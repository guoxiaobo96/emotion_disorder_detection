{"fj79ad1": {"text": "Faith and prayer is a personal thing and is different for everyone. I see the logic behind your questions. I get it. I have 2 engineering degrees.1) prayer for reliable way? -this is kind of personal and probably won\u2019t apply to most. For me, the prayer was asking God for help. I didn\u2019t really think much of it other than a plea for help, desperately. In that darkness, I just put one foot in front of the other until I saw the path2) other methodologies? -I attended most all of the christian churches in town and UU. Found some really good preachers. Just didn\u2019t sink all the way in.3) Opposite conclusion? -yes, it is possible. Satan will try to answer prayers and tell us that there is not god and that he (satan) doesn\u2019t exist. 4) Which correct? - correct is a matter of what one believes. One may choose to follow Christ or to follow Satan. That is the how it was in the premortal world of spirits and the same now.", "link_id": "t3_fbxd8p", "time": 1583088353}}

I\u2019ll let God judge those men and their horrible actions.2) 2015 gay policies? -mistakes of men. While Christ is at the head of the church, he let\u2019s people run it and they make mistakes. A lot of mistakes. Who am I to judge?3) Priesthood? - mistakes of men. See #2. When Christ comes again, he will be right there to be the perfect judge, until then we have to deal with the imperfectness of men.4) Polygamy and child brides? -many men think with their hormones. Polygamy is case in point. Men make huge mistakes in the name of God. God will judge these men, not me.5) Book of mormon? -whether or not it really happened doesn\u2019t matter. I personally believe that the warnings and advice from that book is necessary to follow to literally survive the calamities that will happen before the second coming of christ. Furthermore, if it didn\u2019t literally happen, then I see it is another parable of Jesus. Doesn\u2019t matter either way because the lesson is the same. Follow Jesus Christ.6) Fictional events such as garden of eden, etc? I see that Christ taught in parables while here on earth, how do I know that the scriptures are also no a parable?7) Church slush fund? -the restoration of the church is to prepare for the second coming of christ. Having a slush fund to pay for farms that can be used to feed the saints during the earthquakes, hurricanes, famines, etc is probably a pretty good idea. I don\u2019t think I could do a better job at preparing the earth for the second coming.8) Temple ceremonies? -that is a tough one and simple. What is the purpose of the temple other than to prepare the earth for the second coming of Christ? What would the dead need to be baptized for if the dead not rise in resurrection? What could the resureccted beings do in the during the 1000 year reign of Jesus Christ?9) Prophetic council not specific? -How can God command the whole world save he give personal revelation to all? He gives us prophets to share scripture and then through the holy ghost specific and personal revelation helps each person with their personal needs.10) Why the prophets don\u2019t warn before major prophecies? -Has not the prophet John the Revelator said there will be major catastrophes in the last days? What does the book of mormon say of the last days? I would say that God has given plenty of warning, I just didn\u2019t see it at the time.Thank you for reading this.

{"ej95vgf": {"text": "I am in no way an expert on anything but your last paragraph is screaming for boundaries. This is something I have been working on a lot. It is hard.Sometimes physical space is something that people need in order to sort things out. It is okay to avoid someone, especially a bishop whose job it is to cross all those boundaries you listed, when we need a little space and time from them to think or whatever. The key is what to say when you see them down the road. Make sure they know your just to busy for \u2018everyone\u2019 and not just him.I would use the advantage of surprise and the ease of texting and just text the Bishop about 5 minutes before your meeting that \u2018something came up\u2019 and you\u2019ll see him some other time. And then \u2018mute\u2019 the conversation and ignore any calls until you\u2019re strong enough to maintain boundaries with him and others at church who are trained to violate boundaries and be pushy with probing questions.My final thought is that you mentioned that you don\u2019t want to be discussed in ward council. Asking him that is like saying to a kid, \u2018don\u2019t push the red button\u2019 instead just don\u2019t tell anyone at church about you\u2019re doubts and they won\u2019t have anything to say except \u2018send the \u2018ministers\u2019 (i hate that word) to find out what is going on. Then when those women call or surprise visit you just tell them you\u2019re really busy and catch up sometime Then you can continue any of those relationships on your terms.https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;ei=vj6XXLuZLsKQsAWb9aSgDw&amp;q=boundaries+in+a+nutshell+church&amp;oq=boundaries+in+a+nutshell+church&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.3..33i22i29i30.7207.8452..8855...0.0..0.211.850.0j5j1......0....1.........0i71.V6yTUc0uL6Y", "link_id": "t3_b4tnjt", "time": 1553416662}}

I am not from Utah but I can attest to the loneliness and fear that comes from feeing suicidal in and lds culture. As a adult with a mental illness, I have suicidal thoughts often. I don't want to die but that is where my illness leads me. One of the hardest things about suicide in mormon culture is the teen truly is scared, hurt, in pain, and to make matters worse, can specifically believes they will be eternally punished as will their families for committing suicide. My wife is tbm and I am not. I wonder if the teens that commit suicide face a similar response to mine when they reach out to their parents as donI when I Reach out to my wife. She tells me I am threatening her and to go ahead and do it. I am not kidding. As a youth, when I was suicidal, I realize the church teachings made my mental illness worse because a simple 'mistake' in some so called sin would lead to depression and then thoughts of suicide. To make matters worse, the turning point in my life where I was at my lowest as a teen, doubting the church, wanting the leave, And very depressed, i was taught by church doctrine, my young mens leader, my bishop and parents that I had sinned due to a so called infraction. My infraction was common and human behavior for a 16 yo. This caused me to embrace tscc and has literally hurt me beyond measure. I mean literal pain, suicide ideation is physically painful even before efforts to end ones life begin.I hope, with every fiber of my being, that the leaders of the mormon church pay for their hurtful policies, teachings, investments, and for sustaining the greatest fraud to come upon the earth.", "link_id": "t3_4yx0d1", "time": 1471865154}}

I do some EE design but mostly design of the whole plant because we are an integrated and a developer. It really doesn't matter what you specialize in. What matters is where you work/intern while in school. You must know a lot of EE's and owners and developers from your electrician career. You could do single lines right now and motor and breaker sizing. If you want to keep doing that type of design then work your network. However, if you want to do something else, then grades, the ranking of your school, and where you intern become more important. But IMO the most important thing is not what school you go to but what types of industries are in the metro area of your school.I like power bc the math is simple, the designs are simple and very very important, especially with DG.AMA if you have any questions", "link_id": "t3_4poj22", "time": 1466866450}}

{"d45xu4y": {"text": "Thanks for sharing your story. I understand the difficulties of poor health while being a missionary. You mention BYU I in the fall, I would ask you a few question; what major are you considering? What career path? Do you consider yourself an average or above average or elite student? What part of the country do you want to live? You seem fine with the church at the moment but do you see it possible that that could change?The reason I ask these things is because of my personal regret at being put in a very awkward situation during every business person I meet. I have an engineering degree from BYU and then I got s MS from a very prestigious European university. I am very proud of my education and I like to tell people that. However, I hate the cultish part of the Mormon church. I hate that people ask where I got my BS because I have to tell them byu and I feel ashamed of the bigotry, racism, anti LGBTIQ, and pretty much I feel stupid for once being Mormon. I hate it. I don't work in the inter mountain west so a lot of people aren't Mormon here.I asked you about your major because BYU is really good for some majors but for me I could have gone to a better engineering school. In fact, if I had gone to my second choice school I would have had much better job opportunities because unless you are going to a big top 50 school in the nation, most employees just simply recruit from the best uni within 50 miles of their office. The big ones go to BYU but that is only to publish their brand and offer internships to the top 3 students in a major. So I recommend another school unless you want to work in Idaho. If you are an average student, any state school in a city you want to live will due, if you are an elite student, you deserve to go to an much better school and byu I. If you are questioning the rules and Mormonism there, I would really reconsider because once you're in your are practically locked into the uni of it is BYUi. See other posts about the honor code and the transferring transcript. I have personal experience with honor problems and I don't recommend it.Good luck man.

My ratio was 50 applications for 1 interview. I spent a day on each application. Total of 6 months wasted.Don't worry there is a better way to do it. How many people do you and your parents know? Write down all their names. What is you 30 second elevator pitch? What you job titles you can do? What are companies you can work for? Write those down too. I made this list, over 100 names. I called them (no email), said elevator pitch, and asked 'who do you know that can help me find what I am looking for?'. They gave me 2 names and then I call those people. If you call 20 people a day you can call 100 in a week.I got 4 interviews and landed a stellar job. It has been 6 years and I am still there.Edit: if you use this method, the question must be used word for word. It is psychology.
