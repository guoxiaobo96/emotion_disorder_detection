I wanted so badly to quit, but when you have depression it makes it even harder. I felt like my best friend had died every time I tried to quit. I was getting really bad, then I got sick and could not get and air in my lungs at all hardly. Felt like I was drowning sorta. I thought I was going to die just like mom and grandpa. So I decided to quit right then and there. I had my last cigarette December 10, 2018. After I completely committed to quitting it was so much easier. For a few months after quitting, every time I left the house I felt like I was forgetting something. Technically I was, my cigarettes had been with me for so long every single time I left the house without them it almost felt wrong. It's also so much of a habit that it's hard to put down. It's pretty much involuntary to reach for your cigarettes too. I'm much happier now and can take a shower without huffing and puffing. Cigarettes are almost as addictive as a harder drug. It's extremely difficult to quit. I still have a few seconds where I think, \"ugh I need a cigarette\", but I know all it takes is 1 single puff and I'm addicted again. I'm only 40 and was headed right where my mom and grandpa were on their death beds. The older generation that still smoke most likely do so out of habit and addiction. When you've done something your entire life almost it's pretty hard to put down. And yes they know how bad it is.

No that addiction really takes a hold of you. Finally quit after getting so sick I couldn't breathe and it scared the hell out of me. I haven't had a cigarette in a year now. Still catch myself wanting one, but I fight it and it's gone in a minute or two. My point is, it is extremely hard to quit and like someone else said, they're not really thinking of how much they spend, they just need another cigarette.

I've thrown a 20oz plastic bottle at someone because they were chasing me with a baby mantis.

Thankfully it didn't. It only made very sleepy and very nauseous if I didn't eat before taking it. Didn't have nightmares either. The reasons I decided to even try it is because my grandpa was a heavy smoker, he suffered for years to breathe before passing away; and the main reason is my mother just passed April 20 from pulmonary fibrosis. You'd think seeing your mother stuck to an oxygen hose during the day and a bi-pap at night, struggle to do the simplest things, see her go into respiratory failure multiple times, see her intubated multiple times and then watch her slip away because her lungs can no longer absorb oxygen it would be a walk in the park to quit, but nope. I don't have any idea what in the world is wrong with me. Every time I've tried to quit I've felt like I've lost my best friend. How stupid is that!
