And I agree with you about how easy it is to get. I just realized that the reason I default to thinking it\u2019s sexual attraction is that in the past he said he always tries very hard not to have sexual thoughts about me, my sister, or his sister who is 10 years younger than him. Long background\u2014or skip to the bottom :)He said this when I was about 22 and graduated from undergrad as an art major. My thesis was a solo exhibit in the campus gallery. As an aside, it was a great school for art\u2014accredited museum showing international artists, and two galleries, plus a pop up gallery that I curated. I guess I\u2019m mentioning this because I\u2019m feeling the need to validate the art that I created. Back then it was very heavy handed and in your face about sexual abuse and female empowerment. The show was about 20-30 pieces, all different media. Nude self portraits and pieces speaking directly about my abuse. The gallery covered the doors with paper and put up signs warning of unsuitable content for some. I guess I\u2019m giving all this background for everyone to understand what was in the exhibit which my father went to see. Without me of course. I didn\u2019t ask him to see it or even travel down from Connecticut to Florida. I didn\u2019t even go to the formal school graduation ceremony. So, after he saw that show we went to dinner and while we were driving he said that sexual denial to me. It\u2019s almost like he was admitting something. As another aside, he commented on the size of my breasts (positively) when I was a young adult. So there certainly was some sexual attraction at some times. So, long story short, I think there was distorted sexual attraction and a way to dominate someone (me) he didn\u2019t understand. He\u2019s never liked strong people, especially women. I was smart. I debated. I was not a meek woman like his mother and my mother. My sister was the funny one to make things seem normal. He never hurt her in any way.

{"f9vnycx": {"text": "TW: suicide and self harmI\u2019ve read all the replies and while I understand the reasons behind the comments about his hurt (valid that he feels hurt), I agree with you that you had a mental breakdown and that needs to be the primary focus for both of you right now. The example you use about your friend is spot on and I would react the same way you did. She couldn\u2019t stop it anymore than you could. I recommend not drinking tho. I genuinely miss having a glass of bourbon neat, because I miss the taste and relaxed feeling and because I would use it to stop hurting so badly, but I just can\u2019t with my meds. Also, since you mentioned it, don\u2019t go off Latuda without medical help, which I\u2019m sure you know. So, here\u2019s a little background on why I write all of this. A few years ago, before I was properly diagnosed and medicated, I had a similar experience. My SO and I had been out with a female friend and had a few drinks. When we got home he and I started fighting about him not being attracted to me anymore and wanting the girl we were out with instead of me. He had cheated before so this conversation wasn\u2019t out of the blue. We were fighting I was crying. I remember leaning against the kitchen wall and the next thing I remember is sitting on the floor under the window on the opposite side of the kitchen, holding a large knife and trying to slash my wrists. He walked out. I begged him to stay and help me. I reached out to some helpline resources. Nothing helped. I was (the urge never really goes away, so am) a cutter. That night, after he left, I cut (not for suicide, but to dull the excruciating internal pain) and watched the blood drip down my arm onto the floor. It was a really bad time. He wanted massive emotional apologies. He wanted me to beg. He wanted to understand that I was awful to him. It truly was awful. Fast forward a few years and he now understands that on my own I can\u2019t control it. I see a psychiatrist and psychologist. He now thanks me for taking my meds and sticking with it because he can\u2019t imagine what it must be like for me. How hard it is. Obviously getting properly diagnosed and medicated makes all the difference, but I can\u2019t promise him it won\u2019t happen again. It\u2019s not the only time I\u2019ve been triggered into a fugue state like that. I hope all this helps and I believe you do deserve the type of support you need as you grieve. And I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "link_id": "t3_e73ks4", "time": 1575675164}}

And I truly believe your comments to help in the long term will help them and you are supportive of them and thoughtful of their situation now and in the long run. As for adults spotting it, there is a lot of work to be done, not only to train them, but to help them be empathetic. I\u2019m thinking through your comment about my statement regarding them both being minors and I don\u2019t think I have a clear answer as to why I say that. It\u2019s a good question though. I guess I\u2019m thinking about my own experiences as an abused child and my 20+ years working with kids/teens in abusive or otherwise bad situations. I always hope there is a solution to get them out because it is damaging and sometimes beyond repair to their mental health. I know I\u2019m not saying anything you don\u2019t already know. One outcome from abuse i suffered, in and out of my home, is that I have DID, CPTSD, and all the comorbid mental health illnesses that accompany that. I know not everyone can escape an abusive situation. I couldn\u2019t. And I think that\u2019s why I always offer the information I have based on my experiences hoping beyond hope that they can get out. I know the fear and knowing that you are trapped. (I could go on forever here, so apologies for such a long response. The next bit is about my own childhood abuse only because I want to share that I know what it\u2019s like.)I was sexually abused by my father starting when I was about 3. I told my mother then and she dismissed me. At around 6 I started to get chronic UTIs. I had specialized tests done to see if the was something medically wrong with me. There wasn\u2019t and it was simply dismissed by my doctors. Recurrent UTIs as a child are a giant red flag. As I got older it turned to emotional and mental abuse. I wrote a story about it in high school and it was again dismissed. Chronic stomach issues started and I was again dismissed by my doctor. I was also sexually abused by a teacher in high school, which he did not hide, and the school did nothing. It can all be ignored no matter where you live, but I grew up in a wealthy suburb and strongly believe it was ignored to such an extent because things like this just didn\u2019t happen in towns like mine.

In a professional capacity, in a large urban city and over the last 20 years, I have worked in the public school system, open enrollment colleges, mentor underserved and abused kids for an arts nonprofit and partnered with an LGBTQ shelter that also offers services that will help kids once they graduate high school. CPS is not necessarily the only path to take. Which is why I suggested talking to an experienced/trained adult to come up with a safe plan. Every situation is different, and certainly not all these services are available everywhere, but if you don\u2019t have access to these resources you have access to online services like the National Domestic Abuse Hotline, https://www.thehotline.org.

Candy tasted wrong and I had no craving for chips. Eating less of the junk brought to the lower end of a healthy weight range and then a few weeks ago something really bad happened to me and my IBS flared up from the stress (yet another complication) and I had a hard time eating without getting sick.
