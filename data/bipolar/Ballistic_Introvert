My friend had FaceTimed me in June around 11:30 pm one night visibly angry and upset. She told me that Maddy had discovered a hidden camera in their upstairs bathroom after a bunch of our friends had gone over to change into their bathing suits/take showers. It all went down on Snapchat (which I\u2019m not allowed to have) so I was receiving screenshots of the camera and text messages.

It was going to be and \u2018outside\u2019 camera.\u201d Everyone was in denial and I started crying on the call. My dad walked in to say goodnight and asked what was wrong.

I told my dad (he\u2019s a chief of police in a neighboring town - important soon) and I told him everything..He got a search warrant the next day.

He claimed \u201che was intimidated by my dad\u201d but the police are still going through evidence a few months later.On the bright side, they family is doing AMAZING.

{"edmb79n": {"text": "One summer, when I was younger, I was reading a good ol\u2019 book. It was pretty long and took me a while to read. When I finally decided to stop reading, it was nighttime (I\u2019m an introvert..that\u2019s why I can read all day and not have to go outside). I decided to get up from my beanbag chair and walk over to my bed, turning off my lamp, which was the only light being provided in my room at the time. As a kid, I was always freaked out by the dark. Not terrified..just kinda scared me. It still sometimes creeps me out because you never know who (or what.. it\u2019s 2019 I\u2019m not going to assume) is gonna be creeping out there. I don\u2019t know why, but I thought about how creepy it would be if someone was out there. I kinda did a \u201cyeah right\u201d in my brain and laughed. Now, naturally, as most people do, I looked out anyways. Shit, I wasn\u2019t prepared. Right as I looked out, my neighbor across the street got out of his truck in a bright neon yellow jacket holding some kind of tool and looked straight across the street in the area of my window. He couldn\u2019t see me, of course (I think??) but holy shit I fell down so fast. Since it was summer, the sun doesn\u2019t set until later. So this bitch got home around 10-11 at night in a neon yellow jacket holding something and had to just flipping be RIGHT there when I looked out. TL;DR:Looked out a window as a kid at night thinking nothing would be there but saw my neighbor dressed in bright clothes and holding something looking back at me.It\u2019s such a dumb story..but it was scary at the time.", "link_id": "t3_adzfh9", "time": 1547018403}}

Her mom tries her very best and although they have shelter, food, and some entertainment, they don\u2019t have much money to spare for extra things. I know, it absolutely does not give an excuse for what she did to me, but I try to keep that in mind when we talk. For months, I cut off all connection from her. I just couldn\u2019t take it and my parents forced me to. It felt good for a few weeks but just made me feel guilty. I guess it\u2019s the type of person I am. I did and still am talking to her.

Unfortunately, our families are close and we see each other at family holidays quite often.

We fought all the time and she even got her online \u201cbest friends\u201d to attack me. I thought it was my fault all the time. It would always go: We fight for the stupidest reason.

{"e79er6m": {"text": "The night my 11th month puppy died. I had only had him for less than 10 months before he passed. I was ten at the time and EXTREMELY attached to him. My parents finally got me a puppy after years of begging for another Italian Greyhound. I wanted one so badly because the rescue Italian Greyhound my family had since I was born died when I was in third grade. I also was (and still am) a huge animal lover. Life felt so amazing with Winston. Except for the lovely feces and urine he left in his cage a couple times a week. (In case you didn\u2019t know, iggy\u2019s are v e r y hard to potty train.) We always cuddled and he was super playful. We had a huge bond and were basically inseparable.One afternoon, my mom and I came home from what I think was shopping. We let Winston out and he jumped all over me, wagging his little tail. I of course picked him up and smothered him with affection. Everything seemed normal. This part is hard to remember but I\u2019ll try my best:I remember him jumping up on the couch to join me but I noticed he was limping. I tried to pet him and he snapped at me. This scared me, so I yelped a little. It caught my mother\u2019s attention and she came into the room to ask what was wrong. By this time, I was overwhelmed and already bawling (I now know I have anxiety, which was the cause of my freak out.) and I tried to explain the situation to my mom. I moved off the couch and sat on the floor away from Winston so I didn\u2019t bother him and because I was terrified.....He used all his energy to get up and drag his body over to me just to sit in my lap. I tried petting his stomach/side region and he bit my finger so hard it bled. It hurt like hell but I knew he wanted my comfort. So, while we waited for my dad to wake up (he used to work night shifts), I was petting his head and telling him it was going to be okay. I was mess by now but I was trying not freak him out.When we got to the local animal hospital, they couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong. They decided he ruptured an organ or twisted his insides somehow (I believe dogs that twist around a lot and are more active can get this(?)). They told us that we should consider bringing him to the local college that did surgeries for animals the next day (they weren\u2019t open that night) and my parents just looked at each other with a look that I now know meant they didn\u2019t want to get the surgery for him and were worried. I tried to keep my hopes up. I told myself over and over that he\u2019d live. That he\u2019d get the surgery the next day and everything would be perfect again. I stayed by his side for almost the whole night, watching over him, praying for him. My dad, who was also very attached to Winston, got my attention for a little bit by having me help him cook some dinner. I checked on him every three minutes. The one time I didn\u2019t check on him after three minutes, my dad and I were making light jokes about happy topics and my mom, who was the one watching over him at the time, called us in the room. She told us he had just stopped breathing. I stared at him for a good minute, tracing his body for a sign, anything, that showed he was still alive. I sat down on the couch, comforting my parents as they sobbed. I didn\u2019t cry. I couldn\u2019t. I felt so lost at that moment. I didn\u2019t move off the couch for a week straight. I wish I had known better than to force myself to pretend that he was going to be okay. If you saw him, you\u2019d know that he wasn\u2019t going to survive much longer. He looked lifeless. It may be considered wrong to choose my dog over something else, but, after this event, my life spiraled into chaos. My second-cousin ganged up on me with a few of her online friends and they called me horrible things. My cousin also said she hated me and wished I would just kill myself. That hit me hard. Once 7th grade hit, I was a goner. I was hospitalized for 5 days and diagnosed with Depression when I was 12... I\u2019m now 13 and still honestly feel stuck because no one in my life has shown they really will be reliable help. Both my therapist and parents will send me back to the hospital if I were to tell them I\u2019ve been lying for a little less than a year. It will just be a waste of money because it doesn\u2019t work. I apologize for the very long answer but it always feels good to get my troubles off my chest even if I don\u2019t know the people. (I\u2019m really sorry for any grammar mistakes or if you had trouble reading my answer. I cried a couple times writing this and rushed the whole thing.)TL;DR - 11 month puppy died when I was 10 or 11.
