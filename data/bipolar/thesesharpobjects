So many outbursts, bad relationships, LOTS of drugs...she still hasn\u2019t gotten better but I\u2019ve done a lot of research trying to help her. I recently spoke with a 60 year old women with BPD and I would have never known had she not told me. The advice this old woman gave me was 1.) seek therapy. She said she went for years and years of intense therapy and still goes here and there to keep herself in check 2.) learn self worth 3.) tackle the deeper issues (BPD is usually tied with trauma) 4.) KEEP YOURSELF BUSY. she stressed this one to the max and said it was the key to her getting better but all of this takes a lot of work and patience with yourself. My advice to you is to buy a DBT book (dialect behavioral therapy) and it helps a ton.

But honestly, I would start just by getting out of the house more and maybe adding a small set of responsiblites in your life, just something small. When I was feeling super stuck I signed up for a book club that met only once a week for a couple of hours just so I had SOMEWHERE I had to be, a responsibility to others to be present. Also therapy would probably help a lot. Sometimes we need the extra help. I'll be starting therapy again today after taking an 8 year hiatus. I hope my comment helps at least a little. I know you feel stuck but it won't be that way forever.", "link_id": "t3_d22y3n", "time": 1568120895}}

When she's yelling in the backseat sometimes I still get panicky but it's not as bad as when other people in the car. My worst fear in the entire world is getting into an accident with her in the car. Thankfully I don't have to drive as much as I used to but my god driving around with her at first was some shit.

While it is frustrating, I find myself doing things to keep me distracted and not so anxious. I don't know if cleaning would help you, but when I feel anxious for seemingly no reason I blast music and deep clean like I'm scrubbing my worries away.

I get super hot and start to sweat buckets, my heart feels like it's beating out of my chest and usually mid panic attack my hands will go numb or sometimes get super tingly.

To answer you question, an attack itself is anywhere from 2 minutes to 30 depending on the situation, or sometimes I'm lucky and have them on and off all day long.", "link_id": "t3_d26j39", "time": 1568119053}}
{"ezt03ue": {"text": "I get it, I was a smoker for years and I used it I manage anxiety as well and finally was able to quit!! Another tip for the highway, sometimes when I'm driving I just try to rationalize with myself and tell myself the likelihood of me grtting into an accident is pretty small, especially if I'm paying really good attention (which I do when driving) so in a way it eases my anxiety when I look at it statistically. However, this doesn't work if I'm driving with other people in the car. Not sure why", "link_id": "t3_d1tn80", "time": 1568117074}}
