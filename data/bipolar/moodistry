While it is not guaranteed, a clear intention can sometimes lead to psychedelic experiences that are relevant to that intention.  For example, if you have depression, PTSD, or addiction, you might start by setting an intention around healing in relation to those challenges.  Now, some of what might happen is that you have powerful experiences that are a bit like dreams and need to be explored and understand in terms of how they might help you in that healing process.  There are also potential neurological impacts that occur, irrespective of the specific experience, that promote healing (explore the idea of neuroplasticity).Each person will have a unique experience with each trip they take, and you can't force a specific experience to occur.

{"flz9gb8": {"text": "&gt;  which is a practice that can be achieved just as deeply through kinds of meditationIs a part of the case you're making that psychedelics are a less integral or valid pathway to insight than meditation?  Are you saying meditation is more \"natural\" than psychedelics?  There's cultures where psychedelic plant medicine has probably been being used for millennia, in a way that is essential to their individual and cultural experience.  I hardly think meditation is in any way more valid, more \"empirical\" or more sustainable than those practices.  &gt; scientifically reformI think you and I may have different ideas of what constitutes \"science\".  To me it is a very formal practice for creating knowledge, and very different from practices of mediation.  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your usage.A few examples of \"integration\" for me as a result of recent journeys.I had an experience recently with a shaman present where I was certain I was going to die, that night, during the trip.  I was not very afraid, but I was reluctant to go.  I found myself negotiating for just a little more time - time enough to eat one more blackberry, a little more time to pet my dogs, one more song to dance to.  I felt some sadness and regret that I hadn't found a good home for my dogs once I'm gone.  At the end of the night, I was utterly blown away that in fact I was not going to die and I would be around the next day.So that was the experience.  The integration is recognizing my fearlessness about death (I've been working on that for quite some time).  It is recognizing my reluctance to go as a deep affirmation of this experience of life, inhabiting this reality.  Recognizing the value of the simplest pleasures, like a single blackberry in my mouth.  In contrast, I was not negotiating for just another hour on Reddit.  A very actionable insight was just how important it is for me to find a home for my dogs.  I don't want to be dying on a ventilator with my last thought being that I'm sorry I didn't find a home for my pups.  And finally, what a fucking gift being alive is! These are hugely important lessons.  Perhaps the most significant work of using psychedelics in a meaningful and conscious way is integrate them into your life in a way that is sustainable and actionable.

I think I mostly understood you but I'm not completely sure.It seems to me that to some degree you're implying that integration has a minimal role in the psychedelic experience, that it is a misguided effort, even \"pathological\" insofar as people might embrace their \"truth\".  To me, the journey itself is wonderful and should be honored for what it is as separate from the everyday consensus reality we inhabit, during the time we are having it especially.  But for me the real fruit of the experience is what we take from it and bring into everyday life as insight, sometimes with radically transformative possibilities.  Some of that work of that integration can/is done by relating to an ineffable experience as such, without language-based cognition or communication.  We integrate it on more subtle level of consciousness.  But part of it is also doing our best, knowing that the essential experience is ineffable, to push the envelope with language to attempt to express it, however imperfectly.  Those kinds of integrated insights can be life transforming, the kinds of things we actually put into action in our lives.

But those experiences are not depression, and I don't think that for the collective it is depression, certainly not as it is commonly clinically defined.  Actually, many people are taking courageous action in their communities, and that seldom indicates depression, which is very much about motivation and energy.With real depression (and I'm not sure what Foster discusses is more than a general malaise and sadness - he calls it melancholy, which is different from depression) there is a profound lack of motivation to do anything.  This is the catch-22 with depression, that the things that might help the depressed person break out are the things most difficult to do when you're depressed.  Exercise, eating better, bathing, connecting with people, meaningful work, volunteering, etc.  The same goes for developing a spiritual outlook or practice - it's extraordinary hard for people without depression to do, much less for someone overwhelmed by purposelessness and hopelessness.I recently escaped a two year long depression with significant suicidal ideation.  In my case, it turned out that it was in fact a spiritual crisis of sorts that was, in part, underlying my depression.  I don't think that is true in all cases of depression.  I managed to break up the spiritual ice through the use of psychedelics, used in a conscious and careful way.

We've exchanged long messages on deeply personal subjects.  We finally talked on the phone for a couple of hours.  Ever since then, they've drifted away, and seem now to have ghosted me.In the past, I would have been really hurt, and start investigating every thing I said to figure out why the person pulled back.  When you really start enjoying someone's company like that, it's so easy to form an attachment, and want it to be permanent and in the current energetic form that you're enjoying so also unchanging.  But things change and things end.Lately I've been trying to practice non-attachment when I have these situations of meeting someone, and having a super-intense connection, and then having the friendship come to end.  So for me, practicing non-attachment is trying to be appreciative with the friendship is intense, including recognizing that it is unknown when it will end.  Knowing it may end actually enhances my enjoyment while it exists because it becomes more precious.  And now that my new friend seems to be withdrawing, I'm filling my heart with good wishes for them, and gratitude for all the interesting conversation and learning that happened.  It was a gift that they entered my life for a short time, and releasing the friendship now is something I can do with freedom and ease.

Perception of ugliness actually makes my depression worse, so it's a vicious cycle.  Despair over my looks has gone so far as to contribute to suicidal thinking.When I enter a higher mood state, especially full-on hypomania, it's like I see a different person in the mirror. The glow I have overcomes the specific perceived flaws. And that contributes to how I move through world with greater confidence and greater indifference to my physical appearance.  I believe those things in turn make me much more attractive.One more point on the issue of coming terms with one's physical attractiveness.

It gets me out of my own head, and getting to know other people who I can serve with my love and care, so I'm not thinking about my problems as much.  I find that in giving love and support to people, it is not a drain at all but in fact I get so much in return, in terms of receiving love and gratitude from them.  And in terms of sharing the story of my work with other people, it is interesting to them, but more importantly it conveys to them one of the best attributes a person can have: kindness.

Explore the subtitles and many interpretations of that teaching and you'll see that it is a quite powerful response that puts the bully off-balance.  It's a kind of spiritual martial arts.  It makes you defenseless if you are only see the possibility of responding to a bully being to respond on the terms they establish.Putting aside tactics, which focus on outcomes, it is a practice of radical love as well.  You may not agree with me that love can be a world changing force for good, but to call a principal deeply rooted in love \"dark\" makes no sense to me.", "link_id": "t3_f9fx35", "time": 1582820218}}

{"fixdtht": {"text": "Thanks for taking the time and energy to share these thoughts.  I don't agree with them, but they were very interesting for me to read, because you are grappling with some of the same issues that are foremost to me right now.  I think in your discussion of \"direct experience\" versus science, you might have misconstrued my affinity for science, which is very strong.  I appreciate science as a technology of knowing and manipulating the world.  I move back and forth between the two ways of knowing as well, and I also look for ways to integrate the two (indeed, doing so is extremely important to my spiritual beliefs).  But in my spiritual framework, subjective experience (let's call it consciousness) trumps science, in the sense that science is a wonderful, fascinating, useful tool, but it is a tool held by the hand of consciousness.  And of course there is no science without consciousness, so it seems patently obvious to me that consciousness is a container for science.  And there are many other tools out there for knowing the world, which have different \"methods\" and outcomes than science, but nevertheless have tremendous power both explanatory and practical.  I can share what I see as some of those tools if you're interested.The idea that science and what you call direct experience (I call it subjective experience, but more accurately, consciousness) are two sides of the same coin, and that the result of not moving between them is pathogenic, makes a particular mode of knowing the world that is a small part of human experience culturally and historically the very litmus test of spiritual and mental health.  That's absurd when you think of just how many cultural and spiritual frameworks  don't involve science, and yet have been the basis for spiritual and practical well-being for thousands and even ten of thousands of years.  There is consciousness, and then there are tools for knowing the world, and they are many and diverse, but they are all expressed out of consciousness.  And just one tool among many, a very powerful one, is science.With respect to your second paragraph...Placebo. What I was describing was a much more subtle relationship between intention/expectation/mental frameworks and unfolding conscious experience in a journey, a subtlety that is completely lost with the concept of placebo, which implies something false or not real.  I think we probably mean about the same thing, it was just a poor word choice for me.  We may be coming to psychedelics from a different perspective insofar as you use the term \"bad trip\".  I'd like to know what a bad trip involves in your perspective.The idea that the importance of ritual, ceremony, set and setting in general emerges from scientific method means that you and I have a very different idea about what science and the scientific method is.  From my perspective, the traditions and practices around psychedelics have arisen out of practical, lived experience over thousands of years (as well as within some sub-cultures, over the past 50 or so).  True scientific method was not involved.  And within many contexts, those structures are in place precisely to trigger what many people would call a \"bad trip\", because it is in the difficult journeys that some of the most useful and illuminating work is done.  Certainly for young people looking to party with psychedelics, the most potent and challenging journey's would be \"bad trips\".Lastly, based on what you say above it seems important to you to apply the understandings and principals of science to your experience of psychedelics, by which I mean to explain the experience in terms of circuits, the brain, neurotransmitters, blood flow, networks, etc.  I'm wondering what, on a deep, personal, even spiritual level, does that analysis do for you? How does it benefit you?  Does it make the experience more meaningful and impactful, or does it, by attempting to break the experience down into a technical explanation, make you feel more in control of the experience, and perhaps better to evaluate it?", "link_id": "t3_f8uukm", "time": 1582818411}}

Here's some general thoughts...I respect the power of neuroscience a lot as a way of knowing in the world, and as a basis for technological interventions to help (like medicines or surgery).  But for me, when it comes to the attempt to give language and meaning to higher states of being, I feel like something is being lost in the process of mapping rich, complex experience onto chemical models.  So I wonder if analytically it gets very far toward an understanding - it feels useful but incomplete in some important ways.But the other tricky thing is that if you have that model in your mind and enter a state, your mind is actually formulating the experience around your mental model of it being based on a chemical cocktail.  So in a certain sense, you are manifesting the chemical model in terms of your experience.  I don't think that's necessary a bad thing - there's nothing wrong with the model - it's just one possible way of making sense of the experience.Side note: I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 disease.  For a lot of people with bipolar or unipolar depression, they have a mental model of their own mind that entails seeing in terms of interactions between chemicals, particularly serotonin.

I think it speaks to the fact that this personality trait can be a positive force for you and the people around you.You don't talk much about how the people around you respond, and how you respond to their responses.  Do your loved ones understand you and take your behavior in stride, or is it a constant battle?Here's some thoughts coming from the other side of this dynamic...I'm on the opposite side of the fence in two of my friend relationships.  They are both really pushy with their opinions about the kinds of things you're talking about.  The issue is not just that they'll be very free with an opinion, but if I don't instantly capitulate to their viewpoint, they'll keep pushing and pushing.  It's like they're really frustrated by how stupid I am not to immediately accept their approach to things!  I feel attacked and diminished by their behavior.For example, I have an injured ankle.  My friend works in the healthcare industry as a manager, and did some nursing school about 30 years ago, and so fancies herself a medical expert.  She decides that I need to be taking zinc to aid in the healing process.  I said I'll take a look at it and talk to my doctors (I'm on a lot of meds so I wanted to avoid interactions).  But she just wouldn't drop it and kept pushing that it would help me, referring me to research proving it's efficacy.  (Now, when I turn the tables and give advice to her, I say \"I have some zinc for you\"!)I know her impulse is one of love and concern, but there's definitely two other things going on from where I sit.One is that she becomes utterly sure of the rightness of her own opinion.  She's unable to see both sides of things.  It's a kind of blinders.The other is that she likes to control the lives of other people.  I think that is a very distinct thing from her certainty about the rightness of her opinions.  We've talked about her helping relationship with her mom and she's utterly frustrated that her mom doesn't just do what she says.With her and the other friend that I have this dynamic with, I'm trying to be really conscious of their impulses and to handle their giving of advice in a graceful way, that both preserves my boundaries but makes them feel heard.

They don't come too often - 10 years or so - but they are so intense, I feel like the person is my soul mate just like you do with this boy.One of the things I've noticed is that a crush is only possible when there are big gaps in my knowledge of someone.  I fill those gaps with my ideal version of who they are, and as a result there's a mismatch between who I want them to be and who they really are.  Ultimately, if I get to know them more, many of those idealizations fall away, replaced the real them.  I may still very much be attracted to them, and even love them, but it's no longer a crushing love.

I for one, though I find my diagnosis useful in understanding myself and seeking treatment, I also hold it at arms length because otherwise I feel reduced to that diagnosis, and to being a collection of symptoms.  I really sit on the fence on the whole issue in terms of understanding myself.  My illness is not super severe, so that gives me a greater ability to hold my diagnosis at arms length than someone with more severe illness I think.The way I interpret their use of the word *morality*, is that they are saying that the psychiatric establishment is, while claiming to be objective and scientific, fundamentally making moral judgements about the legitimacy of people who might be called neurologically diverse, where what is made out to be \"illness\" is in fact differences in how people experience and perceive the world.

{"fhpqm5l": {"text": "One reason why someone younger should not do psychedelics is the physiology of the development of the brain.  My understanding is that recent evidence pushes out significant brain development to the 20s.  So I think the physiological impacts can be more significant, but I'm not a neuroscientist.  It's something to consider.My first trip, on LSD, was when I was 17, and it changed my life in such a positive way.  I shifted my education plans from comp sci/business to poetry/philosophy, and that kicked off 10 years of captivating education, two graduate programs in related subjects.  I'm so thankful for that trip.  Interestingly, I knew zero about the appropriate use of psychedelics, and though I would never recommend that to a first-timer now, there was real power in being completely naive to the experience.I think more important than age is being really well-informed about the substances you're using, and the recommend approach with respect to mindset, setting, sitte resetting, integration and dosage.  I think it's important to be clear about your intentions for use.  Etc., my guess is you know all these things, and obviously know a lot about the chemistry.  I'm very troubled and frightened by some of the posts by young people in this and related subs, who are partying with the drug without regard to the issues I've mentioned above.  Partying can lead down the road to abusive, disrespectful use of substances.  I have some experience with abusive use, although I was also getting a lot spiritually from it.  I regulate myself much more effectively now.  My intuition is that you are person who can benefit yourself by continued use, assuming all the practices I mentioned above, while at the same time, there's a case for waiting, especially given your career goals.  I would encourage you to pick a single substance and stick with that for a while rather than switching around.  I've loved MDMA at times, but I worry about it fucking up my serotonin system now, and generally about potential neurological safety issues.  Right now it's LSD and psilocybin for me.I think it's great you're sharing your experiences!  I think it's key to ground what you're saying in terms of being your's and not a universal experience, and to be generally humble in how you relate to your knowledge.

Permanent is a long time into the future.  My emotional life has shifted and changed through distinct periods through my 54 years.  For a sensitive and open-hearted like yourself, and psychoactive substances can help bring that out further, our response to the world will go through cycles and result in different types of triggers.I'm bipolar 2 and my cycles into and out of depression and hypomania have very different impacts on my emotional life.

These days, there's tons of excellent resources online, books and films so you can become well-educated about the practice.  This is not about having a party.  It's about conscious and intentional use for spiritual transformation.  There are traditional cultures that have been using psychedelics for eons, for a variety of healing and spiritual practices.For some, the use of psychedelics becomes a core part of their spiritual practice, ongoing.   For example, there might be an ayahuasca community in your area, around which people will support each other with periodic journeys.For others, psychedelics are the kind of breakthrough experience I was mentioning, that suddenly opens them to a vivid and transformative experience of, for example, oneness, ego death and the power of love.  You can get to those insights on many paths, and psychedelics is one that has tremendous power and potency.  It is one thing to believe those things in your mind, and it is another to have a direct, vivid and mystical experience of them.  It can change your life.  For some, psychedelic experiences launch them onto  journeys into non-psychedelic forms of spiritual practice.  For example Ram Dass, who was an early pioneer in the use of psychedelics, was spiritually transformed by them, but essentially moved on to other practices.  He never disavowed the importance and power of his psychedelic experiences in terms of putting him onto those other paths.I've been using psychedelics on and off for 35 years and they've been a powerful medicine in my life, not always about bliss and joy, but even in the hard moment, revealing essential truths about being, consciousness and love.

{"fhid9p9": {"text": "Wow, that really maps onto my recent experience very closely!  In my case, it's a few of friends that I've been a bit frustrated with, rather than a life partner, so the stakes are lower.  But I relate a lot.How wonderful that you're going through so much transformation!  I'm on a very intense path right now, so I can relate with that too!What I say below is just my experiences.  Where I suggest things, I mean to do so in the most humble way, knowing they may sync with your needs or not.  I'm hearing you describe three issues.  Correctly me if I'm wrong.**He's incurious.**  I've been going through really big transformations in the last few months that have brought me closer to God (my God is non-dual and I experience God through ecstatic movement primarily, but in other ways, so it is very non-traditional).  I've also been hypomanic, so I'm kind of intense right now - very enthused and curious about everything, feeling really tapped in, having all kinds of what I think are really important insights.  But when I've tried to share this stuff with my friends, all of whom are spiritual in their own ways, there's been friction and I've found them to be not curious at all, and sometimes needlessly saying contrary things.  It pains me because I'm so excited and want to share my experience.  My current coping strategy is to be accepting of the fact that my journey, and I think all spiritual journeys, is ultimately taking place on a road I must walk fundamentally alone.  It's so important to have community - I've been a part of great kula when I've been practicing yoga intensely, and that's so supportive.  I've experienced sangha when I've been tapped into Buddhism. But in the final analysis, we walk home alone, but hopefully hand in hand.  I think we need to let go of the expectation that our loved ones will follow us or connect to our transformations.  Better to find and connect with people on the same journey, and receive spiritual support and nutrition from those connections.  That's just me, and again, I think the challenges are very different with a life partner.  I hope I'm making sense.Related to that perspective, I try to leverage my spiritual changes (I've become totally focused on love recently) and apply my new insights to my relationships with friends, do my best to practice compassion, understanding, love and acceptance with them - and avoid trying to convert them.  I struggle with this, but I'm keeping it in my awareness as something to strive toward.**He's unwilling to dip his toes into your journey.** When I read your words, I immediately flashed on a friendship I have with a person who has been depressed for two years.  I was seriously depressed myself for a couple of years, and recently was successful self-medicating with psychedelics.  Having been treated for 15 years with pharmaceuticals, one that really harmed me, research on psychedelics drew me into that as a better route, partly because of safety and partly because it's a one shot treatment.  I love her so much, and it breaks my heart to see her suffering, and frustrated with by limited and ineffective treatment options.I so want her to try psychedelic medicine.  It worked for me so well.  I want her to have relief.  She is resistant.  I haven't pushed too hard, but still I've received subtle signals that she isn't draw to that path (I think partly because she see's them as recreational drugs and dangerous) whenever I have brought it up.  I've realized that sometimes I have very strong impulse to \"evangelize\" things that I'm into at the time, and that have worked for me.  I did the same thing with yoga when I first got into it.I'm working on that impulse, trying to instead just share my experiences openly, avoiding trying to get someone to adopt my practices.  Sort of planting seeds, very small ones, gently. In my experience of spiritual practices, I need to receive multiple \"messages\" about something (like people mentioning it, or seeing a movie) before I start to engage with it.  I think it's more of a marathon than a sprint.(\"Planting seeds\" might sound like I'm being manipulative in a subtle way.  I'm thinking about that, and trying to find the right path for that effort.)*He's saying sexist things.**  Do you think he knows he's saying sexist things?  He may need to be educated about it, and the best way to do that is not in the midst of a heated interaction.  Perhaps sit him down when you're both calm and explain your feelings, and the reason for them.

If only 5% of adopted dogs have significant behavioral issues (destructive behavior, fear aggression, excessive barking, resource guarding, elimination issues, anxiety and/or separation anxiety), that is still a significant crap shoot, and some behaviors may not manifest until later, so while necessary and important, shelter behavioral evaluation often falls short.  Sadly I think many shelters, with good intent, sometimes minimize possible behavioral problems when describing dogs.  Of course, good shelters are adamant about successful placement and would never do that.(My most recent adoption was about 6 months old and the shelter said he was house-trained.  He was not, and I really struggled to get him to not to eliminate in the house.  It was challenging with an older dog, but he did well after 6 months of working with him).  I strongly encourage people to adopt in spite of these potential challenges, so long as they go into it with their eyes open.  I have never purchased a dog (my two pure bred dogs were rescues) and I never will, but I don't have kids and I work at home and I know a lot about dogs.  When I've spoken with friends with kids (particularly small children) about adopting I try to be very frank about the risks.  I had a friend who adopted a pure bred poodle, and there was a bite incident with an adult.  One bite incident with a stranger can be life-changing, in terms of law suits and feelings of guilt.  Later on she had a child and at about two years old the dog bit the child in the face, without permanent injury but sufficient to go to the ER.

My last experience with psilocybin (I used encapsulated sclerotia/truffles rather than mushrooms) was extremely emotional for me, with lots of weeping and journal writing.  I've dealt with a lot of depression over the last two years, and for me depression is emotionally numbing.  I love the release of weeping, so the switch is also very attractive to me for that reason.I went to a small group meeting for psychedelic integration yesterday that I found on Meetup.  It was a good meeting - just a few people.  What was interesting for me is that there a person there who spoke about her experiences with psychedelics, and she had had plenty, as if her experiences were intrinsic to the substances, rather than just her experiences.

That's a good point, and that process of interconnection based on technology is accelerating rapidly.  I think we're at a stage where biological evolution has been dramatically superseded by cultural/social evolution, and decoupled from the pressures of nature, we are evolving incredibly quickly, measure not in decades, but years.  Communication technologies increasing bind us into what could be understood to be a new nervous system.  This was really brought home to me on 9/11 (which was still kind of the dawn of the Internet), where the global, collective mind suddenly focused attention on a single unfolding event.  Our collective nervous system was tapped in to it.  Comparatively, 20 years later, the depth and scope of the interconnection in the face of such an event would be mind blowing.  I think Silicon Valley is definitely pushing toward direct biological interfaces, in terms of how our bodies interconnect with the machine world.  &gt; Our reality is just our brain processing the input (vibrations) from our five senses. Just like a computer processing 1s and 0s to create a virtual reality.For me the brain is a sort of seat for consciousness, which I see as a different ball of wax.

I'm not sure if our concepts of the collective mind are the same.  My idea may be a little less grounded in provable/natural processes, but here's a story related to it.I had an interesting experience in the mid 1990s, when I was in my 30s and doing a lot of psychedelics, mainly acid and MDMA.  I started having the strong impression that in this life, we are embedded in a VR or holodeck world (like on Star Trek), and that our true selves is the player of this game of life.  And that death would be awakening to the fact that we're just playing a game, because a part of the game design is that you are so fully immersed that you don't know you're playing a game.  Within a few years The Matrix comes out, and apart from wishing I had made the movie and made millions of dollars, it contributed to a pretty strong belief that sometimes ideas just start circulating in the ether.  Sort of the same thing happened with the invention of the telephone, although I think that can be accounted for in non-mystical ways, just in terms of the evolution of technology.Of course, now the idea that this reality is VR or a holodeck is almost banal, it has been so deeply integrated into the culture, but back in the 90s it was somewhat new. Related to that idea (and others we've been discussing), I just love this talk by Alan Watts, which expresses the idea in a very heartfelt and dramatic way.

That's an interesting approach, and I suspect that approach has been used in India and Tibet quite a bit, and no doubt produced many positive results, but I don't know too much about it.  I'd be interested to research it more.  I think I'm actually more interested in how memories of past lives can be disproven, particularly if the context for the past life is remote in the past, for example.(I personally don't put too much stock in past life memories, in part because I think if reincarnation exists, there is a built-in boundary that keeps us from remember past lives.  Plus, I don't think we would be reincarnated on the same planet or as the same species.  Regardless, I'm finding discussing the underlying philosophic question of what constitutes proof when we're talking about subjective experiences interesting)For example, what kind of proof is there about the content of someone's dream.  I had a dream last night I was running down the street.  The experience of the dream was indistinguishable for me from waking life (that is, I experienced it as \"real\"), and insofar as it was indistinguishable from waking life, it was real for all intents and purposes.Can I prove to you that I was running down the street in my dream?  Of course not.Can you disprove that I was running down the street in my dream?  Of course not.  Can you prove that a dream is not a form of real reality in the same way waking life is a real reality?  I guess we need to further define reality, and the nature of consciousness during waking life.What I'm driving towards is that I think there is a fundamental difference in how you and I view subjective experience as evidence.  For me, while it is often ineffable, it is extremely valid as evidence.  If I drop acid and experience God, I experienced God, simple as that.  There is no way I can prove it to and no way you can disprove it.  I love that form of knowledge.This is not to say I don't respect the truth and power of materialist, scientific ways of making sense of the world.  I do, vehemently, with passion and with love (I'm a science geek).  But I have enormous respect for the kind of knowledge and wisdom that's produced from subjective experience, and I think using scientific mechanisms to attempt to prove/disprove the content of that experience kind of misses the fundamental point in terms of the difference between them.", "link_id": "t3_f2bjml", "time": 1581554783}}

It had some sort of story written around the quarters, and I loved the thing, and filled it with quarters.  I can't remember the details of the circumstances, but I got really angry at my sisters (who were 5 and 6 years older) and for some reason in my child mind I thought I could hurt them back by tearing up the folder.  I guess I was thinking that because I was attached to the folder they were too.  They laughed at me about it, and in some ways that hurt me more than the resulting, destroyed folder.  I also remember that I still have the teddy bear that I have had since infancy.  At one point when I was little, for what reason I can't remember, I decided I needed to take the squeaker out, and I performed surgery, using electrical wires to sew him back up.

I can have love without any of those things.  You've decomposed into constituent parts that are aspects or attributes or behaviors associated with an underlying feeling of love, which is a holistic and unified feeling, generally.

They may provide some comfort over the phone, but they do not provide safety, physical affection or sex.  How is love provable in that case?  If someone sees a prostitute who provides comfort, physical affection and sex, is that person necessarily in love with the prostitute?  Provable or unprovable?To flip over the mother example, what if their mother is dead and they say \"I love my mom\".

I used to be much more of a materialist, scientifically, logically and rationally based thinking when I was in my 20s, teaching in the social sciences.  That was before I had a set of psychedelic experiences that opened me to other sources of knowledge, and opened me especially to the power of subjective experience.

I generally regard science as very arrogant, but at the same time I actually love it very much.  When it comes the effectiveness immunizations against viruses, or the truth of climate change, science and logical thinking I regard as powerful sources of truth.

{"fhbso4e": {"text": "Hello there.  I always tell myself to keep my comments short, but they always end up being really long!  Sorry.Up until about 7 years ago, I was doing well career wise.  I'm an experienced software engineer, and was mainly focused on creating iPhone apps.  I landed a job with a really promising start-up in San Francisco, and got a nice pile of stock options (subject to vesting).  I felt pretty confident that in 5 years my stock options would be worth millions and I'd be set for retirement.Not too long after I started the job, I started having trouble breathing, and long story short, it was a rare respiratory disease that was incurable and progressive.  I managed to work for another year, most of the time on supplemental oxygen, as my breathing got worse and worse, but finally had to give it up.  Fortunately a year of stock options had vested.However, I didn't have much savings and I had no choice but to sell the options back to the company at a big discount, and I think I got something like $35k for them.  Nevertheless, I was in really bad shape financially, and that's a huge stressor when you have a life threatening, chronic illness, so I'm thankful for what I got, even though it would not last long, especially living in the Bay Area.My disease was essentially terminal, and the life insurance policy I had with the company had a feature where if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness, you could cash out 80% of the policy.  I just couldn't believe it when I found that out.  It was life saving.  I paid down a whole bunch of debt, and had a lot left over.  You never know what's going to come your way.About a year later I received a double lung transplant, and I've been doing well since.  That's about 5 years ago.  It took me 4 years to really get to the point where I was ready to work again, and I've worked sporadically since then.  I can work, but I'm not nearly as effective as I was in the past, partly because of cognitive issues related to impacts on my brain from not being able to get enough oxygen to it when I was sick.I'm debt free, and I bought a house, and have some equity there.  But not much cash left because I've been living off of it.So I have very little retirement savings.  Not good.  Hopefully I'll be able to get more work, and at least build up some cushion.  As a software engineer I have pretty good capacity to earn, but it doesn't help in getting jobs that I have a huge gap of not working on my resume.  My health is good but statistically my life expectancy is not good, because of limited survival rates of a lung transplant (rejection).  There is an only 10% survival rate at 10 years, so I guess my life expectancy is something like 5 to 10 years.  The \"good\" thing about that, is that I probably won't need retirement savings!  I know that's kind of a morbid thing to say, but it's the fact and I'm at peace with it.  Really, don't intend this to be a sob story.

The negativity is food for my spiritual growth.  I want to work with it, not shake it off. Making myself vulnerable is a big part of my spiritual practice, and vulnerability by definition means that you can be hurt.  I think vulnerability is at the core of love itself.  I've found that when I love, I often get hurt.  Yet I keep diving into love (not talking about romantic love here specifically) over and over and over again.  I consciously and intentionally dive into love and making myself vulnerable to hurt.  And the deeper I love, the deeper the potential pain and suffering.  And it's all good.I give love to people here on Reddit, knowing full well that it's a pretty toxic environment, and though I've gotten my hand bit a couple of times, it is so worth it.  Not often but once in a while the love comes back ten-fold.  And I try to take that reflected love, and send it back out.  And that's worth a few bites on the hand!  Of course, too many bites and ultimately I'll quit this platform and focus my love elsewhere, since there are no shortage of opportunities for love.&gt; And any form of mental illnesses is due to the lack of wholenessThere are very complex causes of mental illness, and a wide variety of mental illnesses, so when you say \"any form\", I seriously doubt you actually know about *all* mental illnesses in any detail in order to support that statement.  And I think your statement would carry more power if you situate it in your own experience of mental illness, if you have any.  For me to talk about the ultimate truth of child birth, given that I have never given birth (I never will because I'm male and I'm old), would lead to laughter from my dear friends who have actually had the experience of giving birth!  And quite rightly so.You might also consider the ways in which what is described as mental illness in western societies is understood as shamanic power (or the equivalent) in other cultures.  With my diagnosis, bipolar, my experiences on the manic side involve ecstatic connections with God, so simplifying me as not being whole erases the awesome power that comes from being bipolar (at least for me - for many, mania involves only suffering).", "link_id": "t3_f1xrym", "time": 1581392861}}

For me, it's all just consciousness at play, everything, in a dynamic and non-predestined way, where we are deeply involved in what is unfolding through our consciousness. There is no reality but consciousness.  We have our own consciousness interwoven with a greater shared consciousness.  Shared consciousness is the ocean, and we're a wave riding on top.Of course, we cannot make just anything happen just by thinking. But our consciousness shapes our perception of things profoundly, and I believe shapes what comes into being.  I\u2019ll give you an example based on my experience. I have bipolar 2 illness, and when I\u2019m depressed, I see the world one way, often as a dismal and hopeless place. Losses are devastating. I can be so certain it is the truth of the situation.  On the flip side, if I\u2019m hypomanic, I experience the world with personal power, hope and apprehension of beauty and love in all things. I take losses in stride and I\u2019m very easily able to regard them as a teaching, and work with it usefully. (I hear in your post that you are working to do exactly that.). And because of that radically more positive state of consciousness, I act in the world more, hopefully with compassion and love, and good things happen.Action in the world has a huge impact on my well-being and consciousness. That\u2019s especially true of service work. When I go into service situations, I feel like I\u2019m creating an opening for unexpected blessings to enter into my life.

I think those examples are supportive of the idea that we are One, and reflects my belief that service work can be a two way street.  That is not a given, for example, if it becomes about ego, as I discuss in my last paragraph, it's less of a two way street - the street gets clogged.  So I think we can make the work we do good for us and good for the person served, and that in fact those two different directional flows collapse into a single energetic flow when service is done skillfully.

Setting aside the philosophic questions, seeing what comes up for you when you do the work, might be more informative than a general or abstract analysis.  Being thoughtful and attentive to your own experience while doing the work is key, and will yield the ultimate truth with respect to this question.One thing I've learned is that when you're doing service work that is well-matched to where you are in your life (which I think is very beneficial), it is not draining work, rather it is restorative and energizing.  In that sense, you are getting an intense benefit, a benefit that can be translated into going deeper with the work itself.  So energetically, it's an endless circle of love and support, and I think that points to the oneness of things.The work I've done with dying people has been like that.  It has provided a context where I can grapple with loss and grief in a situation where I'm not dealing with the huge grief of losing loved one in the personal sense.  That is such a great benefit, and I pour my learning about loss back into my practice, to become more graceful and effective with it.

Long story short, I had a double lung transplant about five years ago.  The survival outcomes for lung transplants are not very good.  The likelihood of survival at five years is 50%, so I'm beating the odds in a certain sense already.  The likelihood of survival at 10 years is 10%.  So from a statistical standpoint, there's a good chance I'll be gone in another five years.  Because of the anti-rejection drugs are on, I also face significant statistical likelihoods of kidney failure and malignancies - likelihood of skin cancer is something like 100 times normal.So I have had to find some way to navigate these statistics emotionally, while trying living a full life that isn't focused on my mortality and potential illness.  Some people who face difficult statistics regarding their morality reject statistics altogether as false and non-predictive.  I can't do that because I believe in their predictive power.  What I do is try to \"bracket\" them, as a tool for sense-making and understanding, and sometimes even use them as an impetus for trying to live each day as fully as I can.  What I do not do is amplify their significance and fixate on them, and let them weigh me down, and internalize them.  I believe strong in the mind-body connection when it comes to health and well-being, and I think people who give mortality statistics too much power and weight in their lives are undermining their health, and increase the likelihood that their lives will be foreshortened.  I think statistics regarding attractiveness/ugliness can have a similar, if not more powerful, dynamic.  If those statistics are internalized as too significant a truth, it can drag a person down in terms of the cultivation and development of other qualities that might mitigate the impact of the characteristics the statistics are based on.

A trivial example is that I generally don't care much for heavy make-up.  If I see that they're wearing heavy makeup in their main headshot, I'll dismiss just because (in my perception) we're not a good match on a more cultural level.  That could be prejudicial, and inaccurate in some cases, but I think it's actually a pretty good guidepost for a potential match.For me, in terms of dating going forward, I've lost interested in online dating exactly for that reason and I'm more interested in finding partners in the real world, in contexts where there are shared interests.

If you've been clinically depressed and were able to.  But if that is true, I doubt it was \"easy\" as you suggest.  Spiritually, I just don't believe in internal versus external, at all.  I don't believe in that because of Buddhism, psychedelics and quantum physics, as well as simple lived experience in the world.  All is one for me.

Even people who have committed homicide can have a spiritual awakenings in direct relation to the unthinkable crime of destroying a life completely (and destroying the lives of loved ones of the person).    I've done psychedelics on and off for 35 years, and I have had life transforming experiences that were spiritual in nature, over and over again.  It has opened important doors for me.  It lead me directly to yoga, which is a central practice for me.  It led me directly to a death practice, which is also central for me.But equally so, they have not just been a door opener for me into other non-psychedelic spiritual practices and insights, they are an active spiritual practice in and of themselves for me.  For me, they are deeply coupled with my movement practice that combines dance and yoga.  It is medicine I use consciously, intentionally and wisely (in my humble opinion) on an on-going basis.  It is good and powerful medicine but must be used responsibly, and you must listen to it and respect the messages you receive, including when to pause for integration or stop altogether.I'm using LSD these days, which of course is a synthesized, and it is working really well for me right now.

For me, that \"energy\" is a physical experience of feeling antsy and wound up, it is not a spiritual concept of energy.  For me, simply exerting myself physically helps a lot.  Anxiety is unwanted and uncomfortable energy for me, and so movement helps me release that energy.Deepening your yoga practice involves more and more \"being on your mat\" with your mind and focus.  It clears your head because you're more focused on your movement and breath.  It's a matter of practice, practice, practice.  It is not \"turn key\", the first time on your mat.  It is similar to meditation-based mindfulness practices for clearing your mind of the thoughts that are often the basis of anxiety.

{"fh306je": {"text": "You are a very good writer.First off I want to say that your post just oozes with the goodness of you (as a man, but also just as a person), your compassion, your unflinching sense of responsibility and self-awareness, and the fact that your thoughts and feels come from a place of fundamental kindness.  It also unfortunately oozes  your self-hatred, and that breaks my heart, because it isn't justified and it doesn't rectify the situation in one bit, least of all in making amends.I'll try to ground the rest of my response in my own experience mainly, although some general advice may slip through.(When I started reading the post I thought for sure you were going to describe stranger, violent/forcible or gang rape, or more generally seriously predatory behavior.  What you describe is, sadly, very much a product of toxic masculinity in our culture, and typical rather than exceptional.  That's not to absolve you of responsibility or explain away your choices, but it is a fact in my opinion.  I was a teen 40 years ago and the toxic masculinity was even worse and unnamed.)In high school, I was worse than you, not categorically but by degrees, so I am coming from a place of experiential understanding.  I would pressure partners, both emotionally and physically.  I was with partners where there was similar disparity in age.  I definitely didn't play by the good and right approaches to getting and respecting consent that are (sometimes) taught and encouraged nowadays.Here's my worst confession, and the very last time in my life that I've done anything inappropriate sexually.  A far worse thing I did was that when I became a college teacher in my early to mid 20s, I had sex with my students, at first when they were no longer in my class, and then some when they were still in my class.  The students I dated and had sex with were strong people, with maturity and certainly falling into the category of consenting adults.  No excuse.  I never came even close to trading grades for sex, it never even occurred to me, but it was still a profound abuse of power and I can't pretend that I didn't know that exactly that at the time.  I did not pressure them (unlike when I was in high school) but that is no excuse because of the fundamental power disparity in teache sex.  In some cases they took the initiative.  No excuse.  In no cases did the relationship end in a horrible way, with bad feelings.  Again, no excuse.  In one case, one of those students is a close, dear friend 25 years later now.  In another case, the student is still a casual friend whom I'm in sporadic touch with.  No excuse - I'm just trying to tell the story in a whole way, because I think the wholeness of it relates the nuanced character of some of your situations and relationships.Both of these behaviors are long in my past now, but like you, #metoo really brought the memories up into my consciousness, and made me ask some hard questions about my past behavior.  I see them differently now.  I have, in fact, comes to see some of that behavior as somewhat predatory.  It was, by no reasonable definition, rape, and neither was your behavior, but it was somewhat predatory.Although your transgressions seem extremely mild and typical to me (in part by comparison), I'm using the word predatory because I don't think you want your bad choices to be sugar-coated.  I think you want me to put it that way.I have not made amends by speaking with the two students I'm still in touch with.  I've thought about it but haven't.  You have inspired me to do exactly that and soon.  I know they will totally take it in stride.  But it is not really about their response, it is about my obligation and sense of responsibility.  Inspiring me to do that is a measure of your goodness and the example of love you put out into the world.  You are a teacher and moral example.Reconciling oneself to past moral transgressions is something that so many people must contend with, or at least the really good ones do that work.  You are one of the good ones.  There are of course far far greater transgressions like forcible rape, child abuse of all kinds, and especially murder, that others must contend with, and people do find ways to forgive themselves, make amends and move on as good people.  I believe that you are the kind of person who can and would practice radical forgiveness with other people.  I hope you come to practice that kind of forgiveness with yourself.  Really, please, find the love and forgiveness in your heart to forgive your past self.I believe you have already, and will continue to move through this world taking the lesson of your past bad behavior, using it as a moral compass for future behavior.  That is a powerful way to make amends.You can make further amends by finding some way to support girls and women who have been the victim of sexual assault, and that probably means making a donation to that type of organization (since it would self-serving to go beyond that, to become involved).  Give anonymously, not because you want to hide, but because it is less self-aggrandizing if you do that.  For the same reason, tell no one, because otherwise it becomes an ego thing.You could find an organization where the mission is educating boys and young men about consent and assault, and tell your story and what you learned from it.  And the way it may have made the girls/women suffer, but also how you have suffered and suffer now.There is a path forward my friend.  Please, be resilient and courageous, and walk that path, out into the world and the possibility of forgiveness and absolution.", "link_id": "t3_f18zg2", "time": 1581263109}}

At first it was stocks, and then stocks on margin, and then stock options.  I quit my job as an executive in NYC and moved to CA and started trading full-time.I was trading AAPL at the time and it was on a tear (this was the mid-2000s).  I became greedy and over-confident and way making single trades that yielded hundreds of thousands of dollars in a day.  I hit a million dollars, and just then aggressive short selling started pressuring the stock down.  I chased my losses.  I started using Xanax to manage the anxiety, and that just led to more greed driven trading choices.  I lost all my money.  All of it.  A million dollars.  I was broke, because I was trading my personal capital.I was turning 40 at that time, and facing being evicted.  I plunged into deep despair and obtained the tools necessary for my particular method.  I was ready to go, but was also looking for jobs as a thread of hope.  I was so close to doing the deed when a great job came through.  I moved to Berkeley and started a new life.  Etc.My lessons.  Loss is a powerful and inevitable life experience.

And it's good for me to hear about it because my experience is so different.  I've actually been thinking of mixing in more non-lyrical music to my playlists.I'm mainly the inverse insofar as I only listen to music with a vocalist/lyrics right now!  Sure, I've listened to my share of jazz, classical and traditional Indian music without a vocalist, and I've enjoyed it and been transported by it in my past.But at this time in my life I really love hearing a vocalist.  The voice is powerful and profound to me because it rides on the breath.  The voice is so powerful and intimate when the vocalist puts deep emotion into what they are singing.  The voice is powerful and empowering to me because I don't play a musical instrument, so my own voice is the way I can participate in the music by singing along, with my breath and body.  The voice arises out of the embodied self, and for me the body is deeply erotic (God is erotic for me): simply put, the human voice fucking turns me on.Recently I've gotten into soul music, mainly from the 60s and 70s, mainly sung by African Americans, but also other types of soul coming out of other communities and experiences.  I love the earnest feeling, which is partly based on it arising from the deeply spiritual music of American gospel.  I love the way the intense sexuality of the music is also often bound to love and emotional feeling.  I love the celebration of love beyond the intimacy of two humans, rising up to be the possibility of love in community, and sometimes the transformative power of universal love.So that's where I'm at right now!

It seems counter-intuitive to me to structure a support group so that people who are best coping with their challenges are excluded.The implication is also that anyone who is now a legitimately FA participant, and who adapts and becomes happy, is unwelcome, since they can't relate to those who are unhappily single.  I'm still not always happy being single.  As I mentioned in my comment, I'm bipolar and so the ups and downs I go through involves downs filled with unhappy isolation, self-hatred and hopelessness.

I was a hospice volunteer, which was just being a loving presence at the bedside as people navigated the end of their lives.  Sydney did that work with me.  It was so enriching and bonding, and great preparation.He was aging (14) and I was acutely aware he would be passing soon.  I did a lot of \"preparatory\" grief, which for me is very much a love practice - looking at him with his stupid long tongue hanging out in happiness, knowing he would be leaving soon, and loving him to death (so to speak).  I would try to be mindful of all the little details of his behavior and our routines (rituals), and commit them to memory (I actually have a list in my journal from that time).  I'm not a Buddhist, but I was very influenced by Buddhist ideas and practices at that time, and a lot of my friends were Buddhists.  Buddhism \"does\" loss very well - very much focused around it, specifically around impermanence and change.  I took what I needed from it.  Pema Chodron (When Things Fall Apart in particular) was a big teacher (through her books and recordings) in my life at that time - very wise stuff.I was blessed to have developed a deep conviction over the years that there is in fact a soul, that our bodies are not the totality of our selves, and that the soul is eternal and one with a larger shared consciousness.  I don't belong to a major religion, and I'm very science-focused, so it was not trivial that this happened.  Psychedelic drugs were a major influence in developing that perspective over the years.  That was a major source of comfort, the sense that Syd's consciousness did not end with the death of his body, and that it was a continued presence in my life and the universe, and that it was energized through the process of remembering.Your question has really made me remember Syd in an intense way so thanks a lot for that.

I'm not OCD, but I imagine it's similar to the way OCD behaviors are soothing and pleasing to someone with that disorder.  I engage in maladaptive daydreaming sometimes - I construct elaborate story lines, and run them over and over, and expand them, and run them more.  When I was suicidal, my suicide plans became my daydream and it had a lot of the same features as my other daydreams, most notably providing an escape from the reality of my life - of course, the ultimate espeace.  And pleasure.  And drama.  And emotional feeling, which because I was depressed, I didn't have a lot of.You're at a huge advantage over most others because of your acute awareness of self and being able to witness your own thoughts.  That you are a keen internal observer of yourself will be your salvation.  Nevertheless, you surely are in the middle of the shit and that is a very dangerous place to be.  You are at serious risk, but you're having the wisdom to reach out and I think that is the single most important survival strategy.  Now that you've identified the thought patterns, have you tried identifying them when they are occurring and actively diverting your thoughts?  What happens when you try to do that?Given your own advanced understanding of your suicidality as involving intrusive thoughts, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) may be a treatment avenue you want to investigate.  For many it is an effective way to deal with intrusive thoughts.  I haven't done it, but what I like about is that the approach isn't dicking around trying to solve an underlying mental health issue, and instead is focused specifically on disrupting the obsessive suicidal ideation.

I always hate to share this horror story because it's just one experience, and I'm sure the drugs does good things for a lot of people.About six years ago I was put on high doses of prednisone (60 mg) for a respiratory illness.  I developed some steroid-induced aggression (mainly directed at my poor dogs) and my shrink prescribed me 5 mg of Abilify.  (I'm also bipolar 2).After I was off the prednisone, I was never assertive about getting off the Abilify, I guess because I knew it was hard to discontinue and I didn't want to fuck with a cocktail that was working for me.  I went through a few shrinks, and unfortunately none of them really broached the subject of whether I really needed to be on it anymore.Fast forward six years and I find myself in the depths of a bad depression.  Working with my shrink's NP, we increased my dose from 5 mg to 10 mg in the hopes it would mitigate the depression.Very soon after I developed an involuntary movement pattern in my right hand/arm - basically like a compulsive tapping action.  I reported it and we dropped the dose back to 5 mg.  But unfortunately the movement disorder worsened - it's like the dose increase triggered something.  I saw a neurologist and he diagnosed it as a \"Parkinsonism\", which is not Parkinson's disease, but rather that type of symptom.  Still, it was scary to hear that word.The treatment was to discontinue the Abilify, and they said the movement disorder should clear in six months.  After about four months thankfully it was gone.  It was hellish going off the Abilify, but I don't go into the nasty details of that.  I hope that's helpful.", "link_id": "t3_ezzu5s", "time": 1581028363}}

There's are a lot of possible reasons for them to do that, but I certainly think it should be taken as a serious warning about the relative risk.If you become dead set on experimenting, do so with lots of information, intention and planning.  Treat the drugs with respect, even awe, and perhaps as \"medicine\".  It takes a lot of self-discipline and self-knowledge to safely self-medicate in that way, particularly when you're talking about substances that we really don't understand very well yet, either biologically or spiritually.  If you're going into doing this to have a good time in a simple recreational sense, I think you would be making a huge mistake and should find your pleasures elsewhere.Starting to use these substances while you're actively being treated by a psychiatrist, especially if your cocktail is still changing, will totally undermine that process, adding in an \"X\" factor that your shrink won't know anything about, so additional adjustments might not be the right choices.Although for unipolar depression, you might be able to find a local psychotherapist who would work with you using these substances, I highly doubt someone would treat someone with bipolar 1.

I lived alone, no partner, barely any friends, and for the second year was basically homebound because portable O2 couldn't cover my needs.  I had done hospice volunteer work some years prior, and to my great surprise my colleagues from doing that work, who were  only causal friends at most, really stepped up to support me in many different ways.

There are trends of people creating structured social networks of mutual assistance, and I think we'll see more and more of that.

My lung function was down to 14% when I received a life-saving double lung transplant.  Not being able to breath is one of the worst things that can happen to you, and part of why it is so awful is the way it triggers a terrible form of body-level anxiety.  You are like a fish out of water, every instinct in you struggle to catch that next breath. I never felt anything close to it before in terms of anxiety.Although I was never on a respirator prior to my transplant, I was on one post-operatively and it was not a pleasant thing and I imagine spending your last few days with a tube down your throat, unable to talk to your loved ones would be unpleasant way to go, to say the least.I happened to be suicidal when my respiratory disease emerged.  While I never would have predicted it, as soon I was diagnosed as \"terminal\", my survival instincts killed in in a very powerful way.  I don't have a full explanation for it, but I fought like hell to live.

Focus instead on comments that are based on more substantial evidence.I've read protocols for studies in a clinical context for depression that not only exclude people with schizophrenia, but also where the subject has a first or second degree relative with it.  That may be out of an abundance of caution or for reasons of \"controlling\" for that issue in the study, or other reasons, but it is something to think about and maybe research further.If you've studied the symptoms of schizophrenia and you've experienced any, out of an abidance of caution go see a psychiatrist to get a better sense if those might actually indicate schizophrenia.  Think of it as clearance to fly!  I think there less clinical evidence on DMT than LSD or psilocybin, so it'll be hard to find evidence-based information.  There's just not a lot of data on it and issues related to mental illness that I've seen.  However, my understanding is that the mechanism of action is generally similar so evidence-based information on LSD may be applicable (but others here probably know more about that).If you used LSD in casual settings without preparation, it might make sense to research a more carefully considered plan and supportive context for using DMT.", "link_id": "t3_evuj47", "time": 1580339386}}

You were victimized by that person. I don't know which type you have (though I assume genital based on what you said).  In the US overall about 50% of people have HSV-1.  HSV-2 is about 16%.  So it is very prevalent.  Most people with oral herpes (usually HSV-1) were actually infected in childhood through non-sexual contact with saliva.  That's probably not too helpful to know if you have genital herpes, but I thought I would put it out there anyway.Of course, you'll need to disclose your status to future partners, but there are ways that to do that that will minimize the chance your potential partner will respond negatively.  You can search for suggestions on how to do that online.  Risks to uninfected partners can be minimized.

Google \"psychiatric illness in medical school\" to see some information.  If you do actually have a psychiatric illness, the key is to find the right treatment so that it is well-managed, and you can move forward with your medical career.  You should be able to find psychiatric treatment where it is assured it will not get back to your school.  Research that and go, so you can find out what's really behind your symptoms and stop guessing or trying to get diagnosis on Reddit.Most critically, do not make decisions about your career until you get real, profession feedback on what's up.

I know it's not normally thought of as a disease (instead, it's thought of as a symptom of depression, for example) but I've had depression (bipolar 2) and I've been suicidal and they are very different animals.  For me, the disease of suicide like getting trapped in a muck that won't release you and that colors the world as a hopeless and terrible place that can never change.  The disease whispers in your ear lies about how your life is meaningless and that things will never change.  It whispers lies that you are you are only worthy of self-hate.  It whispers lies that undermine your confidence in your own goodness and power.  Do not listen to the lies.You are a healer.  Your life now depends on you turning that healing power on yourself.  I know all pathways of treatment are now seeming pointless to you, but I seriously doubt you have exhausted all the many possible treatments.  You owe it to yourself and you owe it to your partner to exhaust all possibilities before you take a plunge of the GGB.

{"ffm6sfp": {"text": "Sadly, I think in most localities in the US, parents are permitted under the law to engage in that form of violence assault.  My strongly held perspective is that it is morally wrong to strike another person unless you're defending yourself or another person, and a few other obvious situations.  I believe it is morally wrong to strike a child ever, and that  includes teachers, social workers, and cops, but also parents.  I would like to see laws created that make what your parents did to you a crime.  I think a slap in the face, which is a very intimate and important place on our body, is far worse than a punch in the stomach.  It is like hitting someone's soul.  I think often when parents use corporal punishment they are actually unconsciously angry at the child, and so the idea that it is a just parenting technique or strategy, that it is done out of love or for the good of the child, is  complete bullshit.  It is an outlet for the emotions of the parent that they're unable to manage appropriately.  I think often the behavior is by-product of how parents themselves were raised.  And I don't mean to say that they \"learned\" parenting practices from abusive parents.  I mean instead that they were scared and wounded by their own childhood abuse, and reproduce that abuse on their children for unconscious reasons.  I'm not saying that is the case with your parents.Lately, a subset of people who believe in and practice corporal punishment are actually sadists and derive please from striking children.  I think my father was like that.  I'm not say that is the case with your parents.Abusive parenting practices have a huge negative impact on the general health and well-being of society.  Putting aside all the moral questions, here is why the American Psychological Association thinks hitting children is bad parenting, plain and simple:[https://www.apa.org/about/policy/corporal-punishment](https://www.apa.org/about/policy/corporal-punishment)", "link_id": "t3_eu0f16", "time": 1580049491}}

I've broken up with a couple of friends over the past couple of years because the friendship wasn't working for me.  Instead of ghosting, I tend to write aggressive messages that list all the ways I feel harmed and disrespected.  I'm trying not to do that, but instead to breakup gently and with love.  But most importantly, never, ever closing the door permanently, in my communications with them, but also in my heart.  I do the same when a friend pulls back from me.  I had it happen with a woman who is pretty much my best friend.  We took a break for a year, and just picked up where we left off.  I've arrived at that approach partly based on years of friendships that have ebbed and flowed.  We  would have the intense closeness you describe for a period of time, and then for whatever reason, they would pull away or I would pull away.  Like you said, so often it has to do with something, unrelated to you, that the person is going through.  I mean, if she was in a psych ward recently for depression, that may very well, and very understandably, be the case.  An old and very, very important friend to me is going through a terrible, long depression, and her response to that has been to isolate herself socially.  It drives me fucking crazy because I want to give her love and support, but she's doing her best to take care of herself in the way that works for her (however unhealthy social isolation is).  It hurts me some she won't let me shower love on her.This may be cold comfort, but friendships do ebb and flow like I said.  Keep the door open, keep your heart open, be non-judgmental, and she may heal enough from whatever is going on to return to the friendship, hopefully in the short-term, but maybe longer.  I'm really convinced she did not pull back because of anything you said or did, that it's her thing.I'm trying to patiently shoot for life-long friendship, with people who are worth my friendship.

So much fun. Another time I was taken away from my apartment in cuffs by the NYPD for a ride to the hospital where I was given an anti-psychotic to address my temporary psychosis. This is 25 years ago. I've tried to integrate those experiences into my choices now.These substances can enable us take quick, powerful journeys into other worlds, wonderful and terrifying. It sounds like you basically went into something akin to going into combat (very loose analogy). Your complete sense of reality was replaced with something truly terrifying and all encompassing for a period of time. That's fucking huge. Don't brush that off. People who have that kind experience can take years to process it. They're often diagnosed with PTSD, though I'm not at all saying that is the case with you, but hopefully you get the point of the analogy, which is to say, you experienced something that can't be pushed under the rug.I think when these substances present us with a hellscape, they're offering us an opportunity to work on something very deep. The hardest and most unpleasant trips are often the most fruitful ones, but only if we want to use them that way. Viewing these experiences as \"blips\" or \"bad trips\" is completely missing the power of the medicine. Do you think it's worthwhile to go deeper into what happened and find the information that's being provided to you? Some people will say don't bother, drop more, find fun. Like you said, it can be a wonderful, enlightening drug. I'd encourage you to sit with the enlightenment you've already experienced in the last year or two from both your pleasant and terrifying trips for a while. I'm not talking about just a reset and clearance period of weeks or months. I'm talking about at least a year. Otherwise you may just be abusing yourself, chasing after good feelings, patterns and fractals (all of which are totally awesome of course). I was chasing pleasure that way for a while and it lead nowhere, and getting into that state of chase was very similar to how I was about coke and heroin.

{"ffi59fo": {"text": "I'm not a doctor. What follows is the little bit I've learned trying to sort through my own cognitive challenges (which are relatively minor, or at least I look at them that way now - I used to be very anxious about them).Cognitive change is something that is really difficult to sort through when we're personally trying to evaluate the performance of our own brain, with our brain, based on memory within that brain, without any baseline using objective testing.  It's got \"bias\" written all over it!I'm not saying your mental health problems haven't had a real impact on your cognition, I'm saying it is extraordinarily difficult for you as the subject to know when that's the case, especially when we're talking about an ultra-high performing person (no studying) changing to being a high performing individual (studying) like yourself.  Your perception of things is the most important piece of evidence in sorting these things out, but it has inherent flaws.  In cases where the cognitive decline is more significant and it impacts daily life, it is much easier to test, although even then you need a structured context to determine cause in a reliable sense, unless there is obvious injury.  But your issue is way more subtle and harder to test for.Mental illness powerfully effects cognition no doubt about it, but that's not your issue really.  The question you're posing is whether or not mental illness, over years, causes cognitive injury even after mental health is restored, and also if that cognitive injury is permanent.If your performance is causing you real concern, it would definitely be worth seeing a neuropsychologist to better understand your cognitive status now, identify possible changes since the past, explore possible causes and maybe find some changes to make and exercises you can do to improve in areas you're concerned about.  They may encourage you to eat differently, such as intermittent fasting.  If you're not sleeping as well compared to your younger years, they may encourage you to see a sleep specialist, because disordered sleep can impact cognition.  The list goes on in terms of causes, possible lifestyle changes and exercises.If you have experienced changes in how quickly and accurately you can process information, it can really trigger a sense of loss and undermine your sense of self (even if you go from being super-brilliant to being brilliant, that still is a huge loss for the person involved).  In dealing with my own cognitive issues, I'm trying to have an attitude of curiosity about it (and I think you share that attitude or you wouldn't be here), investigating it, observing myself,  learning about neuroscience, and seeing clinicians.  But I also try not to fixate on it and get overly involved in comparing my present self to my past self, and instead I see all the significant cognitive power I have at my disposal.  I love some of the very impressive things I'm able to do with my mind and brain - I see it as the source of great power, and see the areas of change as something I can work-around through the brain power that I do have.  I encourage you to explore the idea of \"neuroplasicity\".  More and more neuroscientists have been identifying amazing ways in which the brain can adapt and improve function.  This is in contrast to the traditional view that the brain is \"nonrenewable\", which is kind of depressing outlook if you've experienced brain injury or cognitive changes.  The brain is an extremely flexible organ, probably in ways we haven't even discovered yet, and there are ways to encourage that plasticity.  So, I intend this as a message of hope, and encouragement to work with doctors to learn more if you're really concerned!  Physicists are awesome!

Because I have bipolar (2) disease, I flip back and forth between the shit view and the good view, but sometimes find a moment of seeing the balanced view, which I think is closest to the truth.  When I am depressed, I am utterly and completely convinced about my negative world view, and can't see beyond it.I've tried to share a reasoned perspective rather that one based on \"false hope\".

{"ffd8rsw": {"text": "Regarding friends who are parents, the experience of seeing people's family lives unfold on FaceBook is often a thing of sadness and some resentment.  Fortunately, I've deactivated and don't expose myself to the pain of that anymore.  FaceBook is supposed to keep people in touch and connected, but I think in many cases it can be somewhat toxic for single folk.  When I was 47, I suddenly experienced a worsening shortness of breath.  After being misdiagnosed three times, it turned out to be a progressive and untreatable illness, with the only intervention being a double lung transplant.  I had two years of intensifying sickness, alone in my cold apartment, with no immediate family support, on oxygen 24/7, gradually losing lots of the things that made me me, and the ability to do activities of daily living.  Thankfully, I had volunteered some years prior with a hospice organization, and although my relationships with the people I worked with were casual in nature, they really stepped up in amazing ways to support me as a became sicker and waited for new lungs.  It was a major stroke of luck I never would have foreseen.  I never expect a \"return on investment\" for my hospice volunteer work, but things really came around for me.It was a huge thing to having been a very independent person for my whole adult life to having to ask for and receive help - it was a big lesson in vulnerability and our inevitable need for assistance.  It would have been great to have a spouse, to have someone around most of the time, for touch, for help, for conversation, for love, for good food, for medical advocacy.  But at the same time, I knew people with SOs who were terminally ill, and that involves it's own serious challenges, in terms of conflicts and guilt about demanding so much care, so to some extent the grass seems greener but isn't necessarily.  I'm really glad I didn't have kids because it would have been so difficult to put them through that, in so many ways. So I basically cobbled together a support network, and that included a few young people who inexpensively provided me with a variety help.  Obviously, I got my lung transplant, five years ago, and I've been thriving since.  For the lung transplant, I had to have a main support person 24/7 for six weeks after the surgery, and I ended up living with one of my hospice friends for those six weeks, and she was my primary carer.  She saved my life by doing that, giving up her privacy and energy and love, because I simply had no other options.  I'm very sad that she's pulled away from me over the last couple of years because she played such a critical role in my survival.  Really sad, and self-critical about the whole situation.  I now live 2000 miles away from that support network, and 300 miles from the hospital that monitors my lung transplant.  If I go into rejection, although a second transplant is technically possible, it is simply not an option for me - I just don't have the support network in my new community, much less 300 miles away.  I'm okay with that - I long ago came to pretty good terms with my mortality, and I'm trying my best to stay healthy and live as meaningfully as I can in the days I have.  But it is a powerful reality related to being single and isolated: I will likely die at least indirectly as a result of that reality.  I do have a couple of local friends who I don't see much, but can rely on in an emergency.  But they are not in a position to provide major help, nor would I want them to.

My love and care for you is based in the fact that I totally relate to paranoia, hopelessness, and loneliness - in that sense, is not general but very specific.  I don't want to write an essay about me and my situation either, but suffice it to say I was on the edge of suicide about four months ago (researching methods, writing a note) for exactly the three reasons you mentioned (and a couple of more I won't go into it - I had a literal list).  All three are really hard, but hopelessness is in my experience of it the most dangerous and awful one for suicidal thinking, so I'll share my experience and thoughts about that.I totally could not grasp what I'm about to say when I was suicidal myself, so I understand if you can't connect with it.  I'll say it from the perspective as someone who has (perhaps only temporarily, but I hope forever) recovered from the disease of suicidal thinking...  Hopelessness is logically flawed insofar as it takes the past and assumes the future will be the same.  You can look all over the world and see experiences of transcending terrible circumstances, where people's lives take unanticipated pathways to betterment.  There is always the possibility of a future we don't project, that we cannot visualize.  I don't know if that sort of logic makes a difference to you - like I said it wasn't all that useful for me or foremost in my mind when I was critically suicidal (I was just drowning in despair) - but maybe it helps you in some small way.The other avenue for me in battling hopelessness has been to seek out and respect the journeys of other people who have been in really dark, terrible situations themselves and have gotten through it, and seen their lives turn around.  My point is definitely not about \"your situation isn't as bad as others who have recovered\".  That is stupid blather, because suffering is deeply subjective and experiential, and comparisons between situations are meaningless.  Rather my point is just to find those stories and use them as mantras and reminders that there really is always hope and the possibility of recovery, even if you can't see it when you're in the pit.

And like I said, I appreciate your desire to deploy the term to convey the severity of the oppression of wage slavery.  The term contains a lot of power and is very impactful, and generally I think repurposing language and using it to purposes to fight oppression most definitely has its place.  I'm just uncomfortable with this particular case of doing that.I mentioned \"contemporary\" slavery above specifically because estimates say there are 40 million people around the world who are enslaved today (the exact number depends on the definition of slavery), so it is not really just \"past generations\".  While US slavery may be in the past as an institution, it's consequences have shaped the circumstances of many Americans until today, so it is not in the past in that sense, and many of those Americans feel pretty strongly about how that term is used and might feel that using it to describe wage labor diminishes the uniqueness of their experience, present and past.  Some African Americans may be okay with it, particular those in oppressive wage labor situations themselves.  (BTW, full disclosure, I'm white.)I think it is somewhat similar when people redeploy the term holocaust instead of reserving it to refer to the Holocaust.  I'm not saying that as an answer to whether doing so is right or wrong - I think it depends on the situation, and I think many Jews (I'm not Jewish) would agree that it can be redeployed in contemporary situations.  I think people have made comparisons between the camps and the detention of immigrants on the southern border - there was a lot of controversy about that in the Jewish community, so no simple answer.", "link_id": "t3_esf8t5", "time": 1579726246}}

It\u2019s shorthand for \u201cmy experience of God\u201d, avoiding the any notion that my truth is the ultimate truth\u2026at all. I generally say \u201cGod\u201d instead of what some people mean as \u201cdivine power\u201d or \u201cThe Universe\u201d- they are somewhat similar I think, depending, and for me \u201cGod\u201d is a better shorthand.TW: If you\u2019ve been traumatized by institutional religion, this might not be something for you engage with, although it is not at all religious and entirely spiritual. Also, if you are a believing member of a traditional/organized religion, the ideas below you may find to be sacrilegious.First, my God is non-binary. Their pronoun in language is in the \u201cthey\u201d form, but they are beyond pronouns, because they are beyond language. Their true pronouns encompass all possible pronouns. Language can only reach toward their pronouns but never specify or say them. \u201cGod\u201d as a name make is also just shorthand thing for communication sake - their name is also beyond language.My God loves gender in every possible expression or experience of it, including traditional, binary forms, and including the form where gender is absent in someone\u2019s identity. It\u2019s a gift for us to express a core part of ourselves, to be creative with, to celebrate, to become more true to ourselves. Those who are expanding what gender is in the world are taking that gift and the highest possible expression by exploring, playing, expanding, sharing and diversifying it.My God is not separate from from who and what we are. Our consciousness and bodies are a part of divine power, and not some separate thing. They love when we have new ideas, combine ideas, evolve ideas. They love when we are playful with our bodies (I\u2019m thinking here in terms of body art, piercings and surgery, but also things like dance and song).  They love when we harmlessly share our bodies with others.I wrote more than I planned so I\u2019ll stop.

It's a pretty basic test where he goes into situations similar to where he'll be working, demonstrates obedience (sit, stay, lay down, come, heal) and is put in situations, such as encountering another dog and being around medical equipment (like a wheel chair) to see if he gets spooked.  Volunteer opportunities will require that you have some type of certification, and the key thing about that is that it gives you liability insurance, which the organization you're volunteering with needs.  If you have a specific volunteer opportunity in mind, ask them what certification/s they require.I think the most important thing is that the dog have a disposition appropriate to the work, and that the handler have a really good, intuitive relationship with their partner animal.

It was so wonderful, but I have to say at first it was extremely difficult to receive support from them.  I've been a very independent, mostly single, strong, capable person my whole adult life.  And given the realities of my disability, there was simply not way for me to reciprocate in any meaningful sense, except being open-hearted with my gratitude.  I had to just receive and receive and receive, without much giving back.  It was a big spiritual lesson to learn how to do that, to be vulnerable and in need in that way.  I value that lesson so much because I will, of course, someday be in that situation again, as we all will, when we become elderly and when we're dying.  One of the most important aspects of the lesson was really coming to believe that people not only want to help sincerely, but that helping lifts them up.  Allowing someone to help you is a gift you give to them.  I do some service work these days and though I'm giving, I also receive so much in the very act of giving.  It is not draining, it is energizing.Now I realize, you're in a pretty damn intense situation and maybe my thoughts and experience don't really map over to where you are.  No doubt, letting her in you would be asking a whole lot from her.  I understand your resistance to it, I think, a little bit.  But like you said, she has a lot of strength, and probably more endurance and resiliency than even she knows.  Can you see any way in which letting her in on the truth of what is unfolding for you, and letting her help and support you, would be uplifting for her, and not just a burden?  Do you think her helping you would fracture your bond or deepen it?", "link_id": "t3_erznro", "time": 1579656896}}

{"ff7ilda": {"text": "Having dogs has had a huge, positive impact on getting me through periods of depression.  They did not cure me by any stretch, but they helped in a number of ways.  I have reclusive tendencies, and having to walk my dogs gets me out of the house, usually twice a day.  That means sunshine, fresh air, running into neighbors and getting exercise, which is so important because I tend to do no other exercise when depressed.  Also, I moved to a new city about three years ago and having the company of dogs has helped me deal with being alone a lot.Google \"therapy dogs\" to get some good information on the ways that just being in the presence of a dog, and petting them, really helps with stress relief, anxiety and overall well-being.  (One of my dogs is a therapy dog and we go to the local hospital to visit sick kids.  I continue doing that in the depths of my depression and it helped me so much to serve other people with my sweet pup Digit). If you get a younger dog, they'll play with you, and that can be loads of fun.I became seriously suicidal but simply would not abandon my dogs that way.  When I rescued them I made a commitment to take care of them for the rest of their lives.  To me, that was a solemn thing.  So, they saved me.Caring for another being shifts the focus off yourself a bit, and it's very gratifying to be taking care of someone in spite of your depression.People say \"dogs give love unconditionally\", and I think that's true, but for me the more important thing is that dogs receive love unconditionally.  Loving on my dogs makes me feel better.It's fun to get a puppy but that can be very challenging.  If you're getting a rescue, maybe a middle aged dog that has a good disposition and is house-trained is probably the best choice.  It's always a good idea to foster the dog first because mentally it puts less pressure on adopting that specific dog - you can test it out to see if it's a good match.  Do not keep a dog if after a week or two your intuition is telling it's not a good fit.  It's better for you, and it's better to be homed into a situation where they'll thrive.In your situation, you need a dog that's not going to be challenging to handle or form a strong relationship with.  Be honest about your situation with the shelter and emphasize you need a dog who will work for you right off the bat.  I recommend getting a small or medium-sized dog, not a large dog.  You may be able to bring a small dog into more situations more easily - it may also be easier for someone else to care for the dog if you're temporarily unable to.  Of course, a lot of that advice doesn't so much apply if you're getting a professionally-trained emotional support animal.  I guess whether you do that  depends on affordability and if you have objectives with the dog that require that kind of training.  That's obviously a more reliable and less complicated approach.  I don't have much knowledge or experience regarding that.I wrote this fast so I apologize if anything I said was unclear.

Being my own advocate, taking more control of my treatment, probably saved my life.It's a real balancing act between being a strong advocate for yourself and for your care and being a disrespectful jerk, what doctors call a \"difficult patient\".  If you are a difficult patient, your quality of care diminishes according to studies.  But just as with my respiratory disease, our lives really hang in the balance of accurate diagnosis and effective treatment, especially with such a challenging disorder like bipolar 2, so it is critical to take initiative.  For me, I was respectful but assertive.  They went to medical school and may have years of experience behind their interpretation of your situation.  I respect that, and I want to take advantage of that.  But at the same time, when it comes to a mental health issue, we are extremely well-informed on the issue simply because we live inside of it every day.  Tell them that you've learned about bipolar 2 and you've talked to some other patients about their experiences, and you're wondering if maybe the diagnosis fits you better than your current ones.  Their only appropriate response is to carefully hear your concerns, take those concerns seriously, and walk you through the reasons why they disagree (assuming they disagree).  If your current treatment isn't working, that is a another thing to share with them as an important component of your case for an alternative diagnosis.  If they fail to respond appropriately, it's time to move on to another provider.

Nowadays, I don't relate too much to SAD for myself, I guess in part because my depressions have been very serious ones, and so the effects of SAD seems like it would be a drop in the bucket.  I think there's tons of evidence that it impacts people in really high latitudes, so I do think it's a real thing for some people.  Sorry, by \"naming\" thoughts I meant naming them \"as thoughts\", not after person or thing.  So much of our thinking is about the past and the future, which means we're involved in something other than the present moment (the dog walk, the sun).  The present moment is often the place we really should be (though not always of course).  Also, for me, naming thoughts is more generally just about diffusing how weighty they are for us when they are experienced as reality.  Rather they are thoughts about reality.  I get into arguments with people in my head, and when I notice that, label it as a thought, poof, I'm able to release it.  I don't know if that's helpful.  I'm definitely not a teacher of this stuff, and I'm a pretty lousy practitioner (getting better I hope), so I'm probably not someone you should pay too much attention to.", "link_id": "t3_erhgyx", "time": 1579568595}}

If you look across cultures and history, you'll see significant variation in the sexual impulses that people experience and their behavior around those impulses.  Even in the immediate history in the US, you'll see considerable variation. You ask how long can you go without \"fulfilling your biological needs\"?  You're really focused on intercourse I think, or at least sex with a partner.  And I think you're more focused on men rather than women.  And I think you're confusing sexuality with reproduction with your comment about fertility. People can and do satisfy their sexual needs by pleasuring themselves.  I've gone long stretches without a partner and was perfectly satisfied in terms of my sexual needs.  I guess I'm one of the 1% you mention, but that is not accidental.  It's because I've gotten damn good at it, without shame or think of it as \"less than\".  When I said having sex in your teens is not important to living a full, successful life I was not saying it is not important in the opinion of teenagers!  Obviously, in this society, it's very important to them.  Rather, I was saying it is not essential to having a good and successful life to have sex in your teens - tons of people today, and even a higher percentage through history, have been very successful without having sex until out of their teens.  The idea that it is somehow \"damaging\" to not have sex has no basis in reality, in terms of any research or any anecdotal evidence I've seen.  Like I said above, there is plenty of evidence associating adolescent sexuality with poorer performance in school - you're way more likely to graduate high school, go to college, and go on to get an advanced degree if you stay focused on your studies.  If you are still a teenager and you haven't had sex with a partner, don't worry.  You are not at all damaged and you can still be a success in your life, especially you're not obsessed with the fact that you're not having sex and ignore your studies.  If you think you're somehow deficient based on your sexual activity, that can certainly become a self-fulfilling prophecy, and impact success.", "link_id": "t3_erc6ck", "time": 1579568080}}

And with a lifetime implication that if you don't fuck by 20 you're fucked?  Keep in mind that bragging about sexual \"conquests\" is a very common aspect of adolescent male culture around sexuality, so it is very much about peer acceptance and power.Not all, but a good part of the way we think about sex and our sexuality comes from our culture and society.  In many cultures and societies, there just isn't the kind of expectations around sexual activity in adolescence that there is in the west, either within individual minds or within the society.  And yet those boys grow into being strong, confident, successful men.Having sex in your teens just isn't important to living a full, successful life. It's a blip on the screen, and you'll completely forget about it once you're out of adolescence.  Also, there's tons of research that suggests that sexual activity in adolescence has a negative impact among many measures of short and long term well-being, including school performance.  Don't under-estimate the power of self-pleasuring in satisfying the urges you seem to be hanging your case on.  A majority of people in this society don't have sexual partners and live full and fulfilling lives without one, and that is in part to masturbation.  When I was a teenager I was not nearly as good as it as I am now (and I'm talking about the mental aspect, not the physical act), so it not just a \"naturally\" given behavior, it's a skill and capability you develop over a lifetime.

I relate because I also experience emotional hangovers, and I'm over sensitive so even a little bit of friction in an interaction will trigger self-doubt.  My sensitivity is both in a negative response to things other people say, and a worry that things I've said may have hurt people and pushed them away.I have a developing mindfulness practice, and it sounds like you do too.  It helps me a lot in naming my thoughts when I start ruminating on what happens, especially if I get prosecutorial about it (by which I mean, building a litany of transgressions the other person has done).  I name the thought and I neither latch onto or push it away - instead, try to disrupt the rumination, sometimes by distraction, and let the thoughts drift away.  Sometimes I manage to laugh at myself because I realize I'm ruining a nice walk with my dogs by litigating some real or imagined conflict.You mention that distraction normally works for you, but isn't right now, so not sure if that advice is useful.  It might be worth putting your mind to investigating why distraction is not working for you in this case.  Some people will poo poo distraction as not really figuring out the deeper emotional truth which the resolving of which is thought to be the path to healing.  That may be true in some cases, but I call bullshit on that for a situation like this.  Another practice I've been working on lately is engaging in a kind of radical love practice.  I guess maybe it could be called compassionate thinking, or living-kindness.  It's really my own practice I'm putting tougher, but it's inspired a bit by this Buddhist Metta Prayer:***May all beings be free from suffering*** *and the causes of* ***suffering****.* ***May all beings*** *rejoice in the well-being of others.* ***May all beings*** *live in peace,* ***free*** *from greed and hatred.* So in the face of the shitty way your friends treated you, and in the face of the whole trauma, perhaps re-orienting yourself toward love.  I find it to be a relief and release to get to that place of love.I have less to offer on how to help your husband - I don't have an SO so I'm less experienced.

I think style is something that really needs to come out of the deepest part of you, but also shaped by what you see in other people and the media.  So if you don't have a style, really start exploring your preferences and feelings, exploring media and looking around at other people, and seeing what clicks for you.Once you have a style in mind, start buying clothes that work within that style. Work with a hair stylist to cut your hair in a way that expresses your new style.  If your style involves makeup, get help with that from someone who will really understand what your goals are.This is definitely not about picking some cookie-cutter style and forcing everything into it.  And it isn't necessarily about fashion or being cool.  It's about expressing who you are through the clothes you wear, the items you buy and carry, how you decorate your space, and so on.

{"ff38y9x": {"text": "I think mental health conditions are very real things that often require significant treatment.  But the idea of mental illness is a very social and culturally-specific idea, and so is the idea that they are entirely pathological.  Some non-western societies, especially traditional societies, find ways to integrate and celebrate some of the characteristics of what we call mental illness that are thought of only as symptoms in western society.  For example, hearing voices, seeing visions, entering ecstatic states (such as with mania/hypomania), experiencing alternative realities, often find a place in cultures and societies associated with spiritual power.  For example, if you are grieving and the loved one visits you in a very real vision, is that mental illness?  What if you often find yourself interacting with dead people on an ongoing basis, especially ancestors?  There's lots of examples of this type of thing. Because mental illnesses seem so real to us in western societies, it is easy to think they are objective facts in the world.  Given the cultural diversity I describe above, you've got to ask yourself if to some degree mental illnesses are partly \"created\" by the mental health establishment.  When I was first given a depression diagnosis, and the serotonin system was described to me, and I was treated with an SSRI, I started having this mental image of my brain and mind organized around serotonin.

You're probably not going to get the kind deep connection with a massage therapist I'm talking about through Massage Envy.  Find someone through word-of-mouth maybe through your LGBTQ community, or other contexts where you'll find someone cool who you can really connect with and trust.  It's pretty awesome to be naked under a sheet and have someone touch and rub you (almost) all over.  And if it's the right person, you can share where you're at in terms of all these issues.

I don't know what most would think of kissing.You might also consider a massage with \"release\".  While that may not be as sexually intense as you're looking to have with an escort, it might be a good first step in seeing if you want to hire one.  If that's the focus of the session, you're probably not going to get the kind of really soothing, intuitive touch on the rest of your body.  I've found massage therapists who advertise themselves for release are less educated in massage and tend to view the massage as just a preliminary to what the customer came for.  It's always possible in the first scenario I describe above, that you will build a trusting relationship with the massage therapist where they would be willing to take the touch in a erotic direction, but I wouldn't go into the relationship with that expectation.

Just to be clear, what you did seems to me very innocent, not just because you were a child yourself, but because it doesn't sound like you had any malintent at all, and I doubt your cousin experienced it as anything other than roughhousing.  I do not think amends is warranted, and discussing this with your cousin may be very counter-productive for your own healing.  But if you find no other pathway to relieving your remorse, perhaps bringing it up with your cousin would be a path to healing for you, depending on your current relationship.  However, I don't think it's a good idea but thought I would put it out there.I want to put a another possibility out there, more as a thought exercise than as some truth about the experience.  Perhaps you're displacing some other, perhaps deeper issue, onto this experience?  If that were true, can you think of possibilities in terms of your sense of your self or other stuff going on with you now or in the past, where you could be using this experience as a focal point for working through those other issues in an indirect way?  You mentioned your sexual play with your brother.  Could that be involved?I am not a lawyer so please don't construe this as legal advice.  I suspect the statute of limitations probably mean this is not prosecutable in a statutory sense.  I tend to think no prosecutor would be interested in pressing it as a case.  You did not specify the age disparity between you and the cousin you acted out on - depending on that difference in age, it may not have been a criminal act at all.  I think therapists will typically only report if they think you would \"offend\" again, and given the amount of time and your remorseful relationship to the incident, I doubt they would think that.  I don't know for sure, and this is a local issue, but I doubt a therapist would be mandated to report it.  You could talk to a criminal attorney to get a more reliable answer than my feeble one.  It might be worth doing that because it sounds like you are really suffering with this and perhaps a therapist could help.

{"ferufsr": {"text": "Great post.Your struggle is valid with or without a diagnosis of bipolar 2.I have a complicated relationship to my diagnosis and I hold it at arms length.  I've been thinking a lot about how I relate to my diagnosis lately, partly because I'm hypomanic and have a lot of energy to invest in that!  Here's some thoughts I have on it - maybe something will be helpful to you.  It's kind of long because...I'm hypomanic right now.The diagnostic criteria for bipolar 2 is a rough sketch of what the lived experience is for people who meet that criteria.  We are all very unique in our mood patterns and how we relate to those moods and patterns, in terms of how we make meaning from them, respond to them and explain them to others.  \"Bipolar 2\" is just short-hand for your complex and evolving mood system.  In some ways that shorthand is not at all useful with non-mental health professions because people don't know what bipolar 2 is at all, or confuse it with bipolar 1.  Often they don't understand the subtle differences between mania and hypomania.  I find it really tiresome having to explain it to people, and find that half the time they are not really listening closely enough to really get it, and instead clinging to their pre-existing ideas about it.I'm trying to figure out a way to communicate the fact that I have a complicated pattern of moods without using the diagnostic term.  The diagnostic term will tend to lead people to interpret way too much of your personality and behavior in pathological terms.  They will constantly be looking for symptoms and I say fuck that.  Identifying and managing symptoms is something I'll work with my doctor on, and that's that.  For me part of limiting symptom detection and management to my relationship with my doctor requires that I constantly improve my self-awareness of my moods, patterns and triggers.  If you don't know yourself, then you have to depend on others to tell you what's going on with you.  For me, mood journaling has been helpful.A diagnosis is very useful.  It provides a template for understanding ourselves and is a ticket for receiving therapeutic and medical treatment, but I think of it as a starting place.  For some with bipolar 2, they hold to their diagnosis as a major part of their identity.  This is not meant as criticism, but they allow their diagnosis to define them, and see it less as a disease they have and more as who they are.  Some people are in a constant fight with the diagnosis because it has life-long implications, they don't like those implications or perhaps they don't want to take psychiatric drugs.  Any way you slice it, a diagnosis has a lot of power in our lives.  I think it's crucial to take control of that power and wield it to your own benefit. Some things I'm wondering about having read your post.  What does your new bipolar 2 diagnosis do for you, in terms of you feel or think about yourself?  In what ways is the validation of a diagnosis important to you - that is, what does it offer you?  Does it help you understand yourself better?  What changes will happen if your family totally accepts your diagnosis as real?  How does it make you feel if your family were to accept it completely?  I know it's a new diagnosis for you so maybe some of these ideas and questions are pre-mature, but I thought they may relate to \"imposter syndrome\".", "link_id": "t3_eqfkcg", "time": 1579358475}}
{"fepp0k8": {"text": "Most of what I say here relates to LSD, but it is somewhat similar to mushrooms are in how they impact depression.  I recently came out of depression by using LSD.  I've used psychedelics on and off for about 30 years, so I knew the territory well going in.  I did a lot of reading about research programs and clinical use to try to adapt successful protocols to my understanding and experience of the drug. I was very careful.As a general matter, if you want to self-medicate in this way, you've got to do a lot more research.  And for example, more research will help you determine if it's better to take a \"heroic\" dose or micro-dosing, given your particular situation.  But that being said, I would strongly advise against trying to do this on your own as a first-time user.  For someone with BP 2, I would call it dangerous.  You should either find a research trial or a therapist who has experience with psychedelics and is willing to work with you and the drug.  Unfortunately, I think most depression-focused research is being limited to unipolar depression, and if you have bipolar disease you are excluded from participation, period.  Furthermore, in some cases they will exclude you if you even have a close relative with bipolar, it's that ill-advised given the current understanding of using the drug for depression in a clinical context.  Take it slow!  LSD really had an amazing, positive impact on my life recently, so I really hope it becomes more and more available to people with mood disorders so they can share the impact.

You say you should only do it if you're in a stable mood, but depression is by definition a mood disorder.  My point is not that depressed people should avoid psychedelics as medicine, only that paradoxically, they are taking on some risk if they are depressed.  It is a risk, but may only be advisable at this point if mainstream approaches are not working.Based on my research, there is much less clinical evidence based on human trials related to using DMT for depression, and I think that matters as much as anecdotal reports, and perhaps more.  That doesn't mean it doesn't have a lot of potential, only that there is limited evidence.  Of course, research evidence may not matter to some people, and I could have missed human-based DMT/ayahuasca trails in my research.In contrast, there is considerable and increasing evidence for successful treatment of depression with LSD and psilocybin.  Being able to access the protocols used (dosage, set, setting) in successful studies can give you the option of adopting or adapting that same approach on your own.  Of course, if there's a research project near you, it's always better to do it in the clinical setting.  Or a therapist with experience with psychedelics as medicine.

But something changed when I got into my 40s, and especially since I entered my 50s and I'm not completely sure what triggered it.For one thing, having common cultural references has become really important for me.  There's a line in Steely Dan's song \"Hey 19\":*Hey, nineteen*  *That's 'Retha Franklin*  *She don't remember the Queen of Soul*Popular culture is really important to me, and if someone doesn't know Aretha Franklin, or for that matter Steely Dan, while it's not a deal breaker, something will be missing.

If Celine Dion is your favorite actress, we probably don't have much in common.The other thing is sexual attraction.  As I've gotten older, it's become more and more important to me to have partners who have a strong understanding of what pleases them, and the initiative and courage to communicate their needs.  This has become not just a mental thing in terms of choosing partners, it has impacted my physical desires.

I completely relate to 1) the frustration of having to wait for more info from healthcare providers, and 2) finding my mind ruminating on possible scenarios and outcomes.  Here is what I was taught by some wise and loving people and so I pass it along to you.When you're spiraling into dark thoughts, try to find your way back to the present moment.  It's not easy but it is so helpful if you can do it.  The present is where we actually live and breath and where reality resides.  When we're facing really dark, scary possibilities and scenarios, our mind moves out of the present moment and races into the future.  The future is a free-form reality that is often composed of our worst fears and anxieties in a situation like this, and so our minds will  tend to focus in on those worst possibilities.  Positive outcomes get aggressively pushed to the sidelines.  And anyone's thoughts are inevitably going to go toward those dark places - it's not just you.  When it happens, try to become aware that it is happening, and try to take a deep breath, and pull yourself back into the present moment, and let the frightening thoughts that have nothing to do with the present moment drift away and dissolve.  Being able to do this well takes practice, in some ways it takes a life time, but now is the time to start practicing.  I'm not very good at explaining this practice so if I've said confusing things, please let me clarify.I hope the next week goes fast and you get answers fast, and that whatever is going on is easily treatable!", "link_id": "t3_eow5q8", "time": 1579058322}}

{"feaa2oa": {"text": "Thanks for sharing the article.  A few years ago I had a life-threatening respiratory illness and I researched the clinical management of my disease like my life depended on it, which of course it did.  I did home measures of my lung function and used Excel to graph the results.  I researched my meds, especially contraindications, interactions and side-effects.  I pretty much went to medical school.  My self-education and self-advocacy probably saved my life.But I'm a technologist who did about 5 years of graduate school in subjects unrelated to medicine.  I had considerable advantages in my ability to research and self-teach, my ability to use technology, and my capacity to \"talk doctor talk\" assertively to be my own advocate.  Many people, perhaps even most people do not have our ability to do the kind of deep research you're talking about. This puts many people at a huge disadvantage when trying to be their own advocates.  My other point is simply to say, and I think you'll agree, that the issue of OTC drugs applies equally well to \"natural\" remedies.  Many people who use them make the misguided assumption that because they are natural they are safe, in particular in terms of interactions.  The fact is that any drug that is efficacious, and many natural remedies are, is impactful on the body in a way that can lead to dangerous interactions with other remedies, OTC and pharmaceuticals.", "link_id": "t3_eo8xpm", "time": 1578946151}}

Once a paradigm is in place, we start to see the thing defined within the paradigm all over the place.There are similar questions regarding the incidence of autism spectrum disorder, which has seen a massive increase in cases in the recent era.  Is that because we are more attentive to it, or is, for example environmental causes?There is profound diversity in mood patterns that \"bipolar\" and \"bipolar 2\" capture only in the most general way.

Things went off the rails for unrelated reasons before we got to that point so I never had direct experience of what she meant.

{"fdqhy95": {"text": "Thanks for the thoughtful response.  Thanks for challenging some of my comments.You suggest a small penis is \"objectively less attractive and desired\".  Attractiveness is by definition a subjective thing.  For example, if you look at the history of painting, the idealized view of women is to have way more weight on their body compared to the ideal today.  It's not aesthetics - it was actual sexual attractiveness.  Another example is Michelangelo's sculpture \"David\" - call up a picture of him and he has a really small penis.  This is true in both renaissance and Ancient Greek art - you can find examples with even smaller penises than David's.  Aesthetic and sexual perceptions of penis size are culturally-based.You also say it's emasculating to have your genitals deemed worthless by society.  I struggle with that myself.  My size is okay when I'm aroused but when I'm flaccid I'm pretty dinky - and if I'm at all chilled, it's totally like a turtle with his head pulled in.  I've been in situations where friends went skinny dipping or went into a hot tub naked and for me it was like, no fucking way.  I'm still pretty much that way, unless I'm with someone I really trust, but more and more I'm getting to (or trying to get to) a \"who the fuck cares\" point.  Part of it is that I've grown more comfortable not always having to seem super-virile and masculine - to me that's a really toxic expectation.  Real poison.  In terms of mocking men's penis size, while I think that might happen in some segments of the mass media, I'm wondering what sub-culture you're living in where people are actually acting and speaking that way  I may be living in a very different situation geographically/culturally and generation-wise, but it's just about inconceivable that anyone I know would mock someone that way, or make any comment suggesting that men with larger penis are more manly.  I'd like to better understand why you think it's belittling to suggest to the OP that finding partners who are not that interested in penetrative sex is a path to coping with a small penis.  There's so many ways to be sexual, and I don't think one should close the door on possibilities that might be satisfying.

Of course, they end up hurting them anyway by ghosting them.To do this kind of thing when it is a not a romantic relationship, but instead a new friendship, is unconscionable and low.

That's going to give the safety and structure that is most likely to yield the results you seek.  But of course, that might not be an option where you live.If you decide you want to self-medicate with psychedelics, I would encourage you to do a shit load of research, including online guides, anecdotal trip reports (in terms of people seeking mental health results), and perhaps most valuable, look at the treatment protocol of research projects or clinical work that seems to be yielding results, and consider approaches that best match your resources, needs and symptoms.There are many things that will promote a safe experience and good outcome, but I personally think none more than carefully creating the right setting and having a sober and experienced sitter.I hope that's helpful.", "link_id": "t3_ekv6xa", "time": 1578331799}}

{"fddwusu": {"text": "You're such a good friend to come here and ask your questions in such an open and receptive way.  You show real deep kindness in what you are doing.  True friendship.I wish there were simple answers in this type of situation.  If you're going to continue down the road of supporting your friend this way, I hope you have good support and that you're attentive to your own needs and boundaries.  It can be exhausting trying to get someone on the path to healing, and especially so if there is the risk of suicide.  You cannot help in a sustained way if you don't practice self-care.There's only so much friends can do.  It sounds like she is already seeing a therapist, and that seems like that might be the best leverage point to increase the degree of intervention.  Do you have a sense of why she refuses to open up with her therapist?  Does she like and trust them?You sound extremely smart and compassionate, and probably know the things I'm about to say, but I'll put them out there.  I apologize if they are kind of vague, or obvious.  These are the things that I know from my life experience, but I have to learn them over and over again - they are an ongoing practice.Listen to her.  Great listening is a learned skill, so cultivate that - Google \"listening\" or \"listening well\" to get tips.  It's really powerful if, when she stops speaking, you allow a few seconds of silence and see if she starts talking some more - that is when people sometimes really start talking about their deepest feelings.  Sometimes if you keep doing it, they'll just keep going.  Of course, don't do it to the point of making her uncomfortable.Be fully present to her.  Again, sorry, you no doubt already know this, but it's helpful to be really mindful of it.  I'm a total multitasker.  It's hard for me to be with someone and not thinking about what I'm doing with the rest of the day, or what my problems are, or what I'm going to say next.  My mind drifts.  Being present is about bring 100% of your self to the moment.  People really really sense it when you're all there.  They feel seen.Avoid trying to fix too much.  For many of us, we have a really strong impulse to fix things for the people we love.  That becomes such a powerful impulse when suicide is involved.  Some people get panicky.  It is great and impressive that you clearly are obviously not panicking, and being smart and wise about the whole situation.  Be gentle with your suggestions to her on practical steps to correct her situation.  I'm not saying don't offer her practical advice, but find a way to do it when it's going to be heard and be the most impactful.  It's a balancing act.Reach out.  Without being so invasive that she pulls back, be proactive about touching base, rather than waiting for her, with texts or phone calls.  Try to maintain that connection as much as possible so she doesn't pull into her shell.  I've gone through periods of intense suicidal thinking in my life and every time I've isolated myself socially (out of anger, out of not thinking people really cared about me) and that makes things so much worse and dangerous.Touch her.  If she accepts touch, give it as much as you are comfortable with and she is comfortable with.  Hold her hand.  Touch her arm.  Put your arm around her shoulder.  Give her hugs.  Touch is such a powerful way that we are connected to our friends and to the community we dwell in - in some ways, it can tie us to this world like an anchor, making it harder to exit.  Myself, because of my childhood history with not being touched, I can feel awkward about receiving it (especially from men - I'm a guy), so it takes intuition and sensitivity and communication to offer touch well so it can be received.Love her.  In the course of our (hopefully) long lives, we all (hopefully) develop more and better ways to show and practice love.  It's not easy to do love, because we have our own insecurities about it (e.g. will someone push us away) and maybe we haven't been loved ourselves all that much.  Supporting this friend is a huge act of kindness on your part, and each time we take something like that on, it becomes an opportunity to figure out how to love more and better.  I guess this is kind of a vague point I'm making (I mean, what does being \"loving\" look like?) but I suspect you know what I mean.  The practice of love is something you can be doing for yourself as much as her, and that's not a selfish thing.  I didn't mean to go on so long.  I really hope at least some of this was helpful.  I wish you, and her, the best.", "link_id": "t3_ekr9h1", "time": 1578325932}}

If you're mood is well-managed, you should be very careful and weary about fucking with that.  You are definitely taking a risk.I've not seen any anecdotal reports of problems with Lamictal and psychedelics, and I've read things by people who know a bit about biology and chemistry, and don't see any interactions.

There's no quick fix but implementing an actionable, practical plan now will make you feel a whole lot better.Boy, do I have some regrets myself.  I'm squandered large amounts of money in my life.  Coping with regret, financial or otherwise, is something we all inevitably need to cope with.  I try to focus on the fact that I cannot control or change the past, and to focus on what I can do today while planning for tomorrow.On a practical level, there are tons of online communities dedicated to mutual support and advice around personal finance.  It's so helpful to be in touch with people who are also trying to work themselves out of a financial pickle - otherwise it can feel very lonely, like you're the only one with serious issues.  Lately I've been interested in FIRE: Financial Independence / Retire Early.  It is a theory and sub-culture that involves a specific financial planning approach, along with radical frugality to help get you to your financial goals.  There's a new documentary on Amazon that tells the story of a family that tries to change their spending habits in a dramatic way.I know it's hard to spend money to get out of debt, but talking to a moderately priced financial advisor or credit counselor can be helpful, particularly if you can get a personal reference to one who is competent and trustworthy.It certainly isn't a short-cut to financial well-being, but depending on just how much in the hole you are, take a look at bankruptcy.  It's a pretty extreme solution but it makes sense in some situations.I've had some really serious ups and downs financial in my life.  I'm middle-aged now, and I have come to believe that as difficult as things may get, the \"universe\" will ultimately take care of me, because each time I've been on the \"brink\", something good has come along.  This is kind of mystical idea, and though I believe it on some level, I also take it with a little grain of thought.  The key is that it comforts me when I need it.Also on more of a mystical level, I tried to believe in my heart of hearts that underlying this reality is abundance rather than scarcity.  When I've gotten to difficult place financially, I start to view the world in terms of limit resources, of scarcity.  Viewing things in terms of scarcity is not helpful.

I had a series of trips where I perceived that what we know as reality is actually a simulation.  Sort of like the holodeck on Star Trek.  In this perception, the whole experience is structured so that we can't tell we're in a \"simulation\", and so after all, what difference does it make if it is a simulation.  For all intents and purposes, it is \"real\" in all the ways that matter.  When we die, we re-awake to the fact that we were in a simulation, like getting killed in a VR game.  A part of this perception is that there is an intelligence behind the simulation - not \"God\" in any traditional sense, but rather an intelligence that is not different from us, but simply more advanced.  After all, our technology is rapidly moving toward being able to produce simulations indistinguishable from reality, and with computing power that could simulate an entire universe.  In fact, someday when we create a similar simulation, we will be creating a universe nested within a universe.

If you have more significant amounts of cash, it helps to move some of the money into less liquid forms of investment, for example stocks/bonds, or even better, buying real estate, so you don't have easy access to it.

Porn is complicated in terms of how it can really re-shape people's sexuality in unrealistic ways, but it can also be an experience that is freeing and enriching for some people - there's lots of different kind of porn, including some that are intended for women, and represent sex in a very different way.

There are philosophic/spiritual components to Buddhism, but the important thing for us is that it involves practical actions to cope with the deep, painful challenges (such as grief, depression, loss, etc.) that all of us face.  These include mainly mindfulness and mediation, which are practices that are have a significant amount of clinical and research evidence to support their benefits (if that kind of scientific evidence is important to you).  And some choose to utilize those practices outside of the context of spirituality, which is great too.  You might also investigate as well within Buddhism the concept of sangha, which is exactly the kind of community that you're referring to.  Sangha is based on the idea is that suffering is common to all of us, and that very commonality can be the basis for deep empathy, shared understanding, and mutual support.So, open your mind and heart a bit and understand that there are many ways to understand our situation, to use practical ways of coping, and to practice love and compassion with one another.

After 6 years of being on a relatively low dose of Abilify (I think 5 mg), originally prescribed for steroid-induced aggression, a nurse practitioner recommended an increase to 10 mg to address a persistent episode of depression.  It triggered a tremor in one of my lower arms.  I reported it to the NP and we dropped the dosage back down to 5 mg.  Unfortunately, the tremor persisted and worsened - I became very concerned it was tardive dyskinesia.  I was not on the Abilify for my bipolar, so it wasn't a big deal to stop it - indeed, it should have been stopped long before.  I  saw a neurologist and he diagnosed the tremor as a parkinsonism (not Parkinsons disease).  Having discontinued the Abilify, he expected it to clear within 6 months.  It has cleared about 99% now after 4 months.  Discontinuing the Abilify was hellish.  So Parkinsonism is an additional movement disorder side-effect of Abilify (and in some cases can \"unmask\" underlining Parkinsons Disease).", "link_id": "t3_e9d4tk", "time": 1576101812}}
