When I hit high school I thought everyone felt like I did, thought like I did. That I was just weaker than everyone else in dealing with it. Thought my depressions and such were just isolation from feeling ugly and being terribly socially awkward. Thought the highs I got were normal. Did a lot of drinking in school with friends, and even that was bipolar. Sometimes I was an incredibly sad drunk, sometimes it gave me the confidence to actually talk to people.I've always had a fairly strong streak of self control due to terror of being embarrassed. Never even considered that I had manic episodes, always thought that these things were just normal.Came as a shock when I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. Thought I just had depression due to external sources and such. Actually just went to psychologists for the depression and when I finally found a good one, they sent me to a psychiatrist and I got a joint diagnosis from them. It's still weird to think that this isn't just normal, that I'm pretty much chemically different from most people.It's a little lonely.", "link_id": "t3_gu2gj4", "time": 1590954286}}
