Only speak if it will benefit one of the participants (even if its some stupid joke, if it will make the person laugh then it's beneficial).After adopting this method of communication work has been incredible.

{"f9c3evc": {"text": "I am a new nurse living alone and I love it. Here is a random list of advice:1. Constantly look for ways to improve your situation. When I first got into my apartment I had misgivings. I worried that it wasn't a good location or that the room was cramped etc etc. But I decided I would improve the shit out of my apartment until it was the best apartment ever. Now I have smart lights so I can control everything from my couch, its immaculately decorated, perfectly arranged. I absolutely love my apartment now. I achieved this by constantly thinking of ways to improve things big or small, and doing them.2. Living alone means that if you don't make plans you sit and stew. So you must proactively make plans on any day you have free. Even if its just getting coffee with someone and catching up for an hour. Doing this eliminates lonliness and allows you to build an active social life. My social life is better now than it ever was for this reason. 3. Get out of the house. I'm in online school for my BSN, so I like to go to the library and study. But I did this even before I was in my program. Having places to go outside of your house is a great way to eliminate stir craziness and break your mind out of ruminating circles which seem to crop up when you stare at the same 4 walls for hours on end.4. Go outside. This is a sure fire way to feel better about everything. Life is a fascinating mystery and nothing solidifies that more than by looking at trees.5. As for work, I found that the most stressful time was a month or two ago when I was considering leaving the hospital and becoming a home health nurse. I was stressed out and couldn't stop thinking about how the hospital wasn't right for me. But then something came over me and I said \"you know what, I'm not going to be a home health nurse- I'm going to be a badass ICU nurse\". Once I set my sights on a future in the hospital everything fell into place. After that every struggle became a stepping stone towards my future badass ICU nurse self, instead of a reminder of how the hospital \"wasn't a good fit for me\".6. Finally you must, must, MUST get good nutrition: eat lots of vegetables with every meal, avoid sugar and alcohol (FUCK alcohol), get lots of sleep consistently every night and EXERCISE. If you do nothing else in this list, do this. If your body isn't happy you aren't happy.", "link_id": "t3_e4ipol", "time": 1575218927}}

The self efficacy turning my life around and graduating nursing school gave me made me want to choose something great, because I knew I could achieve it. But maybe I need to embrace this quiet period of life and just focus on being a great nurse. Thanks again!", "link_id": "t3_e136zn", "time": 1574657508}}

In order to do this I would add 0.99999999 to a value. I would then compare the first digit of the input to the first digit of the output of that sum. If the first digits are the same then it is whole because if the number had any decimal places (like 3.3333) the first number would jump up to the next whole number after the addition of 0.9999 (e.g. 3.3333+0.99999=4.22222...3 does not equal 4... therefor not whole!).This allowed me to complete the prime number detector.Heres a link that lets you make a copy of the detector, enjoy!

Number 1 thing is TAKE YOUR MEDS. Also don't over medicate. I'm on lamictal alone and I'm doin fineNumber 2. TAKE EMMACULATE CARE OF YOUR BODY/HEALTH. This is non negotiable. For nutrition: Eat tons of vegetables with every meal in addition to whatever carb, protein, fat you want (eat McDonald's as long as you've got a big pile of brocolli taking up half your plate). NO SUGAR. NO ALCOHOL. 8 hours of sleep every night at the same time. If you fail to follow these steps you're gonna have a bad time. If you do follow them youre life will be AWESOME. Number 3. JOURNAL your thoughts, feelings, desires and goals. It's like your brain on steroids. This way you can write down ideas and not have to hold them all in your head like a crazy idea juggler, dropping ideas all over the place.Number 4. Don't give a FUCK about interpersonal issues. People are infinitely complex and spending time trying to figure them out is a complete and utter waste of timeNumber 5. Be fascinated with reality. No one knows why anything really exists. What the fuck is an atom? It's amazing. Go outside and revel in this.Number 6. Be a person of value. Help others. If you're ever sitting around not sure what to do, do something to help someone else and suddenly your life has meaningNumber 7. Constantly do things that will help you out in the future, no matter how small. Pick up that tissue from the middle of the floor. Take out the trash. All these little things add up BIG TIMEBy following this I've been able to completely turn my life around. Im 5 months away from getting my registered nurse liscense, my relationships are amazing and life is awesome right now when before I got on meds I was a loser who smelled like cigarettes and was generally a pain in the ass to be around.That's it.

Just go in with the mindset \"I'm gonna do my thing and not give a fuck what anyone says or does\", it really works and people pick up on it and relax around you a bit more.

If youre the person thats always crying for help and not say, offering a shoulder to cry on or making someones life EASIER, as opposed to harder than that person is going to avoid you a bit more.At any given moment ask yourself if what your doing is helping you move in a positive direction. Say youre sitting on your couch feeling kind of depressed and useless: get up and fold your laundry, do some kegels, clean your glasses. Do ANYTHING that will improve your circumstances no matter how small.Dont be a pussy about reaching out to people you love. You know that relative who youve had a falling out with who you suspect hates you? They think YOU hate them just as much. Say hi to them on facebook. That little voice in your head telling you not to brighten someone elses day is not someone you should listen to.But first and formost, take care of your body and your mind will follow. Once youve achieved that very accomplishable goal you can start making a positive difference in other people's lives and find real happiness", "link_id": "t3_6j015w", "time": 1498237526}}

That kind of thinking is a recipe for a you-centric world view and is a very lonely road. Focus instead on the role you play in the stories of others. When I was young, there was an old man named Brady at our church who always had gum. No matter what, Brady always had gum that he offered up freely. When he died, it devastated our youth group and I still remember him two decades later. Brady might have only played a bit role in all our life stories, but by playing it with generosity and kindness he achieved a sort of immortality. Putting others first with a cheerful heart isn\u2019t easy, but because of that, even the smallest acts can leave an incalculable impact.\" -justin mcelroy", "link_id": "t3_6gjrw4", "time": 1497199594}}

After that year I had delusions that I was being tracked by the fbi and I couldnt trust anyone, fell into a dark pit of absolute dispair yadda yadda. Basically the 4 years after my psych ward visit were pure hell. I dont recommend this. What sucks is that everyone around you treats you like a dumbass for being weird and unproductive during this time even though youre going through a nightmare rollercoaster from hellAnyway finally I got on meds this past march and my life has done a complete 180. I quit smoking, patched up countless relationships, I workout every day. I'm going to school for nursing now which is awesome.

Whats helped me is: -living with my parents (sorry, just have to say this upfront haha) -having a stable job with consistent hours every week-eating roughly the same healthy stuff every day. I start with peanutbutter toast, an egg and carrots. Eat a salad from mcdonalds for lunch. Dinner is microwave mac and cheese/brocolli and carrots. Late night snack is microwave burrito thing (better than it sounds) and carrots. Basically eat lots of carrots and have consistency in your diet-working out 2/3 days. This makes the most noticeable difference. Its amazing how good you feel after getting a burst of electrolytes. You also start to develope muscles after doing the same thing over and over for months, which feels awesome. What I do is set a 15 minute timer and do jumping jacks, squats with dumbells and ab work for the entire time while listening to the most ignorant gangster rap possible, its awesome. I also do yoga and heavier weights all indoors. Exercise also makes a huge difference in sleep quality so skipping out on this is the same as skipping out on good sleep.-meds. I take lamictal 150mg and it turned my life around. If you dont take meds, start. Dont be one of those people that takes 20 different meds. -sleep. Is paramount. Never ever fuck with sleep. If you live with people that dont respect your sleep, bitchslap them.-one thing that really helped is I got so fed up with people treating me like shit that I snapped, and now I dont give a single fuck what people think about me.
