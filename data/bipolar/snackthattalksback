My abuser definitely believed they were showing me love, because that\u2019s the way they were shown love. It took me 27 years to realize that that isn\u2019t what love is and finally cut them out. I was very close to my abuser, to the point that I believe that I had Stockholm syndrome with them. I was obviously groomed very successfully. So I really connected with Charlie repeatedly saying that his aunt was his favorite person in the world. And I also think it\u2019s a good example for people who haven\u2019t been abused to see that play out. He always says he loves her and she was his favorite, and then to find out at the end that she hurt him in a heinous way. People think that ever child who is abused runs away from their abuser and can\u2019t stand them, and while thats the case for some children, it\u2019s definitely not the case for all abused children. The latter are groomed to perfection. Those of us who grow into adults that seek out abuse and believe it\u2019s love are prime examples of this. We equate abuse with love because that\u2019s how we were taught to love. I am a huge fan of the book and was so excited when it got turned into the movie. I will say the movie triggered me more than I thought it would. I guess it was harder to see it rather than just imagining it when I read the words, of that makes sense. I just bawled in the theater. It took me quite a few times of watching it to not cry. Sometimes I still tear up or sometimes I just get chills from it but I\u2019m very fond of the movie.

He is always by my side and gives me cuddles all day long and he literally licks my tears away. He\u2019s the best thing to ever happen to me. I always joked that I have too many emotional issues for one dog to handle so I needed to get him his own ESA. So I got another dog, and I kid you not- that\u2019s what she is for him! He has some anxiety himself (my mom says my anxiety rubs off on him haha) and my other dog makes him feel so much better, they cuddle and play together and it warms my heart so much watching them play.

{"fmv8zfl": {"text": "TW: slight suicide mention, abuseIt has been 16 years since my (f33) diagnosis and it took me literally 13 and a half years to get to the point that I\u2019m at today. For me, it\u2019s finding the correct medication, I\u2019m in outpatient therapy now with a therapist that I love, but previously I\u2019ve been to 5 psych hospitals, a crisis house and a treatment center (for my eating disorder). I\u2019ve got an amazing support system that has always gone out of their way to educating themselves about bipolar and my other disorders, and I finally found a career that I not only love, but am very very good at (I work with dogs!). I have an emotional support dog and if it weren\u2019t for him, I wouldn\u2019t be here to write this. I genuinely believe with my whole heart that animals have healing powers. For me, it\u2019s dogs, but all animals have the capacity to love you unconditionally and expect nothing in return. A lady in Florida has an emotional support alligator! For me, I\u2019m at my best when I\u2019m most productive so currently that\u2019s keeping myself busy with growing my dog business and running it, and having an active social life. On that note, I was in a good place during my senior year of college (but not nearly as great of a place as I am now, just better than the other times) but I also took over 50 hours, worked full time and was flying across the country for job interviews. So I was able to be productive and graduate. My mom used to have to beg me to go out with my friends and so once I started to get better I really worked on building a social circle. I host a trivia night once a month but was asked to start hosting two a month, and I try to get together with my friends at least once every other week. Again, my friends and mom and brother are  incredibly supportive and I do not keep toxic people in my life. I also had to put forth a ton of effort into being kind and forgiving of myself, and it took a LOT of de-programming my brain with that one. It was just beat into my head that because I did shower and my house was constantly a wreck and I slept past noon and couldn\u2019t keep a job for longer than 3 months, that I was just a gigantic horrible person. So I really had to learn and constantly remind myself that these behaviors were caused by my mental illnesses and weren\u2019t these inherent flaws of mine that made me a worthless and wretched human being. I do want to point out that everyone\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d looks different. For me it\u2019s when I\u2019m taking good care of myself (showering every other day, basic upkeep of my house, going to therapy), taking care of my dogs and other relationships while keeping healthy boundaries, starting and completing craft projects, taking my business seriously and doing everything I can to make it into a career etc. I still have bad days because I\u2019m human like everyone else, but in my case, \u201csuccessful\u201d is when a bad day is just a bad day, it doesn\u2019t snowball into a bad week or a bad month. So successful for someone else might be staying well enough to not end up in the hospital while also knowing when you need to go in, or finishing a big project like school or building something that requires a serious amount of focus or holding down a paying job or volunteer job for a certain amount of time, or asking for help when you need it. At the end of the day, everyone learns to cope and manage on their own time. It took me longer than some to become \u201csuccessful\u201d because 6 years ago I learned about childhood abuse that I had repressed in my memories, so that sparked a handful of other mental illnesses and bounced around from hospital to hospital during this period, and I was on the wrong medication so that set me back basically to square 1.", "link_id": "t3_fxkdaw", "time": 1586409362}}

I\u2019ve been on Geodon and Lamictal for 14 years now. I was in an incredibly dark place when I was 27 and I got pumped full of a bunch of other meds (while still being on the Geodon and Lamictal) which I think might have made me worse because when I lost my insurance two and a half years ago and couldn\u2019t afford all of the medications, I dropped back down to the Geodon and Lamictal and have been the best I\u2019ve ever been. Finding the correct medication or combination of meds takes time. If you really trust your psychiatrist, try to be patient. New psychiatric meds take anywhere from 3-6 weeks to notice if there\u2019s a difference, and it can take longer if you try a combination of meds. It might help to keep a journal with your new meds, monitor everything, even if it seems small, both physical and mood changes, to make sure you\u2019re tracking everything right. If you\u2019re not noticing an improvement, you\u2019re just not on the right meds.
