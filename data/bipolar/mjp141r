My life has run the gamut from running from shootouts in the hood to the Ivy League, six figures, married in the suburbs, domestic violence and right on down to welfare. What further complicate things, as Black people in America, many of us don\u2019t have the safety nets that are afforded to other races who have more generational wealth and/or opportunities for socioeconomic mobility. For example, how many addicts from wealth families get access to expensive, high-quality rehabs, time after time? How many times do those same families pay all their bills until they get back on their feet?A lot of black people in America can get rich, not necessarily wealth. Hell, I was rich. So many of us are only a few paychecks away from devastation, as we\u2019re learning now. Everything for me was all good until I got sick, married an abuser and then got divorced just as I was starting in nursing school. That was the umpteenth time of me rebuilding my life after being sick. I had no wealthy parents to help me get my life back on track. I couldn\u2019t really afford to stop working, but I was barely functioning. Not to mention that\u2019s there\u2019s a huge stigma in our community against getting government help. Had I known it, I would have applied for disability a LONG time ago, before my life spiraled and I got sicker. I stayed in a abusive marriage for WAY too long, because I needed health insurance. Also, our community\u2019s victim-blaming attitudes toward victims of domestic violence makes it really hard to reach out for help.I judge someone\u2019s character.

The first thing you\u2019re gonna do is acknowledge that you\u2019re asking for help and (hopefully) not saving this until the rest last minute. I know breaking things down into manageable pieces is rough, but here goes:1) Make a list of everything needed for your application and put the final due date on top. 2) Get a calendar out and assign due dates to everything on the list. 3) If your brain starts bouncing around and thinking about how you\u2019re going to get everything together, that\u2019s very natural for us, just get a notepad and write down all your questions as they come but don\u2019t go to the internet to look them up right away-this will take you away from the current task. 4) After you put due dates next to each item, then you decide who is involved in each item. If you need a recommendation, write down the professors name. If you need a transcript, write down registrar, etc. Once you\u2019re done doing this, write and separate list for everything that involves you only\u2014because you have the most time to work on the tasks that you control. Always give the tasks that involve others a couple of more days as a cushion. 5) After that, look at the lists and determine which to start first. - You could reach out to your professors, first and then be working on your essay at the same time. -What I\u2019m trying to say is that certain tasks don\u2019t depend on each other. They can be done simultaneously.6) Then when you\u2019re ready to work on a task, just do a few bullet points on what you think you\u2019ll need and start right away. The hardest part for me is starting a task. So I like to \u201ctrick\u201d myself by saying I\u2019m only gonna work on it for 5 minutes and if it\u2019s too overwhelming, I\u2019ll stop. Usually after the five minutes, I\u2019m totally hyper-focused. Lol. If after five minutes, I\u2019m still blocked, I probably tried to start with too big of a piece. I go back to the task and make the pieces even smaller. On really bad days I\u2019ve had ridiculously small pieces like, print out worksheet, do first 5 problems, do next five problems, etc. Lol.

Please don\u2019t try to do this all at once, as it\u2019s not safe. However, if you can only get one thing, get Kristen Neff\u2019s book. Start there. I\u2019ve been going to therapy since my teens.

In some colleges they would rather push out students who they view as a potential liability than help this student function better and be successful at school. Enter the office of disability services. Once you\u2019re registered with them, you get formally protected by the federal law known as the Americans with Disabilities Act. That makes it illegal for your professors to fail you or your college deans to do any funny business with you as a student. Plus, even if you never use the accommodations, they are still there for you. You don\u2019t have to be registered anywhere else, but you do need a diagnosis. More than likely if you\u2019re being treated anywhere and you have meds, you already have a diagnosis.

This is for the PTSD nightmares I started to have after I moved back in with my mother. What I like about my combination is that Effexor and Trileptal are both the best meds to deal with my depression and hypomania, respectively. If I\u2019m ever having problems with depression and/or hypomania, I can adjust either or both to help me remain stable. Also, Trileptal has been a dream drug for me. Not only does it help me fall asleep each night, it helps big time with my anxiety and slows down my system overall. Once I\u2019m in a more positive and stable environment, I\u2019ll be able to stop taking my migraine and fibromyalgia meds again because Trileptal can help me manage those when I\u2019m under normal amounts of stress. Also, since I\u2019ve seen how well I can do with these meds while I\u2019m only mildly to moderately stressed, I know I won\u2019t need to stay on these high dosages for long. P.S.

Before, when I was wasn\u2019t stable, I didn\u2019t know how I was gonna feel the next day or the next week. Hope that makes sense. If you\u2019re feeling better, you\u2019re feeling better.

Is it a nagging feeling of inadequacy? Not saying this is your reason, but if the case, it might be more beneficial to address that directly. Also, in our culture, we have a tendency to try to \u201cfix\u201d what\u2019s wrong instead of trying to improve on what\u2019s going well. What are some of your strengths? How can you use them to help you achieve your goals? In medicine, there\u2019s a concept called salutogenesis that focuses on the factors that support human health and well-being, rather than on factors that cause disease (pathogenesis) or what\u2019s going wrong in our bodies. I like to approach self-development in that way.If you keep looking at how to fix yourself, you will keep finding things you can do better because you\u2019re not a machine. You\u2019re a person. What are you doing to support yourself in this journey of self-development? Is your goal to be more productive? Productivity can be a deadly trap because it\u2019s really hard to tell when enough is truly enough. There\u2019s always more to be done better, simpler, faster. Do you have too many things on your to-do list? These are some of the questions you can ask yourself? Finally, are you familiar with the concept of self-compassion?

This is the case of most people with bipolar. However, the lil extra dopamine is what might make things tricky for you in terms of treatment. Also, medications, even in the same class, all work differently - so it can be hard nailing down a med cocktail right away. For example, I also cried non-stop on Lamictal. It\u2019s an anticonvulsant, like Valium and Trileptal but it\u2019s in the Triazine family. My particular brain chemistry responds best with Carboxamides like Tegretol and Trileptal.

This is just coming experience and a little knowledge about how some of these drugs.  In essence, it doesn\u2019t seem like your current combination makes any sense to me.

Also, there are certain boundaries I establish with any new physician I have: - Don\u2019t fuck with my current cocktail unless it\u2019s to adjust dosages. - Under no circumstances will I take an antipsychotic medication if I\u2019m not psychotic. - No benzodiazepines. - Finally, I need my Ritalin because ADHD is no less destructive than Bipolar. Removing it permanently is NOT an option. If they try to cross these boundaries, I tell them that they may put my life in danger and then I ask them if they\u2019re comfortable with doing that? If so, are they willing to put that in writing on my chart? Most of them listen to me after that. I didn\u2019t start off this hardcore, but my time has been wasted by many doctors who were phoning it in or just throwing whatever on the wall to see what sticks. I found out the hard way that a lot of doctors have NO idea what the core difference is between Bipolar 1 and 2 - nor do they know how to effectively treat Bipolar 2. So, I learned a lot about medications by reading about mood stabilizers on Wikipedia. (I will insert the link below.)

After yelling at me or others she seems to feel a lot better. This is a thing some BPD moms do to feel better, put you down, control you, etc. It has multiple purposes. My ears are super sensitive to loud noises and my uBPD mom uses yelling as a form of control. If she wants me to do something I don\u2019t want to do, there\u2019s a threat looming that she may yell and have a meltdown. I then have to choose between my self-respect and her meltdown. I used to choose her meltdown as the default. But more and more, I\u2019m letting her have a meltdown and I just put my headphones on while she does her thing. Or I\u2019ll just calmly leave. The most important part is not showing ANY emotional reaction on my face. Also, if I\u2019ve been triggered into a fight. I just loudly tell my mom that I\u2019m not changing my mind\u2014no matter how much she yells\u2014that\u2019s like the magic antidote. She calms down in seconds after that. Anyway, the situation is really nuts. I suggest that you always have an out or exit path. Now, this can get tricky when someone just bursts into your bedroom and starts screaming. I\u2019ve trained my mom to knock as she enters. I\u2019ve also done the following, which is adapted from the gray rock method:Put my headphones on Give one word answersStay engaged in my phoneTurn my backLock my door. (This one is tricky because she had a WW3 meltdown about that.) I\u2019ve also used noise desensitization therapy. It\u2019s available for free on YouTube.

For example, I\u2019m actually a very strong advocate for take medication for mental health if one really NEEDS it. I\u2019m a about to step on soapbox, so please bear with me. This is still very, very stigmatized within the black community. However, I had to break to to people that we take medication ALL the time for things. There is no need to struggle endlessly for years on end when you could actually safely take a medication that will help get you back on track within a year. Not all medications or taken for life. So black people say they don\u2019t want to be dependent on psych medications. But I don\u2019t see how safely take a medication (with supervision) is any worse than self-medicating with addictions to alcohol, drugs, food, shopping, gambling, or love, etc. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0fNot to mention that the right medication can save someone\u2019s life.

I\u2019m doing a lot better. Since my success has mainly been internal, it doesn\u2019t look like traditional success.

If I don\u2019t get into my top choice Master\u2019s Program, the world is not over. If I don\u2019t find a mate this year, I can still create a family. Things will be okay.

Also, my mother is currently having an adult temper tantrum right next to me and I\u2019m pretty much unbothered. Lol.

I\u2019m not gonna lie it really used to upset me because I have a very good memory. Also, the medication makes it hard for me to cool down. I get hot really easily, but then I can\u2019t cool down without a fan or AC. I have plenty of workarounds for that, too. For me, my peace of mind is totally worth it.

But first, let\u2019s talk about your emotional state. Women with ADHD (especially smart ones) often fall through the cracks because our symptoms tend to be more internalized than men\u2019s. So we often get diagnosed way later. If you get As and Bs in school, just fucking forget it. Everyone just lets you struggle like a fish gashing for a drop of water while you\u2019re slowing dying. Everyone assumes a moral position that you\u2019re lazy and disorganized. Ugh...fuck them.

I have a cousin with it who is an amazing pediatrician. I\u2019m going back to school to become a doctor in my early 40s. Now, in terms of school. The first thing you need to do is find a good psychiatrist to help you through this. One who understands the relationship between ADHD, depression and anxiety. Next, get ALLLLLL of the diagnoses you qualify for. Then, go to the office of disability services in your college and register with them so that you can get your reasonable accommodations. Ask them if your school has a retroactive policy about poor grades, etc. They may not, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask. Follow all of their instructions and get registered. Next, semester tell all of your professors/TAs from jump that your registered or in the process of registering and let them know the deal. Ask if them for feedback guidance, whatever. You just want to be proactive AF. You won\u2019t need to do this every semester but you may need extra support during your first rebound semester because failing is traumatic AF. Get some good resources for managing ADHD. I have tons. Learn all that you can about how you function. Get a fucking planner and use it. Hit me up in the DM/chat. Get familiar with the concept of patience and self-compassion. I gotchu with those resources, too. Most of all, you\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re not lazy, stupid, irresponsible or spoiled.

One the other hand, there is a lot of inner turmoil with quiet borderline. A lot of it and a lot of difficulty regulating emotions and responses. Another name for BPD is Emotional Dysregulation Disorder. From Wikipedia, emotional self-regulation or emotion regulation is the ability to respond to the ongoing demands of experience with the range of emotions in a manner that is socially tolerable and sufficiently flexible to permit spontaneous reactions as well as the ability to delay spontaneous reactions as needed. Meaning if can not regulate your emotions, you react to things very easily and can go to extremes (i.e., lots of crying, catastrophizing, suicidal thoughts, etc.)It\u2019s really important to share all of your feelings with your treatment professionals so that they can get a clear picture of what\u2019s going on and give you the most accurate diagnosis possible.

Also, depending on the medication, learning how it works tells me what\u2019s doing on in my body (e,g., do I need more dopamine, is my central nervous overactive, etc.). Based on these findings I can see if how my physical health may be connected to my moods. When I was using more of a naturopathic approach, I didn\u2019t have that type of data, nor the flexibility that comes with it. In terms of the mood shifting, there are a few things that can contribute to it. What can help is tracking your moods and searching out triggers. Also, tracking the length and quality of your sleep can do wonders. A food diary can also give you a ton of information, as well.

I want to be treated like I\u2019m able but just treated with kindness and compassion\u2014not kid gloves, you know? Now, to address your questions:1) It is absolutely okay to turn down medications and ask for options. Always ask doctors about their rationale for choosing the medication. Be sure to ask for the class of drug (i.e., antidepressant, antipsychotic, etc.). For example, if you\u2019ve never had any psychotic symptoms, really challenge your doctor about choosing an antipsychotic medication. S/he needs to be able to explain why or give alternatives. That\u2019s why they get paid the big bucks. Lol. But really. 2) It\u2019s great that your therapist understands bipolar very well. That\u2019s an amazing leg up. Be sure that your psychiatrist understands it very well, too. 3) Yes!! I understand. I\u2019d gained a lot of weight on a psych med and then I lost it all. I\u2019m always very conscious of weight gain. This is absolutely a concern for you. The goal is to have a comprehensive treatment plan that doesn\u2019t trigger other diagnoses. So, a drug that causes significant weight gain is probably off the table for you, as it may trigger your eating disorder. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s your doctors job to help you find one that works for you. Again, hope this info was helpful.

If she doesn\u2019t get better, there may not be a rest of her life to watch her take pills.  If she had diabetes, would insulin be weird? Our bodies create it naturally but if hers didn\u2019t do that, would you tell her not to take it? Odds are, probably not.  You would want her to do whatever ever she could to get well. The same logic applies here. The hope is that she will be a healthier, happier version of herself with these meds. Most people with clinical depression don\u2019t have to take pills forever. They are not these scary things that will change here antidepressants are usually very mild in terms of psych meds.

Do you enjoying viewing yourself as some sort of fuck-up who needs to be scared straight or else there will be hell to pay? Or would you like to see yourself as a human being, who is currently suffering, while trying to change? I think our society\u2019s view of self-compassion is extremely warped. What you described isn\u2019t exactly self-compassion. While self-compassion supports being kind to yourself while dealing with stress, part of that kindness also extends to being healthy and eating well, not necessarily gorging on peanut butter. The main difference with self-compassion is that the all-or-none thinking that prevails with the \u201cdrill sergeant\u201d method isn\u2019t present. With self-compassion, it\u2019s okay to mess up. It really is. Messing up doesn\u2019t equal failure; it doesn\u2019t equal loser who deserves to be punished and whipped into shape. Whaaaaat? NoSince self-compassion says it\u2019s okay to mess up, it\u2019s equally okay to comfort yourself when you do. You just learn to comfort yourself in ways that don\u2019t necessarily involve food, alcohol or other maladaptive coping strategies. Healthier ways: ways that help you examine why you turn to food during stress, ways that help you, they give you the warmth, love and understanding you deserve when you are in pain, period. There is no such thing as a pain too insignificant, too \u201cfirst world problems\u201d, too ridiculous to comfort. Pain comes in many forms and at many times. It is part of the human experience. You deserve to have comfort and you don\u2019t to earn that. As a society, if we only show ours positivity and respect when we achieve things, it\u2019s no wonder we turn to social media, food, alcohol and drugs for comfort.Btw: Self-compassion isn\u2019t just warm and fuzzy, it\u2019s been scientifically proven to help people perform better than fear-based motivation.

My mental health is the most important thing in my life, so this sacrifice is worth it. If you need to rebuild, then do it. Just know that it may be hard at first but it can be done. Also, make sure to have people who support you around. They will help you get through the rough times. My mom, quite frankly, is a piece of crap, but my best friend has saved me.

People can sniff insecurity out from 10 miles away. Everyone gets rejected. Hot people, too. Also, who are the people you\u2019re interested in? There are a lot of really cool people who like people with great personalities. I once dated a woman who wasn\u2019t conventionally attractive but who had the best personality.
