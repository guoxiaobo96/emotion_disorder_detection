If I seem manic or depressed they ask more.2. Schools don't do enough at all. Like they don't really akcnologe this type of mental illness or similar ones, kinda makes you feel like you don't have the right to succeed sometimes.3. I mean, it ain't right. Like if you haven't been diagnosed by a doctor then you shouldn't just go around saying you got something that you ain't diagnosed with. But if you think you got something, instead of self diagnosing, just go to a real doctor and they can help you4. Personally it's pretty obvious a lot of the time what I'm dealing with cause people notice when I am manic or depressed, not really something I can stop or hide cause it's out of my control. I got some people that are there for me but some people are too uneducated to understand what being there is5. Ways of coping... it depends, art is really helpful, music. People, I need my friends and I don't know where I'd be without them, just going for a night drive and go to the beach and go eat food, you gotta live man. That's how I cope.
