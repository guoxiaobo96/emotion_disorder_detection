No big deal, no Masquerade breach. As someone said, you can deal with one witness, but using Celerity in front of a crow? or getting caught on camera? That will totally be a Masquerade breach for me. Celerity is  intrinsically supernatural, there's no way people see that and just go \"wow, that guy was fast\", they'll will totally go nuts over it.About the dice pool, I wouldn't use that alone to rule any kind of breach just because you can have a 10 dice pool and still fuck the roll, lol.

(Useful when you cut their resources for some reason)-Together they might protect a haven. (One of my players is a tech freak and installed a device that tells the coterie via sms when someone enters their haven. So they stick together for safety)-If they are associated together by other Kindred and part separate ways they still might be found guilty for something the other did.

I can imagine that it\u2019s not difficult to Big Countries to follow the same train of thought and chase them to their new havens. And then, masquerade breaches are too much to keep low, power is too fractured, maybe not every territory has a firm grasp or contacts to make it fade. People start noticing. Not only that buy some might star investigating, looking for their loved ones that gone missing in places that never had that type of crime.

Think in vampire fever around XVII century in Europe. People start getting suspicious of everyone, chaos is everywhere as mortals are accusing each other, and probably taking extreme measures to avoid vampires. Not long ago there was a real case in Eastern Europe where people performed an old ritual in one of their deceased familiar that they thought it was a vampire attacking them, so it\u2019s not hard to think that folclore and panic might cause a total chaos between mortals.From then on, I can only see a gigantic chaos and the Inquisition taking over more openly, and Kindred, if they survive, going on full Renaissance again and working their asses off to make all people believe in science again and science says that vampires doesn\u2019t exist.

I shit you not, and she is not a child. She forced her parents to change schools when her friends or teachers didn\u2019t do as she said.

The whole explanation of the origin of a vampire is weird to say at least. But I like the idea of a benevolent vampire. (Salubri material right there).

Poblete\u2019s tend to be altruistic, take pride in their good work, loyalty and high moral standards (Of course, those standards are pretty much personal, but they are very good at convincing others about them). If you want work to get done and have a good aftermath, you call them to do it. You call them when you trust no one else to do it right. Even if you don\u2019t call them, they\u2019ll be there assuring that everything is done correctly. It\u2019s easy to find them aligned with Anarchs due their tendency to fight for equality or freedom, or their need to command others. Camarilla is also their go to sect, because they sure know how to reinforce the law if needed and make everyone in a domain to work certain way. Some feel drawn to be with the Sabbat due their fraternity like way of organization, but most don\u2019t think there are much place to improvement there to work with.Disciplines: Presence, Fortitude and Ofuscation. Basically because they\u2019ll need to be liked/feared when guiding others, strength to face the shit they fight for and because sometimes you need to get your hands dirty in order to get everything done. Weakness: Much like Giovanni, their clan is their family. But so are their coterie, or anyone they feel connected to. Once they create a significant bond with other Kindred/Ghoul/Human they will fight to death to keep them safe and happy and overall, next to them. This is even stronger with other clan members, so even being in opposite sects they might still help a clanmate in need. Self-sacrifice is never enough.I was thinking that a mechanic for that compulsion is spending Will to try and avoid the compulsion to help or keep someone around and still losing another point of Will for doing so.

She got caught and couldn\u2019t get away with it. That\u2019s why she is trying to not use/abuse her power. That no only shows in the serie but it\u2019s more than clear in the comic where she DID rumor Luther to cope with her divorce (and that\u2019s where they probably got the idea of them fancy each other in the serie because she said literally something like \u201cI heard a rumor that you wanted to kiss me since we were kids\u201d)Also, the fact that they are not blood related does not make them less of a family, and that\u2019s a huge thing that fans of the couple tend to forget to a point were it becomes problematic.

{"eokhcwd": {"text": "That\u2019s normal, you let go a part of you when a character dies. My first character (Julie) had an amazing development in game, she had such a rough life and at the end she found her childhood sweetheart, married and formed a family. I let her go cause I couldn\u2019t bring myself to keep playing her and get her killed. We are almost at the end of the campaign, just one more session and two characters later and we came back to one of the most scariest scenarios (were Julie almost died) and the ST told us that for the great finale all our PC left alive and all the NPC that we met would be there. And I panicked, because she left to form a family and wouldn\u2019t sacrifice them for a fight, but her husband totally would be there and so she\u2019ll follow. What if they died? What if only she left alive? I broke down into tears by the mere idea. They didn\u2019t deserve it, she wouldn\u2019t overcome to being a widow.  The ST told me that he won\u2019t kill them but I\u2019m still anxious af. The character I created after her was her nephew and she indeed died, just after the pack killed her love interest, without me being on time to save him. I legit mourned him for over a month because his dead touch a string deep inside me. When Ska\u0111i died I was sad but somehow relieved because they are probably together now.Anyway, you are not alone at all. I think we all get emotional when we lost a character.

{"eo4ozt2": {"text": "It depends on what derangement they have, and personally, I think that the guide and examples given in the corebook are awful, I usually just dismiss them, because imo they make it easier to play a fish.Now, in my experience as a player I\u2019ve seen a bipolar Malk that was perfectly normal besides the fact that he had buffs in his dice pool, or low difficulty to roll if he was maniac, au contraire if he was depressed the difficulty would raise up.  That was a more mechanical derangement and was fully controlled by de ST that decided with a roll at the beginning of the session which state will the Malkavian have that day. (Or based in the last session to keep a depressed state, etc)I\u2019ve seen one with multiple personalities that manifested in determined moments. There was one that came out when she was really nervous, when she was in front of the Prince or something and switched to this super diplomatic persona that solved the problem gracefully and then when she came back to control... she didn\u2019t knew what happened. She always forget what the other personalities do, and over the game as her derangement increased she developed up to six personalities that came up after a bad roll, when the ST suggested it or when the player find it accurate. This one was more about roleplaying it.As a ST (I still have like 0% experience) had a player with a Malk that was just developing his derangement and he couldn\u2019t tell apart what he saw/listened with Auspex and what were hallucinations. Simple as that, and that alone made the character much more interesting and untrustworthy. We were playing since the embrace and he was also learning to manage this new vampire being, so it was just a mess and his stress would lead to this misperceptions with reality.In another chronicle (Dark Ages tho) I had a Malkavian Prince and she is completely normal and a super functional leader because God told her to do so. And in the name of God she won\u2019t let you mess up with her or any of her servants, humans, ghouls or kindred. Of course she is delusional, but only the ones that knows her closely knows or suspects about her being a malk, by all means she is just another Ventrue Prince.You don\u2019t need a super complicated derangement to be a Malkavian. Someone with a mental illness lives with it everyday but not everyday is controlled by it, it usually pops up in stressful moments so play with that, when the character is scared to death, stressed or anxious, let the derangement slowly slip in and make it grow as the chronicle goes on.", "link_id": "t3_bq66tt", "time": 1558282184}}
