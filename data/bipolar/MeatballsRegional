Go to the gluten free area. You have to stand in line and actually order which tends to intimate some people. It's great. I usually ask for everything but tomatoes and tofu, Thai sweet chill, salt pepper garlic. You just get your own asiany rice thing. Kind of.Panda Express is always so good! I saw a big ass roach there once, but it was only one time and I have no standards for what I put into my body.Chick-fil-A is A++Burger 704 is pretty good in my opinion. Sovi is a lot like crown but they usually have a bit more options. If you're living in South village they're great. If you're in North Village or others then Crown is the most convenient, and it's open later than SoVi.No complaints about SoVi2go, it's quick, it's easy. It's exactly what you'd anticipate it is.Bojangels always manages to get my order wrong and I somehow end up having to pay them to fix it. Wendy's often (but not always) messes up my order, but they fix it without complaint.The place on the third floor of prospector. Mondo's Sub's.

{"fc4sn9e": {"text": "While I'm not quite batting for a pizza, I will jump on any opportunity to talk about my mother. My mother is the reason I do everything I do. She grew up in Detroit before moving with my grandmother to good 'ol middle of nowhere North Carolina, where I would eventually be born. She moved here in late middle school. She gave birth to me at 17. Five months before she became pregnant with me, her older sister became pregnant. Her sister was not at all the mothering type. She would have been a horrible mother, and she also didn't want to be a mother. So, three months before I was born, my mother adopted her sister's son, who was raised as my brother. She's 17, she has an infant and is very pregnant with another on the way. And she had me. She took a semester off of high school to sort everything out, but went back and finished, that way if my brother or I ever talked about dropping out she could say \"I finished high school with two babies, you can finish it\".When I was a month old my biological father sexually abused me. My mother, still just a seventeen years old girl, kicked his ass out, called the police, took me to doctors, and got everything worked out. He didn't go to prison until I was two years old. She fought like hell to put him there, to protect me and my brother from him. My brother is autistic, \"High functioning\" but autistic nonetheless, and he was almost deaf when he was young. I had horrible migraines and one heck of a speech impediment. My mom certainly didn't have an easy time raising us. My grandma helped for a while, paying the bills so my mom could stay at home until we were in school, then things kind of swapped. When I was four we were evicted, almost homeless but thankfully a pastor donated some land for us to have a habitat house built on.My mom is the most powerful, beautiful, kind, and smart woman I have ever met. She has been through hell, and she spit in the devil's face. She worked her ass off to make sure me and my brother had an easier life than she did, and we certainly didn't make it easy for her. I have so much respect for her, more than I could ever convey. She raised us to be independent, and raised us to trust her. I never had a father growing up, but I never had any want for one. I can and do tell my mother everything. She's my best friend. I'm currently in college, she never had the chance to go because she was raising us. All I want in life is to make her proud, and to hopefully, one day, be in a position that I can make her life easier. I can 100% say that I would die for my mother. I would willing lay down my life if it meant saving hers. She is everything to me. I am so grateful and so lucky to have had such an amazing woman raise me. We have had our struggles, but I wouldn't change a thing.As I get older I find myself becoming more and more like her. And honestly, that's everything I could hope to be and more.", "link_id": "t3_eg4b77", "time": 1577426907}}

Schedule appointment for the next Monday.*Starts a new job*Week 2: first actual therapy appointment. Not with the same person the intake appointment was with, which was strange. As I leave they ask me about my next two appointments on the next two Mondays. I didn't recall making those, but I figured yeah every week at the same time makes sense I guess.I told them I just started a job and I don't know my work schedule, so I'll have to cancel my appointments, and that I would call them when I knew my schedule.Week 3: Monday comes, I hadn't called to set up a new appointment because I'd gotten so busy with my new job. I receive a call at the previously scheduled appointment time asking where I was. I explained that I had cancelled my appointment, but apparently not. I told her that here was no way I could make it as with traffic I was about half an hour away. She said I could still come in, and I decline. She seemed very frustrated that I didn't want to come in. **insert $100 same day cancellation fee** I am transferred to the front desk where I asked if I was scheduled for an appointment the following Monday (the one I had asked to cancel). They said yes. I told them AGAIN to cancel it. This is officially the ***SECOND*** time I've asked for them to cancel this appointment. I was frustrated so I didn't set up another appointment, I expressed that I would call them when I was ready with my schedule. The following Thursday I'm at work and I get a call from them. I assumed they were calling to ask if I knew my work schedule. I did so I pick up. It's the front desk*\"Hi, just calling to confirm your appointment for this upcoming Monday\"* **record scratch** eXCSCUSE ME? You're WHAT? I told them no, hell no, absolutely not. I explained that I was very frustrated and this would mark the third time I had asked them to cancel this appointment. Had I not picked up I would have gotten another $100 same day cancellation fee. I told them to discharge me from their care, I was over it. \"are you sure blah blah\" YES, 100% sure, discharge me. She said okay, I figured that was that.Week 4: my therapist called me on either Monday or Tuesday, it's been a minute so I'm not sure. \"Hey Meatball, I understand that you were having some scheduling issues, I was hoping we could work something out.\" I was absolutely enraged. I told her no, there was absolutely no way we could work something out. I explained that I had to ask three times before I got an appointment cancelled, and that now I was having to ask a second time to be discharged. I was clearly not being listened to and I wanted no part in it. She once again sounded really frustrated that I wasn't interested in coming back. Like she was mad at me for not wanting to see her. I went through a lot of abuse so I'm really good at knowing when people are mad. \"Well would you like to make an appointment to discuss other options, I don't want to leave you without any care\" I very politely told her that she and the whole office could go fuck themselves.SO that was a disaster and in still pissed about it.

I ask them if I could help them with anything, but I inevitably had to return to the fitting room. And that was that. Nobody came, they just left the store with their newly stolen pajamas.

I have really bad anxiety, as far back as I can remember it was bad. I recall having my first anxiety attack in the fourth grade, but at that point in time it was dismissed as just being a kid. I was terrified of making phone calls and I had a really hard time meeting new people/ making friends (which led to me being depressed). I underwent some things that made it worse, in 7th grade my neighbors told social services lies about my family and I was removed from the home, it all happened so fast. But when I really realized it was when I had an anxiety attack at school. I was in 8th grade, we had just changed English teachers as ours left to be a librarian. Id had this teacher before but it was his first week this time. I wrote a journal entry as we did at the beginning of every class (in response to a prompt). Well nobody volunteered to read theirs out loud, so he selected me. I had had a rough week and I was really stressed out, public speaking already gave me awful anxiety, but I thought I was just a normal level of nervous. But as soon as he said that I instantly knew I couldn't do it. I looked him dead in the eyes and said \"I can't do that\". He said I could, I once again said no. He insisted, and I just completely broke down. I just started sobbing, I was shaking my head (I.e. \"no\"), I was trembling so hard my friend could see it from across the room, I was hyperventilating. Thankfully one of my best friends was right next to me and he helped. My teacher out a box of tissues on my desk, and said \"I'm so sorry I didn't mean for that to happen\". I'll never forget the expression on his face, he looked so guilty. Like he just ran over my dog in front of my wife and children level of guilty. I tried to get in therapy after that but it didn't work out, I did however get officially diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. I actually got into therapy almost a year ago, after I had to quit my first job due to having anxiety attack before going into work. I couldn't handle it. I'm a lot better now and re-send employment. I'm very glad I got into therapy. Pretty soon after that anxiety attack in 8th grade I ended up in a twoish year long abusive relationship that made my anxiety so much worse. It's taken me a long time to get okay again, and I'm finally almost on a functioning level. I'm hoping to get a job soon, and then my driver's license! The one thing I have always noticed regarding my anxiety though is my memory. One side (a/e)ffect of Anxiety is that your memory isn't great. Mine is terrible, always has been. And I knew it wasn't normal. That always stood out to me. It's nice that now i know why. ", "link_id": "t3_6ja3ao", "time": 1498365592}}

Kinda broke my heart, this is the third time hes done this and it sucks because I have really strong feelings for him. Before this I'd introduced him to my friend Clover because I thought they'd go week together but it didn't work out. Anyways I had a dream that we were standing there and I asked him \"what's wrong with me? Why am I not good enough for you? What am I doing wrong that you can't stay?\" And he looked my dead in the eyes and said \" well... Maybe before Clover you would've had a chance, but since I met here you just can't compare\" then he turned and walked away. Felt like a damn knife straight through my heart. It was terrible, and I woke up crying. I know this dream isn't exactly as disturbing as most, but I was definitely disturbed by it. ", "link_id": "t3_6gujui", "time": 1497333206}}
