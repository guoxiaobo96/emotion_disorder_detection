One day, while Percy was working on an active radar set he noticed the candy bar he had in his pocket melted. Percy wasn\u2019t the first to notice something like this with radars, but he was the first to investigate it. He and some other workers from the laboratory began trying to heat other food objects to see if a similar heating effect would happen. They first heated popcorn kernels, which became the world\u2019s first microwaved popcorn. They then decided to try to heat an egg. The result was that the egg exploding in the face of one of his co-workers.&gt;The company Percy was working for, Raytheon, then took rights on October 8, 1945 for a microwave cooking oven, eventually named the Radarange. the first produced microwave oven was about 6 feet tall and weighed around 750 pounds. The price tag on these ovens was about $5000 a piece. It wasn\u2019t until 1967 that the first microwave oven that was both somewhat affordable ($495) and reasonably sized (counter-top model) became available.&gt;Microwaves were first predicted by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864 by the use of his equations. Later during 1888 Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of microwaves by building a device that produced and detected microwave radiation.", "link_id": "t3_ceb0mg", "time": 1563374482}}

JBOD on the other hand is only as fast as whatever drive the data happens to be on, but if you lose one drive, you should be able to recover the data stored on all of the other drives, as opposed to RAID0, where if you lose one drive, you lose everything.For a mobile setup, I would recommend picking up either an external USB enclosure that has a built in RAID controller than can do RAID5 at a minimum, or a NAS from a company like Synology or QNAP.", "link_id": "t3_cbh1aq", "time": 1562772954}}

{"eslr1tu": {"text": "A few other people have said how they would react.  Let me tell you what happened when I had to go to my old home.I hadn't updated my address on my driver's license in a few years because I wasn't sure how long I was going to be living somewhere and changing it every so often was a pain.  So I didn't. I had opened a bank account with that old address and when I went to order a new laptop, someone mixed up the billing and shipping addresses and shipped the laptop to my old house.  I tried to reach out to my mother to see if she had their contact info, but she didn't as it had changed hands since then.So I got on a subway, then a train, then a bus, then I walked for 20 minutes to go to my old house.  I saw a car in the driveway and went up and rang the bell.  No answer.  So I sat down on the stairs and started to write a note explaining the situation when the door opened and there was a little kid standing in the door.So I asked if I could speak to his parents.  He said they weren't home, so I asked if he could give them my note and slammed the door in my face.  I mean, ok, sure, but don't open the door to strangers kid.So I finished my note, left it taped to the door, and started walking to the bus stop.About halfway there, this bmw comes barreling down the street and jumps the curb.  Then this guy comes out and is like \"WERE YOU JUST AT $myOldAddress!?\"\"Oh hi! Yeah, I'm sorry about the confusion.  I used to live there and there was a mixup with some records and long story short, some of my laptop components were shipped to you.  Have you rece-\"\"DON'T TALK TO MY KID!  YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE\"\"Right, well take a look at the note there, my phone number's on it, that should explain the situation\"\"I COULD'VE KILLED YOU!\"\"OK, have a good day!\"A few minutes later, at the bus stop, another car pulls up and a much more pleasant woman asks if I was the guy at the house, which I said yes.  She pre-emptively apologized for her boyfriend's behavior, he was a bit overprotective and overaggressive.  Honestly I was little concerned for *her safety* if he responded that way every time someone showed up at the door.**tl;dr** Mistakenly shipped computer parts to old house.

I think they added that piece of instruction to tighten that bolt after getting some feedback from customers that that was happening, because I read the assembly instructions multiple times before setting out and my sim racing seat uses the same size hex bolt, so I have one lying around and would've done just that.That said, the shop that I went to told me that I had to replace the entire crank, which I suspected was bullshit.  And they didn't give me a receipt, so when wing extended the same offer to me, I couldn't take them up on it.C'est la vie.Other than that, I've been digging mine.  There was some shipping damage to the front light, and I don't think that the rear light is setup properly on mine.  However, since I live in NYC, I'm going to take it to them to have them take a look.I've been thinking that I need a rear rack, but with the bolt placement, I suspect that I'm limited to the one rack option that they offer or something that clamps to the seat post.I agree wholeheartedly about the lack of suspension being an issue.Another thing to note is that I had to get assistance to adjust my brakes (disk brakes are new to me), and while they were tight initially, they've since loosened (I do tend to rely more on the rear brake).  I'm considering having the mechanical brakes replaced with hyraulics by a local shop, although they said that I'd be looking at $300 to do it.

This is every. single. fucking. day.

I get it.  I used to to be the type to bring my laptop back and forth every day.  Hell, when I was first starting my career in the 90's, broadband wasn't even a thing yet, so when I went to my clients (I was an IT consultant), I carried every version of every piece of software with me in a giant CD binder, along with a small collection of tools and various folders with notes about each location.

As soon as I get home from work, I pull one out, put it on a plate, season with salt, pepper, and whatever spice mix, but those two are all that's mandatory.  Then I throw a half cup of dry rice in a 1 cup measuring cup, and let it soak or wash in a rice washing bowl I have.  Then after an hour, put the pan on the stove, and set the oven to 400.  Once the pan starts to smoke a little, I put the chicken in, skin side down.  Give it 5 minutes, then flip and put the pan in the oven.  Start the rice cooking in a small pot with a cup of chicken broth with a lid on it.  As soon as it looks like it's going to boil over, I kill the heat and set it aside for 45 minutes.  Then I go work out, watch tv, jerk off, catch up on work, whatever.  Come back, steam some veggies in the microwave (lately I've been cooking frozen veggies sous vide, which takes about an hour, but cooks with the chicken).  Once the veggies are cooking, I pull the chicken, check the temp, then if it's at 150F, I'll put it aside and deglaze with some more chicken broth, which I'll reduce and then finish with a pat of cold butter.  Then I plate with rice, then chicken on the rice, then veggies next to the chicken, and drown it with my sauce.It takes a while and requires planning, but once you have a rhythm going, it's easy and probably the best chicken and rice dinner you'll ever have.

{"egs6v6z": {"text": "Depending on the current state of the environment, you'll likely be be building the documentation, including taking inventory, setting procedures, creating and deleting accounts, managing storage and backups, managing printers, deploying software, and troubleshooting.A few tips1. Standardize.  Figure out what roles the company has from a technology perspective, then create images for those roles.  Usually you'll only have two or three.2. KISS - Use as few extra tools as possible.  You want your system as easy to troubleshoot as possible, and added complexity is only going to make that more difficult.3. Soft skills are key.  You need to be able to relate to people.  Talk to them as much as possible to get them to see you as a member of the team.  Don't isolate yourself in your back closet.  Soft skills are much more important in small environments.4. You're on call.  All the time.  Accept it, but learn to set your boundaries.  Learn to say no without saying no.  Instead of \"I'm not going to work on the weekends\", maybe say \"I'll make myself available for emergencies.\"5. Training is better than fixing.  When dealing with PEBKAC issues, I almost never touch my users' computers.  I walk them through the processes that they should know (changing passwords, logging in to Outlook, sharing data).  If you're going to allow people to do things on their own, then you should be willing to train them to do so.  And try to understand that even though they don't know how to do your job, you probably don't know how to do theirs.6. Consolidate your storage.  If you're using AD, a folder redirection is absolutely critical, especially for smaller environments.7. Hosted and managed services are your friend.  If you can avoid managing equipment, it's a good thing.  Hosted VOIP solutions are pretty robust.  Leased printers have been a big part of environments since the dawn of time.  Make use of all of these, but make sure to keep an eye out for your SLA.  No SLA? No dice.8. Do nothing without an email at the minimum.9. Use a project tracking system.

I explain that I don't know how to fix it, and I go back to my desk to see if I can get some clarity from the developer.Eventually he reveals that the word \"Calendar\" is a fucking button.

That said, I also get my ass handed to me regularly on specialist subs that most IT people that I know personally see me as an expert on.The good thing about specializing is that when you have downtime, you can start preparing for your next gamble.  Also, specialists tend to be paid much better than generalists, but generalists will usually have an easier time kicking off and can frequently view a project from more vantage points.I would recommend trying to stick it out.  See where the road leads you before you try to get off, because once you're settled in, which I highly doubt you are yet, you might find that the procedure and routine works for you.As it stands, the role that I landed myself in had a lot of procedures, but they were memorized and manual.

Sometimes being the quiet kid that wants to be alone makes you a target.  Not everyone grew up as a social butterfly.  My younger sister did fantastically because she made friends easily.  I didn't.  I preferred to be alone.  So that turned in to rumors.  People calling me names, spreading rumors about my sexuality.  At a certain point, yeah, I snapped.  In one school, one group was particularly aggressive towards me in gym class, tripping me, pushing me in to walls, so I hit back.Guess who got expelled and sent to a program for \"violent\" kids.Next school, I had garbage thrown at me, people spitting at me, throwing books at me.  And of course, the namecalling and the rumors.One day I had enough and lost my temper and threw a kid out of a window (it was the second floor of a half floor sunk building).  No one did anything to help me or to stop me.Next school, a combination of a teacher (I use the term loosely here) who kept throwing work at me for classes that I wasn't taking, at a level that was for the students with learning disabilities.  I refused, she got in my face, I got up, grabbed my bag, she accused me of assault.  I got a court appointed attorney, and those guys don't have the resources to properly defend their attorneys.

{"ed1x9ye": {"text": "A break/fix client complained that I was too expensive after I raised my rates from $100/hr to $125/hr for the first time in 5 years.  They said that if I wasn't going to give them a reduced rate, they wouldn't work with me, so I let them go.About six months later, I got a call from the office manager.  Apparently they had hired some kid for $50/hr and she was MIA for the last few months.  During this time, \"the server's been beeping\".  And now they can't work because they can't find their files.I asked to hear the beeping, and it was a fast beep about three or per second.  This wasn't their server, but their UPS.I reiterated my rates and they accepted.I went on-site, found the UPS beeping and hot.  The server was lit up, but when I plugged in a monitor, it was blank.  Turning the server off and on, nothing happened.  The motherboard was toast.I told them that the server was dead and when they asked if I could fix it, I flat out told them that not only would it be a waste of time, but a waste of money.  I found them a replacement server, connected their old controller and drives to recover their date, then destroyed the drives.I also checked the logs from the UPS.  Apparently the battery had failed 3 months earlier.  Further investigation showed that it was discharging every night at midnight.  For some reason, the power was being cut to their office every night at midnight.  I figured it was the cleaning crew either blowing a breaker or unplugging the server.  I never investigated, but that was the running theory.Then I went to looking at their desktops as I had to recreate their network from the ground up, because ... no backups for the last 5 months because the backup provider had a new certificate in their binaries that made it incompatible.  Problem is that the email with the alert about that went to the office manager whose response to things that she didn't understand or want to understand was to ignore them.   So no backups.The kid had installed ninite and all sorts of freeware and shareware utilities on their desktops.  I mean, seriously, what accountant needs a codec pack and infanview?  Also found a lot of cracked software.So cleanup of the desktops was in order.Once the new server was setup and the data was recovered from the old array with new, clean ACLs, I created a new login script, cancelled their backup provider and added two external drives that I would rotate weekly, and I used plain old Windows Backup.As part of the cleanup and recovery job, I also provided a proposal for maintenance.  They agreed to 5 hours per week, billed at the earlier rate (previously their billables could be anywhere from 2-10 hours per month).  I also migrated them to Office365, whereas previously they had been using a pop3 provider and PSTs that weren't backed up at all.Oh and the UPS ... the batteries were swollen up like a balloon in a cage and weren't coming out.  Eventually I got them out, but the UPS was pretty much ruined (for the time being ... I did eventually get it working again).  I also added a new UPS which sent myself, the office manager, and the owner emails about alerts.Total time to repair was about 60 hours at $125/hr.This was maybe 8 years ago.... they're still a client, but we've move to a NAS with a VM running their DC, for secondary storage, and AWS Glacier for backups.

I have some points that user should follow to make sure that headset works well:  &gt;1. Batteries - I've found that my controllers work better with regular batteries than rechargeables. It seems to be related to lower voltage (1.2V instead of 1.5V). This might help some issues. You can also try special rechargeables that provide 1.5V but please be advised that those need dedicated chargers.2. Bluetooth - keep Bluetooth dongle as a only device in USB controller (preferably USB3.0). In my case when I plugged something next to the BT dongle (even pendrive) the WMR controllers started misbehaving - they were jumping.3. Reflections - as WMR headsets use cameras for positioning you have to take care to not have any reflective surfaces in your play area - reflection of controller can throw positioning off. The same goes for headset. If you have mirror, glass table or glass in your cupboards cover them with some cloth - preferably with some big pattern.4. Environment light - headset has to \"see\" properly surroundings so you got to have good light in play area. Preferably soft - avoid point lights.5. Sun - cameras on WMR can get blinded by strong light sources, if you notice sun coming through windows close the shutters and use artificial light.6. Distractions - WMR headset positioning can get wonky if you use old type LEDs - blinking ones. Also stuff like christmass tree with loads of LEDs can be a problem. Disable unnecessary lights or make sure that those are not of the blinking variety. To check this move your hand quickly in front of the light - if you see multiple images of your hand it is blinking.&gt;I've found my Samsung Odyssey perform very well - on par with Oculus and Vive positioning when every thing is setup correctly.  &gt;Also I've used plain 1m extension cords for USB3.0 and HDMI to give myself extra space - without any issue.&gt;Have fun!\"", "link_id": "t3_aaarlw", "time": 1546059987}}

The international service is marketed as - for lack of a better word - a perk for anyone who does travel internationally.  However, Google and much of the press who cover such things seem to be treating it with much more import.If Fi was sold as a phone service catering to international travelers or as a quick solution for people who were looking to avoid huge data charges on an occasional trip, then I'd say it's a fantastic service.

(The emergency being that he ignored the \"your password is expiring\" prompts for two weeks and needed to log in to OWA to change his password.)I explained that 1. not an emergency, he's just lazy, and 2. Sunday.  5AM.  Bad dog! No biscuit!Fast forward to last weekend, I'm visiting the client at their office after hours to help the owner with his Blackberry (no, really) because of course it's his password.  He said he put it in to the interface, but for whatever reason, he couldn't log on to O365.I looked at the screen, tapped the checkmark, and he turned beet red and asked how much I was going to charge him.$150.  Normally it would be $300, but he shared his whiskey (~~Dewars white label~~  maybe not) with me, I have a very well paying job now, and it was on my way.As we're drinking whiskey in his office, I explain that I have counterparts in Europe and I explain that I'm a little frazzled because they're 7 hours ahead and like to send me emails at 5AM.In the years since the Sunday 5AM incident, We've actually become pretty good friends, and he and his office manager looked at each other, looked at me, and started telling me to find my zen place and have some whiskey.", "link_id": "t3_9qmlrw", "time": 1540306421}}

Sometimes it's great and I make a friend for the night or for years, sometimes it's bad and I have people I'm not attracted to get pissed off at me and flat earthers try to get me to go home with them to do shrooms (both of these were this weekend, I'm hardly what one might call a catch, but damn).At the same time, I go to festivals alone and do what I want.  I go to concerts alone and don't give a damn about what people think about me because I don't fucking know anyone there, so I just let loose.You know that saying \"Dance like no one's watching\"  in my case, it's more like \"Fuck the bastards, make 'em watch!\"If you're having fun, people will gravitate to you naturally.  It's not an overnight thing.  People have a hard time coming out of their safe little circles, but even if you do it once in a blue moon, you'll meet some of the most interesting people, if only for a day.  And if that turns in to something romantic, then yay!  And if it doesn't, you can at least enjoy the ride.", "link_id": "t3_9i97tf", "time": 1537755659}}

The way Derrida talks to and about Mage makes me think he needs to take a seat.Vidaux ... what is there to say about Vidaux ... no, really.  Dude's supposed to come off as this sage wastelander, but there's zero backstory.  Tell us something about him beyond him being a demolition man.  What was he gathering from the robots in the second episode?  Is this just how he gets by or is he a mercenary?  Also, he's got a pseudo-french name, but his daughter's name is Mayuka.  Explain.Mayuka ... Her interaction with Yuri about Pinocchio (a little on the  nose there, no?  pun intended) is how I would expect a child to interact with an 18 year old.  Beyond that, I don't expect much from Mayuka, because once again ... a kid.Yuri bothers me but I don't know why.  Probably because she's going to betray Derrida at some point or is going to be shown as having worked for rebuild this whole time or some kind of uber predictable twist.  My guess: she was trying to get her hands on the access key and Mage wasn't having any of it, but didn't want to be like \"Nope, the old man that took a little too much interest in me when I was 8 is coming back and it's for him\"Hans - puppet villain.  He's not the boss by a long shot.The world - is there one?

Without taking my hand off the joystick, I say that I'm installing Exchange .... which I was ... on the other screen.He still told me to cut it out though.We tried to setup a citrix server (this was Metaframe 1.8 on NT4 Terminal Services Edition) to play Starcraft as a published app and it worked ... kinda.  Still needed some polish since NT4 wasn't really getting DirectX updates.", "link_id": "t3_9dtcbw", "time": 1536346246}}

I'd say that's a great line of experience.My recommendation is to stick with it for at least a year, get to know Dell's product lineup pretty well.  Things like OpenManage, EMC VNX, Sonicwall, switches, storage ... I personally use almost all of it in my current environment (although to be fair, I probably would've gone a couple of different routes for what we're doing)You've got a lot of options if you want to stick with Dell, but if you decide you want to move on to a different organization, that knowledge of their hardware and platforms will serve you well.  I was a DCT for about six years, just working freelance, and just knowing how to diagnose a server down to a single component while other consultants are saying \"the whole thing's dead\" has won me some serious brownie points with my clients and employers.As far as moving to help desk, this is a fantastic way to go there, although honestly, I think you'll likely be overqualified.  Most people *start* at helpdesk.", "link_id": "t3_95gpm1", "time": 1533701981}}

Then it was just fixing people's problems, whether it was getting their phones setup, troubleshooting their problems with their computers, installing printers ... that was about it.Consulting ... more printers.  More troubleshooting.  Viruses.  Basically, if it's got electricity running through it, they'll attribute that to me.  A lot of the work that I did was Exchange Server related, migrations, upgrades, troubleshooting.  This was also when Windows Server 2000 came out and introduced Active Directory to the Windows world.Citrix Admin, well this was on metaframe 1.8 and NT4 Terminal Services edition.

Terminal services licensing is a bitch.Then I worked with a couple of MSPs ... more printers, but now remotely supported and I have ticket queues and deal with politics.Then I took an Exchange project that I left early after another consultant got in my face.And I just took over as an IT Manager where the names of the game are storage, Office365, account management, minor physical architecture (making sure that server room in the potential new office meets our current and future needs), hardware recycling, ACL management, security, support and .... printers.

Payback is OK, but I felt that 2015 was just more fun and if you're looking for a story or massive Monster energy drink product placement, this has at least the latter in spades, and a lot of the other drivers in the game are real people, which is also why you can't pause.With your specs, you should be able to play pretty much anything, but if the game's shit, the game's shit, and if the game sucks you in, it's gonna suck you in.  I recently ran through The Run just for shits and giggles, and while it certainly wasn't a mindblowing experience, I had fun, and fun is really what it's all about.Besides, at 100mph, you're not gonna be marveling at the reflection of your car in the water.For something even faster that looks gorgeous, take a look at Redout.

This was after I said that his wasting of the two weeks prior by taking his entire department to training without telling me anything and then getting pissed off that the project manager that they requested wasn't free.So then I'm trying to get the project to decommission some servers that were no longer in use and we needed to handle a portion that I hadn't worked with before and so I poked at it a bit and pulls this whole \"we don't want to mess with production systems\", but no one's using these systems anymore.  I've double confirmed that they're not in use, and I said as much.  And so we go in to the office.That was six weeks ago, and I took a new job.  New job had me sign a training agreement that was super fucking shady, but I didn't see any other options.  The agreement that I had to sign was that after the training that they would be able to bill me for the training if I didn't accept their first two gigs.Well the training's a fucking dumpster fire.  It assumes that other training materials have been completed without actually including any references, it's full of contradictory statements, images that contradict their own materials, and spelling and grammar mistakes are all through it.  It's so bad that it wouldn't fly in a middle school English class.So I take a break from \"training\" to go to the dentist, and as I'm locking up my bike, all of my energy disappears.  I collapse in the middle of the sidewalk and people are looking at me like its some kind of act.  Then someone called an ambulance ... apparently I was turning blue.On the plus side, I got home and got a call from a recruiter that I was talking to a couple of months ago about a position that I thought was not happening and they're going to try to get me in for an interview next week.However in the meantime, I have $28 in my bank account, $1700 due for rent, and a $275 electric bill to pay.", "link_id": "t3_8uicr4", "time": 1530239528}}

Otherwise you'll need either a different ranger extender (also, make sure that the range extender is connecting to a 5Ghz network or at least a 802.11g network at the bare minimum).Two things to be aware of:1. You'll never reach that 800Mbps on your wireless.  You MUST be wired to use that.  In general, the only things that I recommend keeping on a wireless network are tablets and phones.  If it doesn't need to move, it should have a wire.  (Source: 23 years of network engineering experience ... wireless is horrible.)2.  The Internet service that you subscribe to means absolutely NOTHING on your network.  If your network doesn't have the capacity for it, you're paying for something you're not using.  I have this problem now.  I have a DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem, which is great for 100Mbps.  However, if I replace the modem with a DOCSIS 3.1 modem, I can get 200Mbps.

Then they had another guy come on to take over project management, which was scheduled while everyone was out, so he was effectively useless.  Then I took that part on again and had one of the guys in the department take on the pivotal role for the entire project.  The job that he needed to do should've taken two hours.  Two weeks later, not only was it not done, but then he went on vacation for a week.  Once again, I was not told about it until he was past his deadline, which pushed all of my deadlines back an extra week, except all of those were locked in already so I was going to have to work twice as fast, except these fuckers wouldn't let me just do the job that I needed to do, and if I hit any kind of speedbump, like for instance finding out mid-deployment that they're using a system that they forgot to tell me about, I had to stop everything, document disconnecting that system, get approval to disconnect that system, and then ensure that nothing else was going to be affected by disconnecting that system, then document the procedure to disconnect the system, get approval for the procedure to disconnect the system, schedule the disconnection of the system, disconnect the system, then a week later, move a fucking mailbox that's not even related to all of that.Normal procedure: move the mailbox.  The system will automatically redirect all attempts to connect to the mailbox, because that's not only how it's designed, but it's been designed that way for over 20 years because it shouldn't take three weeks (I'm not exaggerating AT ALL) to move a mailbox.And I have anger issues.  Oh and when did I hear about any complaints or concerns?  When I was told to not come back.  No one tried to address anything, they just held it back from me in the hopes that what?

You can pick up an 8 camera system that might even include a few feet of 18/2+RG59 cable for a couple hundred bucks at costco.  However, it'll be shooting at 480p, if you're lucky, but more than likely it'll be 360p.  Personally, I prefer a network attached system that consists of a number of IP cameras connected to a switch along with a NAS running some variant of DiskStation, usually a Synology or QNAP.  It's a significantly higher cost, but if you're investing in a system for security, you're essentially paying for insurance.  If you buy a cheap system, install it cheaply, and don't secure it physically or have off-site backups, you might as well not have anything, because in the event of a break in, that's exactly what you'll have, because a smart thief will take the DVR.", "link_id": "t3_8c1swh", "time": 1523659551}}

The assumption that was being led to was that they were basically expected to be cannon fodder, but the lack of people in the city also had me thinking that the people were either robots, holograms, or surrogates, and that all of the people were either in pods like we saw, or had been digitized or were AIs.Now I'm thinking it's something like Vandread, where people live basically forever by replacing their organs, which is why the woman had her heart on the outside.  One of the guards was also delivering a replacement, because she kept feeling weak.  Another part of that is that apparently a side effect for some people who have organ transplants is a loss of a sense of taste.  A buddy of mine had two lung transplants and kidney transplants before he passed away (cystic fibrosis is a bitch), and he couldn't taste anything.My theory is that the earth was irradiated from either environmental factors or war, and the klaxosaurs are an AI that were built either as weapons or as a new lifeform to take the place of the lost parts of the ecosystem, but they grew out of control.  Humanity moved underground in to cities and maintained a connection with the upper world through the plantations.  Soldiers that would live above ground were grown from the harvested reproductive organs from the clones that were created to harvest other organs.Eventually, this just became the way of the world, and society accepted that they lived underground, got what they needed as far as mental stimuli and sustenance from regeneration pods and would basically live forever, but they would be the final, everlasting generation.The part that I'm coming up short on was that zero two was called a nine.  My theory: the original nine people that the plantation had as their originators were cloned, and the designations that people receive are indicators of generation.  So zero two would be one of the first generation of clones, Ichigo and Hiro, being 015 and 016 would be second generation clones or children of first generation clones, and Zorome would be a third generation.  However, since everyone is coming from various harvested organs, multiple generations can co-exist with ease.Zero two's fangs are also due to the doctors experiments in modifying humanity so that they would be more viable for returning to the surface.", "link_id": "t3_854mnx", "time": 1521313235}}

Most of the time I was a tranzie, the Andy Warhol types watching over Frank-N-Furter's experiment, we moved prop pieces, ran the lights, and helped the audience.  I had six people that I kept moving along.  My girlfriend played TrixieAt one point, we were going to be out an Eddie, so she suggested that I take up the role, and the cast director was cool with it, so long as I could get the blocking down, but my girlfriend had other ideas.  She wanted to do a lift.So the lift was at a point in the movie where neither Eddie or Trixie is on screen, so the performers have to come up with their own thing, and we worked on it for two weeks.  At a part of the scene where they're at arm's length away from each other, the camera cuts away, but my girlfriend charges me, jumps up and I catch her,  with her straddling my waist, I reach around the outside of her thighs, grabbing her, basically by her inner thighs, lifting and swinging her on my right, then my left, then back to the middle, where she pushes off, and I move my hands to her waist, lifiting her straight up in the air.Something I should point out about the movie theater that we were in is that there was no marley in the event that something went wrong.  If I dropped her, she would be going down on to a concrete floor, head first.Night of the show comes up and I'm nervous as all hell, because we've been practicing for the last two weeks, but I haven't done the full lift yet because we were doing this in our apartment.  So my scene comes up, and there had been a bit of hype surrounding this, and we got to the point in the song where she's supposed to go up and I figured I'd get her up a little bit and then swing her back down and all would be good.I don't remember what happened, but this is what I was told:She went vertical, did a little bicycle kick, and then I swung her down, perfectly and the audience went nuts.I didn't see or hear a thing.  I went backstage, changed in to my tranzie outfit, and then ran the lights for the rest of the show.This reminded me of what I thought would've happened.**tl;dr I successfully did what this guy was trying without injuring my girlfriend at the time... it was cool.**  happy now?", "link_id": "t3_83uzzo", "time": 1520871281}}

And from my experience as a freelancer, and consultant, I've found there's nothing worse than an unmaintained or unmanaged wiki.A wiki is great when you know exactly what you need to find and it's a relatively broad subject, e.g. Group Policy Printer Management, but not so great when you need to find out how to say deal with the minutae of a particular printer and a workaround that someone found five years ago to get some specific driver to work, and no one has been maintaining that documentation, so the links are all now dead.The reason that large wikis work is because there are a lot of people behind every article, checking links, confirming information.  When you just throw everything in to a pile, that's all you have, a big pile of information with zero context to make sense of it all.  And now it's completely overwhelming, there's no obvious rhyme or reason to anything.Like all documentation, it needs to be written by someone that can make sense to it from a documentation standpoint, taking the \"here's what I did to fix the problem, here's the conversation that I had with other engineers, here's the mess of a network diagram that hasn't been updated in 10 years that we used as a reference, here's the updated diagram that's missing about half of the information from the previous diagram, and here's a pile of passwords.\"Let's not forget that in addition, engineers, sysadmins, techs are all smart people.

Think Lumburgh.Last week we had ours after two very slow months.  I have an 80 hour quota that I'm required to bill, and I didn't make it.  Further, in November, I had the pleasure of dealing with a customer who was insulting and I refused to continue to work with.  I asked a co-worker to pick up the ticket, and the co-worker's name is on the ticket, but said co-worker didn't actually do anything and the customer demanded a refund.The company decided that during the slowest month of the year to take that refund out of my check (which is a violation of my state's labor laws ... I've already filed a complaint)During our bi-weekly call, he decided to take that time to complain that *I was costing him* money and that I should propose some new plan to save the company.I then proceeded to explain in a calm, professional tone, pretty much everything that I said before, that he called me a liar and thief based on a 5 minute conversation with a total stranger over an engineer that he had had multiple conversations with, who had always had the company's best interests at heart when working for the company, and that I had no intention of helping him or being friendly with him at all.  He was apparently taken aback and had no idea that I hate him, so he brought in another HR employee to mediate, and I explained the whole thing once again, I also pointed out that the entire environment was not what I was sold and that I'm concerned employees are being encouraged to defraud customers, because some engineers who take a lot of time off are somehow billing 300+ hours per month and I'm being chastised for only billing 30 hours during Christmas.", "link_id": "t3_7yj8zx", "time": 1519052832}}
{"duhcml5": {"text": "Shortly after being hired as a full time employee at my company, the VP of HR called me up to ask if I had installed software licenses owned by the company (which I don't have access to) on one of my personal clients' networks.  I said that I hadn't, and he clarified that I had used (note that he didn't ask if I had, he said that I had) the teamviewer quickconnect client linked from the company's website.  This link goes to teamviewer's website and downloads a branded version of the quicksupport client.I had done that.  I also used it with my personal account, which didn't eat up any of the company's licenses.  This guy has no clue how the licensing works.He called me a thief and a liar for claiming that I hadn't installed this software (it's portable, it's not installed) and demanded an apology that I wouldn't do it again.This was my first week.  I had told all of my clients that I was closing my business to take a full time job and that if they were interested to come along with me.  Most were hesitant (and are now absolutely against it), but the client in question?  He had already signed up and said that I had set them up in the first place.So this shithead who is WAY overextending the boundaries of his position is claiming that I stole software (not hosted on the company's server, not using any of the company's licenses), misrepresented myself as an employee and representative (I was already working for the company for nine months and have had a box of business cards sitting on my desk for the last year), oh and he's claiming all of this from someone that he's spoken to for five minutes without asking me to clarify anything.He's concluded that I'm a liar and a thief and proceeds to threaten to have me removed from the company if I don't stop trying to explain and just apologize **to him** immediately.Good thing I work from home and have a hotkey on my keyboard to mute my microphone because I was in tears.  I had just closed my business to go to this company and now I was having my livelyhood ripped away from me.Yeah, I hate him.The two other people that I hate:1. Went behind my back with one of my clients because the client figured we worked together (we didn't, I had recommended him for cisco work since I'm more microsoft focused)2.

Consulting will destroy your career.

One place was very proud of the fact that the oldest person in the company was about my age and was the second CFO that they had because the first one was fresh out of college and had no place being a three letter acronym.My erstwhile goal is IT Manager or CTO/CIO for a small to medium sized company, but honestly it's become more of a pipe dream than anything else.  These days, I'm effectively a very well paid secretary because the jackass who's been rocking the boat at my current place has decided that it's more important that any idiot who calls should find it easier to get ahold of an engineer than a sales person.

I figure they mean that it's rebooting frequently and they're exaggerating.  Then the person on the phone walked out and I heard the beep-beep-beep-beep-beep death rattle of a UPS gone wrong ... and they've been ignoring it for 3 months.So I go on site and find a ~~bomb~~ UPS with a battery so swollen, I can't get the tray out after disconnecting it, but the other thing that I find is that their server is dead.  No POST, no nothing.  It's toast.So I ask a few cursory questions while ordering a new one from Dell Outlet to get it on site as soon as possible.Then when the new server arrives, I set up the new server, I pull the drives and controller out of the new server, plug them both in the new server, and start extracting data.I'm able to get in to safe mode in Windows where I can access the event logs and find that there was a power failure every day at around midnight.  I thought to myself, \"what could be causing that\", so I set up a webcam pointed at their door, and around 11:30, I saw someone going down the hall with a floor waxer.  The floor waxer was causing a voltage dip that the UPS had been absorbing, but it eventually killed the batteries that were never meant to discharge that frequently.So yes, get a UPS at the minimum, but ideally, you should have any large appliances or power tools or anything that's going to have a large draw on a separate circuit.", "link_id": "t3_7nqcfq", "time": 1514961418}}

{"drhziog": {"text": "I almost never have a chance to tell this story, but here goes ...When I was 16, my high school had a \"computer show\".  This was in 1994, and online services were the way to get online, if not straight to the Interwebs.  At our show, we had Microsoft showing off a Windows 95 beta on this suitcase-sized \"laptop\" from Toshiba, and few local companies, including Prodigy Services.For those that don't recall those days, Prodigy was owned by various companies at certain points in time, including IBM, AT&amp;T, and a few others.  And Prodigy was a direct competitor to AOL and Compuserve, the former of which was just starting their floppies to the world campaign.The Prodigy rep was having trouble getting online however.

So I poked around in her computer, connected to my computer at home that I had set to auto-answer, much to my younger sister's chagrin, and eventually found a second copy of the Prodigy client, which I got her online with.Later on, she stopped me as I was drooling over the Toshiba suitcase, and gave me her phone number, which to a 16 year old computer geek, was something that doesn't ever happen.A few days later, I gave her a call and she asked for my address, which she sent a package containing a couple of Prodigy polo shirts and pens and a Prodigy installer with a post it note on it saying to use a different username to sign up.So I popped the floppy in to my computer, installed the client, signed on, put in the alternative credentials, then got to the point where it asked for a credit card and all of the controls were disabled, aside from \"Next\"I now had a comp'd account.  I used that account for almost four years, including when I went to work for Prodigy the next year.", "link_id": "t3_7kuy55", "time": 1513731862}}
