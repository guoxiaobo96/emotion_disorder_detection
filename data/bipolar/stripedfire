That being said, when I have it, I have a lot of it and I've only experienced instability as a result a few times. Overall it's going to depend on your brain.My pdoc explained it like this: our pills are stabilizers or uppers. Alcohol is a downer. They're literally working against each other so you're pretty much guaranteed to have some type of side effect, especially the more you do it.Ultimately you should talk with your psychiatrist.

Of course you want to be supportive but that doesn't mean you have to cause harm to yourself. It's a hard line to walk but a therapist will help you find that balance.

He and I are still seeing if we can make things work but we've been trying our entire relationship (which has been 10+ years) and those aspects of his personality are part of him.Remember you can't make him change, nor should you try to. He is who he is so you need to define what you are and aren't willing to accept. Pushing your PTSD boundaries is definitely taking things way too far and he's very immature and frankly doesn't love you as much as you think if he's willing to hurt you like that.Edit to add: look up the DEAR MAN conversation technique.

The low premium makes me feel like I'm saving money because I put the money I would have spent on the premium into my savings so it can accrue interest and I'm not just giving the insurance company a bunch of money. The negative is that it has a high deductible that must be met before they pay out for anything that isn't routine preventative care but for me it works great.

It's typical to get the generic when it's available due to significantly lower costs.Lamictal is an anti-epileptic med designed to level out the activity going on between neurons. Seizures are caused by imbalances of chemicals between neurons and bipolar is thought to be the same, just with different results. Feeling manic? You've probably got a high level of a neurotransmitter like dopamine or are significantly lacking one. Since seizure triggers (chemically speaking) are so similar to bipolar triggers, anti-epileptic meds are common methods of treatment and are typically very effective.They're designed to level you out so if the Lamictal is working right, you'll have fewer ups and downs and when they do happen, chances are they won't be as intense.It's been an incredible tool for leveling me out. We combine it with an antidepressant but I've been on Lamictal since I was diagnosed about 6 years ago. My bipolar hasn't gone away but I'm so much better than I was before treatment.Remember meds work differently in everyone so it might not be a great fit for you.

{"ew3fjdn": {"text": "I'm also not the OP but figure I'd get involved in some conversation here. I've considered myself to have a much higher amount of empathy than a standard person (I feel bad for potentially hurting inanimate objects' feelings by leaving them out or disfiguringthem) but I don't know how I can compare to the other two I've seen in here. That being said...I personally consider my empathy to be very accurate but you could potentially argue that's an egocentric view. Empathy starts with knowing someone is going through something you've gone through then feeling what you'd felt at that time and then bringing those feelings to the present so you're actually feeling them again. Once it evolves and you have more life experience, you can empathize with things you haven't gone through by using the closest basis you have and adjusting it using logic. I personally haven't lost a parent but I've lost loved pets, a grandmother-figure, and have felt pain from feeling left behind and lonely before. If I get too caught up in my head, I'll start to tear up but I catch it there and distract myself or cut it off so I don't cry over something that hasn't happened yet. Because there's no true way to know what someone else is feeling, empathy is an assumption. But in the same way, it's as much an assumption as what something tastes or smells like to someone else.I've never found out what I was feeling while empathizing was wrong. I have learned that what I thought someone felt at a time was wrong but I wasn't caught up in the active emotions that the concept of empathy entails. Thinking further on it, I was feeling cognitive empathy at those times but something stopped me from going flown blown. Maybe I could tell something was off? This doesn't eliminate the possibility of it having happened though. It very well might have and I just never found out or noticed.I feel shame or guilt when I know I've done something wrong that could get me in trouble. Instinct is to say that it has to do with someone else getting hurt or something but that's not the case. I've felt it when the only person it affects is me. I try to talk myself down and figure out how to prevent the feeling from happening again. For example, I was late to work a lot last month. Not by a lot but by enough to get in trouble if someone felt like making a big deal out of it. Most days I was fine but some days I'd have extreme anxiety that came from somewhere else which amplified my feelings and caused me to feel shame and guilt. I kept trying to cope by telling myself it's fine, I can't really get in much trouble and even if I did, it won't kill me or anything. I also kept thinking of ways to wiggle out of it and then fought those thoughts with ones of \"you need to take responsibility for your actions\". I effectively went through an obnoxious cycle until I forgot about it long enough for the anxiety to go away and the guilt with it.If the person explained to me how their muted emotions feel, I believe I'd be able to empathize well. My husband experiences love and emotions differently from others and I recently learned my dad does too. I've been working through learning as much about the ways they experience life so I can identify and connect with them and know what's going on. Some concepts I still struggle with. Part of it is them struggling to describe it and part of it is my lack of comprehension. It's so different from my normal and it's something we're basically told won't come up so it's hard to wrap my head around but the more I learn the better I get. I knew I loved my husband when I could definitely say I'd forgive him for (almost) anything, would be willing to put my life in danger to save him (jump in front of a train or whatever), and that I believed the feeling to be unending. The instincts and strength have changed a lot over the 10 or so years we've been together but through our big challenges I've learned that it won't go away. Even if I wanted to stop loving him, even if I needed to, I simply can't. It's basically involuntary. I opened myself up to let it in originally but I'm not capable of getting rid of it now. But love also isn't quite an emotion - it's almost like another part of who I am. I'll do little things like scratch his head, vacuum, keep my shoes cleaned up, have the TV ready for him, etc. to make him happy because of that love. Those are actions caused by my love for him but at that point it's not emotion. Something else is driving those commands in my brain. The love just makes it possible. The love I feel for my pets is more passionate and even less voluntary. I did let that love in but it was a lot easier than with another person. I can forgive anything they do, no matter the damage it causes, because I know there's no malicious intent. I'll still get mad but I try harder to reign it in and don't really punish then because they're cats so they won't learn from anything I do. If something happened and I suddenly stopped feeling love for my husband it would complicate things but it's hard to know by how much. I wouldn't be so blinded by it and would more clearly see the negatives of our situation but at the same time, he's my best friend. We get each other much more deeply than anyone else. We laugh together, can predict what the other is thinking, know each other's patterns. Those things wouldn't go away even if the love did and those could keep us together, especially if my capacity for love disappeared entirely. I don't have human babies though raising my own little humans is one of the things I'm most looking forward to in my future. That's harder to speak to than if I lost love for my partner. Every image I have of my kids is entwined with love. I don't actually know how to extricate that love. Part of it would likely depend on their age. As a baby, I'd likely think they're cute but I'd feel a significantly smaller bond. If they've grown into free thinkers then there'd be more likelihood for respect and fascination with how their brains work (but I love figuring out brains so that's where that comes from). Since my cats are my kids right now I can say I'd be less patient and understanding but they're also still cute and I'd still keep in mind that their capacity for doing things with bad intentions or learning from whatever education I give would be limited so I'd treat them very well still. I just wouldn't dote on them like I do now. My reaction to remembering an emotional experience depends on how involved I am in the remembering. I often have barriers to stop me from getting the full force of an emotion since I'd be a big sissy all the time if I didn't. My standard emotional memory retrieval is surface level - in that event I'm remembering the events in a factual way. She steps away, I look up, I feel sadness and pain in my chest, now there are tears, I step forward, etc. I'm refusing to actually feel those emotions so I keep the memory very restricted. It would admittedly be like watching a movie in VR from the first person perspective. But sometimes I can't keep up that barrier. When that happens, it's a full fledged reliving of those feelings and it's more \"all at once\" than \"step by step\". Most of the time I'm feeling things this way because I'm experiencing empathy. The Lion King got me yesterday. My friend's pain almost got me today. On rare occasions I will experience this because I'm going through something else like feeling abandoned or worthless. The way life is now, it's because I'm in a bipolar hypomanic state. Before I was as self-assured as I am it happened a lot and was because of active feelings of loneliness and exclusion. When it's non empathetic, it's very very hard to control and brings up a lot of other times with it to, basically slapping me in the face with all the other times I've felt that way. Reliving feelings for me is honestly exactly like experiencing them in the present except it includes the knowledge of it being from the past and I have a different kind of block that I use for real-time emotions.I can't say this is how everyone feels but I've tried to describe it as true to reality as I can. I do know many others describe empathy the same way so I'd consider myself to be a reliable source for that but again, that could just be me being egocentric.", "link_id": "t3_cmesav", "time": 1565076359}}

So to help OP, I want to point out what it officially looks like because it can be hard to recognize without it being pointed out.Hypomanias or manias (manias are significantly more intense, last longer, and must cause harm to the person's life like losing a job or physically harming oneself) often cause random fixations like \"I must clean right now, even if it's 3 AM and I have to go do something at 6 AM - I can't rest until this is done\" or \"I need to paint and paint more and continue painting and never stop. I don't need sleep anyways\" or \"This living room's layout is so dumb now. I'm fixing it immediately. I want to go buy a couch! But it's so late the store is closed! I can't handle waiting for it to open!\"When I was unmedicated and also when my meds simply aren't enough to fight the chemicals screwing with my brain, I'll get irrational and blame my significant other. The worse the episode, the more ridiculous the blame. \"It's so clear you never loved me, you dont do anything for me! I make all the sacrifices and you don't care!\" even though he's been spending a lot of time and energy giving me love or taking me out to eat. I try really hard to control these and it usually results in me shutting down completely to prevent harm but sometimes that doesn't work.These mood episodes can come literally out of no where, which is significantly more common with BP than when the episode has an explainable trigger. It's caused by chemicals being imbalanced in the brain, though they still haven't figured out what causes the chemicals to be unbalanced specifically. Thankfully, they do have meds that can make it much easier to live a normal life. Therapy is effective for some too, but you need a great therapist who can teach how to maintain presence of mind amidst the assault of chemicals so you can regain control of your thinking. OP, I applaud your patience, that's very difficult to be faced with. You can't diagnose her yourself and you'll need to get her to a psychiatrist. Manias and hypomanias can last a long time though it seems her pattern is faster than others.When she comes back down, talk to her gently and express very clearly that you love her and want what's best for her, and would like her to see a psychiatrist.Also, no matter what, and I really need to stress this given her behavior, DO NOT accept a depression diagnosis or allow her to only take antidepressants without a thorough evaluation to see if she has bipolar. They can really screw up a bipolar person's life because it triggers too much of one chemical. Depression is caused by a lack of chemicals and bipolar is caused by chemical levels being all around unbalanced so if they're given \"happy chemicals\" then it actually causes too much of those \"happy chemicals\" which can trigger a manic episode.

They definitely don't solely reside there. With depression especially, focus needs to be put on what you can do now, celebrating any win even if it seems small. If that means you can't exercise but you can say no to a shake and yes to water, then that's exactly where you start. It sounds like you handled I the right way for your body, especially since you did start exercising once you felt ready for it.I'm curious, though, when you were trying to exercise before, was your mindset \"exercise to lose weight\" or \"exercise is the only thing that will make me feel better\" or something else?", "link_id": "t3_ci9k51", "time": 1564250032}}

Out of no where I couldn't remember answers I'd gotten literally a minute ago and sometimes couldn't remember if I'd asked the question at all. My words became jumbled and I often couldn't think of the word I was trying to say, no matter how long I thought about it.

My desk was covered in sticky notes. Then my memory gradually got better over the course of a few months. Unfortunately it's never gone back to normal and details get muddled in my head often but it's good enough that I can more than function. I just struggle sometimes.I often do similar to what someone else said and remember \"where was I when this happened\" to build my knowledge of the surroundings (time of year, people that would be there, activities taking place). I think I've taught my brain other ways to handle it so it functions off different neurons.I've wanted to change my meds but also like another said, I'm too terrified.

If she seems receptive, ask her to go to a therapist and you could even say \"I don't know whats causing our issues but I want to fix them.

This relationship could become one that does a lot of damage to you. While you might be willing to endure it for the goal of her coming back to normal, you need to keep in mind your own health.

I take 250 mg Lamictal and 100 mg slow release wellbutrin.I've never gone more than a day without a pill and it's only happened a few times. When it did, I started out feeling a kind of buzz throughout my body and my senses were numbed a little. The buzz and numbness would grow and I'd become very lethargic. The best way to describe my mood is simply \"off\". It was hard for me to identify how I was acting differently but I could tell I was. I was more argumentative and confrontational. Sometimes I'd stay in a good mood while being agitated and other times I'd get snappy. I knew I was out of touch but couldn't do anything to stop it. Everyone reacts to meds differently so you would likely experience different symptoms. My first time going a day without the meds was alright but the second time I felt too off and wanted to avoid doing it again if at all possible.Also, I remember those info pamphlets that come with the meds both say sudden stopping of the meds can cause serious side effects such as epileptic episodes. If you end up in this situation in the future you need to wean yourself off carefully and with the help if your doctor if at all possible.I'd recommend signing up for a mail prescription service. I get my pills in 90 day batches and refills come straight to me instead of needing me to remember to stop at my pharmacy.

Your kitty will feel so much better and have a lot more energy once he's on a complete diet. I recommend not wasting money on a grinder as chewing the meat and bones is better for kitty jaws. I also recommend buying small amounts first to see what your cat likes. Mine love pork but are very picky about the beef cuts I give them.Also, do lots of research before you start feeding. The diet is a very sensitive thing, especially in your case with your UTI prone baby. You need to make sure they're getting all of their nutrients from what you give them. That Facebook group I mentioned has an excellent calculator to help figure out how much your cat needs in a day and what portion amounts of each food (ie: how many oz of meat vs. bones vs. liver vs. other organ).I can tell by the brand you feed him alone that you care about feeding him the best and I'm so glad you're making the jump to a full fledged proper diet.

{"ejuf0ox": {"text": "Bipolar is known to cause relationship issues due to the instability and irrational behavior. Somehow I've had pretty good control of mine, especially once I got medicated but I still have issues. I've learned enough about my moods that I can usually recognize this energy in my head and identify what I'm doing is the bipolar and not me. When I notice it I'll frequently lock down and just not do anything. No talking, no decision making, sit there and stew in it until it passes. Usually it's at night and I'll fall asleep. Once I wake up it's almost always over. That's not typical, unfortunately, for most people with bipolar.For the first couple years my husband and I were dating, he used to do a great job of just being supportive and helping me pull out of it. He'd do this by listening to me and talking me through the negative things I'd say. He'd give me hope, too, when I felt like everything was over. As time has gone on, he's honestly gotten a lot worse and that sucks but I can't get too hurt by it because it's not his job to fix me.

Most people feed chicken liver. The big animals like cow don't have as much nutrition concentrated in the same area so it's not very effective. Also, you can't overfeed taurine. You don't have to worry about taurine unless your feeding bird breast, then you absolutely need to balance it with more thighs and drumsticks (like what you were saying).Variety is great but the bare minimum requirements are 75 - 80% muscle meats (this can all be the same animal unless your cat has a sensitivity that requires more types), 5% liver from a small animal like chicken, 5% more organ (this can still be liver but many like to do kidneys or other secreting organs) and 10 - 15% bones.

I suspect some forgotten trauma plays into it and I'm very sure my religious upbringing contributed for years but the end result is the same. He actually needs sex, massages, and head scratches to feel loved and sex is the thing he craves the most. Sex usually hurts me a lot (up until recently) and it was frequent that I would go months without any desire and it wasn't uncommon for me to feel disdain towards the idea in general. Things have gotten better but even so, it would have been wise to end the relationship a long time ago for both of our sakes so he could feel wholly loved and I could feel less used and more appreciated.The lack of sexual desire left me feeling deficient, broken, and hurt for a very long time. You don't need to live that way and even though it's been a couple years for you guys, I'd highly recommend to end it now and find someone who is more compatible.Also, pick up the 5 Love Languages book. It's very educational and will help you identify what you need from a partner and what you can offer them in return.One more thing: know that you shouldn't feel guilt for challenges in pleasing him nor should you feel ashamed that the relationship didn't work out.

Not prefect but at least I can really enjoy it now. I've embraced my kinks and he's completely supportive of doing whatever it takes to satisfy me. I trust him not to judge me and I also get seriously turned on by turning him on.So yeah, support her and tell her how hot you find her, never tell her something she wants sounds weird (though also go ahead and tell her if you're uncomfortable with it without discouraging her feelings), and keep trying various things.Another note: I have a tendency to \"chicken out\" close to climax. I get in my own head and back off. I haven't figured out how to fight it always but if I'm SUPER into it then it doesn't happen.

They would make me take off my clothes outside and \"have sex\" with them (I don't actually remember details but I do know it was what a kid would think sex was if they'd never been walked through it).

A lot of the stuff he did I chalked up to him being playful but a ping went off in my head that tried to warn me to run away. He'd try to \"tickle\" our butts with his toes (and missed the mark the would move his foot to continue missing the mark), and loved throwing open the bathroom or bedroom door when he knew full well someone was naked in there. There was this night I had a sleepover there and my friend fell asleep hogging the bed so I went out to sleep on the couch. He came out of his office and was breathing funny and something told me to pretend I was asleep. He just stood behind the couch for a minute or two with that weird breathing and then went back to his office. I try not to think about what exactly was happening there and hate to think of what would have happened if I'd reacted differently. He was also incredibly controlling and verbally and mentally abusive but I didn't know how to see that. I actually was in a class where they talked about the 4 different types of abuse and I realized that he probably wasn't just playing around and if I really loved my friend, I'd report him. His kids joked using sexual terms and also threw open locked doors like their dad did. I realized that they learned this stuff from their dad and there was a lot of activity going on behind closed doors that caused them to behave the way they did. I called CPS and lost a friend that day because they weren't very discreet about the accusations against him and my friend vehemently denied that her father's behavior was wrong. They were about to move out of the country in a couple of weeks so the last thing I heard was that CPS didn't see anything wrong when they checked it out and I imagine he kept on keeping on in their new home.There are still times I think back and say \"Ooooohhhhh... That's what that was.\" and then feel like a complete dumbass for not realizing it sooner. ", "link_id": "t3_9wpy6v", "time": 1542195218}}

{"e9ci5nk": {"text": "Rant away, friend. That's part of why this subreddit exists. Bipolar is a bitch of a mental illness and when you're in that frame of mind where you hate yourself, it's hard to get out of it and seems like some random thing has to kick you out. I wish I could say the perfect sentence to make you feel better but there isn't one. The best I can do is say people care, we're here to listen and it's no bother for us, and your life matters to a lot of people, even if you think it shouldn't.I also want to give some advice in case it can help: level out your brain. Your bipolar is caused by chemicals not working right in there. When you have alcohol, caffeine, or speed, those chemicals end up going haywire. I don't know if you're at the right spot in life but when you are, take a breather and clear out the extra chemicals. You'll feel a lot better once your brain resumes a sense of \"true normal\".One more thing to maybe help and show I know the horrible energy running through you right now: about 3 and a half years ago I kept finding things that I hate about myself - my room is a mess, I can't even get to work on time, I contribute nothing to the lives of my family. The list got big and I very quickly found myself obsessing over ways to violently kill myself. I hated myself more than I'd hated anyone ever before, far more than I thought I was capable of. I had suspected that a medicine change had caused the feelings to grow and finally got sick of feeling the hatred I had. I took my old medication (which was literally just 25 mg less of zoloft) and was back to my normal, confident, self loving person within hours. The tiniest chemical differences affect us way more than most other people. It's so freaking stupid but the only option is to work with it. ", "link_id": "t3_9vieao", "time": 1541751211}}

I have a helmet thankfully but the rest is a major pain to figure out, especially being a very slender woman - I've got limited options. Right now I'm specifically trying to pick a jacket and pants, both from the same brand so I can turn it into a suit.I had honed in on making sure that all of my armor was CE level 2 due to my husband's riding habits and I chose the RevIt Xena 2 matching jacket and pants though I replaced the hip armor with D30 so it would also be CE level 2. Everything else is already level 2 (and I bought the level 2 back armor for the jacket). The fit is awkward. I'm a bit uncomfortable in the pants around the hips (that might be fixed if I put the armor back to the CE level 1 it came with) and the knee pads add a lot of pressure to my knee caps. The jacket is comfortable enough but everything is a titch baggy - it'll stay in place but you can tell my arms, chest, and thighs aren't as \"big\" as the clothing was made for.This god send of a woman with lots of experience who also works for Revzilla suggested I opt for the Dainese Racing 3 Womens jacket and Delta 3 pants because they'll likely fit me better and provide great protection. My concern is that their armor is CE level 1 all around and not level 2.So now I'm stuck trying to evaluate where my risks are and was hoping you experienced riders would know more about protextion levels and what would be the wiser decision.Which will (probably) provide better protection: the level 2 armored gear that doesn't fit quite right or the level 1 armored gear that would probably fit fantastically and is still overall certified to CE Category 2?Thanks in advance!

It took effect within 2 days and the hypomania lasted about a month before my brain decided it wanted to switch things up again. My quick reaction to the meds is what clued my psychologist into my bipolar.Also remember a couple things: just like depression, hypomania can lay hidden so you're experiencing it but don't realize it. Your bipolar tendencies can shift to be somewhere you don't expect (normally you need to clean your room or buy a bunch of crap when you're in a manic state but now you feel an intense desire to welcome the future and make yourself the best you can be) and as a result you let your guard down. Stay vigilant. The second thing to remember goes hand in hand with the first: that hypomania can make you feel suddenly alive and the most happy you've been in your life. It can give that desire to go out and be something great. You may interpret the hypomania as being \"normal\" but it's not. This happened to me because of my misdiagnosis. I'm still struggling to figure out how happy is normal happy and to not expect that euphoria. Edited to add that my use of the word \"hypomania\" is synonymous with \"mania\".
