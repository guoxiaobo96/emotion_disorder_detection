For basking the cheapest method is a 120w flood light from home depot and buy the dome and a dimmer switch at home depot. A temperature gun is best way to setup your basking temperature. That's probably the cheapest and best way to set up your lighting. Unless the cage is dropping below 70 degrees at night you're fine there. If it drops below 70 you'll want to use a ceramic heat emitter (CHE). You want no lights on at all during night.Set your basking area to be about 115 degrees. My basking area is a 12x12 tile. The center is 115 degrees and she has a nice radiant temp to choose from since the tile heats up to different temperatures.Your UVB fixture needs to be inside the enclosure. Don't put it on top the screen will filter out the UVB. Basking light is fine on top of the screen and your dragon should never be able to reach the bulbs.That's pretty much the lighting setup.Also since you're new to the hobby a bit of advice. Start a dubia colony. They make no noise and have no smell and are super easy to keep. This is the best way and cheapest way to keep a good supply of food. Buying crickets all the time gets expensive. I bought my starters a while back from dubideli. You'll want around 3 females per male adults.

My job just consists of running reports, answering phones if they ring, and every now and then I have to deal with a guest. Overall it's not bad. My therapist says it's a really good job for me. Im able to work a lot too since I'm alone every night no coworkers to deal with either. I do get the occasional guest that is rude and screams at me though. I have panic attacks whenever that happens. Over the last year it's happened 3 times. I would say my average night is 2 phone calls and maybe 1-2 walk ins. I'm in a pretty big touristy area too. My boss was also extremely understanding. He saw me just shutdown a few times when people are rude. He's also saw me when I was hypomanic and a guest was being rude and cussed them out. He doesn't know that I have bipolar disorder though. He's a really great dude but I've felt no reason to ever tell him if it's not getting me in trouble.", "link_id": "t3_5tjh8h", "time": 1486876249}}
