After about a year I went off it (cold turkey, brain zaps, ugh) and thought I was off all meds for good.Fast forward to last fall/winter when I had a manic episode followed by intense, suicidal depression that forced me to move back into my parents home. My psychiatrist said she thought I might have bipolar 2. I explained that maybe that was the case, but Zoloft has worked for me before so she should put me back on it. She complied, and so for about two months straight I didn\u2019t get more than 2 hours of sleep and was constantly in a state of hypomania.I went back and got different meds (lamictal, wellbutrin, seroquel) and made vast improvements, as well as began to accept my diagnosis.I switched docs because I felt like she wasn\u2019t too thorough and had a lengthy session that ended with a bipolar 1 diagnosis, in addition to ADHDSo anyway, that\u2019s my lengthy story about being diagnosed at 16 with mild depression and finding out five years later that actually I had sever bipolar disorder and could have been spared a lot of pain had I just had a psychiatrist who was willing to ask a few questions.", "link_id": "t3_e825io", "time": 1575858152}}
