It was released earlier this year. Takes it to a whole new level.

You can't completely remove ads, but you can make sure the ads are relevant to your interests.

At least on Facebook there is a way to hide/block ads from a specific company by **tapping the 3 dots or arrow** next to the post. There's also **ad preferences** in the settings you can change by deleting the random things Facebook adds to your list of preferences. There's gonna be a lot! They literally add random words like sock, doll, or sweatpants. That's a few random as hell things I seen in my preferences that don't belong. If you delete them periodically you will see less and less of ads you don't want to see. But, Facebook continually adds categories based on comments, likes, and shares. So, it's something you gotta do regularly or you will get more and more bs that doesn't relate to you.

I am an emotional mess mostly but I try to keep it positive. I am back in therapy and I have a neuropsychological testing appointment soon so my diagnoses should be lined out and my medication fixed. That way I can live instead of being medicated and trying to find my path in a state of drowsiness and negative thoughts. As for racism, it's the worst habit people can have. We're passed that shit. I was a threat bc I had actual corporate training so they restorted to petty drama. I tried to be a team nonetheless and used my southern charm to pay them no mind. I even had more training than the store manager bc the owner didn't care to pay for it. I fixed their food cost from worst to best in the district. Then they lost that perk once I left after a year. No one gave inventory the attn it deserved. They did it to themselves not wanting to be a team about it. Karma. I do my best to not hold a grudge. But it was satisfying to know they lost their best in the district title and bonus bc they couldn't do it without me.Your positivity and empowerment is appreciated \u270c\ufe0fEdit: As you can see here username checks out. I was so passionate about my job yet almost equally hated as much. I had such a love-hate relationship that I made it my Reddit username. Even after all that drama and more, I still miss it because I miss providing quality customer service and making sure that food was spot on perfect.", "link_id": "t3_fbdx2h", "time": 1583174573}}

We all know some type of drama exists in every work place.My worse experience ever at McDonald's was after I moved to NY from WV. I expected I'd find a better environment in NY. NOPE!Sorry for the essay, but this is why I am nervous to work again...my experiences have not been positive:My first day running the floor as a manager in NY (I'm from WV), I asked the manager to have who ever left the mop bucket out in the middle of the path to put it up (it was not my shift yet so I didn't have the authority to delegate employees during her shift). This grown ass adult kicked the mop bucket over, clocked out and told me to take care of it. All bc I kindly asked her to have the employee follow through and put it up. I made the same mistake of not reporting that incident. But she was the biggest bully in the place and was bff's with the store manager. She assumed and pointed me out as a racist to the whole store + others in the district solely bc I'm from the South. I'm not at all, but she assumed I was as soon as she found out I'm from West Virginia. She's black and I had zero problems with that, but it didn't matter. Another incident happened that caused me to be injured. So, instead of taking action, I just left. I felt nothing would get done. I did report to the owner that a fellow manager refused to mop the greasy mess that caused me to slip... but I was told to just let it go bc the owner didn't want a race issue (the employee is Muslim). This person refused to mop up the fry area, but, begged to work the fry station knowing that's part of it? If you work a station you're required to clean the mess no matter if you're management or crew, there was not a spare person to do it for her. Well, they're management too, so they thought they were above mopping. I ended up with a labral tear in my hip. Thanks for reading!", "link_id": "t3_fbdx2h", "time": 1582994085}}

You don't just get payed paid a flat rate it depends on the difficulty and how long it takes you to finish. Finish to soon it's too fast and you get paid shit, take too long same thing.

If you have friends to play with, you can make money rq just by helping them with their sales. For the coke, meth and bunker sells, as an associate/biker club member, you get paid at least $30k for each sell, a little less for docs, weed, and cash. It really adds up quick if you have a group and each person has a handful of sells or more. Now I have over $60 million and have anything I want and more.

I got comfortable with them and hearing them speak before I was comfortable enough with myself to use a mic. With the amount of times I've been hit on, harassed, or told I'm a \"12 year old boy\" using a mic on the PS3, I never thought I would find a group of people that made me comfortable enough to voice chat. It was easier to vc on the PS3 because I played with more family than strangers.", "link_id": "t3_ed7v7z", "time": 1576859261}}

I don't do well in social situations as is,  treating me like trash when I'm trying my best is not gonna help anything. It's all about proper communication for heists. Even if I am not using a mic, it's not hard to send a DM with appropriate information beforehand. To me, it's just a game NBD if ya fail. Sure, I guess you lose a little of the payout each time you retry. But, still...It pays to be patient with other people, you never know what they got going on. The more pressure you put people under (especially if it's negatively) the more anxious they can become.

{"fbgqouw": {"text": "Right there with you, in the same social anxiety boat. I played GTA V on PS3 before I got it on PC, which taught me voice chat is not a good idea being female. By the time it came out for PC, I had already started college and that's when the heist were released.  Unfortunately, I was unable to do the heists (except for the very first one) bc I was busy with course work and only had time to play during summers. After I finally graduated and was able to sink time into the game, everyone had already gotten bored of the heists and did them a ton of times. NBD, I didn't need the $. But, I tried to help a \"friend\" out on the D.Day heist (they did it solely for the big $) and all they did was get pissed at me because I wasn't keeping up very well. I was staying alive but, I wasn't accustomed to doing them, what's goes on, or where to go. So, I didn't know them like the back of my hand like most players. Thus, they were new to me and this person ignored that fact (Yes I did warn them I was clueless). Because of this experience happening at least 3 times, I've decided the heists aren't worth the time, stress, and anxiety, especially the social anxiety that comes with using a mic, and even more so if it's strangers. It's damn near impossible to do a heist without voice, typing takes too much precious time.Thanks for reading my bs.

I did FINALLY find another therapist a few months ago I thought would be a great fit, but it turns out she wasn't supposed to be on the list my insurance gave me. However, she did see me for the 3 EAP appts and sent me on my way bc she refuses to work with Cigna. (EAP = employee assistance program that covers 100% of the first 3 appts.) I have decided to NOT go the EAP route again. I still haven't made an appointment for testing yet, so I am not sure what's available. I was told my doctor needed to send in a referral and the facility will call me to schedule an appointment. Unfortunately, the facilities she gave me were dead ends. The first doesn't accept Cigna, second isn't taking new patients. I was seen 30 minutes after appt time and mine ran over my usual 20 m, so it was rushed more than usual. I had to stay after with the receptionist in hopes to have better luck with Cigna's list of providers that is accepting new patients, we did not. So, we did talk about what's going on, but I didn't get a chance to get any info on the actual testing.

You don't have to have stock in your MC businesses to generate stock for the NC, that's only for selling that particular MC business. You only need to *own* the MC property to generate the nightclub stock. I have 3 of 5 MC businesses empty and the NC fills right up just fine. No upgrades are necessary for each MC property if your not going to run the MC businesses, but you should upgrade the NC asap for max earnings.Here's a big NC guide to explain it all, there's so much to know!https://www.reddit.com/", "link_id": "t3_blfdzf", "time": 1557167806}}
{"emnzz2y": {"text": "Warning: I've written a essay, but there's so much to know!Honestly, it's best to only run the most profitable MC businesses than it is to run the cash or docs when buying supplies. There's barely any profit made with those 2 bc the payout is so low. I have all 5 MCs only for the NC to run. I only buy supplies and sell coke and meth, and leave the others empty to generate the NC stock.  Weed makes a little more profit than those two, but I've did the math by tracking all my earnings and major spending for several weeks and came to the conclusion to only have weed, cash and docs for the sake of the NC, and sell bunker, coke, meth, NC and occasionally cars foe me profit.I got rich quick this way + helping friends with sells. It's much easier to buy supplies and saves a lot of time, especially if you're trying to work with cargo, cars, bunker, NC and MC businesses. It's a lot to keep up with + a lot of time stealing supplies  But, if you got a big group of people, stealing supplies can fill up in one supply run. No need to upgrade the businesses if you're not going to sell, but you should definitely upgrade the bunker and nightclub fully to make $ faster. I saved up 12 million to buy the NC and upgraded it over time when such things were or on sale, next thing I knew it was 3 months later and I nearly tripled my income. FYI you need bunker, CEO crate warehouse + all 5 MCs businesses to fill all the NC stock bars. Once you get all of them it does take 66 hours as seen by many people in have chat (fully upgraded I do believe) to fill it 100%. That's a lot of game time, but running the game afk in between playing sessions helps a lot. Personally, I either sell individual full bars, or special orders over 100k from the NC. I've gotten it full before but that's a lot to risk all at once. Nice payout tho! Also, if you change your dj at the end of each GTA day, you don't have to run those popularity missions. When you get the notification $ was added to the safe that's a sign to switch. You might have to do one or two missions to get it full without having to wait the 40 some minutes for the day to change, but once you get it full, changing the dj on time makes popularity effortless. The $10k daily safe $ is the exact cost of the dj, given you're at max popularity. 10k is the max, gets lower by $2k each bar of popularity you're down.Sorry for the flood of information, just excited to share what I know, lol.

People will find some way to shame people regardless. I was taken back by someone saying I was skinny shaming earlier when I've been thru it and wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, ugh! It's emotionally draining to deal with it bc as you said your body has other plans, not entirely the fault of the person or their habits. Have you considered talking to a doctor?  I know it's hard to talk to people about such things, but, maybe they can offer something to help you. I was always afraid to bring it up, but, I didn't have to after my diagnosis. The meds seemed to even me out in simpler terms, bipolar disorder had me all out of wack chemically. (not saying the same could be for you, but, discussing it could bring forth some solutions to the issue.) I grew up poor so I just assumed we were so skinny bc we didn't get to eat much outside of school. But, as I got older I stayed skinny and stayed hungry. Turns out, I'm bipolar and once I got set up with a solid medication regimen, I eventually started gaining weight. I'm not an expert by any means, but, it seems once I got chemically balanced I could gain weight... 2 of my 4 meds cause weight gain and increased appetite so that of helped.

On the left I list the name of the recipe underlined and each item needed is listed under. On the far right space (other side of line), I list non grocery items then grocery items not related to recipes.I used to use my phone, but it was hard to not get distracted and to keep organized. However, I do list the dinners for the time period in a list via Google Keep app with the dates meats need to be used by to easily keep track of what to cook when (helps out the \"oh shit I forgot about the meats\" fail and waste). My husband is a list contributor so he can see what meals to chose from. Another thing that's helped my organization is storing digital \"printed\" recipes in Microsoft's OneNote (there is a free version). From there I have a master list of recipes where I choose and copy the recipes over to a section labeled for the month, that way I don't have to search the master list each time I need to find a recipe. This section is cleared and label changed monthly to  reduce clutter. For recipes found in books or my binder of magazine recipes, I include the page or section with the recipe listed in Keep to find easily.Apologies if it seems complicated, but it really has saved me so much anxiety! I will simplify so not overwhelming, so sry if I caused u to be overwhelmed).-Use a notebook to plan dinners and make shopping easier. *Bonus* I learned in college that we retain more information writing versus typing. Therefore, writing a list will help shopping less chaotic as we remember more of what we need.

Anytime I've mentioned how therapy has helped me through this or that, they clap back with something about how they don't like being told how to live their life and it never worked before. They also tell me to save my $, therapy is pointless. To which I disagree, but mental health care coverage is insanely hard to navigate, can't say I blame them for not dealing with it.Story time:I'm currently in a conundrum with my insurance and EAP (Employee Assistance Program that covers 100% of my first 5 introductory appts.) coverage for a new therapist, and I'm doing better than I thought I would without therapy. But, I also miss it and know I need it. Currently waiting for insurance company to respond to my complaints. Long story short, my previous therapist decided to no longer practice and in attempts to find a new one, I requested a list from our insurance company. Ended up being a very outdated list (hundreds of Drs) of in network doctors who take the EAP.  Sadly, the list was NOT specific to my husband's company/plan. So, after several calls to make appointments, then denied, I finally find a doctor that's actually seeing new patients. Just 4 days before the appt., I call to verify EAP coverage and sure enough this doctor was listed  but NOT for my husband's company. I had to get in touch with a 3rd party company, who cannot communicate with the insurance company (some bs reason). I was offered only 3 doctors... 1 is in another state and the other two are way out of the way. Bc of a high deductible plan, I'm responsible for 80% of the costs until it's met, which is why the EAP coverage is so important. Since therapists usually schedule new patients for once a week visits for the first month, that's a lot of cash all at once. But, I see my psychiatrist often, she's amazing and is highly impressed w my progress in many areas... despite being out of therapy.Apologies for the rant, and thanks for reading. It's been so frustrating and have nowhere else to vent such things since deactivating Facebook.TL;DR: navigating insurance plans and coverage is an absolute pain, especially when it comes mental health. High deductible plans and a disorganized system makes it nearly impossible to get adequate care. Also, Cigna is a nightmare to deal with!", "link_id": "t3_ao3qrx", "time": 1549551632}}

{"e55zr3h": {"text": "Ah, okay, thanks! I really don't mind stealing supplies, it's fun and even more now with a few new missions variations in the mix. This is my setup: I have 2 warehouses (16 slots/62 slots), a vehicle warehouse (with several collections almost complete), fully upgraded bunker, and a fully upgraded weed business. I know it's not the most profitable, but I just bought it for new things to do and bc I toke in real life, lol. I don't have a massive car collection or many heavy duty items. Other than the Kuruma, I have 3 other sports/super cars, also a fully upgraded Insurgent, APC, and a Buzzard. I am looking to buy something better than the Buzzard, it seems to be less durable than it used to be.I have several friends to help with supply runs and deliveries, so maybe others don't and this is why they'd rather spend. I guess those who choose to buy instead of steal value their time/money differently than I do. I have to use my time wisely bc as a stay at home parent, I have a million other things to do and play in between cleaning/chores. So, to me regardless of this, I'd rather spend *my time* than spend $75k of hard earned $, for what 4-6 times to fill up bunker? Haven't really did the math other than I know estimated 6 fill ups x $75k = $450,000 and that's nearly half the profits of a full bunker delivery.  I have not taken research into consideration bc it's hard to factor in that to the profits, but idc, the weapon upgrades are worth it. I did a trial of buying supplies when i got the free money from the livestream giveaway, but I felt like it was dipping into my profits. Surely I don't burn through $75k in armor and ammo that fast. So to me, stealing is more profitable bc I don't have to pay anything upfront for supplies, only my time, armor and bullets, which is far cheaper than paying $75k after what is it now.. the2 hours playtime (via a random player in chat) it takes to burn through a full bunker supply bar?", "link_id": "t3_9ayl6b", "time": 1535735286}}

I manage bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, and non-military PTSD with meds and therapy, so I guess the after effects of my childhood. Anyway, that's hard enough as is and adding a kid to my responsibility list has really taken its toll given my sensitivity to anything remotely stressful. I wish I had advice to give, but we're in the same boat, except I just have the one child. Good luck, my friend. All we can do is do our best to set a good example regardless if we're dieing inside.

{"d5cf0k4": {"text": "I was glad to be able to engage in the conversation, I am not the best at socialization. But, I try to connect with others who share my struggles because we're not alone and it helps both sides to be there for one another. Especially those who can understand and sympathize with situations. I am sorry I neglected to see this sooner, after getting trolled over something else, I took a few days off from internet communications. I am sorry you're experiencing a breakup. It can be difficult when the person you care for the most and who knows you better than anyone decides they cannot continue. I have had many breakups, mostly due to cheating, which is why I gave up on dating women. Being a woman myself, I can relate to women and all, but dating them is a different story. I commend men for putting up with our crap, bipolar (etc.) or not. Even though your ex knew you and understood the issues, was the relationship healthy? Sometimes it can be hard to realize letting go is the best thing, I know I have had my fair share of toxic relationships, and at the time, I thought they were my soulmate and no one could ever understand me better. However, I was not medicated during this time, I am just now on my 3rd year mark of being on meds. I feel the pain of shit therapists, it took me a handful before I found one to fit my needs. Hang in there!As for my mother, after she gave up custody of me at 15/16, I only heard from her once and that was to visit my sister, which was put in foster care via her 3rd husband when I was 19. Once I became pregnant, she tried to be mother of the year. I was grateful for her help during that time bc my fiance refused to let me work 10-12 hours a day and money was tight. I have since moved ~800 miles away, but when I go to my hometown, it's difficult to avoid her when I am seeing other family members. And, she pays for my phone, which she bought for me as a gift when I first moved. She holds that over my head and threatens to cut it off, at this point Idgaf. I play nice because she's vindictive and spiteful, it's hard telling what she'd do, especially bc she tries to be hip and young by being friends with the majority of mine on Facebook. This stems from her husband's prior involvement in a local coffee shop and catering company. She purposefully hides stuff when she's around to trigger me because she likes to laugh at my struggle. That's why the last few visits have been limited, my daughter stays with her, we stay with close friends. I cannot be around her for long without her causing me trauma. If I cut her off, which I basically have as we don't talk and I neglect to tag her in photos of my child on Facebook, it's hard to tell how she would retaliate. She loves public humiliation of me, always has. I keep the peace as best I can to avoid her turmoil and it's hard to at times, especially when my grandmother's death was blamed on me because I moved. She died the day after my birthday going on 3 years ago. Is it bad I cannot express or feel love towards her? I loved my grandmother dearly and she was basically my mother, but I just cannot find it in me to forgive and forget and pretend to love my mother. She had the nerve to tell me that my disorders are at the fault of my grandparents because they raised me on routine and order. TF?! I don't understand her logic or mentality. But, I just focus on my stability and raising my child in a better environment. Thank you so much for your encouragement and allowing me to vent. I wish you the best!", "link_id": "t3_4s1anr", "time": 1468527531}}
{"d55t36t": {"text": "From what little I learned about bipolar disorder in the college course Introduction to Psychology, bipolar disorder is hereditary, but mostly from the father's side. He's not in my life, other than on Facebook and I didn't meet him until my high school graduation. In recent years, his wife has informed me that her sons have it and it's believed my father does and it came from him. As for my mother, she is something else... she's always been abusive and violent towards me and my siblings. Her obsession is murders and serial killers. Nothing wrong with that, but as a young child, I was forced to watch horror movies or anything to do with crime/murder and nothing else was allowed to be on TV.  When she came to NY to visit when I first moved here, I woke up to her watching The Human Centipede with my daughter who was just a few months over 1 year old. Yes, she's too young to know what's going on, but still it's way too twisted for her to see. My mother doesn't see and issue bc I was exposed to such things. I am a freaking train wreak with all of these disorders. She blamed my disorders on my grandparents bc they raised me as a baby to be on a specific schedule..blah blah blah something to do with my grandpa being in the military. She had me at 15.To beat it all, she has a master's degree in social work and was a counselor for addicts for 10 years. She left the one guy I see as my father (2nd marriage) still to this day, who was good to me and my siblings, for the asshole who is head of children's services at the local DHHR in my hometown (3rd). When she got with him, the several infractions with CPS magically were cleared from her record. (Too many horrific stories about that time in my life, but I escaped her custody at 15) She cheated on all of her partners with the next one, 3 kids... 3 different dads... married 4 times. The first was my sister's dad, who ended up being a child molester (my male cousin) and she DEFENDED him in court, when he was convicted anyway (12 counts). Now, she on her 4th marriage and the guy is only a few years older than me. I have so many horrific memories, I am surprised my therapist doesn't need therapy. Thanks for reading! I tend to talk a lot bc I have little to no social interactions.", "link_id": "t3_4s1anr", "time": 1468091723}}

All of a sudden she's married to some random guy she met at college (4 years ago). No problem with that, other than she is still being flirty with A and letting him know she wants to be with him. She calls or video chats anytime she's drunk to let him know she misses him and other typical girl shenanigans. Well, recently she has somehow convinced her husband to have an open relationship so they can be married and she can be with A. Well, A is not having that, he wants her and only her, or not at all. So, she stopped talking to him completely.  A is a great person and one helluva catch and in my opinion, L is being highly irrational towards him.

{"d55qtoa": {"text": "I feel your pain! Anytime I have feelings or an opinion regarding this or that, I am automatically having an episode. Sometimes, on a scale of 1-10, I am at a 3 or 4 and am treated like it turned it up to 11. Prime example: We went on a trip to Hershey Park (from NY to PA) for my daughter's 6th bday last year and met my mom, her bf, and my niece there (they travelled from WV). First thing we did was take my daughter on her first roller coaster (niece was too small at 4) and when we got to the front of the line there were only 2 seats left and 4 in our group. So we could all go together, I turned to offer the group of 2 behind us the remaining seats. Only to see my mother and daughter going on without us, even though I said \"we'll see if someone else can fill the seats\". My intentions were to share the experience of my daughter's first rollercoaster ride with her, but my always-trying-to-make-me-upset-mother went on without me and my fiance. We had to ride in the next line of cars. When we met up with them, I plainly said to my mother that she hurt my feelings by going without me. So, she started yelling and cussing at me telling me I needed to take my medication and quit trying to control everything. I was hurt and upset, not angry and raging mad. She instead disappeared for 3 hours and refused to come back and spend time with us, which she sees us every other year or so. Making it all seem like I am the problem. I had taken my meds, even additional anxiety meds to cope with the crowd, and simply brought up my feelings were hurt. To me that's no reason to flip shit and make my anxiety worse by yelling at me and cussing at me in front of my child, and deserting her on her birthday. I guess she couldn't apologize for or accept the fact she did something wrong. She never even apologized, but I was expected to. TF?! She also pulled a similar stunt during my visit for Christmas when I had a right to be upset she allowed her alcoholic bf drive me and my daughter after heavily drinking.  It seems as though people want to assume the worst in those of us who struggle with bipolar disorder. I am also trying to manage PTSD from my traumatic childhood, anxiety, and panic disorder. My mother knows this, but seems to always trigger me and make me out to be the problem.So sorry for the rant, I felt as though I needed to share. I wish you comfort and peace.

{"cav359v": {"text": "Friends... I have them, well sorta. I don't have many friends where I live now,which is 800 miles from my hometown, it's just so hard to meet people when I don't really go anywhere. I go for walks and to the playground but I never run into the same people.I am not going to go through my life story at this time, but maybe eventually. Once I moved back to my hometown and got back together with my now fiance, his friends became my friends, and my old ones were on a different path. Anyways, I am not close enough to them to talk about things like this. Same with my family. I talk to my mom a lot now, but she really didn't have much to do with me after I moved into my Grandparents house at 15, until I became pregnant at 23..  She's a completely different person now, but we don't talk about the past.My support system should be my partner, but doesn't have much to do with me except some TV sometimes, or when he wants sex. It's always good, but he's just so disconnected from me, I am just not in the mood. I have decided attempt sleep on the couch so can get up at a decent hour. I don't sleep well at all, but once I am finally out, I just cannot get up. However, if I sleep on the couch, I will wake up easier because it's brighter and the noise of Kevin getting ready for work. Since I am already up so late/early I am thinking of just staying up and making some breakfast, which is usually a weekend thing, since I am not an early riser. I also still need to pack his lunch. I do everything I can for him, but yet I get nothing in return.  ", "link_id": "t3_1hjqxc", "time": 1372842504}}
{"cav31yb": {"text": "**Apologies if the post is messed up, I switched to a tablet.** Thanks for commenting! I needed a smile and the encouragement! I know he loves me, but I do believe I have pushed him away. I have anger issues, due to the abuse I went through as a child. My mother was very abusive, along with my older cousins I grew up with. I guess you could say I was bullied. I've been walked all over my entire life. I understand that suicide is not an option, and I doubt I will ever harm myself again. However, I cannot help but think about it sometimes. My daughter keeps me going, but at the same time she drives me crazy. She's such a sweetie and has fun with me no matter what we're doing. I do believe the main problem is my relationship and I am not sure how to, or if I can, fix it. I am also a late 20's student and have a job, and possibly a second job. My first job is only about 12-15 hrs a week, and the second is just a part time job. From the time I was 16 until I became pregnant I worked (way too much if you ask me), then returned to work for a year until we moved 800 miles away from our hometown. We have lived here since 2010 and I worked for a bit, but it was an unstable work environment so that's when I quit work, went to therapy, and my therapist recommended online classes, and I got accepted and just finished in May.", "link_id": "t3_1hjqxc", "time": 1372841827}}
