Lol You don't have to be worked up to have a negative opinion on what someone else beliefs. You can disagree with out being angry about it. And the REASON is disagree with this particular point of view is because I find it to be an immature point of view. And that doesn't make me angry. and just because I think negatively about a particular belief someone holds, doesn't mean I think negatively about them as a whole. My husband and I disagree on a lot of stuff. Lol. And based on my personal interactions with other humans I don't believe the majority of people have unrealistic expectations. I believe SOME do. But, imo, most don't. However, I can see why you would disagree. You haven't met the people I have. And I haven't met the people you have. But once again...

But there ARE plenty of men and women who know better.

They do less harm to your body and have less effects on your organ function. And physical dependace can easily be monitored by a Dr specializing in pain management. Like when it's time to be done, being carefully weaned off with medical supervision. And maintaining doeses with a drs supervision. It's a different kind of dangerous. More like some people want to take more when they don't need to kind of thing. The danger with opiates is being grossly over exaggerated by media. I believe them to be dangerous only if you don't take them as prescribed by a medical professional... Just like any medication. In terms of physical damage to your body tho, they pose less risk than torodol when taken long term, although torodol doesn't create a physical dependace.  There is no merical pain management drug. You basically pick your poison. What works best for your situation physically, and what kind of trade off are you willing to make for pain relief.  I am in no way recommending one over the other.

I was young.. like 13. Im 31 now. I get it now tho. I cant say it gets \"better\". I will say i got better at accepting the bad as an important part of me.... i will say that the bad seems less stressful(???).. idk. I now have a really good support system. Great doctors. And take as much time as i need to maintain my mental health. (Sleep schedule, eating, exercise and meditation) I can say that i AM happy i stuck it out, ya know?

It sounds like you are doing an awesome job to manage your mental health... the thing is, bipolar depression is always gonna be a part of us. I find that on my bad days (which as i mentioned a a little less with the celexa) if i accept that its a bad day instead of trying to convince myself i HAVE to feel better, i am able to cope easier... i try not to be hard on myself... and take it easy.  idk. Honestly, it sucks, and its hard. But the bad days are part of us. Keep doing all the awesome things you are doing, and reach out to your dr for help...
