{"e0gmken": {"text": "Took a reply I made in the multiple sclerosis subreddit and altered it slightly for this post. My husband was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2013 and wanted to divorce because he didn't want to 'put me through' the uncertainty, the facets of disability that could prevent a 'normal' life, etc. I got mad and told him never to say that crap again. It's been hard, sure, especially after we had a child (turning 4 in August), but I cherish him in a way he still doesn't seem to quite believe or understand.I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1 mixed and rapid cycling episodes plus a few other things recently, but my unmanaged condition caused a lot of trials and heartache for both of us. Even still, he persevered. He believes in me when I don't. He loves me even when I go off the deep end, and is there to cushion my fall when I leap off proverbial cliffs.I believe in him. He is intelligent, kind, gentle, willing to try whatever new adventure I've decided to start (or support and embrace the changes my illness can bring). I love him so deeply that it hurts when my actions cause him harm or when his condition makes him feel pain, feel like a burden, feel worthless and depressed. Honestly I am scared for both of us. Neither of us know what our different illnesses have in store for the future. However, knowing that I have a partner who will take me as I am, even when I was not taking meds and barreling down paths full of bad choices, he stays by me, loves me, and holds me when I inevitably shatter and make life altering decisions that are difficult to recover from.We didn't sign up for life to throw this crap at us, but it did. Instead of giving up or shutting down, we take things as they come and try to adjust as best we can. We communicate. We genuinely care about each others emotional and physical wellbeing. We also adjust and make the best of the situation. Instead of being disappointed/upset that the beach is not an option, we make plans to take our daughter to the aquarium. (He can get a wheelchair and it is in the ac, and when our little girl inevitably gets worn out walking, she can ride the daddy express!) I want to make sure that we still get out and enjoy our time as a family and to savor every minute we get to spend living and experiencing life. It may not be what I imagined it would be years ago, but there is always a way to find a fun compromise and use the illness as a means of enjoying life in a different way.I don't understand how he can weather through the storm that is me, and he doesn't understand why I want him to be my partner and lover for life. I advocated his treatment and made decisions when he couldn't mentally cope. And he has done the equivalent for me.To anyone reading this, scared to be a burden or in a relationship or to have a family: you are worth it. You deserve any happiness you can find in life and you deserve to love and be loved and supported. If you want children, you deserve to have them and watch them grow, to teach them and in return savor the magic of life through their eyes.It isn't easy, but having my husband in my life makes it easier feel that living is worth it.Thank you, love.

My dad was very physically abusive to my mom, and was starting to turn it to my older sister (not his biological kid)  when my mom decided it was enough. I was 8 at the time. My mom and dad had a big fight with screaming, him punching, all that. My  2 older siblings and I were huddled on my sisters bed, just waiting for it to pass like it normally did. Something changed though. It went silent downstairs. A few minutes later, we crawled out on the roof because we saw the flashing lights of police cars. Mom spoke with the officer. We deemed it safe to go downstairs. My dad just stood in the door way, telling us he loved us on our way past. We overheard the officer talking about loaded guns hidden all over the house; under my parents mattress, in the bathroom, etc. They escorted us to a safe house and that was the last I saw of my father for many years. I still vividly remember the flashing lights, his silhouette in the doorway, thinking that no one would be celebrating his birthday with him next week. A silly thought, but it made me indescribably sad. I learned a year ago that he had written a letter describing his intent to kill us all and himself. My mom still has it, but I don't want to read it. About two months before this, my brother and sister were having a fight. Dad would put them against each other, but this was worse than anything he had done before. My sister hit my brother or something, so my dad chased her into her room, onto her bed and shoved her against the window. My brother had forgotten his anger and was begging dad not to hurt her. Instead of hitting my sister himself, he turned to my brother and hollered for him to punch her. My brother was crying, trying  to say no, but my dad was having none of it. I can't remember the exact threat he made, but my brother did end up punching my sister tears streaming down both their faces as I stood paralysed, fear rooting me into place. It took me a long time to get past my helplessness in those types of situations. The happy ending is that my dad moved to South America, and never plans to come back to the US . I've had no contact with him for years, although I've considered it just for closure. My sister and brother found spouses that make them happy and have kids, as do I.

Every year they do a reenactment of the war for independance and have women spinning wool and all kinds of fascinating displays and battles.South Lake, OR. Beautiful place up in the mountains where we used to get gallons of fresh spring water to take home.The deserts or Arizona have amazing rock formations and deserve a drive through.The Catskill National Park in NY has waterfalls and is gorgeous all year round. That applies to any national park in NY Tarpon Springs, FL. It is a sponge dock where you can buy authentic  greek food and buy hand rolled cuban cigars right on the docks. They also have tons of nifty little shops. I found an authentic nazi sword just opening drawers in this one cluttered curio shop!Go through the woods in North Carolina and Arkansas (Forrest City is where I lived for a couple years) in the spring and summer months. Beautiful scenery. I found persimmon trees, honeysuckle lining the forests, a rope swing on a hill that overlooked the whole town. Terrifying to ride, but breathtaking view.In Avon Park, FL, there is a freshwater sping called Denton Lake where the water is clear as glass and always cool (fantastic for the 98 degree summer average in FL!) And if you go a bit futher south, you will find Hammock Park in Sebring. It is a swampy area with small wooden walkways suspended above the marsh. I hope this is useful to anyone who reads it!

Dabbing will make it look more natural. If you feel you must rub it in, do it in tight downward circular motions with a foundation brush, that way the little hairs on your face won't be trying to stick out at unnatural angles.You might want to also get some concealer for more coverage power if the marks are very dark. Just put a tiny spot on the darkest areas and dab with sponge again to blend it in.Also, if it doesn't seem to stay well, use a bit if primer before you put on the foundation. And make sure you give a good 5-10 min after applying moisturize if used/foundation so that your skin can soak it in and it sets. I really hope this was helpful!Edit: Make sure the foundation you have matches your skin completely. Just take a small dab and swipe it on your chest.
