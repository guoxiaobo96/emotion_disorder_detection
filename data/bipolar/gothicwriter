As for my bipolar 2 meds, I take a very low dose of lithium and I take an anti-psychotic as needed. I actually think I am diagnosed correctly because I feel more stable than I ever have in my life. But I do agree with you that taking the lowest dose and the least meds you can is probably best. For me, the mania that I mean was definitely dysphoric and agitated. I didn't know at the time that it was mania but now I do.  My hypomania tends to show up as staying up very late and writing for days on end starting again early in the morning or I get mixed episodes. When I start to go down that mixed path, I take an anti-psychotic to ease out of it. I get a lot of irritability with my bipolar 2 which is also hypomania or I can just be up. Even when I have run out of Vyvanse I exhibit these behaviors and for years I have been very irritable as long as I can remember and totally off-kilter, so I definitely cannot pin it on the stimulant though my psychiatrist has me on the lowest effective dosage of it. I forgot to mention that I also struggled with binge-eating in the past so that was another reason for the Vyvanse and honestly it is the most effective medication I take for my eating issues. I tend to try to avoid thinking about all the labels that have been put on me and look more at what is effective in helping me.

{"ek1nz8u": {"text": "Look into food addiction and at ways to try to deal with it. there are things that I have learned are musts for me to be sane around food, let alone lose weight. I am on Vyvanse for binge eating and it has been a godsend. I weigh 30 lbs less than I did when I was at my high weight and 15 or 20 less than when I started Vyvanse. For me I seem to have a real biochemical issue with depression that likes to stick around. I really get a sense that you are dealing with some depression from your post because I know that feeling of everything being hopeless. I will also say that my whole life I was hungrier than my best friend or most people I knew my age. Many people in my family were the same way and are very large. I have always known that there are definite differences in people in terms of their makeup and how hungry they might get and or how they cope with food. recently I ran my DNA through Promethease out of curiosity about what I would find.  My DNA results show that I have high ghrelin and low leptin. no wonder I've always felt hungrier than it seems like others dead and why I didn't seem to have a stop button when I eat. In addition, I have about seven bad fto genes which are the big ones for ending up fat. With all of that said along with having ADHD I, I have used food to cope with everything in life. I don't blame my genes for making me fat but I blame myself for using food to cope for years. having the genetic propensity just gives me a lot more fire under my butt to actually deal with this once and for all--this being at least a hundred 30 extra pounds that I am carrying around. It is only in really listening to how I talk to myself and how I justify my life choices that I am making some progress and not losing a few pounds only to gain it back again as I had been doing for months in a row. I know that I must eat breakfast with protein in a decent amount every morning and drink plenty of water every day just as basic starting points. I must also avoid simple carbs and eating a lot of sugar too or I get that hungry feeling most of the day. I count calories and I just shoot to get below what I have expended. I also started at just trying to move 5 minutes a day and now most days I move at least 15. I got really serious about all of this in mid January. And my body is changing and even as big as I am and with only losing about 6 lb, I have had a couple of people comment already that I look thinner. This is a really slow change but victories build on victories. I would also suggest therapy which has helped me some but I don't feel yet that I have found a really good eating disorders therapist though I would like to since I definitely have struggled with binge-eating disorder. Having a psychiatrist is a must because I definitely need medication to help me with my appetite in general. The rewiring part of changing the ways that I think is more up to me and working on that is helping immensely. I would encourage you to get help with the mental end of all of this. I didn't get morbidly obese because my brain was functioning well. The depression and other things made it just the opposite.Sorry for the book, but I'm hoping that something that I said helps.

{"e37kmnm": {"text": "Side effects are that I have to actually take my Vyvanse in two doses because I have underlying anxiety as well. Splitting it into works for me because otherwise if I take it in one dose it makes me to up and I get very cranky. That could also be due to being bipolar 2. It's not really clear but Vyvanse helps with my energy levels which are low because of bipolar 2, the binge eating, and a little with depression. When it wears off late in the afternoon I can feel a little bit of a dip but my other meds usually cover for that. Another option is just drinking a cup of tea or something like that. another side effect for me is that I have a fast pulse but I had that before I got on Vyvanse. so my psychiatrist decided to kill two birds with one stone and treat my anxiety and my fast pulse with a beta blocker called propranolol. I feel so very different taking that and I'm just much calmer and my pulse is where it needs to be, too. I can tell you that Vyvanse is a very smooth drug, and it has very few side effects for most people versus something like adderal. I can also tell you that I have been on three ADHD meds, and Vyvanse was the only one that really touched my eating. I forgot about the Strattera that I was prescribed by the first psychiatrist I went to who didn't really know what he was doing. In other words, Vyvanse is the first line treatment for binge eating disorder. I've also been on Topiramate for the binge eating, but it makes me depressed and weepy and I don't recommend it unless you find that it gels for you. I it has a lot of side effects. The upside is that it makes it very easy not to overeat, and I lost weight on it almost seemingly with no effort. I just seem to be allergic to it or something even at extremely low doses so I don't take it anymore.As far as actually getting a prescription for Vyvanse, I would honestly recommend that you go to a psychiatrist and get checked out in general for ADHD, bipolar, depression and other stuff because usually there is something underlying the BED, unless you have some history of sexual abuse or something like that which I've read is a big factor for BED.", "link_id": "t3_92osdp", "time": 1532819874}}

{"e2k5j0n": {"text": "Definitely. Before my bipolar 2 diagnosis the only thing that started to help me truly quit binge eating and lose 20 some pounds was Vyvanse. Then my psych nurse and I knew there was more going on because I still had depression underlying the ADHD. I got briefly on the med Merry-Go-Round when I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in April. I can tell you that Lamictal made me eat sweets like a fiend, and I always had the impulse to stop and get drive-thru something. I gained a few pounds on the brief time I was on it and just felt like I always needed something to eat. Now that I'm on Latuda, I'm actually starting to lose weight on a stable dose. The short answer is that yes. I realize that a lot of my problems with eating and food have been due to moods and not being on the correct medication. I don't know what else to suggest for you other than exercise because that really helps keep my appetite in check even if it is only 10 minutes a day. I can tell a huge difference in what I eat and what I crave on the days that I exercise by 2 pm. I just have less of that pit of craving in my gut in general if you know what I mean. I realize some people don't but I think people who have binge eaten or really struggled with weight will know exactly what I mean. By the way, the bipolar has kept me from ever having an exercise routine or even feeling like exercising on a regular basis. in the last month and a half on Latuda, I have managed to start an exercise routine of about 4 days a week without a lot of trouble. I just shoot for 10 or more minutes a day and most days I do more than that. so yeah we're back to meds. I was very obese before I got on Vyvanse and I continued to struggle until I had my bipolar 2 diagnosis and got on a weight neutral drug that actually lifted my depression.

Psych nurse added 25 milligrams of lamotrigine to the Vyvanse I already take (to be titrated up) and she added 10 mg of Propranolol for anxiety. The Propranolol definitely does not wire me up, but something is. I'm only sleeping 3.5 to five-and-a-half hours a night and cannot shut my mind down. My normal is to sleep six and a half to seven and a half hours. Last night, I was up till after 2:30 a.m. on Ancestry. Ugh. Thoughts? Could it be the Lamotrigine? My Promethease test says that I am sensitive to anticonvulsants and I know in the past when I took Topiramate I couldn't tolerate it more than 25 mg per day, and that even makes me terribly sleepy.The upside is that I have been much more productive at work, and I have felt happier overall and less depressed. But I have been shouty in the early afternoons. I would love to hear what you think since I'm new to all of this. My appointment with nurse again isn't until close to the end of May and I need to sleep before then.
