I took the meds for 2-3 years but then i ditched them because I didn\u2019t know anything about BP, did not think I have it and because I thought that my family problems were the cause of my mood. Since then I\u2019ve always had these periods when I would get burnout and then get out of it and start another major project like n business or whatever. I didn\u2019t know that I had depression because I thought you have to be sad to have depression. So now a couple of years after my first diagnosis, I land in hospital again after a huge manic episode and gets diagnosed again. It took me a long time to get to terms with my diagnosis but I am getting great treatment now and doing a lot better. This is maybe my biggest regret in life. Going off my meds. I lost so much in terms of enjoying my life, relationships, businesses and time. So much time lost. Most people like to cling to their euphoria like Gollum clings to his precious ring, but at what cost? If you don\u2019t get proper treatment you will become a ghost of your former self. BP is progressive without medication. The episodes get more frequent, more severe and more destructive as time passes. Also, don\u2019t diagnose yourself.

The important thing first is to get the right help and take good care of yourself. To honest, I did feel embarrassed at first but then  decided that I should really not give a shit about what other people think of me. The people around you are temporary. Soon, new news becomes old news and before you know if, someone else will do something embarrassing. The best advice I can give you is to laugh at yourself and not to internalize or take yourself to seriously. If you can master that, you will save yourself a lot of pain and drama in the future. Remember that everyone had embarrassing stories and everyone will collect these stories, especially in varsity:)But really, always put your health first. I did not and I regret it now.

When this happens, I tell my husband that I am having some sensory overload and that I love him. He is very understanding because he knows it is a symptom and he does not take it personally. Communication is key and she should also be committed to be honest with you and to try to communicate it in a nice way. Both of you should educate yourself about bipolar to the max, especially in regards to dysphoric mania and lesser known symptoms. A caregiver should also be cared for and you should read some books or articles about that. Sit together and identify her triggers and make sure you know them and how to look out for them. Bipolar can be a deceptive illness and 90% of the time we don\u2019t realize that we are displaying symptoms. Because of the rape she is probably dealing with PTSD as well. She must try to find a therapist that is a fit for her. She should really consider this. Most of us also shopped around to find doctors we are comfortable with and that we can trust.

I was also diagnosed way back but ditched my meds because I thought it was a bunch of bullshit. Also, I think that psychiatrists and psychologist should educate their patients way more than they usually do. Every bipolar is unique and looks a bit different. I landed in the hospital because I became obsessed with my neighbor's because the sound it made drove me crazy. It did not bother anyone else. &amp;#x200B;I also think it is a bit dodgy to diagnose someone on a first visit. You might want to ask that doctor why he says you are bipolar and explain to you his diagnosis. I did that with mine.&amp;#x200B;It is however very important for every depressed person to get screened for bipolar. Before I got diagnosed I had to fill in a mood chart with symptoms every day for x2 months and tick my symptoms. If you want to, I can send it to you.&amp;#x200B;Also, the first thing you hear about bipolar 2's hypomanic episodes is that you would have an elevated mood, like being very happy or having a nice high. Most people have dysphoric mania that causes you to be very irritable en sensory sensitive for instance. This is why I did not believe. Most of these hypomanic symptoms are not easy to spot. My best friend is BP2. He would be a hermit most of the time but all of a sudden he went on x20 dates on Tinder. Behaving a bit out of character. I would get so many business ideas that I want to pursue. Other days, I am trying to learn French, Hebrew at the same time, while want to write, screencast and podcast all on the same day. I don't eat sweets, but the last time I got manic I bought myself chocolates every day... aka changes in appetite. I get forgetful, confused, can't sleep, etc.&amp;#x200B;Thing is, bipolar is very deceptive. None of these things are traditional red flags, but it can ruin your life if you don't take care of it.
