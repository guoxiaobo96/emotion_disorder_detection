{"fto86xf": {"text": "That's a-okay! It's a common challenge. Basically, typically, you talk to a therapist and you get drugs from a psychiatrist. The most effective treatment is usually when both work in tandem. Notably. if you go to a therapist, there may not always be a diagnosis, but if you go to a psychiatrist, it is likely you will receive one (if they deem you fitting for one of course). That can be a can of worms in itself, but you mentioned yourself that your status isn't normal. It might be time to escalate it. I remember living in a state like this and wanting to disappear in to myself. It was chaos and it felt bad. Please try the exercises, but afterwards, please call some doctors. Also, if you are feeling brave (and able) to call a few doctors tonight, I suggest you call and leave a message asking for an appointment on the answering machine even if it's the middle of the night. This way, in the morning, you cannot chicken out of it and say \"I don't need it\", which is certainly something I'm guilty of.

{"ftnins4": {"text": "Hello my dear. Fellow mentally ill girl here. I think I might be able to help, if only just a little. First, remember this: we live in a society where so many of us define our value by our careers. \"What are you?\" is not greeted by \"Happy\" or \"a person\", but a moniker of our careers. We are constructed to put so much of our emotional value (on top of our economical value) in to our careers that we forget who we are as people. We forget that our inherent worth does not stem from being a garbage truck driver, a doctor, or a grocery store clerk. Our inherent worth stems from who we are. I know that that's a really difficult thing to believe right now, but think about what you'd say to a friend. I'm sure you'd say the same thing. Secondly, you do not need to begin applying right away so long as your economic constraints are not in direct jeopardy. You can take time to lay in bed and you can take time to be sad. Please allot yourself that. Also allot yourself that it is not your fault. Everything is difficult right now and our economy is bracing itself for a hit. Eat your ice cream. Meditate. Treat yourself. I know that your first instinct will be, \"no I don't have the income to do that\". You have the income to buy ONE vial of nail polish that you like. You have the income to treat yourself to dinner for ONE night. Your soul needs that right now to get back on it's feet. Thirdly, if you need something to keep yourself busy and bring in some passive income, I always highly encourage applying to \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"undesirable\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" jobs. I put so many quotes because I believe no job is undesirable and everybody is valuable. Working at Target or at a fast food restaurant can give you much needed structure and stimulation while providing a little bit of income. Do not let yourself think that you've \"fallen\" to that job. You are still applying to other ones, and there is ZERO shame in it if it's something you want to pursue. Lastly, apply at your own pace. Remember how difficult it was last time and do not psych yourself up of kick yourself if it's hard. Applying to any job is hard-- plain and simple. Try your best every day. It will come.", "link_id": "t3_h0jbxo", "time": 1591841559}}

If you take the action of blocking them, the entire action of unblocking them will be more challenging. * You have your dog with you. Talk to her. Be with her. Love her. Notice the little glimmer in her eye, the feeling of her fur. Cherish all these moments. My dog is three years old and I try to do this still. Use your dog to ground yourself while loving her. * Jobs come and go. In western society, we define ourselves around our jobs so much. Try not to. I applied to so many jobs each day (literally until the last page of the job board) in my field, and it took me a few months. I felt like a failure, and now I'm in something I love. Every single day, try your best. Try your best and that is enough. Your best will ALWAYS be enough if you let it be. * Jobs pt 2. If you think that it would help you to get a part time job at Target or McDonalds or something that'll help you make some money while giving you structure, I highly highly encourage that. I will say it explicitly: just because you are going to a \"less desirable\" job after \"failing out\" of your desired job doesn't mean you aren't still applying for our desired job whilst making some money/having structure on the side. It can be rewarding and wonderful. * There is small shit that makes you happy, I know there is. Look for it. It doesn't matter how fucking tiny it is. It doesn't matter if it's a twang of happiness from how soft your sheets are or the taste of french fries or how you look in a particular outfit. Take that small thing and focus on it-- focus all of your being on it. It's okay to watch that extra episode. It's okay to wear that shirt again even if you wore it yesterday it fi makes you feel good. Love yourself. Make it through this one second with your small happiness, and then start again. * Develop rituals and habits! Sometimes, I'm depressed as shit and I don't want to take a shower, but I know that if I can make myself take a shower, I'll do my skincare and then I'll feel better. Make those habits. Condition yourself like your'e training your dog. Reward yourself for it. Condition happiness. * Lastly, again, life is not a race.

As a person with the disorder that roots for us to find love, **get the fuck out.** I know you love him, but get the fuck out. A lot of this behavior isn't abnormal per se. It is all within the range of things that might occur with the disorder. What IS abnormal is him not telling you about his diagnosis, lying about seeing his therapist, and gaslighting you. The rest of it... the job situation, the grandiose delusions, the alcoholism even, I can chalk a lot of that up to the effects of the disease. However, I will say this over and over again: **our illness is not an excuse for our shitty behavior.** It might illuminate why we behaved that way, but it is **not** an excuse and should never be viewed as one. This include the possibility of other people making the excuse for us. He STILL did all of this to you. Illness aside, it is not proper behavior to lie to/about you, gaslight, and blindside your partner who loves and cares for you. The proper way to love someone else, as a person with bipolar disorder, begins with acknowledging our behavior and getting fucking help. We have to understand what our behavior is doing to our loved ones. He has to see how he is hurting you. Then, he has to go get the help he clearly needs. This is a huge personal journey that he needs to take. You cannot make him take it. It's a manageable disease, but it's a profoundly selfish one. Flare ups are like black holes that consume everything else in my life and focus on me me me me me. It's not a way that I want to live my life. It's not a way I want my partner to have to live his life with. **It's a manageable disease, but he has to actually manage it.** Now for your questions: I, like many other, came to my senses when I hit fucking rock bottom and got myself psychiatrically hospitalized. It doesn't take everyone this bottom, but it's a fucking rude awakening. Before that, my behavior wasn't unlike your ex partners. It was the hardest awakening I ever had in my life. Who knows how long mania lasts? There are clinical averages that people can look up, but each individual is different. Now? I fucking regret it. I am medicated and in constant treatment, but there are episodes.

{"f7ac70x": {"text": "Aw man, I had really similar horrible puppyhood, and to some degree, similar worries. I now realize in hindsight that they were bogus and the result of lack of sleep and insecurity. I'm not saying this is the case for you, but it's what happened to me.Firstly, my dog always gets more excited to see both my boyfriend and my family members than myself. He is, plain and simple, not super affectionate with me at all. Cuddles are infrequent, and a snoot bump needs to be prompted with a command. With my boyfriend, he absolutely loses his mind to see him, loves to lay on top of him for hours, and is generally enthusiastic. With my family, he jumps up and down and whines whey they are leaving. Here's the thing though. My boyfriend is only here one day a week, and my family do not stay in the same gated off area as him. They are special-occasion people. I am his owner and seeing me every day is simply not that big of a deal to him. If I wanted a dog that acted that way, I would have gotten a Golden or a Berner or something. Huskies are not known to be very touchy-lovey dogs. While you may think she is being touchy-lovey with your boyfriend, it might be a guest response. Atlas loves me. GSDs are known to be a little bit more velcro of dogs, but he's not touchy-lovey. Again, I'm not a guest to him. I'm his owner. Seeing me is normal. However, he still follows me in to the bathroom and lays on the carpet while I shower, and when I am walking in the yard (or the dog park) I can walk away without looking and know he is at my heel. These may not be true for your dog, but they are examples of alternative ways to search for love. I had to work really hard to find these when he was younger because we were not bonded yet. If your boyfriend doesn't put that much effort in to taking care of the dog, I would continue this pattern if you truly want to spend your time getting the dog to bond with primarily you. When I raised Atlas with my ex, I was extremely strict with all of his interactions with my boyfriend. I made it clear that he was *my* dog. I hand-fed Atlas all of his meals, and accompanied playtime whenever I possibly could. I did ALL of the training. My ex was not allowed to teach him new commands. I valued every single bonding experience. I get it. My dog has IBD and had giardia when he was a puppy. Cleaning up shit to be ignored by the dog you cleaned up shit for is ... well... shitty. It's okay to \"lose it\". Having a puppy is HARD. One with this dynamic is even harder. I would go forward while working to build a bond, and watch out for puppy blues.

If I wasn't dramatic enough, he wouldn't stop. Little bugger was too smart and could tell I was faking. This was really frustrating because we would walk away from his play and face the wall to really hammer in the \"i don't want to play with you\". It was dramatic, but it worked.

I'd stay up all night paralyzed in fear and crying periodically. He will grow up. I cannot attest to how quickly. Sometimes, my 3 year old acts like a gigantic puppy. That being said, getting older doesn't instantly train the dog. It certainly makes them easier to handle in some respects (bigger bladder, less crazy puppy energy, etc.), but they won't suddenly know where to potty (or where not to potty) if they weren't taught in puppyhood. What all of this is to say is that just because they've grown in to adulthood does not necessarily mean you will not feel this fear. Lastly, as someone that has been diagnosed with both the things you listed, I'm sure you know that our lives are just harder than those who don't face challenge. It's unfortunate, but it's true.

Honestly, things really started to make sense and it was very helpful overall. I am able to radically accept certain things about him. However, I don't think I could ever dream of \"changing\" him. The love he provides me is in his own way and I'm okay with that. Yet, simultaneously, I've been known to ask for certain more emotionally intimate activities when I would like them and he does them because they make me happy. On the flip side of the coin, I've been diagnosed with a very volatile mood disorder. I try to stay even heard but it can be really hard. When emotional, people tend to misinterpret things and have selective hearing. We tend to blow things out of proportion and not be open to communicating. I can, no doubt, be frustrating to communicate with. I think a lot of moving forward in this department has  to do with practicing communicating, knowing when to walk away, and learning to say sorry. It's a lot of work and requires both sides to work at it. Lastly, you listed a couple of points of what love \"should\" feel like. I don't think it's healthy to allow anybody else to tell you how to articulate emotions. Both my partner and I are certain he loves me. He says \"my brain treats if as a fact. I love facts and they are indisputable, so it's a big deal for me.\" However, I don't ever think he'd say he's \"unable to live without me\" as that would just be factually wrong. I think it's up to you to decide what you think love is.", "link_id": "t3_cw4hj8", "time": 1566925093}}

{"etqkw8b": {"text": "Firstly, I want you to know that I love Addison with all my heart. I would go with a crate personally if I had the choice. I own a sedan and my dog is \\~80 pounds, so it's not an option for me, but I think crates provide fantastic containment and come in lots of crash tested varieties. That being said, they are LARGE, and cumbersome. They can become seemingly permanent fixtures in your backseat, and I don't know if that's something you would want. I own the Sleepypod and I am actually INCREDIBLY happy with it. I got it for Atlas when he was roughly 8 months old and I like it a lot. My favorite part of the harness is that it prevents him from walking around and being a hazard. He is effectively strapped in to the backseat like he is just another passenger. That being said, it does take an amount of training, especially if your dog is accustomed to moving about the cabin. The dog should be able to comfortably sit and lay down in the Sleeypod without issue, but any further and it will trigger the seatbelts locking mechanism (that protects us during crashes!) Towards the beginning, Atlas did hit that a few times, hated it, and try to wrestle his way out of the harness. He succeeded once or twice with some method of randomly flailing until he pressed the button. After some training and someone funneling him treats back there for a while, he's good. I will say that it may not be as good for longer trips. Atlas has a lot of energy and doesn't like to sit still as he's quite young. This might be different if your Addison is more content to lay down, but if I go any further than 35-ish minutes, Atlas absolutely needs to be exercised first or... cue the flailing. In this regard, I would absolutely prefer the crate if I could have one. I've not used the Ruffwear personally, so I do not think I can comment on it.

Imagine me throwing two raw chicken drumsticks, a chunk of tri tip steak, a few strips of chicken liver, and some pork brain in a bowl. This is a meal that's not unlike what I'd feed Atlas (pre-supplements). In order for raw to be balanced, they need to eat bones. I know the idea of eating whole bones is weird for us people, but it's perfectly okay for dogs. You absolutely do not want these bones to be cooked or they have a higher chance of splintering and hurting the dog. * If it's been prebalanced, the bone will be ground down and safe for him to eat. Some people's dogs don't eat bones whole (just ground) because they are known as gulpers and can choke. Typically, ground is a \"safer\" option, but whole bones clean teeth which is really nice. You mentioned a huge pork bone. There are a few rules regarding bones in the raw feeding community and one of them is **no weight bearing bones** (unless it's a bird). This means things like ribs and shoulders and tails are okay, but you don't want femurs. Usually, those butchers bones are femurs or leg bones. This is because these bones tend to be harder and can fracture dog teeth if they are aggressive chewers.* His poop turning dry and crumbly after having a big bone like that is expected.

My dog has chronic gastro-intestinal issues and raw has saved him from needing steroids his entire life, and I give it so much credit. I **always** recommend a slow transition. Cold turkey really just ups the risk of an upset stomach with not very much reward even if it does work out. Since the dog hasn't eaten raw food before, you cannot know at all his it will react. Even a mall amount might cause GI upset and diarrhea, so it's always best to stay on the side of caution imo. Since you are using a pre-made mix, there isn't a way to transition the richest part of the diet last. The % you give him is based on his weight, activity level, and individual dog basis. In example, the guidelines I use say 2% for maintenance, and 3% for weight gain. I actually feed him 3% because that's what he needs given his activity level and who he is. For example, I know people who raise working dogs that eat all the way up to 5% because they are doing extremely taxing activities every day (think bite work).

He has this body pillow he likes to sleep on (I think it's cooling) that goes on my bed, so that's usually where he lays his head at night. He'll then like to put his face on a human pillow (like a little person!) so there's a little one over there for him. Then, I will give him lots of gentle scratches as he falls asleep.

It mitigates the fear of choking. However, Atlas has never ever choked on a bone and he eats tons of types. I do vary his meat sources, but a lot of dogs with sensitive stomachs owners don't. They say that their pups can only handle one protein per meal and they do rotate, but maybe weekly. This hasn't been my experience. My dog is 85 pounds, and I feed roughly 2 pounds a day.

{"eawx5f1": {"text": "Hello! I literally know nothing about PLE, but my boy has IBD so I hope I can offer some insight. Atlas has had digestion issues since he was 10 weeks old, and it has been a rough journey, but I am so proud to say that at 2 and a half years old, he is thriving at a happy and healthy ideal weight. I am beyond proud as there was a point where I couldn't believe this day would come. We're even off of steroids! Firstly, always keep his weight in mind. Weigh him regularly (every day if you can). It is shocking how fast it can get away from you and all of a sudden, he's just skin and bones and starving. It's crucial to stay ahead of the curve and keep in touch with your vet. More accurate information will keep you better informed. Secondly, read the poop. I am a literal poop queen. The poop is the most honest and pure measure of your dogs' digestive system that you will ever get. It will tell you so much about what's going on in their gut and it's status. Keep an eye on the poop. In fact, keep a fucking poop log that corresponds with what he's eating. It will help you track what works and what doesn't. If his appetite is still ravenous and you are still having diarrhea, I recommend continuing to see if you can find something that works for him. It can be extremely tough, but it is do-able. These days, Atlas is on a raw diet that I work really hard to maintain. It's not for everybody, and not everybody buys in to it, but it brought him from emaciated to where he is now, so he will eat this diet until his last days. It takes quite a bit of time, effort, and energy but it's all worth it for him. I like it because it gives me as much control over his diet as I could possibly have. I also see a ton of people that see success with hydrolyzed protein diets. There's a fantastic IBD dog facebook group that I highly recommend! Be very careful about treats. I highly recommend The Real Dog Box as their treats and chews are simply dehydrated meat. I am aware of what meats Atlas can eat, so I can give them to him without worrying about an episode. I do not let other people give him their treats as I cannot regulate them. I have a few supplements that you can toss in to your dogs bowl regardless of what kind of diet he's eating (kibble, canned, cooked, raw, etc.) * Raw Goats Milk: This is unpasteurized goats milk. It is nature's probiotic super-food. It is better, and tastes better than probiotic powder as well. He gets some each and every day, and it supercharges his gut. * Fish Oil, Kelp, Turmeric: Essentially, there are all anti-inflammatories. They soothe the inflammation in the gut. * Slippery Elm: This is miracle tummy tamer. I bust it out when his poo is getting a bit loose. I am also really careful to keep him as low-stress as possible. Obviously, we never want our dogs to be stressed, but a stressful time can really set off an IBD episode! Think, a move or something. If I were moving, I would probably board Atlas in a place he's familiar with for a few days while I get everything in order because he finds moving furniture and watching his home being taken apart stressful. I try to limit these stressful moments as much as I can. Lastly, as a \"what can you expect\" moment, I'd like to touch on what you can expect emotionally. Having an IBD dog has been really taxing on me emotionally at times. There have been moments where I've been in tears because of how sickly Atlas has looked. He's been skin and bones with no end in sight because he just wasn't digesting any food. He's been weak and frail, and it's broken my heart. I've felt inadequate and I've felt like I've failed him. I am here to say that it will pass. It will pass as long as you commit yourself to finding a solution and what works for him. There will be episodes. There will be times that his tummy just gets upset, and there will be diarrhea. He's in this together with you, and you guys can conquer this together.

{"eawvzkc": {"text": "Hi! I am an owner of a beloved ESA that happens to be a German Shepherd. Because I am a proud owner, [here is a photo](https://imgur.com/a/KQu7SD8) of the beloved shithead. Atlas is very special to me, and I absolutely think German Shepherds are the best breed in the world and I will take it to my grave. However, I am hesitant to recommend one to you based on the answers you've provided. I'd like to first ask the question of how you would like your ESA to function. In example, some people would like their ESAs to snuggle them when they are feeling down. Others prefer having a dog as the pup forces them to get outside. Personally, Atlas serves as an outlet for my obsessive tendencies (so that I can avoid placing them on people) and quite actually gives meaning to my life. Selecting a dog that is oriented towards you needs is very important! In example, if you wanted a dog that served the support function of comfort, you wouldn't want an aloof breed like a Husky. Thus, it's important to consider how exactly you would like this animal to support you. Generally speaking, I am always very hesitant in recommending German Shepherd to inexperienced owners. Although I got a GSD as a first time dog and it's worked out, I am absolutely out of the norm. Somebody once said \"German Shepherds are really easy dogs to screw up\" and I totally stand by that. Their naturally wary tendencies make them prone to reactivity and they are prone to being very high strung. Lots of Shepherds suffer from anxiety themselves, and if you were to have anxiety yourself, this may not be beneficial for you at all. In a lot of ways, it can end up hurting you. I saw that you were looking to adopt a younger pup. I totally think that getting Atlas at 10 weeks has forged a bond that could probably support the weight of a million sumo wrestlers, but I suspect this would be the same with any dog that I got. I also need to warn you that raising a puppy can be detrimental for those who face mental health challenges. Puppy blues are a very real thing, and not sleeping for a month straight while constantly being paranoid about accidents can really do a number on a person. This is something really important to consider. Furthermore, I stayed in a smaller apartment with my Shepherd for about a year without issue. However, this was because he was already a year old before we moved in and potty trained. Potty training from an apartment can truly be a pain in the bum. I also wouldn't really think of a young German Shepherd as an office dog. They don't really calm down until they're like 5 years old because... well just because. Atlas is a little ball of energy and I think he wouldn't do too well in an office. They tend to be higher energy and it can be a handful when in a space like that. it really is case by case though. They are also known for their endless barking and their inability to shut the fuck up. As far as dog breeds I would recommend, I really cannot recommend anything in good conscience until I understand better how you'd like the animal to function as a support system.

Theoretically, I wouldn't try to go pastel pink in one go even with a professional hair stylist. I would go a bleach out to blonde, and then try to go lighter after.

{"e99hroy": {"text": "Okay, I don't level that fast obviously, but I'm level 133 (slightly below you!) and I level once a day to once every two days. I suppose it has just a little bit to do with the fact that I was also actively trying to level before they reworked it, so I'm used to seeing slow progress and I have a lot of patience. I also don't ever manually grind because I don't hate myself. I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit of a dolphin, but I don't spend my crystals on auto-battles/exp boosts. I don't find those to be an efficient use of my crystals. Instead, I use them on vanity items and pets. Pets are really beneficial to training though. It's the difference between kill efficiency with buffs and without. I have S tier EXP crystals on and I try to increase my efficiency as high as possible. Basically, the faster you kill, the more exp you gain. This seems kind of stupid-obvious, but yeah. Therefore, the stronger you are, the faster you will level (assuming you are still doing the same map) up to a point of diminishing returns. Thus, even though I can do SF113, it's still more efficient for me to do SF80 because I can 1-2 shot them. Another great use of crystals is going to be getting the exp buff in fever. As long as you kill at a reasonable rate, your fever will be up at a good rate. I also train almost exclusively with bishop buffs as I have several friends I train with. Another way to really boost your exp over time is making sure your party is strong. If all 5 people are 1-2 shotting, you're going to level a lot faster then if only 2 people are. That's why private guild parties are really great. Lastly, hot time is a great time. I hoard all of my exp boosts and stack them all during hot time. Thus, for a bit of hot time, I'll be getting past 2x exp. I can level maybe 1-2 times a day during that period. ", "link_id": "t3_9v3j3j", "time": 1541638566}}

{"e8s4ycj": {"text": "Hello!  Firstly, please remember to breathe and take time for yourself. Take it one day at the time, and celebrate the little victories. I will say that I think one of your key issues is that you are regarding the mouthing with a lot of violent terms (i.e. \"violent\", \"retaliate\", \"defensive\", etc.). It is important not to regard this as malicious as much as nativity. This is how he interacted with his siblings. He does not know that our human skin is fragile and breakable. He doesn't know that it hurts. You have to teach him. It's going to (hopefully) help a lot with the frustration when you alter your viewpoint to see him as lost, scared of his new environment, and unsure of the world. I would not recommend the pinching of the mouth/nose area. I know that it works for some people, and I know that hand on tongue words for some people, but it's not what worked for my difficult dog, and it's not what this subreddit generally recommends.  Imagine someone telling you that you can't use your hands. That's what training a dog not to use his mouth is like. Each time you shove him hard, or reprimand him too harshly for this, he gets confused. He doesn't know that you're a safe person yet. He doesn't know what you're doing. He doesn't know what he's doing is even wrong. I always recommend emulating dog language. When puppies play together, if a puppy plays too rough, the other dog will let out a yelp and disengage play. This, over time, teaches the puppy that it is not okay to play rough and that, if he does, others won't want to play with him. It conditions him that his teeth are sharp and they can hurt. Thus, I recommend yelping and disengaging play when your puppy plays too rough. It teaches him not to be a dick. Now, I'm going to address your issues:* First, let's talk about \"self defense\". It is possible that he might be resource guarding or something, but at such a young age, it can easily be trained. You can also tell if this is the case by looking at body language and signs. Is he doing it when you're attempting to \"take\" something or is he doing it just because he's playing? Is he barking? Is there growling? Assess all of this and see if you can infer what is motivating this behavior. It is likely him exploring the world and not understanding how to interact with humans yet. I raised a herding breed, which are known to be notoriously nippy. It hurt so fucking bad. I regularly showed up to classes covered in cuts and bleeding. It just fucking sucked. The bot provides really great tips for bite inhibition, and all the advice I can really give is to keep at it. He'll get it. Just give it some time. * Yo, my dog is two and a half and his smartass is still like this. ~~I hate him.~~  Some dogs, like some people, are simply smartasses. If I remember correctly, JRT's are known to be intelligent shitheads. That's the downside of having a smarter dog. A smart dog will look for the treat and know that they won't get rewarded and thus won't do it, even if they *know* the command. The tip that I have is to be consistent. Although Atlas is a smartass and is absolutely more obedient with treat involved, when I put on the \"serious business\" command voice, he knows what's up. * Sometimes, I can ***see*** that Atlas hears me because his ears turn. He just chooses not to come when called because he is a fucking dick. Again, consistency is key. * My dog is *still* struggling with jumping, so I cannot really weigh in here. I will say that his \"violence\" will stop once he learns that it is **never** okay to bite people in that way. * Atlas did this. He didn't have a bed from there on out. At first, I felt really bad about it. Then, I realized that he slept on the floor most of the time out of his own volition anyways. He's also a toy destroyer. Over time, you learn to look for and purchase more durable toys. I can't really buy him cute toys, but I've learned to select ones that work for us! * Again, the bot has great tips. * The rest of these seem to be bite inhibition things, and should resolve once he learns it.

{"e8no06u": {"text": "God it's 4 fucking AM and I broke out my laptop again to reply to this.Disclaimer: I have made it partially through the Anime MHA and do not read the manga. Spoilers ahead.I will be disregarding the events that happened in Korra and assuming that Aang was frozen immediately after defeating Firelord Ozai. I will break this down in to several different sections in order to best illustrate my answer:**Moveset:**In order to assess if Aang can become the #1 hero, we must first review his moveset. With mastery of all four elements and their \"add-ons\" (lightning, blood-bending, etc.), Aang seems to hold overall power over a great deal of those who we see in MHA. In MHA, we see several elemental based heroes as well (Todoroki, ~~Babe~~ Bakugou (explosions can be considered fire... right?), Endeavor). The aforementioned three heroes are all wildly successful as can be illustrated through Endeavor being #2 (and later #1) hero. Todoroki and Bakugou are both considered very strong by the MHA world as can be evidenced by their placement in the Hero Tourney. That being said, although there seems to be ability to manipulate outside of them (i.e. Aang's air ball thing), the main method of element manipulation in ATLA consists of martial arts based movement. This may be considered a weakness in the MHA world as equipment modifications may be more limited. I do posit that Hatsume would think of something though.I would be as bold to say that the Avatar State may be able to trump everything I've seen so far in MHA based on the sheer power of it.**Symbol of Peace:**Aside from the moveset, we also must discuss the parameters that one may be considered \"#1 Hero\". As All-Might has taught us, being the #1 hero is not simply about defeating villains. Being #1 hero also means being the symbol of peace.As this is pre-Korra, the connections to previous Avatars is still intact and Aang has the ability to access their knowledge and such. This is extremely similar to the depiction of One for All and it being passed down from hero to hero. In many ways, the Avatar could be considered the #1 hero of his/her time. They are seen as a symbol of peace \"bringing together all nations in harmony\". In fact, the Avatar was such a symbol of peace that the opening narration said \"when the world needed him most\" from the viewpoint of Katara even before she met the Avatar. Aang seemed to handle being the symbol of peace for his time fairly well and I believe that he would be able to fill the role in MHA times as well given his ideals.Yet, his attitude towards heroism is closer to Aizawa's in my opinion. I do not believe Aang to be overly concerned with fame (given his Airbender Monk background) and he would not be a huge fan of all the attention. Although he has the ideals and power to become #1 hero, he may not have the right attitude towards limelight.**Against All Might:**I do not believe that Aang could best All Might based on All Might's standing alone. He has long been the symbol of peace and a new kid on the block, no matter how powerful, would be able to replace this. Additionally, All Might's absolute ability in the social aspect of being a hero is incredibly strong in this argument.**Against Endeavor:**I believe that Aang could overtake Endeavor as Aang has the ability of not only fire, but the other 3 elements as well. This is an oversimplification as the abilities have their different nuances, but it does seem like a skewed matchup. However, in the both the social and ideals aspect, I believe Aang would win out leading him to be #1 hero. In short, Aang is a lot more lovable and approachable than Endeavor is. Best Jeanist knew what he was talking about when he made Bakugou gel his hair down.**I am only as far in the anime as seeing Endeavor be #1. I don't have thoughts on Aang vs. anyone else.**&amp;#x200B;", "link_id": "t3_9sanjj", "time": 1540813348}}

{"e8ahvfw": {"text": "Everyone else here has given great feedback! (I\u2019m super happy to see that because there was a time when any raw feeding post was met with instant backlash.) I raw feed Atlas because he has every digestive issue under the moon and it works for us. Because of my experience, I will likely raw feed every single one of my dogs for the rest of my life *as long as it works for them*. Is it a good idea? It depends on who you ask. Although the phenomenon of raw feeding isn\u2019t at all new, there is extremely limited scientific research on it. Most of the evidence out there is anecdotal. I state this simply as a fact. Is my experience anecdotal? Yes, but I\u2019m not gonna stop feeding what I believe saved Atlas\u2019 life because some people dismiss my evidence for doing so. The thing about raw feeding though is that it\u2019s hard! It\u2019s almost like a second part time job in a way to me because of how I\u2019ve committed to doing it. I make all of Atlas\u2019 meals from scratch. This means a couple of things... 1. Meat hunting. Every week I browse grocery store circulars and hunt deals. Every grocery store visit I peruse clearance meat. I buy in bulk and I have a second freezer for it. (Lots of raw feeders deem it a necessity.) this is all an effort to keep it affordable. Raw feeding can get expensive quick, but by doing all this, I\u2019ve managed to keep it roughly the price of premium kibble. 2. Tracking: I keep a detailed excel spreadsheet because I have to make sure I have everything on prep day! 3. Math: depending on which model you follow, there are ratio guidelines to what your dog should be eating. Obviously these are guidelines and they vary dog to dog, but, in the end, if you are feeding too much bone for a month straight, it would not be surprising if your dog is constipated. Thus, we gotta do the math. It can get tedious when you are measuring and weighing large quantities. 4. It can get messy: once a month, I do meat day. It\u2019s a meat marathon where it looks like I murdered someone in my kitchen. I weigh and measure out two hundred pounds of meat in to individual bags to defrost each day for Atlas. Additionally, feeding time can be messy as well. I feed Atlas in my yard or in his crate if weather does not permit, but germs can be a worry for some. 5. Responsibility: this is the biggest one of all. If I make my own food, I have no AAFCO to regulate me. It\u2019s all on me. If my dog isn\u2019t getting complete nutrition, I\u2019m the only one there is to blame. For me, that\u2019s a lot of pressure, but it is worth it. Now, this is if you DIY. Much of this can be mitigated if you do permade. If you do do that, I want to implode you to ask lots of questions and still do your own research. Commercial premade is still very new and there are tons of companies out there that are not selling complete and balanced diets. Lastly, raw feeding a puppy is stressful. Their ratios will need to be adjusted weekly and they eat about a metric fuckton. In short, it depends on who you ask if it\u2019s worth it, but either way, it\u2019s a lot of work.

{"e81wcza": {"text": "There's quite a bit to unpack here, but I'm going to start with your main question about budgeting. Ideally, nobody would get a dog until they are absolutely ready to cover all of the costs associated including any surprise catastrophes. However, if that were the case, people would need to wait until a very late stage in life to get a dog. This isn't always the route that people wish to take as dog ownership is a lifestyle and some people desire to spend their 20s with a dog. As you have stated, you have a 12 year old son. I don't think that there is ever really a time to check all of the boxes and say \"yeah I'm ready\". I think there's a lot more to take in to account. In terms of your mental math, adoption fee works out if you are going to go the shelter or rescue route. If you are looking at going the breeder route, a reputably bred puppy will cost anywhere from 4 to 5 times that amount. In terms of vet visit, my vet is actually a lot cheaper than that. Pet insurance is also going to vary greatly depending on your breed and plan. Obedience classes are also going to vary. As far as dog gear and dog food goes, those are an endless sinkhole that I would absolutely not limit to the amounts you've listed. Growing puppies go through gear and toys and food like it's nothing. It takes a ton to keep a growing puppy stimulated which often results in tons of gear that we need to buy. As far as food goes, $50 monthly *might* be sustainable for that size of dog, but food is a really iffy thing. There's going to be a period of finding things that work for you individual dog and it can be much much more or less. I will say that my dog specifically cost exponentially more than that. In my dogs first year of life alone, he managed to rack up $4000+ in vet bills (?!??!??!), but it got mitigated by pet insurance. On food, he ate about $80-$100 a month. On dog gear... god I don't want to even think about it... possibly $200 for the first 3 months averaged out (crates, gates, and stuff are expensive). Please take this with the kindest of intentions, but having a dog growing up is incredibly different from having a dog on your own and being the primary owner. Growing up with a dog means that the training and fiscal responsibility likely fell mostly on to your parents. Having a dog of your own is much more difficult. Again, you've stated that you have a 12 year old, and I know plenty of dog owners that say that puppyhood was more difficult for them than infancy. In all honesty, costs aside, this doesn't seem like a great situation yet. Ideally, everybody needs to be on board in the family. A dog is a whole-house thing. Everybody needs to be on the same page in training otherwise the pup will be confused. It will mix up the dynamic of the home and it's important to present as a united front. It's a great idea to discuss training methods and ideologies with your dear husband before even getting in to looking at dogs. After that, I'd look in to the breed questionnaire and evaluate breeds for you. If not breeds, then some basic things (how much shedding are you guys willing to handle? how much barking? how much exercise is this dog realistically going to get? etc.) This way, you two will have a better page to go off of than just \"it should be smaller\".  In terms of dog breeds, please do not just pick according to size. In example, of the two breeds you've listed, Corgis are not great with cats. ", "link_id": "t3_9pg1ke", "time": 1539941033}}

{"e7suk0r": {"text": "Hi there! I want to preface this by saying that I am a raw food feeding lady. I am **not** opposed to kibble and I will never shame anybody for feeding it because it works! We have the AAFCO for a reason and people who feel the need to kibble-shame in my community baffle me. That being said, I do believe in what I feed and will be coming at it from that stance. **Your concerns:** * My dog is really sensitive as well. In fact, so sensitive that he's been diagnosed with several issues regarding digestion. What really helped us (regardless of raw or kibble) was extremely slow transitions. I would transition over roughly a week and a half, feeding 25% more every two days. If the stool started to get soft, I would backtrack a bit and work our way up. It was slow and I sometimes had to go back and forth for a few days, but I didn't push his tummy. In my experience, it always made it worse. Boiled chicken and raw veggies are perfectly fine short term, but I would be wary to feed them long term as they do not have a complete nutritional profile. Lots of people see success with canned pumpkin, but I didn't find it helped Atlas specifically. We do see a lot of success with anti-inflammatories, probiotics, and slippery elm powder.* I find that coat is really closely tied to diet. Something really easy that you can do is put fish oil in her diet. Just like it makes human hair shinier, it does wonders for dog coat as well. It also serves as a great anti-inflammatory. You can get the special dog fish oil, but human fish oil works just as well. It's literally the same thing, just marketed differently. Human is usually cheaper. Lots of people use the capsules that people take as supplements, but I personally like liquid because my dog won't eat the capsules. Both work! * A lot of pups do that I think. My dog was fucking obsessed with eating rocks for a while. I'm talking if I offered him a treat or a rock, he'd go for the rock. (???) For him, it really was a deficiency as he had an undiagnosed chronic illness. However, I don't think it's unusual for young dogs to like to eat random crap. My partner's family had a perfectly wonderful and healthy dog that just adored eating grass his whole life. There wasn't really a rhyme or reason for it. The dude just genuinely loved the taste of grass. Keep an eye on it. My dog grew out of it on his own. **The things you wanted opinions on:** * Here ya go: &gt;**Raw options** (Again, this is what I personally believe in so I do always leave some options):   &gt;  &gt;[Answers Pet Food](https://www.answerspetfood.com/): This stuff is extra nice because it is fermented which loads it with probiotics   &gt;  &gt;[Stella &amp; Chewy's](https://www.stellaandchewys.com/)  &gt;  &gt;[Vital Essentials](https://www.vitalessentialsraw.com/)  &gt;  &gt;**Kibble options:**   &gt;  &gt;Disclaimer: I am a bit out of date on kibble knowledge as I have been feeding Atlas his diet for over a year now. However, I am in many groups due to my pup's illness and I try to keep up to date on what works for other dogs.   &gt;  &gt;[Purina Pro Plan Sensitive](https://www.proplan.com/dogs/products/focus-adult-sensitive-skin-stomach-salmon-rice-formula): Purina gets a bad rap, but I actually know lots of dogs with IBD that do well on this   &gt;  &gt;[Purina Pro Plan Hydrolyzed Protein](https://www.proplanveterinarydiets.com/products/ha-hydrolyzed-dog-food/): Hydrolyzed protein is pricy, but it's something to look in to if your dog has issues with nearly everything. It's about as sensitive as it gets and this is the go-to kibble for IBD pups in my experience. * The issue is that every dog is sensitive to different things. It's a bit difficult to just come out and say which ingredients are \"good\". I will say that things that are fermented are loaded with probiotics which are really great at aiding the digestive system. * Like I mentioned up there, as slow of a transition as possible with plenty of stool hardeners available.* I like them. I have some that work for Atlas that get added to his food when the stool starts to get loose to prevent IBD episodes. I will say that my evidence is anecdotal and just like with human supplements, your mileage may vary. I always encourage everybody to do their own research and only feed what they are comfortable with. &gt;**Fish Oil:** It is nice for the coat and serves as an anti-inflammatory. Long term, it's supposed to help a bunch of other stuff too, but these are the reasons why I feed it.   &gt;  &gt;**Kelp:** It's supposed to contain lots of vitamins, help with coat, and help with metabolism.   &gt;  &gt;**Raw Goats Milk:** It's one of the best sources of probiotics you can find anywhere. Also, my dog thinks it is yummy. You can also get plenty of probiotics in powder form, but I like using this as a daily. I do add additional probiotic powder when needed though.   &gt;  &gt;**Turmeric:** It's an anti-inflammatory and assists in aiding function in the liver.   &gt;  &gt;**Glucosamine**: This one is for his joints.   &gt;  &gt;**Slippery Elm Powder:** This stuff was a game changer for Atlas. I think it's made of magic. In short, it soothes the digestive tract. * Talk to your vet and see what he/she recommends! Some people feed adult food from a young age for large breeds (and lots for giant breeds) to regulate growth. They do adjust the feed amount though. Lastly, I always recommend you keep updated with your vet. Regular diarrhea while your dog is a puppy is something to keep track of due to the fact that they are still growing. Furthermore, if your dog does have something like mine did/does, the records really help the vet diagnose it. (If he does, never fear! Atlas is thriving.) I would also keep very careful track of his weight to monitor it and the poop (color, texture, etc.) If the diarrhea does persist, I highly encourage running some tests! They can only help glean light on the situation if there is one. &amp;#x200B;", "link_id": "t3_9o39m1", "time": 1539602724}}

{"e7mkmlv": {"text": "Alright, so it's rather late here so please excuse any embarrassing typos I may or may not make. I got Atlas as my first dog during my undergraduate career. Although my course load was laughable compared to yours, my dumb ass decided to get a German Shepherd puppy regardless of the big flashing warning signs that say \"don't get one of these fuckers as your first dog\". (I don't regret it and I won't ever say I do, but it was hard as fuck and I never commend it to anybody.) I experienced a ton of similar emotions to those that you've described! Here's the thing. I have this really shitty impression about college down owners. I guess it's just me being jaded after seeing *so* many dogs that are neglected, poorly trained, or have general behavioral issues due to ownership issues. I saw classmates walking around with puppies that were 4 weeks old. (Why do you have this puppy??? Why are you outside with it right now in a college campus full of germs holy shit? Where is it's mother??!?!?!?) I've seen puppies being terrified out of their minds while they allowed every person to manhandle them. I've seen dogs being walked at the school in 90 degree weather. It all just sort of really cast a shadow on the group for me. From there, I vowed to be the best fucking owner I could be. Dear god it stressed me out. **In regards to how you're feeling:** Puppy blues are a very real thing. Add that to the pressure of trying to complete a degree or go to work is immense! This is why I always try to encourage people to take at least a week off from work to get themselves acclimated. For some reason, people seem to gloss over the no-sleeping-everything-is-covered-in-pee factor and just focus on \"wow so cute!!!\". The thing is, puppies are *hard*. No one seems to say anything about that, but they are, and feeling stressed out is normal. Honestly, you sound like an incredible dog owner. I always say that although the stress sucks, *you feel it because you are a good dog owner.* You are taking this seriously, and that's a good thing. Too many people chuck their crying puppy in the yard for the night to get some sleep and are cool with that. You're stressed because you want to do a good job. I hate to drop the cliche, but good things don't come easy ya know? It's all worth it though. You got this. Also, he's your first pup! I remember being as afraid as you. (Atlas ate a pair of fucking earphones and had to get fucking surgery on his first birthday) It seemed like every little thing could kill him or screw him up. These days, I glance at things and say \"eh that's fine\". It'll get easier with time and ~~you learn to trust him more~~ he proves himself more trustworthy. **Insofar as living conditions:** I raised Atlas in a house with a yard for his first year and we moved to an apartment after his first birthday. Although an apartment isn't optimal, it wasn't game-breaking like a lot of people said it was. Atlas is on the lazy side for shepherds but is still a shepherd. I just had to put in extra work in going out to exercise him and tiring his brain out lots each and every night. It's not impossible. The biggest issue I see with an apartment is potty training as it can be a huge pain to take him out every 2 hours and go down (possible) stairs. **Regarding mental health/anxiety/stress:** Happy (belated) world mental health day! Atlas has helped me **so** much with my mental health. Honestly, he's saved my life on more than one occasion and any time that I'm forcibly separated from him for more than 2 weeks, I will actually have an anxiety attack. Atlas is a pillar in my life that forces me to hold my shit together. That being said, for the first year of his life, he quadrupled my stress/anxiety. It's worth it a billion times over for all the wonderful years we will spend together, but it was no joke. I'd wake up in the middle of the night just sobbing because I was afraid I wasn't good enough for him and I was going to fail him. The tip I have here are to get a good support system. My ex basically raised Atlas with me. Although he and I are not on good terms, I am so grateful for all that he did for me during that time. I highly suggest getting a support system for you that will reassure you and you can talk to. The best thing I did was tell myself that I wasn't going to fucking fail. I channelled all of that anxiety in to becoming the best dog owner I could ever possibly be. I lived on this subreddit and read every piece of information I could get on training dogs and behavioral issues. I did not let failure be an option. I was going to be better for him. This is what has forged his and my relationship to this day actually. I try to be better for him each and every day. As he and I grew closer and he became the dog I knew he could be, my confidence grew and I beamed with pride. I *could* do this. *I could be a good dog owner. I wouldn't fail him.* You got this. **Moving forward:** Look, **never ever fucking ever let anybody shame you if you decide you want to re-home your puppy.** I will never understand people that do this. If you were to re-home, you are clearly doing this because you decided this was what's best for him. People will give you crap and that's because they're fools. I would fucking re-home my dog if I could no longer give him the life he deserves because I love him. If you do decide to keep him, no more flip flopping. This is it. Cards on the table. You don't want going back and forth from the breeder a habit. Try not to let what's already happened bother you too much. This one incident is not going to \"break your puppy\" forever. It's time to move forward. Lastly, always always always make time for yourself. It's so easy to let the puppy consume your life. You need to take time to get a cup of coffee and just sit there for a bit. You need to take that time so you aren't falling apart at the seems. Your dog will be okay crated (when he's been trained!) for 20 minutes while you catch a breath. **Regarding the puppy:** * Atlas was a surprisingly quiet dog in regards to barking as well. (He made up for it a fucking 10 fold in whining though.) Finn will find his bark eventually, but enjoy the quiet while it lasts! * Sleeping a ton is very normal. Puppies need lots of that. Use that time to catch a fucking break. * Atlas hated going outside too, but that's because there are a lot of brand new sights sounds and smells outside. Give Finn many many opportunities to be outside and interact with things so he will hate it less. * Stairs suuuuuuuck. I lived on the 3rd floor when I lived in my apartment, but again, he was 1 by then. Carrying is a good call as HD is no joke, but I will caution that this may not be sustainable when he gets larger. * Really take to crate training. It saved my life during school because... well he had to be *somewhere* while I was at school. Once he is, he will be okay for 2 hours max. * Along with crate training, once he regards the crate as his safe place, you can actually utilize it in the car if it's small enough (or your car is large enough). * If not, car rides are thought of to be fun for dogs, but they can actually be quite stressful! A 4 hour drive is quite long for a puppy. I moved with Atlas a few months ago, and it was one 8 hour trip that I broke in to two 4 hour trips. He's 2 and due to his energy level, 4 hours is still pretty tough for him. (I do have him strapped in to a Sleepypod though, so the restriction of movement likely has much to do with his car-fatigue). I found it really important to make car rides a pleasant experience. For quite a while, I had someone else drive my car while I sat in the back and funneled him pets and treats. It was a pain, but Atlas has taken to his sleepypod and car rides quite well now. * Don't let him be in rooms on his own yet. Until he is crate trained, I suggest tethering him to you by the waist when you aren't watching him. ", "link_id": "t3_9nhuc0", "time": 1539335613}}

This is because he was a really insecure puppy and I needed to bolster his confidence to prevent him being fearful. However, as time went on and he grew in to the cocky asshole he is today, he absolutely requires more balanced training. Atlas gets bops when he's bad and when he tries to jump on people, he gets a firm clothesline. Afterwards, he's always praised for good behavior, but if I didn't do this, he would take it as green lights to keep jumping on visitors. Yes, I've done the positive training. Again, for the first nearly year of his life that's all I did. I also recently got a prong collar. I used to be avidly against them, but after nearly two years of positive training to try to get this dickhead to walk nicely on a leash, I decided that I needed to try something new. I researched the prong collar and I ultimately decided that it is a training tool that is actually much safer than most people think it is. In fact, the most unsafe thing of all would be Atlas catching a squirrel and my \"leave it\" failing to have him launch off after it without me being able to stop it. Thus, the prong is the better choice for me. Also, Atlas is a dramatic fuck.

Also, there's the issue about wanting to keep Typhoon buff up, but if you equip it on Auto, it somehow finds a way to mess up the combos (???). This all causes my TB to sometimes just stand there being knocked back for like 10 seconds taking a crapload of damage. This all leads me to believe that I want to try to increase defensive stats in order to combat the Auto-battle AI. I only use Thunderbolt, Annihilate, and Typhoon (for the buff).

I think that a lot of us had our expectations set really high due to the feelings we've had towards the super idealized game we had in our heads that would remind us of our childhoods. Putting that aside, I'm liking it. **What do you currently like about it?** I really do like the auto-battle thing. Some people don't like that they don't feel like they're \"playing the game\", but I like that I can progress while I'm not actually playing it. I don't ever grind manually, I mostly like to optimize my exp gains and reach goals I've set for myself. I like how there are multiple avenues for people to set personal goals (S tier jewels, PBA weapon, fusion equips, emblems, making mesos, hitting level 120, etc.). We really have the option to satisfy our own goals. I also like some of the daily dungeons and that we get rewarded for completing them.I also like nostalgia factor and portability. **What do you currently dislike about it?**At the forefront of all of our minds is the 6 hour trade policy. Inherently, I understand the attempt, but I would really love if they allowed us to have 3 items listed at all times, and the ones we were waiting to collect would just wait to collect in a separate queue. I dislike the Guild Dungeon and part of Mu Lung. Guild Dungeon is just dull. Mu Lung is fun when you are doing your really try hard run, but the rest is just bland. I would really love to see some variety. I also dislike that Royal Styles are the only things that give bonuses. I understand the economic principles behind it, but I'd love to be able to whale for the royal styles (if I could afford it) and equip my Cash Shop choice equips over them while getting the bonus. Nexon wins out economically anyways there too. I also dislike the current Expedition drop system. I know that the rates are meant to be low, but I would appreciate it dropping a fragment each time that is literally 1/1000th or something of a drop to forge a drop. That way, I feel like I got a little something each time at least. Also, Cygnus do need adjustments. **Are you casually playing or grinding when you get the chance?**I'm playing super casually! I play a lot, but I never grind. It's always auto-running or me doing things like Daily Dungeon. I do do a lot of math that ensures that I'm getting at least 2x when I auto for long periods though. **Do you see yourself playing long-term or quitting in the near future?**I wouldn't go as far as to say I see myself playing long term, but I also don't see myself quitting any time soon.

{"e6n5any": {"text": "**GSDs &amp; Protection Dogs** As a person with a German Shepherd which looks like a \"picture perfect\" GSD, I can whole heartedly tell you that he would be an awful protection dog. This is because he's had no training, and has not an aggressive bone in his body. This is how I like it. I trained him to be tolerant and like all people after they let him sniff, and  be a big gentle baby. One of the reasons GSDs get a rep for being aggressive is because of their naturally wary nature. This is actually really similar to the attitude held around Dobies, but I haven't owned one personally so I can't really weigh in specifically. GSDs that are poorly trained &amp; socialized can end up being reactive, and I think their protection dog stereotype may partially originate from there (along with their reputation as military/police dogs as well of course). Outside of a very very highly well trained dogs, having that aggression (protection dogs are **trained** targeted aggression) is not typically a good thing. While the typical GSD is naturally wary, and this trait can quickly evolve in to fear reactivity, this is highly undesirable and I would not wish this attribute upon anybody. German Shepherds are the opposite of low maintenance. They require a lot of exercise, are too smart for their won good, and *will* eat your couch if you do not give them what they need. Also, the shedding will drive you crazy. The breed is prone to SA as well, which makes long work days problematic. I will say that mine doesn't have SA and can do 8 hours just fine. They're also typically not great recommendations for first time owners due to that wary nature and a fear reactive GSD being no joke. **Multiple Dogs** Theoretically, I guess. However, I would *never ever* personally get two dogs within even two years of one another. For one, I would want a puppy to be fully grown. For two, if I were adopting two adult dogs or something of the like, I would want the first dog to be fully integrated in to my house/family before adding a new element.

Since you raised Rotties, you know the importance of consistent training for a large able-to-deal-damage-if-not-trained-well dog.

They\u2019re not easy to please, require a huge amount of exercise, shouldn\u2019t be trusted off leash, and shed like it\u2019s their job. Since I don\u2019t have person experiences with the other breeds, you\u2019re getting a GSD and Corgi response!**German Shepherd Dog:** &gt;Since you said you are interested in going through a breeder, I will go advise based on that route. Let it be known that I think GSDs are the best dogs in the world and nothing will ever change my mind so take it all with a grain of salt.   &gt;  &gt;**Let's talk about the good fitting areas first!**   &gt;  &gt;They are loyal to a fault. They know who their human shepherd is and they do not stray from that fact. Atlas likes to be able to see me whenever he can. He's okay if he doesn't, but he does prefer it. Lots of GSD owners joke that they cannot shower without their dog checking on them. I am one of those people.   &gt;  &gt;They're highly trainable! These guys are super intelligent, which is a double edged sword. As long as they are properly motivated, they pick up new commands and tricks with ease. Mine does have an attitude though.   &gt;  &gt;Atlas is super snuggly (only when we are alone though). He used to not be, and I let him grow in to it himself, but these days, he sleeps like a human next to me with his head on the pillows and cuddles. It's really cute.   &gt;  &gt;Atlas is very particular about visitors. He loves everybody, but will 100% bark at them and jump on them if I don't do it a certain way (in a very excited way, not an aggressive one). I have to introduce a certain way, but he's cool. I trained him to be this way though.   &gt;  &gt;They are intimidating, no doubt about that.  &gt;  &gt;**Alright, now here we go with the not great areas...**  &gt;  &gt;Look... I think GSDs are the best dogs ever and nothing will ever change my mind. However, there is a reason that this subreddit strays away from recommending them normally. It's because, generally speaking, having a GSD is kind of like having a dog on hard mode. That being said, you did raise a Shiba, and that's not considered easy either (but for very different reasons). Shibas are considered difficult because they are so independent, which is actually more similar to a husky attitude. German Shepherds are considered more difficult because, at the root, they are the opposite. They're so hugely sensitive to everything and complete drama queens. They typically have lots and lots of opinions about things.   &gt;  &gt;Getting a GSD as a puppy from a breeder is always a wise move. The really utterly depressing fact of the matter is that the breed is plagued with BYBs and the health conditions are so high risk as is. It's a really sickly breed, and I would go the puppy route as well. There isn't anything wrong with rescues, but because of the GSD reputation (and a lot of the reputations with the dogs you've listed), lots of people tend to get these dogs as \"protection dogs\" that they seem to think will automatically protect them without putting in the work and love. This isn't to say that you will do this at all. You seem like you'd be a great owner! It just seems like that's the trend with the breed, so getting one from a rescue may result in some undesirable behaviors.   &gt;  &gt;You say you don't want a super energetic dog, but I think 3 hours of walking is great! Atlas is on the lazier side of shepherds, and I prefer ball in backyard and a 2 mile walk, but that sounds amazing for a grown dog. A growing shepherd on the other hand... would you be able to put in more time as the pup is an adolescent? Teenage GSDs are known to be crazy exercise machines. Atlas calmed down a lot so he's cool now, but yeah that time wasn't awesome.   &gt;  &gt;The naturally wary attitude of GSDs makes them not fabulous dog-dogs most of the time. They're kinda known as the fun police. Mine much prefers people, and is very choosy about his playmates. He's totally cool meeting people though! Again, as listed above, he gets really excited which can be scary for people, but he's sweet. This is a result of extensive socialization, which is crucial as a fear reactive GSD is no joke.   &gt;  &gt;Dog aggression and reactivity is a worry for these guys. Again, can be trained, but you said you aren't willing to manage, so it's notable.   &gt;  &gt;**A gsd will shed like it is hit job, so your cleanly boyfriend may need to adjust.**   &gt;  &gt;Renting will be an issue. GSDs are banned nearly everywhere and I'd heavily consider before getting one. This is an issue with nearly all the breeds you listed though. **Corgis:** &gt;The reason I adore Corgis is because I am a herding girl enthusiast! Of the Corgis I've interacted with, I see a lot of herding dog attributes that I love in my dog (intelligence, attitudes, etc.) Thus, they do come with a herding dog mentality. They must be worked in some way/ have a job. I am seriously considering a Corgi as my next dog as they are a herding dog in a smaller package, and come with less of a reputation. Not that I care what people think, but it sucks to hear some of the comments about Atlas when I know he's just a sweetie pie. Again though, they do share a lot of attributes with GSDs which is why I like them. * Eager to please, smart, The ones I've met have been snuggly, but I hear it can be hit or miss. * A great amount of exercise for one that you've listed! * Will also shed like it's their job. * Much easier to rent with! * Also known as fun-police, but MUCH LESS so than GSDs. * Doesn't have that \"intimidating factor\" that you listed.* Breed has been popular in the past few years, lots of BYBs and upcoming issues. * degenerative myelopathy :( Overall, as much as I love these guys, I hesitate to recommend. I think it could work, but there are better fits. Outside of the shedding, I'd totally recommend a Lab. Considering the shedding, a Poodle, but you seem to already have one.

Also, I find that a great way to have guests over in a smaller space is to make the space nice. It feels less weird that way to me for some reason. Now here\u2019s some tips: * lighting can do so much to open a room up. Choose warm bulbs instead of cool ones to make it more homey. * consider a mattress upgrade to a queen/king if you don\u2019t have one. You would think a bed taking up more room would be counter productive to your desire for more space, but I find that it helps me feel more adult and put together. After all, when I think of adults, I don\u2019t think they sleep on twins. I find a queen is a good size to pull a room together. Throw some gorgeous sheets on it, push it agains a wall, stick a body pillow or some sort of backing against that wall and your bed is a makeshift couch for others to sit on. (If you\u2019re comfortable with that of course) while I live in a bigger house, my personal space is set up like this. * embrace ground sitting. Take a cue from the Japanese and get a low table. Nothing wrong with some good old ground sitting on some comfy cushions. * cute comforter or duvet! Bed bath and beyond has them on sale and you can get them at an incredible price. * invest in space savers. I was incredibly amazed at how less dingy my place got after I moved. For one, hardwood in the bedroom is now a requirement in all my future homes, but also, I was gifted some really nice book cases that I use for storing things that aren\u2019t books.

{"e50u5cu": {"text": "I'm 83% to 110, and it gets a bit harder, but to be honest, I barely grind. I have leveled up roughly once every 1.5 days since 100. Here's what I do:* **Daily Dungeons + Jewels:** Do your 3 daily free ones, save your other tickets you get for Thursday in hopes of exp. crystal. Do the highest highest level you can. At level 100, I did Hard and fused those in to A tier jewels, which each provide 1.4% exp. increase. You should be able to equip 4, getting the 5th at 110. Right now, I get an extra 5.5% exp. from jewels. When I level up, I will equip my 5th one that's on standby, and the % will go up with a bonus totaling 7% + 1 % (from set effect). I'll also get increased drop rate. I'm going to passively work to get EXP jewels to S tier without taking apart my A tier page though.* **Mu Lung:** Mu Lung is boring as fuck to do back-to-back, which is why I always recommend scattering a couple of Mu Lung runs between your daily dungeons. Once a day though, do one run trying balls to the wall. You want to place as high as you possibly can. Save all of those bonus potions from the event for this (I use ACC ones because I play NL). Do every fucking run of Mu Lung you can and get as far as you can. Buy the 15% exp pendant, and if you can afford it, stack the 10% as well. Just make sure you do the math. If you rank in the top 20%, you get roughly an extra 10k Mu Lung coin to spend every week (I think its 10.8k but I'm not too sure). Do the math using the community guide. I happen to stumble upon a lot of extra tickets recently and was able to spam to get both pendants. This yields me a total of 25% exp.* **Hot Time + Bonus EXP:** The bonus EXP things they give us stack (read the fine print), so I stack a red, orange, yellow, hot time, and my extra 30% exp together from Mu Lung and jewels and farm like an insane person in a 6 man party. At one point, Star Force 80 was yielding me like 5k exp per kill.The thing is, to rank highly in Mu Lung or to clear Daily Dungeons on either Very Hard or Chaos, you have to be pretty strong. Daily: Very Hard actually still one-shots me, but I have dark sight so I'm cool. Chaos mobs are a bit too much for me still. Mu Lung: you are competing with everyone on your server. It's hard. Literally the second your press your attack counts.In Mu Lung, you're also competing with the whales that have emblem everything. I don't try to place in the top 3. That's really not realistic for me. My goal is the top 20% for the bonus leaves, and that's pretty achievable. I will disclose that I am slight IAP, but it has almost entirely been to look cute.Therefore, to be strong, you have hopefully allocated your resources towards what you need for it. I got my max base stat claw really early in the came and have been nurturing it. I'm about 15k leaves away from going to unique (I'd be 5k away if I wasn't cubing it before like a dumbass). I also played the trade station economy game to get some of the mesos I needed to fund certain things. In example, I managed to buy a Sirius cape as a rare with max stats. I upgraded with the free ones they gave us at the beginning of the game and got it to be an max stat unique potential cape with Accuracy (lmfao I'm lucky as fuck). There is a bit of RNG involved like in this example of course, but the highest possible stats actually don't matter too too much when it comes to armor. All of my gear has some sort of accuracy potential on it though, because I miss like a motherfucker.Things you can do to get strong so you can place in Mu Lung:* Do Nett's every day as many times as you can: the different levels of rings can be equipped to different slots.* Do every single Zakum and Horntail run you can. If for nothing else, do it for the leaves. Think of Zakum Helm/Necklace as a bonus prize to be honest. You need the leaves anyways.I think that a lot of progression in this game has to do with doing every single thing offered and making sure to nab exp opportunities when possible.Edit: Autojoin party in channel 1 or channel 2 is really great.

However, those corrections usually come in signs that many dog owners can be uncomfortable with. In example: teen showing. Nipping. These two actions are not inherently aggressive and serve as warning signs, but they make many dog owners anxious. If a humpee isn\u2019t super great at correcting for themselves, owners can step in. I do find that if they are allowed to correct from a young age themselves, this is less likely. Female dogs know how to put their foot down. It is badass. As far as the humper, the owner can step in if he/she feels it necessary. Although Atlas isn\u2019t much of a humper, he has his moments. This is where I have to play social politics really quick to see the other dog owners attitude. I am totally cool when Atlas getting a nip in the face to show him he\u2019s acting inappropriately, but some dog owners aren\u2019t okay with that happening. It\u2019s really a tossup.

It hurts you so fucking much I'm sure, and people that are shaming you are just being ignorant and mean. You were put in this situation, and you are trying to make the best of it.** I'm sure your dog is gorgeous. A working line Czech IPO GSD is something out of my dreams to be honest. That being said, it sounds like you are very aware of his needs and are looking for advice on how to proceed. First, I would decide if you are firm on retraining or rehoming. I will break them down in to categories. **Retraining:** This is going to be fucking hard. I'm not going to sugar coat it. It's going to take a fuck ton of time and it's going to be really really hard. This might mean changing your sleep schedule so that you can go to bed at 10PM and then wake up at 6AM to jog a few miles with your dog. It can mean restructuring your entire life. This might mean spending money on a professional trainer to come regularly. This might mean a lot of things. Regardless, this is *going* to mean hours upon hours with your dog each day being frustrated, being overjoyed, frustrated again, and all in a violent loop. Yet, this can also mean amazing things. More than anything, I am so looking forward to my upcoming move because I am going to start herding classes with Atlas. He has shown instinct and I am very excited about it. Dog sports provide a wonderful bonding experience with your dog and, although it can take up weekends, I would gladly spent every weekend running around sheep just to see how happy it makes Atlas. At this point, I would heavily lean towards the professional route. A high drive IPO Czech line GSD is beyond my personal scope and I wouldn't be able to provide advice in good conscience. You seem to be going the right way with the dog trainer though. I would note that I wouldn't want one that trained wolves as much as one that has trained working line dogs. I would also look in to CBD if you are open to it. **Rehoming:** Look, realizing your home isn't right for your dog takes guts. Rehoming him takes even more guts. People that shame you for it are ignorant. If I knew I could no longer provide the home Atlas deserved, I would find a rescue to put him in, or a foster that was able to care for him. Would it break my heart in to a million pieces? Yes. The thing is though, I care about him more than that. It would be selfish for me to keep him. I would never fucking do that to him. Do not feel guilty. I would actually look in to experienced breed rescues. Especially with your dog, they are going to be able to help more. Trying to re-home him yourself can be difficult and I wouldn't feel prepared to do so. God, if I were in a better place in life, I would actually see if you wanted to get in contact if you were interested in rehoming. **Unsolicited Advice:** Please don't read this if you don't want unsolicited relationship advice. *My dog is* ***always*** *going to come first. I have known my partner for 8 years now and we've been together for over 1. I've had Atlas since he was 10 weeks old and he is 2 now.  Although, technically speaking, my relationship is much older than my dog, I will never ever compromise Atlas in any way for my relationship. I promised to take care of him when I got him. I promised to give him the best life I could. I swore that to him and myself. If my partner insisted on moving in to a town-house even though I said it would be bad for my dog, I would drop his ass.

{"e4rzfkm": {"text": "I don't know why you're getting down-voted. You are trying to start a conversation. I know that pitbull fear-mongering is a problem and I see it sometimes on this sub, but I really don't think this is the case here. Pitbulls are, unfortunately, the poster child for\"dangerous dog breeds\". Other \"offenders\" in this party include Dobermans, Rottweilers, and German Shepherds. As the owner of GSDs, I'm sure that you've experienced some prejudice regarding them. I absolutely know that I have experienced it regarding Atlas. People cross the street, people shame me for having \"such an aggressive dog\" before even bothering to do anything more than look at him. People nearly always ask if he's going to bite them upon meeting them. It's truly disheartening, but I suspect it is only a fraction of the stigma pitbull owners face. Because of this environment and this prevailing attitude towards these breeds, it becomes a tale that repeats itself. A huge part of the entire debacle is the social implications of it. It has become sort of like \"German Shepherds are police dogs\", \"Golden Retrievers are family dogs\", \"Chihuahuas are bark-y and bite-y but somehow it is acceptable because they are small\" (no shade, just illustrating stereotypes which I think suck), \"Pitbulls are dangerous dogs\". Yet, there are a fuck ton of dangerous German Shepherds. The really noble, well behaved police dog version of the breed is actually far and in-between. There are also Golden Retrievers that are not great family dogs because they can be prone to separation anxiety. There are really wonderfully behaved and sweet Chihuahuas. It's all about stereotypes. Furthermore, the existing stereotype and reputation behind them as \"tough dogs\" (god they're actually sweet as hell) perpetuates this type of ownership. You see it in nearly all of the \"aggressive breeds\". As a GSD owner, I try to be a positive ambassador for the breed, but there are so many SO MANY ill behaved ones. A lot of people get dogs from these breeds because they expect them to be fierce or protective. I get tons of statements saying \"huh he must protect you\". I chuckle it off now, but Atlas hides behind me when he gets scared-- not the other way around. However, this attitude that people hold can totally affect the type of people that are getting these dogs. Getting a dog because you want him/her to be a \"tough dog\" instead of evaluating the dog's individual needs and breed temperament is never a good idea. In turn, many of these individuals who bring these dogs home treat them like living protection systems instead of pets. Therefore, you see lots of them under-socialized and under-loved. Then, when they turn out to be ill mannered because of the previous circumstances, they end up in shelters. It's sad. I hate it. Another issue is the fact that they are the most commonly bred dog in the US. The more common and popular a breed is, the more potential there is for puppy mills. It's a sad and true fact. Puppy mills, as we all know, breed for profit. They don't do health testing and they don't try to breed towards a standard. They're meshing any female and male of the same breed (sometimes not even), slapping a label on them, and selling them for as high of a margin as possible. This leads to health issues out the wazoo. Physical ones are horrible and sad, but the neurological/mental ones are the ones that really can come down and enforce the stereotypes. When you breed a dog poorly, they can be prone to neurotic temperaments that can easily turn sour when not managed properly. Then, you have multiple generations of puppy mills replicating this process over and over. A really great example of this is the GSD breed. All of this is sad and it makes me sad. Banning the breed is not the answer. Sadly, I don't think there really is an answer. I think that we can slowly improve by educating everybody more about pet ownership as a whole, but that will take so much time. The average pet owner isn't aware of what constitutes a puppy mill and they aren't aware of many of their dogs needs. There are so many people who get dogs just to make them \"outdoor dogs\" and it breaks my heart. Although I know that there are livestock guardians that just like to lay outside all the time, a large majority of them want to stay inside with us. I had to explain this to my mother when she asked if it was necessary for Atlas to stay with me. I told her he literally wants our bodies touching while we sleep at night. So much of this has to do with attitude and education, but it's a really daunting task.  ", "link_id": "t3_99zngq", "time": 1535146074}}

{"e4qvsjy": {"text": "Firstly: * German Shepherds are the opposite of calm and laid back. Mine is a lazy one and is a fucking asshole with more energy than the average dog.* Although your schedule is actually pretty similar to what mine will be starting next month (new job!!!), I don't think it would be adequate for a GSD pup. Mine is two and has calmed down a great deal, and can deal with being alone for that long. Adolescent GSDs typically cannot. * Additionally, these questions give off a vibe that you have not previously owned a dog. German Shepherds are very much not recommended or first time owners as they are really easy to fuck up with a lot of dangerous repercussions. They also tend to be *very* challenging puppies as they are too smart for their own good, mouthy as hell, and have approximately the energy level of the Energizer bunny. * Lastly, if this \"breeder\" looks like they're going to sell a puppy to you based on this little information, I would be really wary. Reputable breeders (particularly for this breed) tend to ask tons and tons of questions to ensure that the pups are going to good homes. They tend to have huge waiting lists and would not simply sell a puppy to anybody. You want a reputable breeder for all dogs, but especially for GSDs. They're prone to a plethora of health conditions which includes neurological ones that can lead to less-than-desirable-and-sometimes-dangerous behavior. Now your questions: * An adult? Yeah. A puppy? Probably not. Also, having any sort of dog kind of low key takes over your life. People say teenage GSDs are never-ending exercise machines that will hold your couch hostage if they don't get it. It's exhausting and not a great time. I'm so happy that's over.* Kind of. Atlas has some core traits that he has retained from the first day that I got him. He is a nurturing and loving type, and he still has that. However, as a puppy, he was really insecure. I made sure to change that by building his confidence. There's a lot of room for growth with puppies. I made sure to reinforce the behavior that I liked. Also, dogs taking after their owners is a totally real thing. * Depends on what you want to do. My dog is crated because I like having that option available to me. He likes it and everybody is happy. The typical Shepherd is extremely intelligent. Atlas took to obedience, frisbee catching, fetching, and much all else I've wanted to teach him very quickly. Just as they need a lot of physical stimulation, they also need tons of mental stimulation. They are incredibly intelligent dogs. Also, as they are from herding dog lineage, lots of these herding dogs tend to want to be near their human shepherds.  * **THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING THAT WILL KEEP GSD SHEDDING UNDER CONTROL.** You will live dog hair. You will breathe dog hair. Your life will be dog hair. You will need to accept all of your clothes are covered in dog hair. Dog hair balls will roll through your home. Dog hair will be a staple accessory and a staple condiment in your food. We can brush and bathe and add supplements all we want, but GOOD GOD. I am not even exaggerating. They're nicknamed German Shedders. I wonder how Atlas even has hair on his body with how much is falling off to be honest. * Diet plays a humongous role in coat health! Ever since Atlas and I converted to his new diet, he has been sooooo soft and shiny. It's awesome. However, he will never really be soft. He will be soft for a coarse haired shepherd, but he won't be fluffy. **On Bernese Mountain Dogs:** Ugh I love this breed SO much. I love herding breeds, but this breed is special to me. My long term partner's family has raised Berners their whole life and I've known three of them. They are truly incredibly friendly and loving dogs. They're calmer and SO friendly. Their energy levels and exercise requirements are much lower and they are much less neurotic. However, I do have a couple of notes regarding them: * Although their temperament is incredibly biddable, I am usually hesitant to recommend them to inexperienced dog owners as their size + strength can be a very dangerous thing. A jumping Berner can very easily knock down a fully grown man and it can be very unsafe. * Health is the most tragic and horrible thing when it comes to Berners. The life expectancy is too short for their wonderful souls, and all that they are prone to breaks my heart. * Berners also shed like it's their job. Although Shepherds shed in hairs, Berners shed in clumps. Giant. Black. Clumps. They are really soft and fluffy though! Generally speaking, I always recommend new pup owners to take about a month (if they can of course) off of work/ work from home. You would be fucking amazed how much work it is. 10 week olds cannot hold their bladder more than 2 hours at a time, so you can do the math. All in all, I highly recommend you fill out the breed questionare so we can get a little better gauge. Let me know if you have any more questions! ", "link_id": "t3_99tpi1", "time": 1535108733}}

Living with a mental illness is really hard, and yeah, that means sometimes, we require certain things from our partners. However, that's not at all unreasonable. If I were to marry a man that's in a wheelchair, I wouldn't be upset that if he asked for mobility assistance from time to time. While mental illness is less \"visible\", it doesn't dismiss anything regarding that you are a person that needs (and deserves) that type of support in their life. Him telling you to just \"be more positive\" is really mean and it would really hurt my feelings personally. I am sure you've never told him to just \"be more tolerant of touch\". Both are things that neither of you can change and I would expect him to be more understanding. That being said, since he is an Aspie, he may have issues applying that understanding to situations outside of himself. Have you tried to have a discussion as to how it makes you feel, and in turn, comparing it to something that he cannot change such as the example I listed. Based on what you're saying, your partner kind of sounds like a dick. However, as a person that has an Aspie partner, I do know that a lot of things he does/says may sound terrible, but he's really just not understanding. I think you guys could benefit from a lot more direct communication and understanding what those things he says really mean. As hurtful as it is to say he hasn't felt attracted to you in the last year, it may benefit the both of you to discuss what he means by that. I know that my partner sometimes accidentally says things that I interpret as really hurtful. Instead of getting emotional about it, I try to ask questions even though it hurts my feelings at first. I find that, most of the time, it's a misunderstanding. Just because he has Aspergers does not mean he is entitled to giving you a relationship that is less than you deserve. I know that that may be hard to see from a point of depression, but that's true. You deserve to feel loved, supported, and cared for. Sometimes, that means being more sensitive to touch, and my partner is that way too, but I expect him to be a good partner to me otherwise. In example, we both ask each other a ton of questions so that we can make sure there are minimized misunderstandings. We've both learned to communicate in very direct way as well. Another example is, although he has so so so much trouble with social cues and emotions (like most Aspies), he is REALLY wonderful with mine. He has had about 8 years of practice, and he has spent this time curating a database of reactions and situations in his brain for specifically my reactions. It doesn't work on anybody else, but it is so touching to me that he put in that type of effort for me, especially since it's something that's so difficult for him. It's one of those things that make me feel so loved. I mention this because, just because he's an Aspie, doesn't mean he does not actively try so hard to understand and make me feel loved. You deserve that. Therapy may be in the books, but you are not losing the love of your life. The love of your life will love you the way you deserve to be.

However, I really really did identify with Laura-Jean. I will admit, growing up, I was kind of boy crazy. I found our personalities pretty similar. Is it kind of cheesy?

Although it isn't addressed directly in the movie, it seems to be implied that LJ and her sisters share the same mother (who is Asian) and their white father. Her two sisters are portrayed to be very clearly mixed with mixed heritage actresses while LJ and her actress clearly lean very very Asian. I really enjoyed this aspect as hapa babies and children can land all over the spectrum and, like LJ, can pass as completely Asian. Now let's talk about the boys. The two main love interests in the film are Peter and Josh, both of whom would be considered white passing. Is this a problem? No, I really don't think so. Could they have written in an Asian love interest? Yeah sure. The film does not so far read as a story about an Asian-American girl, but a story about an American girl who also happens to be Asian. I don't really feel that just because she's Asian, there should be an Asian love interest. In the film, she grew up with a white father after all. Despite Asian passing, she is still of mixed descent, and it shouldn't be at all odd that she finds herself attracted to one of those two mixes. It is, after all, familiar. I don't remember if they tell us where the film is set, but if it's somewhere like where my aunt lives, this movie actually portrays my cousin's situations quite well. My aunt married a white man and her children at the only Asian/part-Asian children for cites and cities around.

However, both gender's experiences should be about having a good time with one another. **Are my expectations too high?** God no.

{"e4l0b98": {"text": "I'm playing NL and I think the general consensus is (1) pray for those boxes / good drops and (2) play the trade station. You can get a normal max base attack claw for a pretty affordable price compared to how many mesos rain down on you early game. Outside of that, I know what the \"ideal\" set up for gear is, but I haven't gone out of my way pursuing it. It's also agreed upon that 100% maxed out gear is not super important or worth for the price. It's totally RNG, but you'd be surprised how lucky you can get given the freebies raining down on us because of launch and farming mini dungeons with drop rate increase. I'm running: * Jaihin Guards (E): Max attack, 10 star enhance because I suck and failed 11 twice. As said time and time again, the weapon is what puts out your damage and you want to work on early. I got this in trade shop really early. * Halphs Hat (E): Max mag def. Not max phys def. I just got lucky. This either fell out of a monster or came from a weapon draw. I forget. * Pensalir Armor (U): I would prefer it to be anything but Pensalir, but this Unique literally fell out of the sky and I'm not going to whine about the stats. * Blue Belt (R): This is not special whatsoever and the stats are whatever, but I am waiting for Netts to bless me. * Muspell Gloves (U): It's not maxed, but I need the accuracy and the unique is nothing to whine about. * Helphas Boots (U): It came in a daily dungeon and it as better than what I had. * Noble Shoulder (R): This thing is max. I'll probably work on it. * Sirius Cape (E); My pride and joy. This shit was bought for like 5k at the trade station when it was at the base defense so we wouldn't know how it would scale as they all start at four. It's got unique potential and is max stats. I love it. So, as you can see, although I'm F2P, I have 3 max stat pieces! Although Halphas Hat isn't the ideal, I do plan on replacing with Zakum, so it's not too big of a deal. Sirius Cape and Jaihin are both end game for me and match up to the guide. You jut have to get kind of lucky and play the trade station. Plus, you can run Elite dungeon as many times as you can a day and sell those equips in the store if they're not great. A lot of them aren't great, but lots of the times, just because they're epics, you can sell them for like 300k (on my server at least). Over a week, that's like 6.3 mil if you do this every day for 3 times. Also, running this, I have no problems with anything but horntail at level 102. I highly suggest getting a base claw and collecting leaves out the wazoo to get it to unique. If I wasn't a dumb fuck and spent my leaves on cubes trying to cube to epic potential, I'd actually be 75% to the fucking 40,000 leaves needed. You can even get it all the way to epic using the free shit they give you in the beginning of the game. If you don't have those resources anymore, an alt can provide them for you. As far as gear goes, get that one or two pieces that's endgame for you and pour your resources in to that. ", "link_id": "t3_993j62", "time": 1534873789}}

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about two years ago and my entire family is riddled with mental health problems. Mine is particularly concerning as it has almost landed me in the hospital and very much effects my daily life. While I do not have PCOS or any physical issue that would prevent me from having children, I do understand the fear of passing mental health issues. I have seen my own father destroy our family because of his issues, and I know how much I struggle with my own on a day to day basis. I do not want my future potential offspring to have to fight that. Furthermore, my partner  whom I love deeply and plan on hanging out with forever is on the spectrum as well as a host of his own issues. The both of us agreed that there's just not really an ethical way that we could do the whole kid thing. The kick in the stomach is that he never really wanted them before being in our relationship, and I never really thought about them either. He's also got these two nephews that we see from time to time (we're moving to the same town as them) that are aged 1 and 3 and I'd never realized how maternal I could be.I don't really know how to describe the moment that I realized it. I was alone in my apartment when I connected the dots. It was weird because I never actively wanted children, but it seemed like a door was being slammed in my face. Even worse, it was/is a door that I could still have the choice of walking through if I want to, but I don't know how to do it without feeling supreme guilt. I cried a great deal. It was very uncharacteristic of me. I was just so fundamentally sad about it. I will admit, I sort of put it in a little space in the back of my head and I try not to think about it. Because we are different, I would be physically able, I guess my brain is compartmentalizing.Although you do have PCOS, that doesn't necessarily mean your eggs are not viable. If they are, IVF and surrogate is an option. If I'm being honest, if I were to ever have children, we may opt for surrogate regardless. Women with bipolar disorder tend to have more volatile pregnancies. The mood swings can be extreme and mine are already, quite frankly, dangerous as is. Although it's a long way off, we are aware that we need to keep all of those options open to us. I will say that I, personally, have never felt *any* inclination to be pregnant. To me, it would be a way of having a biological child.I'm the same age as you are, and it's been difficult. While I do know that I cannot possibly imagine the challenges and hurdles that you face are and how they must make you feel, I do know that there are so many options out there. As far as adoption goes, it is a completely viable and wonderful option. I do feel that innate selfishness of hoping that my future child would be a little version of my partner running around because he is great and I think that would be great, but I also know that adoption is an incredible route to take. I'm sure other people would be able to write more in depth relevant responses to this fact as I have little to no experience with the matter.*PS.

Honestly, I wish I could be as secure as you are. I do agree that a lot of women our age are very consumed with long term relationships. There are some societal undertones to this, but I can't get in to that without going on a huge tangent about how deeply rooted it is. It's got a lot to do with validation, the male gaze, and role models. Lots of women don't even realize that we have been conditioned to feel this way. Although I have issues with the institutionalized subtle male domination that lies in the subtext here, I also think there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting long term relationships and marriage. We are all our own people and we can want what we want, just like you can want what you want. I've been relationship obsessed for as long as I can remember. I have always wanted to be in a long term relationship as it did validate me. I am really happy to report that I have really worked on my mental health and have grown so much stronger as an individual. That aside, I'm totally fucking wedding-marriage crazy. I've always loved it in theory, but in the last year, I've gone full blown \"hey when's that ring coming\" on my boyfriend. (We have known each other for 8 years ok, I'm not THAT nuts.) I say that jokingly as I do know he feels the same way as we've talked about it. We are waiting until he is out of graduate school and we are more financially stable. Do I feel like I'm missing out? With my previous relationship, I did a little bit. In my current one? Not one bit. A huge issue in relationships, especially at our age is that it consumes both parties and morphs them in to one blob. My boyfriend and I were long distance for most of our relationship and we are closing our gap for real now. This really forced us to be our own people. I have my own full fledged hobbies, as does he. We make our own decisions and we act as individuals. We don't set \"rules\" for one another because we simply trust each other. This attitude keeps me from feeling like I'm missing out!

I'm waiting to hear back from my dream job on Thursday and I have my fingers crossed. It's really good that you are taking it seriously. I think that a huge problem with my generation/ most of the new graduates is that we don't take entry level jobs seriously. It is a really entitled attitude that employers don't like to see. At the same time, you should also try not to be too rigid. In regards to your questions: * I like to bring at least 5 copies. 5 is too many, but I've needed 3 before and only had 2 so I bring 5 now. I stick it in a folder so I don't have loose papers flying around and I print it on just regular printer paper. Even though they already have the resume on file, a lot of employers don't print it. If you bring it and they have it in front of them, it can be helpful to bring out your qualifications. Also, it serves as a little bit of a cheatsheet insofar if you get stumped and want to look down at it for a bit. The biggest warning here is not to do the \"oh it's on the resume\" thing. It also shows that you have initiative and like to cover all of your bases, which is a really appealing trait in administrative work. * Insofar as Microsoft Word skills, I have never brought in a sample. I will say that I am very proud of how concise, professional, and well designed my resume is. It showcases a little bit of the skill on it's own. I would totally email them beforehand and ask if they would like you to bring samples. Again, it shows initiative and that you are an excellent communicator.No one can know exactly what they're going to ask, but a couple that I've gotten a few times are as follows: * What is one of your weaknesses? (For this one, I like to also incorporate how I address the weakness in my answer) * Tell us about a time that you had a conflict with a co-worke and how you handled it * If you have a lot of tasks at once and you are feeling overwhelmed, how do you handle it?

The thing is, looking like white fang whilst simultaneously being a golden retriever level of friendly while simultaneously loving kids is asking so much of a dog. Dogs are living creatures and we cannot just sims our perfect creature. I actually love the same type of look you do. I like that pointy ears long snout look, but I also know that looks are the last thing that should come in to play when selecting a dog. It's more important that they are good with children as you have kids and good family dogs overall. That look that you like is generally famously bad with children (Huskies, herding dogs). I'm not saying that every one of them is, but with herding dogs, them herding children is a very real thing. Herding includes nipping and such. I would absolutely not go with a Mal if Shepherds are banned. There will 100% be landlords/people giving you a hard time with it. People don't generally know/care about the difference, and that's asking to open a can of worms that will be really difficult to handle. Also, these guys (and shepherds too) are known to be cat chasers. If your \"always stay near\" is a clause you don't want to budge on, I would not go with a husky as they will bolt at the first opportunity. Off leash hiking is super rare and not recommended at all with a husky. Furthermore, they are famously high in prey drive and will likely chase cats.Please don't take your dog jogging in 90 degree weather for several miles at a time. Dogs are covered in fur and this is a really good way to give your dog heatstroke. Look, it seems like you're really obsessed with the ears standing up thing, and the idea that you have about this dog in general. Honestly, even breeds with pricked ears don't always stand up.

In fact, it seems like you are asking for recommendations and listing what your wife wants with complete disregard for her preferences.

{"e4228zm": {"text": "Your friendship expectations, just like your relationship expectations, should never be thought about as \"too high\". It's okay to expect a certain thing out of a relationship, even if it's platonic. A year ago, I realized that I was the problem in some of my friendships. I have a very very obsessive compulsive personality, so much so that my psychiatrist says that I almost have a disorder level for of it. I used to turn my obsessions on to my friends and that is a super unhealthy relationship to have. At my peak, I was GPS tracking everyone. Yeah. It was insanely terrible. These days, I'm a lot better and now have a dog that doesn't mind that I'm obsessed with him one bit. Since I was like that for the first 20 years of my life, it was pretty fucking hard to make friends. I still made a few that I cherish and I love beyond all else.I've known J since I was 8 years old. She and I are soul sisters. I've always been very terrible making friends with other ladies due to some of my personality traits and interests, but she and I are on the same wavelength. I can talk about anything with her and we've been through some shit. I met C when I was 14. 4 years later, and then 3 years later again after that, he became the love of my life. He understands me beyond all belief and he is my friend before anything. I met M when I was 18. M and I are so close. He and I just get each other. It's awesome. Lastly, I met D earlier this year when I was 21 (roughly 5 months ago we became close). D is incredible and I am honestly beyond grateful I've met him. My only regret is meeting him only a few months before I am moving due to having graduated. If you are keeping up with the ages, I make a new friend about every three years. Don't get me wrong. I talk to other people and make acquaintances in the meantime, but these are my true closest friends. I hold each of these individuals near and dear to my heart and I care for them so fucking much. I can talk to them all about anything, and they are my ride or dies. I trust all of them to bail me out of jail and I would bail each of the out of jail. I will always back their play and we can literally hang out and sit in silence. There's no awkward silences. I treasure them and I hope to keep them all for always. J, C, and M have all been long distance friendships for at least a year now. We are as strong as ever and it's amazing. I tell each and every one of them that I love them and it's not weird. I have high expectations for a friendship. I know that, but I am also a damn good friend. I will *always* be there for you. I will *always* back your play. If your play is dumb, I will fucking tell you it's dumb, but I won't judge you for it. You always have a place to stay with me and I will egg your ex's car if you want me to. I will try my best to go above and beyond with you. Because I value honesty, I will never lie to you. In return, I expect you to not lie to me, and to care about me the same way. That's literally it. You'd be shocked how hard it is to find someone that just doesn't lie to you and cares for you. Between these very important people in my life, I really wouldn't make friends that I say are significant. I'm really okay with being by myself and I would rather be by myself than hang out with people that I don't genuinely love and want to be with. I'm not insecure about my lack of friends, and I often joke about it to the few I have. Because only D lives locally, I spend a lot of time alone, and with him when I'm not. By no means am I drowning in friends. I think that it's important to put yourself out there and be open to meeting people, but know that you don't have to lower your expectations. Just like in looking for a relationship, if you force yourself to lower them, you'll only be disappointed and frustrated in the long term. It helps a lot to pick up a hobby. If that hobby doesn't render you anybody you really like, you now have a brand new hobby that you like to do! I hang out with my dog and watch a lot of TV, and I'm okay with that.

It's worth noting that my dog is a huge dick, but loves me very much. He usually expresses his feelings accompanied by some asshole move. * My first bonding experience was the day I picked him out. I was super overwhelmed by all of the cute puppies buzzing around. How do you even pick? One and two were like ping pong balls bouncing off of the walls. I knew off the bat that they weren't for me.

{"e3ygjyd": {"text": "I had to google that dog breed and they are gorgeous!I'd like to begin by saying that it is totally possible to have a not-great-in-apartment breed in an apartment. By all means, my dog should be awful in an apartment. He's a German Shepherd. He does just fine! He is on the lazier side for his breed, but you just have to be diligent with physical and mental stimulation. In short, it's do-able.To answer the question of how to prioritize these different factors: I don't think there really is a right answer so to speak. Even though all dogs become perfect once you fall in love with them, there is rarely ever going to be a dog that is 100% perfect. It's sort of like asking a person to be perfect. I would compare it to dating. There are some deal-breakers during dating (e.g. smoking, desire or not to have kids, etc.). Then, there are things that the other person may do but you can tolerate because the other things outweigh them (e.g. hates your favorite food). Then, there is the separate thing that realigns it all: do you think you'll fall in love? (The answer is yes.) You want these priorities to be a part of all of it, but I would start with deciding what are deal breakers.**Bernese Mountain Dogs:** God I love this breed. Herding breeds have my heart because I love their intensity and their opinions, but outside of herding breeds, these guys are my absolute favorite dog breed. They are loving and kind and awesome. One qualm I'd have given the info provided is that these guys are BIG and they SHED. My partners family has Bernese Mountain Dogs and the biggest guy was pushing at least 100 pounds, and that's being conservative. He looked much bigger because the guy was fluffy. Their girl, whom we all consider to be little is 80 pounds fully grown. Also, Berners shed in clumps so you would frequently see clumps of hair billowing around the apartment. They can also be quite slobbery, but 1/3 of my partner's family dogs have been slobbery, so there's that. They are snuggly as hell though and incredibly friendly dogs. They are also super capable of being out and about during Canadian winters. One concern that I would have is apartment living. Lastly, I can never mention Berners without a word of caution to the life span and health risks though.**Brittanys:** I know nothing about ~~hounds~~ spaniels (literally illustrating how little I know about this breed) .**Border Collies:** Love of my life breed (except for Shepherds of course). As a herding breed enthusiast, I look at Border Collies with awe. (shoutout to @endeavorsofego on instagram). They're truly magnificent creatures, and watching them do agility is breathtaking. I would be extremely cautious to recommend a BC in an apartment. I know someone on this subreddit does it, so hopefully they can chime in, but with the expected energy level... I'd just be worried. They are in that awesome weight sweet spot though. Being excellent at agility also comes with the territory of being intense and energetic as fuck, and the exercise requirements are through the rough. This does not make them great office dogs in my opinion. Also, they are vocal and shed a good amount. Overall, I would not recommend this breed even though they are incredible and wonderful and beautiful.**Golden Retriever:** It says that you raised one and owned several, so I'm sure you know quite a bit about these guys! They're really awesome, but I'm sure you know they're outside of the weight constraint you set. Although not ideal, I think they're do-able in an apartment. Again, I'm sure you know more about these guys than I do. What I will say is that I will always go Bernese Mountain Dog over Golden Retriever due to my personal experience with them. They have the friendliness but are lower energy while being larger.**Spaniels/Setters:** I know nothing about these guys.Overall, I would lean towards hounds. At a glance, a papillon may be perfect. Again, my knowledge is really limited on this group, so I would ask someone that knows more. Maybe a toy or mini poodle? These guys are considered hypoallergenic and shed very very little.

In the post, you can see that Atlas actually serves a supportive function that is completely opposite of the one that you are talking about. However, there is nothing wrong at all with the cuddly type of support either! I'm also super appreciative of your honesty about not being super educated about dog ownership. It seems like you are willing to learn and that is really awesome. Before I do breed recommendations, I want to talk about dog ownership. When you say that you are not willing to tolerate any shedding, barking, or slobber, I need to emphasize that this is just not possible. There are low shed, low slobber, and low bark breeds (it's pretty rare to have at once all three even), but even \"low\" is more than \"no\". Dogs are dogs. They're going to shed, slobber, and bark at least a little bit. If that's not something you can accept, I do not recommend getting a dog. Owning a dog is a big deal. In my eyes, I've accepted this other life in to my hands. It means that I will care for it and love it as best as I possibly can and give him the best of days until his last day. My entire god damned life changed when I got my dog. The difference was like night and day. I cannot stress that he took over my entire life. The necessity to accept some level of shedding, slobber, and barking is pretty metaphorical for what it's like to own a dog. You just kind of have to accept that they are going to bleed in to every part of your life at least a little. Furthermore, every dog comes with his/her challenges. Just like with humans, they're all going to have some type of issue. They might be too stubborn or do badly with other dogs or hates being alone. It's something that is a part of owning a dog. I only put all of this out there because I truly didn't understand how much work it was until I did it. Even people who had childhood dogs don't really understand it until they do it. Having another life in your hands is something else entirely. As far as sensing panic attacks go, yeah some dogs can do it. It's got something to do with the heightened senses. They can sense that your mood is shifting and your breath is getting faster for example. Then, the will likely react, and they can be trained to react how you want them to. However, it's not realistic to just expect a dog to be able to do that. Atlas does not give a single fuck about when I'm going through some shit. In regards to Golden-doodles, I never encourage purchasing them or any other designer breed. A designer breed is any breed that is bred for popularity and profit rather than toward a standard. Although I really adore the concept of a golden-doodle, they are currently not a recognized breed. Therefore, they are not bred towards any sort of standard whatsoever, and thus cannot be ethically bred dogs. I do hope that in the future they can be established and recognized though. After pondering all of that, I think you could do well with a companion breed dog. They tend to be low shed, bark, and slobber, and tend to be really cuddly and velcro-like. The one issue is that velcro-like behavior comes with a downside. They can over-anxious and develop separation anxiety rather easily. Then, you have a person with anxiety and a dog with anxiety and it's just a bad anxiety party that no one wants to be at. If you can stomach shedding (because cats shed a truckload) or would be interested in getting a sphynx Cat (Hairless), they could be a fit for you! Despite the reputation of being stand offish, some cats are quite snuggly. They are also much quieter and don't slobber. They're less work, but also love you (even if they don't show it sometimes). Also, they're cute as hell. Aside from that, I would totally look in to rats! I know, I know. It sounds ridiculous. However, rats are insanely smart. They can learn their names and tricks and everything. Maybe cuddling isn't so realistic with them, but it's a thought. I would also look in to rabbits.

In my eyes, I've accepted this other life in to my hands. It means that I will care for it and love it as best as I possibly can and give him the best of days until his last day. My entire god damned life changed when I got my dog. The difference was like night and day. I cannot stress that he took over my entire life. The necessity to accept some level of shedding, slobber, and barking is pretty metaphorical for what it's like to own a dog. You just kind of have to accept that they are going to bleed in to every part of your life at least a little. Furthermore, every dog comes with his/her challenges. Just like with humans, they're all going to have some type of issue. They might be too stubborn or do badly with other dogs or hates being alone. It's something that is a part of owning a dog. I only put all of this out there because I truly didn't understand how much work it was until I did it. Even people who had childhood dogs don't really understand it until they do it. Having another life in your hands is something else entirely. As far as sensing panic attacks go, yeah some dogs can do it. It's got something to do with the heightened senses. They can sense that your mood is shifting and your breath is getting faster for example. Then, the will likely react, and they can be trained to react how you want them to. However, it's not realistic to just expect a dog to be able to do that. Atlas does not give a single fuck about when I'm going through some shit. In regards to Golden-doodles, I never encourage purchasing them or any other designer breed. A designer breed is any breed that is bred for popularity and profit rather than toward a standard. Although I really adore the concept of a golden-doodle, they are currently not a recognized breed. Therefore, they are not bred towards any sort of standard whatsoever, and thus cannot be ethically bred dogs. I do hope that in the future they can be established and recognized though. After pondering all of that, I think you could do well with a companion breed dog. They tend to be low shed, bark, and slobber, and tend to be really cuddly and velcro-like. The one issue is that velcro-like behavior comes with a downside. They can over-anxious and develop separation anxiety rather easily. Then, you have a person with anxiety and a dog with anxiety and it's just a bad anxiety party that no one wants to be at. If you can stomach shedding (because cats shed a truckload) or would be interested in getting a sphynx Cat (Hairless), they could be a fit for you! Despite the reputation of being stand offish, some cats are quite snuggly. They are also much quieter and don't slobber. They're less work, but also love you (even if they don't show it sometimes). Also, they're cute as hell. Aside from that, I would totally look in to rats! I know, I know. It sounds ridiculous. However, rats are insanely smart. They can learn their names and tricks and everything. Maybe cuddling isn't so realistic with them, but it's a thought. I would also look in to rabbits. A lot of people raise these guys in cages, but I know some who raise them free-range around the house or outside and they're very happy! ", "link_id": "t3_962pf1", "time": 1533896197}}

If you can accept some flexibility there, here's my list: * **Bichon Frise:** These guys match your desire for a loving and snuggly pup. The issue here is that they are C-L-I-N-G-Y, and I would be wary leaving them alone for as long as you are looking to. However, they're a pretty good fit overall! They are not easy to groom though and I would highly suggest getting it professionally done. * **Maltese:** Another one in the companion group. Again, the issue of clinginess comes up. Notably, you are east coast and these guys don't tolerate the cold too well. This can be remedied with sweaters and such though. * **Toy Poodle:** They tick almost all your boxes! They are a little more barky, but I've met plenty of quiet enough poodles. Notably, they are again sO CLINGY, and I may worry about that. * **Shih Tzu:** This one, despite being in the companion breed, tends to tolerate being alone a bit better than the previous two. They do tend to shed more though. * **Yorkie:** Overall, if you can tolerate them begin a little more barky, I think that these guys might be a good fit for you. They tend to be more independent than the first three on the list. You did list that you would go either or for rescue or breeder. One of the things that I would be most worried about going in to rescuing a companion breed like the ones you're looking at is going to be the genetics. Unfortunately, many of the dogs that end up in shelters and rescues are not very well bred as most reputable breeders actually have clauses in their contracts with pup-parents that they will actually return the dog if it doesn't work out. So, as I am sad to say, a lot of the ones that you find in shelters or rescues are backyard bred and not very neurotically sound. Because of this, these breeds that are already prone to separation anxiety may have the deck stacked against them to begin with. Combine this with the fact that you work roughly 7 hours a day, I would be worried. I will say that I've never owned a companion breed though, so I can't really say from experience exactly how much of a worry it is, but I can say that I own a breed that is commonly backyard bred, and the genetics really do play a factor. Being vigilant about good training and positive behavior reinforcement goes a long way though. All of that aside, this is under the pretense of you living alone.

It's owners like this that gives Shepherds and their owners a bad name and it's really discouraging. I've had my dog on a lead in public before and had some grown ass man say \"careful, he's going to eat \\[a passerby Chihuahua\\]\". It was honestly heartbreaking and really frustrating. People like this really grind my gears. On one hand, there are big and small dog sides for a very good reason. It's the reason why dog day cares separate. Usually, this is for the small dog's safety. Predatory drift is a thing, and not all dogs are gentle with smaller dogs. It can be unsafe and I never want to see a dog hurt. What's more is that the big dog will almost always receive blame for the situation. Yet, I also understand the desire to socialize their dogs. The dog park is the easiest and quickest way to encounter other dogs of multiple sizes. While in a perfect world, there would be easy pup play dates arranged, in reality, it's not so easy. Furthermore, dogs can learn a lot from one another. Big dogs need to interact with small dogs to learn how to interact with them and vice versa. When Atlas was a puppy, I did bring him in to the big dog side of the park, but I was very careful. I followed him around at a safe distance and made sure interactions were safe. I also sat on a bench that he was free to dive under if he ever wanted to disengage. He did get dog-piled once or twice, but he did learn from the situation. He learned how to interact with dogs that were behaving that way. It's worth noting that Atlas was never what I would really classify as small. He was probably 30-35 pounds when I was doing this. Because of this, he knows how to behave with dogs of all sizes. The one time I flipped out is when someone brought their chihuahua puppy to the big dog side. This dog was still pink. I was afraid my dog was going to paw him and he was going to get hurt. I can sympathize with both sides, and, as always, I think that with enough owner care and such and things, it can be okay.

I call in to question what situation allowed them to attain the dog in the first place, but I get it. What I need to highlight is that the last two times I was away from my dog for more than a week, I had crippling psychotic breaks. Last time, I ended up curled up in a little ball sobbing in the open trunk of a car. I need him and he needs me. I rely on him. When people want to get in to no pet housing and ask for advice, you will undeniably see an onslaught of comments saying \"Oh just register he as an emotional support animal, there's a million links online\". As I'm sure you know, those links are all bogus. However, this isn't common knowledge and people continue to do it. Inherently, this doesn't hurt anybody, but it is kind of a dick move. Where it gets dicey is when the people that have \"registered their dogs\" have ill mannered dogs. We see reports of people with ESAs that have bit other people on airplanes. Whenever I see reports like this, I let out a sigh of sadness. Yet, I also feel for the guy that got bit. He was trying to fly somewhere and some special snowflake decided that they were above the rules. There's also an issue with PDOCS readily supplying letters to those who say they have anxiety regardless of whether or not it is true. Often times, these people are the same people who feel that they should be special and can bring their dogs wherever they want as if they were service dogs. People know they are not doing the ethical thing and taking advantage of a system that is made for people that need it, but people don't care. Then, they become the majority. The thing is, it's a lot like GSD ownership. I imagine it's also like pittie ownership, doberman ownership, and so on. Look. I get it. My dog breed has a reputation and people are wary of them. I chose this dog breed and I love him and think he's my little spoon, but I know people have certain opinions. I frequently get asked how I could own such an \"aggressive breed\" and that my dog is \"going to eat their dog\". It is incredibly frustrating, but it is an example of the pattern of the masses being applied to the individual. It's incredibly frustrating for me, so I usually call Atlas an assistive animal. It is still a correct term and it does not ring alarm bells in people's brains. I also try to be a really good representative of the owner of one and be considerate to those around me. In example, I probably won't ever try to fly him. If I do, I will likely have him sedated. He is big and he is going to be a huge inconvenience to everybody involved on the plane. Honestly, at the end of the day, it all makes me really angsty. I also hate that this entire thing has come to make a mockery of mental health issues. ", "link_id": "t3_93qraz", "time": 1533162749}}

{"e3eqfyh": {"text": "No I do not. I used to when Atlas was younger, but I've had a few bad experiences and no longer go. Most of the bad experiences have been with owners and not the dogs. I prefer dropping him off at day care if I want him to have the opportunity to play with other dogs. I would arrange playdates if I had friends with dogs my dog liked, but alas I do not. In theory, dog parks are awesome. A place where dog owners can go for free and allow their dogs to socialize and tire one another out? Awesome. However, in reality, dog owners have different philosophies and almost everybody is looking down at their phone. A few of my hugest pet peeves about dog parks are: * **Children**: I am all for children at the park if they are well behaved and parents understand that these are dogs in a dog space where there's a lot of energy. Most of the time, they are not well behaved. I have had multiple small children try to handle my dog while he was wrestling with other dogs, and I've had two boys try to play catch at the park, frustrating the dogs. I've also seen a toddler that could not yet walk at the park. Also, it's already hard to keep track of a dog, I cannot imagine how difficult it is to keep track of both a dog and a child. If a child gets hurt on accident, it's likely still going to fall on the dog in the eyes of the law. *  **People who bring food:** I do not know what compels people who bring food to the dog park. It is a mess for resources and can lead to my sensitive stomach dog being fed something he shouldn't eat. * **Poorly behaved dogs:** I know that it must be hard for those with those with non dog-dogs who their owners want to get accustomed to other dogs. However, I have a particularly scarring experience of a huge German Shepherd (100 + pounds at least) that went around harassing each dog one by one. He made my then 50 pound Shepherd scream in pain and it was very unpleasant. When my puppy went up to try to play with a smaller dog after, the family picked up their dog in fear. It broke my heart, but I understood. They just saw a dog that looked just like him (albeit double the size) terrorize other dogs. I understand that scraps break out from time to time and that's natural. However, I've seen some dogs go full on and that's not great. * **Poorly behaved owners:** having their dogs on leash and throwing off the power dynamic, promoting resource guarding, owners straight up kicking their dogs... it's awful Because of these reasons, I no longer go. I do miss it though. Atlas has this best friend Sadie at the park. She was the best. She's a bigger Rottie and she wouldn't give Atlas the time of day when he was smaller. She waited until he got to at least 75 pounds before she would engage him and she would still watch her strength. They had another Boxer friend named Brutus and it was great. Brutus and Atlas played hard and were ver vocal. Some people found it scary, but Brutus' owner and I had an understanding about our dogs and we watched them carefully. It's also an amazing place for those without yards to play fetch. Here in the US, leash laws are really strict. Essentially, we are not supposed to have our dogs off lead anywhere but at dog parks and our homes (bar some exceptions of course). Thus, those without yards really don't have places for their dogs to be off lead and play. We can drop off at day care, but we don't get to play with them ourselves in situations like that.

{"e3emmqq": {"text": "Unpopular opinion: Just because he is an aspie, he doesn't get to be a dick. I would consider the entire relationship long term if for nothing else, but the sake of your child. I know this subreddit is generally against the \"leave them\" route, and I'm not by any means saying to go straight to that, but I would put that in your periphery.To preface everything I'm saying and to put it all in to perspective, I will have to tell you a little bit about my identity and my relationship. I have been diagnosed with a few things, but bipolar disorder is my primary diagnosis. My lovely partner has been diagnosed with a few things, but the most prominent one we see on a day to day basis is his ASD. I totally acknowledge that ASD is a different outlook in seeing the world, and that medication tends to work to limit certain manifestations (e.g. anxiety) as opposed to reorganizing the way his brain works. That's simply the way it works and it's something we face together.If raising my puppy has taught me anything, it has shown me a little bit of what I would be like as a parent. I love my partner. I will always love my partner. However, when and if I have a child, just like my puppy, his/her life and happiness will **always** come first. When I had this theoretical child, I was making a promise to them and to myself that I was going to provide the best possible life I could for them. Children are products of their environment. I spent 21 years in a family setting like the one you listed due to my father's untreated bipolar disorder (passive aggressiveness, adult tantrums, etc.). Our family fell apart and we are still navigating the system to this day. My sister and I grew up deeply disturbed due to my father's behavior. We hadn't even realized it was abnormal until much later in life when it had already made impressions on us. The hugest example was the lack of a healthy relationship model from my parents. From a young age, it normalized my father taking advantage of my mother's kindness and putting up with tantrums and bullshit. I'm happy to report that this past year has been so difficult for my family, but we are all finally in therapy and progressing. This entire process has taught my sister and I that we all have years of childhood trauma to undo.Throughout the years, my mother said the exact same thing you said: that she felt like she was mothering three children. Over time, she grew to placate him when he had tantrums because, although he acted like a child, he still had some dynamics of adulthood. He would make the entire house a living nightmare if he was left to his devices, and my mother harbored 25 years of resentment. She spent the last ten deeply unhappy in her marriage and that's no way to live life.There's a chance for you to prevent this type of thing from happening. I am aware that your husband cannot change the fact that he is an Aspie, and I am by no means blaming him for it. However, I am going to highlight that he is dealing with his manifestations in an unhealthy manner. It's okay to have challenges. It's okay to be frustrated that the child isn't very adult yet. This is all normal reaction. What is not an acceptable/normal reaction is that your husband allows himself to become a jerk. I know that sometimes, it is difficult for us with challenges to help ourselves. It spirals so quickly and, before we know it, we are just... assholes. I address this nowadays by being very active in my emotions and leaving the situation. If the situation is too much for me, I will say \"Babe I'm sorry, but I need to excuse myself so I can scream in to a pillow for a second.\" I cannot and do not let the hand that I've been dealt hurt the people I care for. I do not allow my condition to make me a fucking asshole.The two of you need to talk about **both** your feelings. There needs to be communication about how to deal with difficult situations in a more healthy manner. It needs to be a give and a take. More than anything, your husband sounds like a jerk because he is putting himself before the child. For me personally, that's not a reality I would accept.Edit: I wanted to put out there that I know it's kind of a catch 22. Him walking away from the situation doesn't make him the best father figure, but that's better than being a passive aggressive jerk. Although it's not ideal, it is better than the alternative. I don't think anybody is a perfect parent. I think that it is okay as long as he contributes to the child rearing in other ways. ", "link_id": "t3_93kp60", "time": 1533122885}}

For some reason, just because they are under our roofs, we expect them to be \"civilized\". A really sad example is if an owner leaves a dog with a higher prey drive with another smaller dog at home. Sometimes, we see stories on this subreddit about the larger dog accidentally killing the smaller dog.

I think that these things hold true regardless of if one or both parties are facing mental health challenges. Obviously, with challenges, there will be times that we need more help, but it\u2019s important to be aware of that. From what I understand, your partner isn\u2019t seeking treatment. At the end of the day, it is their individual choice whether or not to seek treatment. In fact, if you strong arm them, it\u2019ll likely end up not working altogether. Treatment is a choice.

Then, hopefully, the two of you can talk about why you are feeling this way and what the two of you can do moving forward. Here\u2019s how I see it: I have bipolar disorder. That\u2019s never going to change. All I can do is play the hand I\u2019ve been dealt in this life the best I can. I also know that, when left untreated, my bipolar disorder caused me to hurt the people I care about.

Atlas is going to round two years old this week, and although he's grown up in a lot of ways, he's also still a puppy in a lot of ways. You can very much see the puppy in his eyes. I think Atlas is a pretty well behaved pup. The only thing is he still has issues with jumping when he gets too excited, but we are working on it. I can only continue to correct. He also still fucking excitement pees when he sees people he likes. He's better now, but he still does it. Six months was particularly difficult for Atlas. He was entering adolescence and he was this big clunky idiot. If I was a sitter on Rover, I wouldn't want to watch a six month Shepherd either, but that's not your fault! They're puppies, and they're big puppies (often times teething during this time too). As far as smaller dogs go, I'm afraid there's not too much I can say on the topic.

I saw in your post history that you were bringing home your German Shepherd puppy in 7 weeks 8 days ago. Are you just having little jitters? Firstly, I cannot seem to locate about your ESA situation. [This is my post on the power of a psychiatric ESA](https://www.reddit.com/ In the post, I talk about how ESAs can serve people in different ways. Depending on these different ways, different breeds may fit the bill. So, if you're comfortable with disclosing it, what (and how) exactly would you like this future pup to be supporting you emotionally? As a person that owns a German Shithead, I don't often recommend them. However, it seems like you would be a wonderful owner for one! Will it be a better fit for you than a Poodle? I am unsure. I've never owned a Poodle and each dog and each person is different. * With competition obedience in mind, I might lean toward Poodle rather than Shepherd. Shepherds love to please their owners, but they have a HUGE attitude while doing it. Mine tries to be a smart-ass. From what I gather, Poodles might be a bit better for this. * I can't imagine doing disc with my dog because he is ungraceful and very clunky. Every shepherd owner I know thinks their dog is clumsy as hell. * Your activity level sound amazing! You would make a high-exercise requirement dog really happy! * Obviously the brushing/shedding thing is going to be different between the two breeds. GSDs shed like nothing else though... even compared to Goldens. * They're known as bark-y but mine isn't overly bark-y so that hasn't been my experience. * Shepherds, in my experience, tend to have excellent recall. I suppose maybe going back to those human shepherd dog shepherd roots, but I can walk out of a park without looking and I know Atlas will be by my side. His emergency recall is like him hitting a wall and turning around. It's something I'm really proud of. As far as your 4 points at the end, a GSD does tick all of them. I will warn you though, the people that I know that have raised dogs growing up, when getting their first herding breed, they said it was like night and day.

As another commenter said, the breed tends to be high anxiety. I know Atlas feeds off of my emotions and he does get anxious when I get anxious. Ironically, that is one of the qualities that make him a good ESA for me, but I digress. * I know you listed that you want a \"mean\" looking dog, but it's something that I don't generally recommend for service work. People give me a really hard time with Atlas as is. I don't take him anywhere above pet level, but even walking down the street, people do give us a difficult time saying \"how could you keep such an aggressive animal?!?!?\" \"he's so dangerous!!!\". Bringing him in to public places would probably provoke a great deal of people. Although that shouldn't matter, in my experience, quite a few people will come up to you and let you know it. People, unfortunately, do discriminate. * The natural wariness isn't great. * Lastly, I think the most important stand out point is the health issues. Realistically, the breed isn't very healthy. Mine came to me at 10 weeks with a genetic issue right away and I realistically do not expect him to live to full expectancy. We know the importance of a service dog. Having them out of commission due to health issues is a double whammy of them not being there to assist you and you being very worried about them. Now, I never ever discount an individual dog as a service dog due to their breed. Each dog is different. On paper, huskies are horrible service dogs, but I've met a phenomenal one. He just was out of the standard. However, if you are selecting a puppy from a breeder, I would set the puppy up for as much success as possible regarding expected breed traits. I would recommend: * Poodle * I would also look in to Goldens and Labs even though yours shows her belly for pets immediately. Going in to the breeder, you can look for a breeder that is breeding towards the lines you are looking for. Lots of labs are used as service dogs and many of them come from excellent breeders that go in to breeding with that in mind. * Bernese Mountain Dogs: I think these dogs are fucking amazing. I am a herding dog girl, but this breed holds a place in my heart. I would be concerned about the size and lifespan though. They're also primarily black dogs which can \"scare\" people.

The real issue happens when I have to be away for over 2 weeks, but up to then, it's fine. Honestly, having him there wouldn't be great. Because he is an ESA, he isn't held to the same standards as a service dog, and thus, hasn't been through that same rigorous desensitization training. I imagine him taking it not well would result in an awful time for those around me as well. The space on a plane is small enough without him there as, again, he's 75 pounds. Lastly, I would never consider flying my dog cargo. Even though he likes his crate and considers it his safe place, I cannot imagine how terrifying it would be in a dark, loud, pressure moving box that he's never been before without me there to comfort him. It would be so scary for him and I wouldn't want that.  There's nothing wrong with people who fly their dogs when they need their dogs, but for me, it's not something I would consider.

He loved the thing and it was always loaded with high value treats that he didn\u2019t get otherwise. It worked his brain and associated crate with high reward. There\u2019s a lot of kibble puzzle toys too: iq ball, wobbler (I love this one!), bob-a-lot, tug-a-jug (this one is really fucking hard for even me and I have opposable thumbs ok). Your pup has lab in him so if he has that good motivation, this might be a good outlet. I think you mentioned indoor fetch.

It\u2019s also a really great one to train leave it, drop it, and such with. It costs like $5 to make with a PCV pipe, rope, and tennis balls.

I learned my reputable breeder lesson after I got Atlas, and I will absolutely be taking all of the precautions to follow that route in my many dogs to come. Trust me, you might think $2000 is a lot to pay for a puppy right off the bat when you could get one from a backyard \"breeder\" for $500, but Atlas raked up **$4000 in vet bills in his first year of life.** German Shepherds are a challenging breed. I know quite a few breeders part at 8 weeks, but I would have the breeder keep the pups until 10 weeks if they'd be willing. They are a naturally mouthy breed (you just wait...) and are nicknamed land-sharks. They need all the fucking lessons from their litter-mates as they can get. The breed is known to be smart (and god they are), but that also comes with a huge issue. People always say \"I wish my dog was smart!\" No you don't. You really don't. Atlas once hid my shoe so I wouldn't leave the house and I was late by 45 minutes. He opens drawers and doors and he is the worst. I love him though. A smart dog comes with his own opinions. The best example I have is that Atlas has a Golden Retriever friend named Flynn. At the park once, my partner at the time told both dogs to sit (Atlas knew sit). Flynn smiled and plopped his bum down on the ground for the absolute stranger like it wasn't an issue at all while HIS OWN DOG looked at him like \"I'm not doing it without a treat\". This intelligence quickly barrels in to balls of nerves if not treated right. Removing a pup from his litter itself is a very stress inducing activity. Doing it earlier is just not great.

{"e2vwg2d": {"text": "Hi friend! I had to look up lymphangectasia, and I cannot comment on that. Atlas does have IBD and SIBO though, so I can tell you a bit about IBD. First: **your dog is not going to die**. It's difficult to get the right combination of diet and meds, but it's very do-able. * Yes. It gets easier. Atlas was emaciated through his ENTIRE life from when I got him at 10 weeks. These days (he's almost 2!), he is a perfectly healthy weight and I actually have to worry about keeping weight off of him. I cannot fucking believe how well he's doing and yes, by god, it's possible. * I am always going to be frightened of a relapse. It's something that is never pleasant. I remember last time this happened, I was in school and Atlas was waking me up every 2 hours to be taken out (I live on the third floor up 4 flights of stairs). I would get home, and he would have broken out of his crate and diarrhea'd everywhere. It was a constant nightmare. I am always frightened, but the good thing is: I am ready now. We haven't had a relapse in about 8 months! Every time the poops get a little bit soft, I roll out the calvary. * Yes! Atlas is a fucking menace. His energy is just fine! * I absolutely love [the real dog box](https://real.dog/). They are just dehydrated animal parts and my dog does amazingly on them. I feed raw, so it's a super easy thing for my dog. However, i know plenty of people who feed kibble and use them as well. There's tons of variety and I love that they are literally all just one ingredient. There is nothing else in the treat-- just a dehydrated meat part. It makes things simpler. Now, I have Atlas' IBD more or less under control and god I'm so thankful. I have a few tips for ya. * **Feed what food works for your dog.** You will find yourself scrutinizing anything you are feeding your dog more than you ever thought you would. You will drive yourself nuts looking at the bags. Here's the thing though: if your dog does well on some food people are claiming is \"bad\", as long as you are personally comfortable with the food, feed it. Again, Atlas eats homemade raw and I am so thankful for it. It allows me to control every single aspect of his diet. While I know this isn't for everybody, I know a lot of IBD dogs see success on it. [Here is my long rambly post on Atlas and his history](https://www.reddit.com/ * **Read the Poo.** I scrutinize every single poop Atlas makes. It is my #1 sign of his digestive health and it keeps me up to date with his condition in the best way he can. Even if it's the middle of the night, you fucking bet I get out a flashlight and look at it. He was with a friend all last week while I was out of town, and I made it a point that if he ever made a bizarre poop, that the friend had to take a photo and send it to me. If I see the signs, I have to deploy the GI infantry. * **Decide How you Feel About Antibiotics and Steroids.** Having an IBD dog isn't easy. Seeing him starve despite eating all he could was so painful. However, I think the worst thing is when he needed a steroid shot a little bit over a year in to his life. While I am totally comfortable utilizing steroids and antibiotics when necessary, I am not a fan of using them as a permanent solution. Seeing the long term effects in humans is just not something I am going to go with if I'm able to help it. If you decide similarly to me, it's important to get a routine down. Quite a few people I know use antibiotics and steroids long term, but (to me) it's sort of waiting for the next episode to come. Again, this is just my belief system and no one is in any way obligated to follow in it. **The Cavalry:** This is going to be a list of all of the different medications (traditional and non-traditional that I've tried with Atlas). \\* = the things I use when the poop starts getting loose. * Metronidazole (and all the other antibiotics): They're antibiotics and they do what they're supposed to do. Again, I don't like them long term because of antibiotic resistance, but I do use them when he needs them. * Pro-perctalin: The stuff is great! It's a good stool firmer and I use it when my natural remedies don't cut it. * Fortiflora: good shit. It's got enzymes and we all know they need them enzymes. * Fish Oil\\*: Packed with anti-inflammatories and it's nice for his coat * Kelp\\*: More anti inflammatories * Turmeric\\*: More anti inflammatories * Raw Goat Milk\\*: More probiotic cultures than fortiflora. I'd feed Kombucha if I could afford it, but I know plenty of feeders that make their own to feed their pups. * Slippery Elm Powder\\*: Godsend. I'll let you do your own research on it, but it changed the game for Atlas and me. * ProBios Powder\\*: This gets tossed in on extra gnarly days and kicks it up a notch further. * Because Atlas is raw fed, I also crank up the bone content a little bit. What you can do is get a thing of bone meal and supplement with that when it gets soft. You're going to want to be careful though. You really don't wanna go overboard and you want to follow guidelines for your pet's weight, but it should work. Groups: * [This is an awesome IBD facebook support group. ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/11164787803/?ref=bookmarks)I generally like their advice, but remember, it's all internet people and everybody has a different experience. * If you prefer a more holistic method, [you can click this one](https://www.facebook.com/groups/292537937935806/?ref=bookmarks).

I knew that he learned sit very early on (maybe 12 weeks old), but at 6 months, I was still praising him and throwing a party every single time he did it successfully.

It's really hard because god raising puppies is hard. It's also difficult when you *know* that you should ignore her and let her be a menace and settle herself, but she's biting you and it's so frustrating. It's hard. I get it. Every time that this happened to me and I felt frustration boiling, I would excuse myself. I would not hit my dog under any circumstances. Atlas had REALLY fragile self esteem as a puppy. I couldn't afford to inflict that fear. Nevertheless, I have totally accidentally stepped on him before. I was so afraid that I broke him. Turns out, puppies don't break after one incident. They develop bad habits over a series of bad influences over time. Every single time your puppy acts out, it's an opportunity to teach her and let her be a better dog. As fucking frustrating as it was, I breathed deeply and allowed my determination to guide me. Sometimes, I would be shaking with anger, but I held that shit in for my puppy. When it got too tough, it really helped me to think about what Atlas was going through. I couldn't imagine how afraid he was, in this new house with these aliens that don't want him to explore with his mouth and seem to not like when he poops. With your baby with a broken arm, her growling is likely just her reacting to being in pain and not yet understanding what's around her. She's grumpy because she feels fragile and she's afraid. The two of you haven't been together too long, and later in her life, if she breaks her arm, you can reasonably expect her to let you soothe her, but for now, your relationship is still forming. Even that, you've already started yourself in a not great place with hitting her early on. You *must* change your behavior. Is your puppy doomed because of what's happened to her? No. I think it's difficult to doom a puppy. However, if you continue this behavior, your puppy will fall in to a negative spiral. Every time you let it happen and say you won't do it next time, you are losing a learning opportunity. With every negative experience, you may have to work 10 times harder to create 10 times the positive experiences. You have to make the change today, and you have to commit yourself to the change. Go to the next room and scream in to a pillow if you have to. Go outside and run laps if you have to.

I know that it can be really disheartening because it's hard to communicate with your dog, but keep noting the symptoms and I would start keeping a notebook of them. It's really helpful to go to the vet with it in hand and tell them accurately what your dog is experiencing. I would note all things from general behavior, stool consistency, frequency of stool, eating habits, etc. During this time, I would try really hard to keep an eye on her weight. You said she's a lab/husky mix so I suspect she's on the larger side and not super easy to weigh at home, but you'd be stunned how quickly they can lose weight if they aren't getting their nutrients due to health issues. This also serves as a great indicator. Mucous-y stool with blood is never a fun sign, so going to the vet was the right call. Usually, the first line of defense is to check for worms and parasites. Although your dog cleared the first test, I know that some vets like to test for parasites twice as it can sometimes not show up on the first panel. Atlas displayed similar behavior when he contracted Giardia and Coccidia. Antibiotics are also a super common thing to prescribe and have likely helped the parasites if there were any. Moving on from there, lots of vets do a general GI panel. From there, if issues persist, I would take a look at the TLI (for SIBO and EPI). It's rare, but worth looking in to. Has your dog always been a snippy about food? You said she was a grazer, but didn't say much else about her eating habits. I know that mine is really snippy on top of being a sensitive GI baby, so it was important for me to distinguish if he was just being an ass or if it was some upset. It's important to compare to their normal behavior. Rice and chicken sees a lot of success, and pumpkin does too. However, these days, I use different remedies that I have found work for my dog. Personally, I don't like to feed Hills I/D simply because it's not something that I stand by (being carbohydrate heavy). There's nothing wrong with it. It just doesn't work for Atlas. (He won't eat it.) I would decide this food is something that you are comfortable eventually transitioning to before moving forward. At the end of the day, I can't really diagnose him over the internet obviously. Here are some remedies that have been nice to Atlas and me: * Antibiotics (I try not to need this. it's been a while since I've used them) * Steroids (only for when it gets really really bad. have only needed once) * Pro-pectalin (stool firmer) * Fortiflora * Raw Goats Milk (more cultures than fortiflora) * Slippery Elm Powder * Anti-inflammatory foods best of luck!

What I will say though, is that you did purchase Annie from a \"backyard breeder\" but not a puppy mill. Responsible ethical breeders *do not* have oopsie litters with the exception of maybe a rogue stray breaking in to their breeding grounds while their female dogs are in heat. Craigslist is not a reliable place to get a puppy and does not *usually* indicate ethical breeding. However, this does not mean people who have oopsie litters are bad people. I always advocate spaying and neutering as a precaution if the dog isn't going to be bred simply because it's something I believe in. I think there are way too many homeless dogs to do anything else. However, I also understand freak accidents happen. I understand that, sometimes, your dog is in heat, gets really determined, breaks out of your house and gets impregnated by the guy down the street's dogs. I think the most important thing here is the intent. It really doesn't seem like this woman wanted to turn these puppies for a profit. She was just trying to give her dog's babies to a good home and I really can't fault her for that particularly when it is a one-off instance. I do hope she spays and learns from this experience though. While oopsies are not great, sometimes, they will happen and that's the reality of it. We can only try to be better (thus the importance of education on spay/neuter!)

{"e2gyok2": {"text": "This is a roommate issue and not an ESA issue, but as a person with a psychiatric ESA, I am not going to recommend one in this situation either way.I graduated last Spring, so I'm about a year older than you and I got my psychiatric support animal almost 2 years ago. I got him as a puppy and he is my entire world. He has improved my mental health leaps and fucking bounds. I love him with all of my heart and he is everything to me. I am not even kidding, the last time I thought he was going to be taken from me, I had a psychiatric break. I nearly landed my ass in the mental hospital and I was falling apart. I was psychotic and quite actually out of my mind because I thought he was going to lose him.Animals are so powerful, but they can hurt as much as they can help. The first two months of owning my dog was fucking hell because he was my puppy that knew nothing. The next five were not that much better because it was just so fucking much responsibility.Let me ask you the big ticket question:**Think not about what the dog for you, but also what you could do for this dog. An animal is a living breathing creature. Yes, he/she will likely help you with your depression, but when you are depressed, what will happen when you just can't get out of bed to walk him/her and they start literally eating the wall? In short: are you ready for the responsibility of an entire other life?**It is so much responsibility and it caused crippling panic attacks and depression for me. There's this thing called puppy blues (happens with adult dogs too). It is compared to what a mother feels when she has postpartum depression. For those of us that deal with mental health challenges regarding depression. It is actually just Puppy Depression instead of Puppy Blues.If you're trying to find a way to \"deal with\" your roommates not being on board with it, I would never ever recommend getting this dog. A dog is an entire home thing. Although they might not need to be in the loop with training and stuff, a dog is going to want to interact with the housemates. There is going to be shedding. There is going to be dog smell. A dog is a living creature and simply trying to placate your roommates and say \"do it for my mental health\" isn't always good enough. It can lead to resentment and conflict that is really horrible for mental health.In addition to that, the laws around ESAs and landlords are really fucking murky. I am navigating them right now and it's hard. In short, they are not required to okay the dog. You might be able to get \"sure\" from your landlord because it is legally required in some aspects, but it's going to make for a bad time for you and your roommates. They did not sign up to live with a dog and it's not great of you to try to force them to. Try to think if you'd behave differently if one of them was hugely allergic.Lastly, I feel like you're putting too much emphasis on this dog \"doing leaps and bounds\" for your mental health. While I would say that Atlas did that for me, there didn't start being more good days than bad days until nearly over a year in. It's a lot of work and I nearly never recommend it to a college student, much less a college student facing mental health challenges AND roommates that do not approve.Edit: **Also a huge point is: if you've been saving up for a shelter dog for a long time, I'm sorry to say, but I don't think dog ownership is great right now. Dogs are fucking expensive. Atlas spent FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS in vet bills in his first year of life alone. That's not including exam fees and vaccinations. Then toss in food, tools (leashes, collars, etc.), and toys and you have nearly close to five thousand probably. It's fucking expensive and nothing feels worse in the world (and can be worse for your mental health) than seeing an animal you love so fucking much suffer. Trust me, I know. When Atlas was sick with his issues that the veterinarian and I were having trouble diagnosing, I was sick to my stomach and depressed every fucking day.  I felt like a failure and a bad dog parent. If there ever was a situation where I couldn't pay for him to get the help he needs, I would be beside myself.** ", "link_id": "t3_8z7y0g", "time": 1531727553}}

First, you are a super articulate person and you sound so wonderful and caring. You sound like a fantastic partner. I commend you so fucking much for getting up and leaving when it got abusive the first time. The worst part about mental illness I think is that we often don\u2019t start recovering until we hit rock bottom. It can be so hard for us to actually hit that stage sometimes because the people we love catch us. However, in doing that, they break our fall and they often times get crushed. Sometimes, loving both yourself and the other person means stepping away and letting them hit the ground. You have to trust in them to pick themselves up. It might take an hour and it might take ten years, but that picking self up is something we need to choose. It looks like she picked herself up. She had a job and she seems so much better from your post, and I\u2019m so happy for you both! Yet, it\u2019s so crucial to remember recovery is a process that we are never really going to be free from. It\u2019s a part of my life each and every day. I\u2019m not gonna lie. It\u2019s tiring and taxing. Sometimes, I just wanna stay up late or sleep for 3 days in a row, but I know I have to use my tools and not do that. Unfortunately, wanting to go off of our mess is a really regular issue of when things are too good. Somehow, we forget we need them (???) and want to stop. We think to ourselves \u201cwait I\u2019m *normal* now. I don\u2019t need meds\u201d. Then, the cycle repeats itself. It sucks bad. The good news there is, usually, after a few cycles, we can come to accept a different state of our illness. We can realize that \u201cyes, we need the meds to be stable and good to those around us, but no, there is nothing wrong with that\u201d. To this day I still get the urge to come off of my meds. Hell, I have been doing a super shitty job of taking them this week. However can due to my much practice, I\u2019ve become much clearer with symptoms and signs and whip myself back in to shape before I spiral. It comes with time and practice.

This isn't even to mention how much psychological progress she would have likely have had to make after that entire situation. People and their pre-conceived notions can be so very hurtful.

Hearing \"Grab 'fluffy', he's going to eat her!!!\" seriously is very heartbreaking. Hearing grown men tell their daughters \"Don't pet him. he'll bite you.\" is even more hurtful. However, I think the most hurtful of all is when people commented \"Oh he's too skinny! Are you feeding him?\" or \"You need to feed him more\" or anything like that. This was because Atlas and I were both working so fucking hard for his health already. He was sick from birth and it took my vet and I a long time to track down what it was. He has chronic runny stool and would wake up some days just extraordinarily weak. He is much smaller than his projected size because of it, but I don't mind it. He's my cute puppy.

His aversion to therapy seems also to stem from that idea. However, it\u2019s important to note that therapists usually recommend medication as a tool. He doesn\u2019t *need* to agree. In fact, I know some people who are very open with their therapist saying \u201chey I don\u2019t really want to go on medication\u201d and they\u2019ll try to steer clear. However, there is a point where the therapist might think external help is needed and that\u2019s when medication comes in. If he just wanted to pay someone for medication information and prescription, he could go see a psychiatrist! That\u2019s why there are two separate disciplines.

In order for any of these coping mechanisms to work, we have to believe in them and want them to work. Even then, sometimes it doesn\u2019t, but we have to start somewhere. Have you spoken to him at all to where this attitude comes from? I find that quite a few people that refuse treatment and denounce it in such a dismissive way without trying it to its full extent are, in some ways, very afraid of it. We can be afraid of losing ourselves in the medication or afraid of it all failing. The worst thing is to start recovery and get our hopes up just to get them crushed. Alcohol is medicine. It\u2019s not a very good medicine as it\u2019s unregulated and people can buy it in troves, but it is a depressant.

Some people just don\u2019t like medication, and that\u2019s okay. It just means they need to employ their own mechanisms to ensure the wellbeing of those around them. In example, right now, living separately (if you were together before) is no doubt causing strain. Things like this (if caused or contributed to by BD) should be addressed.

Also, different things will work for different dogs. When Atlas was very young, I was very very careful to do positive only. This is because I noticed that his self esteem and confidence was very low and I needed to reinforce and build it. I did this through lots of positive training as there is a lot of praise associated with it. This worked really fabulous for him! There were times that I got really frustrated though.  Sometimes, he just wouldn't get it. He would act out (esp. the biting phase) and it would be so annoying that I wanted to snap. I stuck it out and did the yelp method and it really worked more incredibly than I could have imagined. He didn't even mouth me during teething. It really taught bite inhibition incredibly well. However, as he got older and much much more confident, (You wouldn't even recognize him as the timid puppy he was &amp; I'm really proud of that) he also developed an attitude. I began to mix in some stern corrections. I will grab him or bop him if he jumps on the counter. I will also sternly tell him to \"shut up\" and such. I only started doing this after Atlas and I established a very positive, trusting, and loving relationship. To this day, our interactions are about 95&amp;#37; positive and 5&amp;#37; negative. I'm okay with that and I think he's okay with that. He's learning and it's effective. I think that a lot of people stress positive only training because it is safer. When you suggest positive only, there is not really that chance of us choosing incorrectly when to correct and when not to and what amount to use. This line is something only you can know for your dog, and I think that we like to suggest positive only as a precaution to fly on the side of safety. ", "link_id": "t3_8x1ae9", "time": 1531056336}}

{"e1xyk49": {"text": "Firstly, I wouldn't reward the puppy when he's being stubborn with a treat. It might be instinct to hand them a toy or a treat when they're being naughty so they get occupied and stop being naughty, but over time, it can reinforce those behaviors. Secondly, 16 weeks is so little! He still has lots to learn and you can totally still address these behaviors early. This does sound like resource guarding to me (particularly the part where you said he gets like this about stuff he really likes), and the auto-mod does a really fabulous job of linking resources. It's not difficult to understand the idea behind resource guarding as none of us like when things are taken away from us. The great part of this is that your pup is still very young, so these behaviors are not set in stone and can be nipped in the bud. Atlas used to have some very minor behaviors like this, but through training while he's a puppy, he lets me take virtually anything out of his mouth. Chin up! You got this. Now, in terms of approaching your 16 week old, try not to be afraid. If a blood draw incident when Atlas was a stupid mouthing puppy decimated my relationship with him every time it happened, he and I would have no relationship to this day. I think something that no one really tells you when you get a puppy (esp. a mouthy breed) is that your hands and ankles are going to be covered in scratches and scars before they aren't. Puppies honestly do not know what they do and their own strength. Because your pup is very young, I would also look in to really honing in on that bite inhibition. Your dog should fundamentally understand \"My mouth is strong, and I shouldn't use it on my owne dogs/whatever because it can hurt them\". You see a lot of people make a big deal of dogs biting and drawing blood. Do not get me wrong, that *is* a huge deal. If Atlas bit and drew blood right now, it would be a huge safety concern of mine. He is no longer 16 week old and him drawing blood can do damage. However, at 16 weeks old, he was going around biting like a landshark until he learned not to.

I think people who cram the adopt don't shop attitude down other people's throats and shame anybody who went the other route are often holier than thou. I think rescuing is an amazing fucking thing. I think giving an animal a chance at a new life after abandonment is something that is wonderful and really should be commended. However, I needed my dog to serve a very specific and niche role in my life, and I needed him to be as predictable as possible. Nobody will succeed in shaming he in going the breeder route and I refuse to be judged based on it.  That being said, it's so fucking important to choose a reputable and ethical breeder. I think that a lot of people grossly underestimate the amount of money that goes in to creating an ethically bred animal. There's a ton of pre-natal care, health testing, and much more. This can lead animals to be up to thousands of dollars. Yet, I would rather see Kat pay thousands for an ethically bred kitten than go through a backyard breeder. OP is right. If these kitties are from ethical breeders, they would *not* under any circumstances, allow the kittens to leave unvaccinated. It is possible that Kat didn't do the follow up booster shots, but they had to leave the breeder with at least the first rounds. **Now playing devils advocate:** I don't agree with her Anti Vaxx views. I will never agree with them and I think it's awful. However, as a person that went through a breeder, I am inclined not to shame her for going through one. If she goes through an ethical breeder, there will undoubtedly be first rounds of shots done. Yet again, I'd rather her go through an ethical breeder than an unethical one. Also, on the attitude of kittens \"nobody wanted\", it's a bit hard for me to imagine. Lots of breeders have litters reserved out up to years in advance. It is possible that the kitties Kat adopted were born \"defective\" in some way and were thus \"void for sale\", but we cannot presume to know. Yet, in this instance, many breeders would keep the animal and see if they could still find the animal a suitable home. In this case, the home found may have been Kat's home. While I know this is all speculation, it is the only way I find this making sense. **On the Other Hand** I am not to aware about her advocacy for pet rights. I am aware she is an advocate for animal rights and veganism, but I am not going to presume I know anything about her work with pets/adopting. If she is going to go around telling people \"adopt don't shop!\" when she \"shopped\" herself, I do think it's a bit hypocritical.

{"e1tpur6": {"text": "It's really helpful to first bring up the possibility of you having Aspergers and what it means. This way she is free to do more research on it if she'd like to. There is a wealth of information online and so much of it is available and some are geared towards NT's to help them understand better. An analogy I liked is: * If people were computers, NT's would be computers that were built for multi-tasking. They can handle lots of tasks at once and switch very quickly. They do everything at a moderate speed. Aspies are like specialized supercomputers. They can process one task extremely rapidly at once, but if they need to switch, they need to take a moment to switch programs. While everybody's experience is different, I think this helped me understand my partner a lot better.I do think that not understanding social cues comes with time. It can be really difficult for a NT to imagine not picking up social cues at is second nature for so many. Those of us that are able to pick up on social cues (I would not call myself a NT by any means) can better understand with time. I think of it as my partner not having the radar device that people without Aspies have that read social cues. This becomes really apparent when my partner just does not understand he's being rude to others and I interject. I would also have a conversation with her about what you can do to make her feel loved. Even though a lot of feeling loved comes from responding to gestures, a discussion about what you can actively do can really help you out. For you, I would work really hard on being more attentive. Despite my partner's Aspie challenges, he is the person in the world that understand me in my entirety the best. This include my cues! While the cues of other humans continues to baffle him, he is more fluent in mine specifically than I could even understand. This is because he has been observing my behavior for almost 8 years now. Although it sounds rather clinical, he is a rather clinical person and I've learned to love him just the same. According to him, he has built a huge database in his mind dedicated to me and my reactions. I've helped him do this by being very vocal with my feelings. \"I didn't like how that made me feel\" and such. In turn, he's been able to really grip me as a person. He does have issues from time to time, but I think nearly every couple does. When he does miss my cues, I will just say \"babe that hurt my feelings\" instead of frowning. We are also very open to the phrase \"I don't understand. Can you please explain it another way?\" when we are speaking. Although my partner has had a ton of practice and is now phenomenal at communicating with me, we weren't always this way and we've totally grown with time. As far as what she can do, there's stuff on her side too! After all, relationships are about both individuals putting in work. My partner finds it helpful when I'm vocal about my feelings, and I am receptive to being asked lots of questions. Also, I'm always happy to explain things to him that he says he doesn't understand. I'm also really open to some of the issues that he has to deal with outside of social cues. In example, we had a sensory issue just last week.

{"e1t3pia": {"text": "Thanks to u/crayhack for summoning me! German Shepherds are pretty notorious for gastrointestinal issues. I quote a very credible animal nutritionist in saying \"A German Shepherd can eat rocks and turn it in to diarrhea\". They are known to be plagued with a myriad of problems such as IBD/IBS, allergies. EPI, and much more. Therefore, they are a pretty \"good\" isolation variable I think. I use \"good\" subjectively because I would wish these health problems away in a heartbeat, but for the purpose of evaluating the \"quality\" of raw food, they make good \"test subjects\". Please do keep in mind that I am a hippie-dippy raw feeder, so take everything I say with a grain of salt. I think, at the end of the day, it depends if you buy in to it and if it's something you believe in. For my particular instance, my and Atlas' story is much like the story you mentioned. Atlas has IBD &amp; SIBO (inflammatory bowel disease &amp; selective intestinal bacterial overgrowth) on top of just being a picky asshole about his food. I researched kibble extensively and had a list of brands that I truly believed in and would still recommend to this day. However, Atlas could not eat any of it without either spewing butt water or turning his nose up within a week. I am aware that some people go the tough love route with kibble, but he was already emaciated and was a growing puppy at the time. Plainly speaking, I could not afford to tough love him. I also looked in to canned, but if I'm being honest, he would have needed to eat 6 cans a day at the time of my looking and I just could not afford that. From there, the two other diets I had heard of was cooked and raw. I had heard more hubbub about raw and hey, if I didn't have to cook it, I wasn't going to complain. I tried raw as a last ditch effort. He was severely underweight where I could see all of his bones whilst being a growing puppy. He was such a happy puppy otherwise, but I could see that he was weak at times. I was sitting on the floor sobbing at one point because I just didn't know what to do. I tried it, and it worked! These days, I really do like raw because I am handling every single piece of the diet myself. It's something that is really important to me because I've come to understand his IBD triggers. I am so grateful for raw food. Is this anecdotal? Yes. I am not going to deny that it is anecdotal. The thing is though, this is the one thing I've tried that works for my dog and I'm going to keep doing it. That is all the reason I need. I actually have to keep an eye on his weight now. Yes, that' right! I have to actually worry about him getting overweight now. This is something I never thought was possible. I always struggled so hard just to keep him a healthy weight that I felt such a wave of happiness when I was actively thinking about possibly cutting his food back due to him gaining too much weight. His coat is shiny, his teeth are clean, and he is healthy and happy. Moving along to vets: My own vet told me when he gave me a package of Hills Z/d to try that he didn't like recommending the food very much as it doesn't have too much nutritional value to it. I really took this to heart because I value what my vet says a great amount. After all, he went to vet school! However, he and I also have an understanding that Atlas is a special needs dog. While he admits to not knowing too much about raw food, he also knows that Atlas is finally healthy overall. Therefore, we have an understanding about me feeding what I believe in. It is true that veterinary schools are sponsored by pet food brands. This does mean that there is a lean towards the industry, and that's not necessarily a bad thing I don't think. I know several raw feeders that seem to think kibble/big companies are the devil, and I just do not think that's true. There are plenty of amazing pet food brands out there and I really do adore Purina Fortiflora. Although I don't use it anymore as Atlas is thriving without the supplement, he did really well on it while he was using it. I view the relationship between pet food brands/industry to vet school sort of like how I view the Pepsi sponsorship I had at my college. While a Pepsi sponsorship meant that there were Pepsi products and machines all over campus, it didn't necessarily mean that they were forcing me to drink Pepsi. I prefer Coke. I jut couldn't buy it on campus. Pepsi is much more accessible and thus a lot more normalized. I'm not too sure about the \"anti-raw\" culture in vet schools. I have not been to vet school, so I cannot comment. I know that some people have talked about it, but I've never really talked to anyone that went to vet school about this subject so I'm not comfortable commenting. Regardless, I do know that they don't teach too much about raw feeding. I also think that vets have so much to learn in school, remember they do all animals (!!!) that it might not be super realistic for them to spend an egregious amount of time on learning the delicate ins and outs of nutrition. Remember, in humans, we have a dentist, an optometrist, surgeons, etc. Yet, with our animals, they just have the one doctor: the veterinarian. Thus, they have a huge amount to learn! I'm really thankful that there is a specialty of animal nutritionists. They've spent a lot more time studying the ins and outs of animal nutrition because they've chosen to specialize in it. Now. *raw is fucking hard.* I am not saying this from a \"honhon I am so skilled. Most people can't do what *I* do\" standpoint. I am saying it from the view of this: when you are raw feeding, often times, there is no AAFCO checking your work. If we don't get it right, our dog's are the ones that suffer, and because they are dogs and can't speak, they can't really tell us how they're feeling. Like any unbalanced diet, over time, this can lead to a great deal of health issues. Even with pre-made raw, the industry is so new that lots of those diets are short on organs or bone. It would need to be labeled, but a lot of feeders don't really know what to look for. If you're doing it yourself, there is just a pile of 50 pounds of meat, and you just have to get the ratios right. There's a lot of math involved with calculating the bone content of say a drumstick. It is 33.3&amp;#37; bone and 66.6&amp;#37; meat. I have to factor all of that in when I'm trying to hit my dog's golden ratios. On top of that, I had to grab a second freezer because it just wasn't realistic fitting 200 pounds of meat a time in my fridge. I follow grocery store ads every single week religiously to circle the best deals, and I am ALWAYS on the prowl for exotic meats. I have made friends with butchers and slaughterhouse owners to keep my prices low. There's a joke in the community that, during prep day, we all break out the wine. It's not easy and not everybody has the time or desire to spend hours upon hours a week doing prep work. While it does get easier with time, and I hadn't prepped in 3 months up to yesterday because I bulked it, it really is a lot of time and energy. Lastly, *kibble is not bad.* Would I feed kibble if it was best for my dog? Absolutely. I will feed whatever is best for my dog and there is nothing more to that. As for me, since my experience with Atlas, I will likely be feeding raw as a default to my future pets bar them not doing well on it. It is something that I believe in and something that I will stand by. However, for the average owner, kibble is a godsend! Not everybody wants to become a fully blown crazy meat lady like me. I am not calling people who feed kibble lazy. I would never ever suggest that. If their dogs do well on kibble, I honestly see no issue with it. It isn't my business what their dogs eat. Kibble is formulated by licensed nutritionists and follows AAFCO standards that ensure they are able to nourish the dogs that are fed it. It is made to work and it is made to be effective. Kibble feeds hundreds of thousands of dogs across the US alone every single day. It is a great thing that works for most but not all dogs.

I would continue to offer her new experiences, but maybe look in to private one-on-one sessions for training. Also, simply because the prime socialization window has closed, does not mean socialization stops. I think that socialization continues until the pups very last day. It's called the *prime* window for a reason. The rest of the time, you are still going to be able to expose her to new experiences. It will be a little more difficult, and you might have to introduce her to the same thing 10 times instead of 3, but it's totally possible! Atlas missed the prime window as well since he had a very nasty bout of parasites during it, and I didn't want to infect other dogs. I worked really hard the moment we could socialize and it helped a ton. We're still working on some things, but he isn't one of those super fearful dogs. Atlas still barks at drive thru workers even though he likes people, so I think it's something about the unique situation of a drive thru. Because of this, I cannot help you at all here. In regards to the not having a gauge of strength with her mouth, this is something that is important to teach ASAP. The bot on this sub has some really fabulous tips for teaching bite inhibition. You are absolutely correct in that it is crucial to do this before she gets much bigger. She has to learn her own strength and that she can hurt people and other things so she can gentler. She doesn't *want* to hurt you. She just doesn't know. There are a couple of things that may have happened with the car. It could really just be that she hates the car SO much and is really stressed, resulting in vomiting. To approach this, I'd start doing short car-rides to the park or something so she associates the car with a good time and it's short at first. A car crate can also be really really helpful here if she's crate trained as it can totally be a safe space for her. However, since she's going to get a lot bigger, you might want to assess if this is a realistic long term strategy. I have a car harness for my dog (Sleepypod) and I really love it. It is now calming for him, but can be stress inducing early on as it restrains the dog. I do like it because it prevents Atlas from crawling all over the car and forces him to capture calm. I sat in the back with him with the harness on funneling treats until he got better with it. Take it one step at a time. I know this subreddit really advocates going to puppy classes, and I think that's amazing for most owners. The thing is though, Atlas was constantly sick throughout puppyhood. I just didn't want to infect any other pups. I ended up doing almost all my training at home. I just made sure I was extremely dedicated. It can totally be done, but it requires a lot of commitment. It might be something you want to consider in your case. I know that people say awesome things about the Fenzi series. ", "link_id": "t3_8vy91j", "time": 1530694578}}

I totally understand the sentiment of just not being very interested in it.I also see your wife's point of view where this 4th of July party comes around once a year whereas board game group may meet weekly. Is there a reason that this party is really important to her? Has she expressed it as such? I would be a little bit more sympathetic to your wife if this party was, for example, a tradition that has really come to define who she is. If this is the case, I could totally see her wanting to share that with you. Sometimes, it's just nice to have our partners around.

I think that having a home-base where she feels happy and safe so she can recharge is really important, and she just doesn't have that right now. It is possible that she views this party as a place of familiarity and happiness and wants to share that moment with you as she hasn't been feeling very much of it lately.Yet, it's also important for the two of you to mutually understand that going everywhere together is *not* a requirement.

It's funny because I eat a lot of junk because, plainly speaking, it's cheaper to eat junk than to eat healthy organic grass fed foods. My pup eats a specifically hand-picked diet due to his special dietary needs. I've seen his health improve leaps and bounds, and that's all I need to keep doing what I'm doing. That being said, it's also normalized for us people to eat a lot of GMOs and plenty of people eat tons of processed foods. In some rare instances, people do survive on exclusively processed foods. In fact, as a person that recently graduated university, plenty of my peers ate a diet of almost exclusively instant noodles and spam. Simply put, noodles and spam is just cheaper. I'm not saying that dog owners that feed kibbles are skimping. I would never suggest that. I think that we should all feed foods that we believe in that our dogs do well on and other opinions don't matter. I'm simply saying that it's not surprising that it's become normalized. Pet food companies formulate foods that work otherwise they wouldn't be in business. They nourish hundreds of thousands of dogs each and every day that wouldn't otherwise have balanced food. Therefore, even though I don't feed it, I'm really thankful that kibble exists. Without it, so many dogs would be short their nutritional needs. Balancing a diet is *not* easy.

{"e1plxnf": {"text": "Firstly, no one can tell you what exactly to do. We can only tell you what we would do given the situation and offer new insight. Only you can make this call for yourself. Now, there\u2019s a whole bunch to unpack here. I will first start with communication. I think that it\u2019s really great the two of you are in counseling, but it seems like there\u2019s a long way to go. Both your comments if \u201cokayyy\u201d and his \u201clet\u2019s get it over with\u201d are passive aggressive in nature and not very healthy ways of communication. It\u2019s something to acknowledge and assess if the both of you are willing to put in the effort moving forward. It takes a lot to change habits that have formed and it will take a lot of teamwork and time. Moving on to relationship dynamics: it seems like you really feel like you are putting in a lot more than he is in this relationship. Although he may also feel this way, the fact that at least one of you does indicates an imbalance. Normally, from this point, I suggest sitting down and communicating about it. However, in your case, I feel as if it may result in a fight. Thus, I encourage bringing it up with your couples counselor. Relationships should generally feel 50/50. Of course, there will be times that the other person needs support\u2014 and that\u2019s okay, but generally, it should be a give and take. As far as what he has been doing: snapping at you for interrupting his video games is unacceptable and immature. I wouldn\u2019t tolerate this. I also think part of being a good partner when we have bipolar disorder includes being accountable for our recovery and state. Medication can fucking suck. It can make us feel numb and sleepy, but that just means that particular med isn\u2019t a good fit and we need to try something else. It takes a LONG time to get the cocktail right, and it can really fucking suck getting there. Drug withdrawal is horrible, but a year later, we\u2019ve almost got it down. The thing is though, not only for myself, but I know that it\u2019s for my partner. I\u2019m not a good partner when I\u2019m unstable. I\u2019m volatile, irritable, and obsessive. Not everybody needs to take medication to be a good partner. In fact, some people do really well with coping mechanisms. However, these individuals realize that they need to live up to reasonable expectations of being a partner. Despite illness on both ends, both parties should have reasonable expectations met by their partner. I think that anybody can reasonably expect to be respected, feel cared for, etc. these are basic components to a relationship. It\u2019s up to you to decide how much you are willing to compromise those. It\u2019s just important to know that you deserve them. Illness isn\u2019t an excuse. Even if someone is bedridden, they can express their gratitude and love for their partner. It\u2019s important. If he only tries to improve when you are willing to leave, it\u2019s not indicative of something very healthy. In my experience, this also often leads to not much progress. This is because it\u2019s really difficult to seek improvement completely for the sake of someone else. The most strides are made in improvement when we want it for ourselves. It\u2019s a lot of fucking work: tracking moods, monitoring side effects, etc. some of these things can be brutal, and it only works if we want it ourselves. Lastly, fuck cancer. Beat that shit. I believe in you. That being said, the fact that it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s being sensitive at all to your cancer diagnosis is bullshit.

{"e1pk8td": {"text": "Girl (boy?), I GOT YOU. Okay, I don't think I've ever heard such an accurate way to describe ownership as your leaky boat analogy. It is awesome and I will totally be stealing that. Puppy blues acting up during 5.5 months is totally normal! After all, this is the ~~Voldemort~~ demon phase known as adolescence. This period is plagued by regression of training, \"forgetting\" their names, \"forgetting\" where their potty spot is, and so much other frustrating stuff. It's the age of challenging and it's annoying to say the least. During this time, we can only double down on training. Sometimes, we have to go back to basics. Your good puppy is in there, just give her a little bit to find her place in your family. She is a teen rebelling. The cross walk biting does sound like teenage nonsense. As stated before, gotta just reinforce. Now, the bad news is that this *might* be the beginning of SA. However, she is a puppy and the good news is: this is totally manageable and can be nipped in the bud. It seems like you've been spending almost all of your time with her, and I think she might benefit from some independence training. With Atlas, I was really proactive with preventing SA because his breed is known to be prone to it. The reason that Atlas loves his crate so much is because I made sure to make his crate a safe place/home base for him as a puppy. Along with getting his Kong exclusively in his crate, I also made sure that he understood crate =/= abandonment. This meant that he was sometimes crated while I was home. I started by sitting next to him during it, then got further and increased the time. This really really helped with his independence because it gave him a safe location where he felt at ease when I wasn't around. This is the reason I adore crate training so much, because he always has \"his place\" when he wants to be alone or if he needs a break. It's an incredible tool that goes far beyond containment. I highly recommend creating such a safe place for her so that she can feel at ease even when you aren't around. The process will, by no means, be short, but I think it's totally worth it. It will also be a lot easier because she is already crate trained!  That being said, even velcro breeds should be able to be left alone for 8 hours as adults. Of course, we don't want to leave them for any longer than we need to, but they should be able to hang out by herself for a workday. My dog is a notorious velcro breed, and I fully expect him to be able to be independent while I am out for work or school. It is not unreasonable at all. It sounds like you are really well equipped and have a plan moving forward. That is the most important thing imo! I think that is the first step in seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and you seem to have that down. Being afraid that you'll fail her is something that so so so many of us experience. You sound like you are doing incredibly and I encourage you to believe in yourself some more! I LOVE Treats + Chews from The Real Dog Box. They are just dehydrated meats and Atlas adores them. There's a lot of variety and they're really high value. I get 3 different types of treats a month too and they are really great for making sure he's always excited for training. They go in Kongs well. I also love the chews as they give us light, medium, and heavy chews. Because Atlas is a chomp chomp, he goes through them fast, but they're super enjoyable, and again, cycle monthly so he's not bored. I'd highly encourage you to look in to them!

{"e1kvr3v": {"text": "Whoa I have a lot of feelings to unpack, so I'm sorry if this is quite long. **ESAs and Misconceptions** There is a common misconception that emotional support animals have to be these cuddly soft unconditionally loving creatures. While this is a super great way that animals can provide support, it is not the only way. My dog (who acts as my support animal) functions a lot like your cat does. He honestly is a huge asshole and generally doesn't seem to give a shit. He provides me support my making me be better. He doesn't give a crap how I'm feeling. He needs to be fed and walked otherwise he will destroy my place. He cuddles exclusively when he feels like it and no other time. This is not often. However, he is an incredible support animal despite all of this. I strive to improve and be better for him. I do all that I do so that he can get the life he deserves. Since you already own your cat, I encourage you to assess what kind of support you are looking for. She may already be able to provide it. Secondly, since you are looking to rescue, you play a different ballgame than those who go the breeder route. Make no mistake. I think rescuing is an incredible thing and can be wonderful and rewarding. However, for me, I elect not to rescue because I rely on my dog to ground me. I need him to have a predictable temperament and I want to control as much growth as I possibly can. This way, I can mold him in to the dog I need him to be. If you rescue a pup, the temperament will not be as predictable and if you rescue an adult dog, their personality will likely already be there (along with pre-existing issues). This is not to say rescue dogs are bad. By no means are they bad. This is simply something to consider when getting a psychiatric support animal. I don't have my shit together. I cannot handle taking care of a dog that does not have his/her shit together. I acknowledge this, and thus, I chose the path I did. **ESAs and \"Messing Someone Up\"** I have a dog that is one of the go-to dogs when thinking of \"messing someone up\". He's a brown and black German Shepherd (albeit he's smaller than most) and can look very intimidating. However, I worked actively to train him to at least tolerate all humans and dogs of all sizes. We have some issues due to his inherent wariness, but, by no means, do I want him to mess anyone up. It is actually kind of a fantasy to think of those hero dogs that fight off intruders. Don't get me wrong, they totally exist and are super awesome. However, most dogs cannot be expected to do that without some training. Atlas would bark at them, but ultimately run away because my dog is a princess. The good news it that, usually, barks are enough to deter shady people as the noise alerts the passerby. I would also highly discourage training an ESA to attack under any circumstance. While it is very possible to train an incredible attack dog with an off switch to boot, it is very very difficult and requires hours upon hours of dedicated training. An attack dog is inherently targeted and trained aggression with a fail-safe off-switch. Overall, I feel that it is much safer for them to not have that training. **College, Mental Illness, and Dog Ownership** I got my ESA in my second year of university. Atlas is everything to me. I wrote a long ode to him [here](https://www.reddit.com/ However, it was not fucking easy. No one ever talks about the hard part of owning a puppy. Because I chose a puppy to mold him, god fucking dammit I had to mold him. That is fucking hard when you're in college. Unlike having a stable job, I couldn't just take a month off to get it all together. Instead, I was coming home between classes. I was honestly waking up in the middle of the night sobbing worried that I would fail him as an owner. Not to mention the mission that's housebreaking and basic teething training. Puppy blues are a real thing and, as someone that is also prone to depression, it quickly becomes actual puppy depression. It's really fucking hard and it's usually bad before it's good. I cannot stress how fucking bad it was. If you elect to go with an adult dog, you do get to skip the horrible puppy stage. He was adorable as a puppy, but fuck puppy stage. Going with an adult dog comes with it's own issues. He/she will come with their own sets of opinions and behaviors. Some of these behaviors will be not great and you will have to retrain them. After all, they're already grown and have personalities of their own! This can get incredibly frustrating. In example, if they've been resource guarding their entire life, training it out is not an easy task. This is all stuff that you'd have to manage while attending classes and trying to get your grades up. While you can hire a dog walker, if the pup/dog isn't well behaved the rest of the time, it's still really hard to get peace and quiet to study for finals. It doesn't matter that you got home at 1AM because your study session ran long and it was a difficult concept. Your dog needs to be walked. It can get really really tough. Also, it's fucking expensive. No joke. Atlas managed to rake up $4000 in vet bills in the FIRST YEAR. He is lucky I love him. I'm looking for employment right now, and I have to consider two mouths to feed, which is something that adds pressure as well. That's not even counting his food, toys, crate, and general other crap. Again, he's lucky I love him. **Expectations** I think that you might have too high of expectations. To snuggle with you all the time and to be able to handle being alone are often contradictory traits. We can't force our dogs to snuggle with us. Sometimes, they just don't like it. While we can train them to tolerate it, it's not something I like to do. I would rather he be comfortable doing what he wants. Thus, often times, dogs that want to snuggle all the time are very much velcro dogs. Also, medium dogs don't generally fit in laps too well. They are a tad too big. Although, my 75 pound dog seems to think he's a lap dog, so who am I do judge? **Going on Trips** When we get dogs, we often give up a piece of spontaneity and traveling. I don't travel often because my dog is happiest with me. While he is happy to be boarded (he likes other dogs) or to be watched by others, I am his human and he would prefer to just co-exist with me than anything else. I wouldn't have gotten him if I had the intention of having him love me and then leaving for long periods of time. I firmly believe my dog deserves to be with his human.

Sometimes, we stumble or fall, but we must always keep fighting to get up again. It seems like your partner is actively trying to get help through his therapist and that is honestly amazing. Although I personally have not seen success with therapy, I know lots of individuals who have. The thing about therapy though is that it\u2019s supposed to be paving a path for your partner to recovery and to stability in order to function. Is this what is happening? Is he being as active as he possibly can? Is he actually trying to get better, or is he just saying he\u2019s trying? In terms of the job issue, I think you handled it incredibly. I don\u2019t think I would have been able to hold in an explosion and I commend you. Honestly, there is a possibility that going back to work just isn\u2019t healthy for him right now.

Two years of relying on your income without too much action on his part raises red flags. Although it is really beneficial to be able to see a therapist whenever, often times, things such as jobs offer us structure and stability in our lives. Depending on his state, it would be really great to see him try to contribute the best he can, possibly by getting a weekend job as simple as bagging groceries. It\u2019s the thought that counts.

{"e1furr1": {"text": "I'm super glad you've found someone you want to pursue a relationship is! That's super awesome and I'm happy for you. Being in love is difficult and complicated. We go out in to the world pretending we know what love is, but in reality, we all have no idea. As human individuals, it is up to us to go out and define what it means for ourselves. We are so used to this fairytale definition being crammed down our throats that that's what automatically comes to mind, but in reality, we can't really have an idea of a feeling. It's just a feeling. Imagine having an idea of sadness but not really feeling it. It's not quite... right. And in this case, you wouldn't quite know what sadness feels like or is. It's the same for love. Thus, for you, love might be that feeling of an upswing and being just head over heels. I don't know how long you've been seeing this person, but it sounds like this might be the early honeymoon-like infatuation phase. This is often complicated by our bipolar disorder because we just feel things strongly. Love definitely isn't a stagnant thing. It's constantly growing and changing, and the goal is always to love the person as much if not more than you did the day before. Hopefully, over time, you and your partner become closer and fall deeper in love. Often times, this comes with feelings of trust, compassion, honesty, understanding, and more. This leads to our romantic partners having the potential of being incredible support systems.  During my downswings, I have a really hard time feeling anything. I mostly feel empty and just generally bad. However, during this time, even if I don't necessarily \"feel\" the love, I do know it is there. I treat this statement like it is fact. I love my dog, and I love my partner. No matter what the state I'm in, these are my truths, and I act accordingly. I think that I see my partners flaws all the time. After all, they're a part of him. I've just learned not to mind them. However. they totally come out more when I'm feeling bad and just looking for reasons to self-destruct. Over time, I've learned how to have an internal conversation with myself and talk myself out of that type of negative thinking of him not being good for me and such. Over the almost 8 years I've known him, I can safely say that I value him as a person and as a partner so fucking much. This grows with time as I can easily look back on history and sort of \"convince\" myself when I'm down. I shouldn't need convincing, but mental illness shouldn't exist, but it does, and this is how i cope. The #1 thing in all relationships is to talk about it. Have a conversation about how your partner can make you feel more loved during a downswing. Talk about how they can respect your space and how to address the situation. The goal is for you to feel secure and know that you love and are loved. The only way to do that is to have an open and honest conversation. ", "link_id": "t3_8ugmjw", "time": 1530196236}}
{"e1flta4": {"text": "God, I get so upset when people shame others for going the breeder route. Yes, adopting and rescuing is a wonderful thing. In fact, I think it's one of the most altruistic things a person can do. However, there is *nothing* wrong with going the breeder route. People who shove \"Adopt don't Shop\" down other people's throats are extremely ignorant and very rude. People do not get shamed for not adopting children because there are children in need. It is unarguable that there are many many children in need of homes even just in first world countries. Yet, nobody says anything when a couple elects to have a bio-kid. I don't think it's that different. Obviously, we don't get the chance of feeling like we pushed the puppy out ourselves, but there is something about the obtaining a puppy and going through the entire getting to know a breeder, getting to know the parents, picking your puppy, etc. process that is very intimate and wonderful process. You should not feel bad for wanting to go through it. In fact, if everybody did their research and went through ethical breeders who require forms to be filled out, health testing, and just all the other things ethical breeders do, I imagine there would be fewer dogs in need. However, there would also be a lot fewer dog owners (in my opinion) which is both a good and a bad thing. Unfortunately, unethical breeding is the norm and unethical breeders are the norm in turn. This means people that would not normally be having dogs (if they went through an ethical breeder) have these dogs and there is a higher chance of it not working out. Furthermore, most of these \"breeders\" will not take the dog back if it doesn't work out unlike ethical breeders. In a perfect world, we would only have wonderful ethical breeders that only sold puppies to people they thought would make good homes, thus rendering shelters and dogs without homes fewer (hopefully!). It's like a problem that feeds itself with people who say \"Adopt Don't Shop!!!\" aggressively. In turn, the nature of all of this frustrates me to no end. You're not crazy. People are going to give you a hard time, and that sucks, but that doesn't matter. What matters is you are getting your fluffball and you are going to be so happy (and stressed and covered in pee and not sleeping, but hey who cares, puppy!!).

I cannot imagine how difficult it is for darker skinned gals to find their shade as I am medium toned and olive leaning and already have a difficult time. She was recently invited to the Too Faced launch of an extended shade range for the Born this Way foundation, and although there has been so much controversy surrounding her, I cannot help but be happy for darker skinned gals as this is a win in my book. A brand has openly gone back and added shades, which means they are admitting they were not inclusive enough before. I think that's really awesome. I think that Jackie did make a big mistake here. It is unfortunate that she is unarguably the hugest creator in the industry fighting for this inclusivity and as candid and open as she is is also so impressive. While her actions should not speak for the entire community, it is an unfortunate side effect of being a leader and being the loudest voice. This is why famous people have PR teams. People will turn against you and your cause will be affected, and that sucks. Separately, I really wish there were a more \"mainstream\" Asian beauty youtubers. I know that we have lots of lifestyle ones that dabble in beauty (Sophia Chang, Jen Im, Weylie, etc.) but we don't have too many beauty youtubers. I'd love to see looks on people with different types of eye shapes as well. I'm so very happy to see Bretman Rock coming in to popularity because I think he's super talented, hilarious, and awesome. I also love Nikita Dragun (I know she's controversial, but I like her). However, both of them are \"darker skinned\" Asians. There is nothing wrong with this and all shades are awesome, but I'd love to see lighter skinned Asians dabble as well. I think we'd be lucky to have our Jackie Aina that talks about issues like wanting lashes to be made smaller. I think the mini line from House of Lashes is incredible and I feel so fortunate that they are a thing. A lot of large dramatic lashes just look... clown-ish on my eyes. I know that I can trim the band, but if I trim the length, they end up looking like nubs and I don't get the gorgeous dramatic effect. I would also love to see more olive skin types. I feel like companies often forget that we exist. While our plight is mUCH smaller than our darker skinned sisters in my opinion, I feel like we would be lucky to have someone talking about our issues as well. I think that Jackie should have realized what she does and how she acts affects what she stands for. Her cause shouldn't be defined by her actions, but people will take it how they will. Because she took a hit, her cause will likely take a hit as well, and that sucks. ", "link_id": "t3_8ufz5r", "time": 1530179508}}

In fact, I believe that my bipolar disorder has allowed me to love more deeply than most people are able to. However, I will never ever waver on the fact that people should lower their reasonable expectations in a relationship because of illnesses. It is reasonable to expect to be respected. It is reasonable to expect to be loved. It is reasonable to expect not to be woken in the middle of the night. You deserve to be treated like the wonderful partner you are. The fact that you've stuck beside him despite this crap shows how wonderful of a heart you have. However, you don't deserve this. Part of being a good partner with bipolar disorder is being active in our recovery. I know I'm a fucking nightmare when I'm cycling. I know that I cannot be the partner I want to be. I know that I'm snappy and short and irritable, and I do not want to be that for my partner. I know that I am not the best version of myself, and I want to be that for him. He knows that this is hurting you, but he keeps doing it. He doesn't care enough to stop, and that is a fucking dick move.

I think he's probably lost like a lot of us are. I think the saddest part of mental illness is that a lot of us don't know how to get better until we hit rock bottom. We beat up and take advantage of those that care for us until we eat their hearts. Much of the time, it takes them leaving for us to realize what we've done and that we need help. I hate that it takes to this point, but it's been true for both me and my father. You love him. I know you do, but I want you to love yourself too. If you need to think about it this way, if you do love him, the more you stay, the more you are enabling him to take advantage of you. You love him so much that you're preventing him from hitting rock bottom (the same way my mom did for me). Sometimes, unfortunately, we have to hit rock bottom.

I think that a lot of partners allow that feeling of wanting to help overwhelm them and end up suffocating us when we really just need to be alone. That being said, you *can* love from a distance. A lot of times, that act that you respect her and love her enough to keep that distance means the world. In example, my long distance partner came to visit me one weekend and I happened to fall in to a very irritable episode the second day he was over. I was snappy and it wasn't a good time. I ended up blowing my top and telling him that I needed space. He voluntarily slept on the couch without a peep. There's such a bad connotation with \"sleeping on the couch\", but it wasn't bad at all. Honestly, I needed space to recover and the fact that he did that for me was so moving to me and made me feel so fucking loved. The next day, I was feeling so much better and we were snuggling once again. You can do things like sending flowers or one of those meal delivery services with her favorite food.

It's really nice that you're being proactive in your meds and really monitoring your moods. That's really important I think. My partner knows immediately when I'm sensing something is off, so we are prepared. The communication is so important. My partner and I have been close friends for 8 years this September. We've been dating for a year or longer depending on how you count it, so we have been communicating for such a long time. Ironically, he has Aspergers which means he should be terrible at reading emotions, but we're both blunt and direct with how we're feeling and it's really done wonders for our relationship.

Sometimes, certain breeds are more inclined to separation anxiety due to their genetics. In example, I own a Shepherd and like many herding breeds, they are very in sync with their human shepherds as they were bred for hundreds of years to do so. Separation anxiety is a huge problem within the breed because the pups become so attached to us that they don't know how to function without us. It's okay if your dog doesn't like other people or other dogs that much. My dog isn't a huge fan of most other dogs to this day, but it IS important that he, at least, tolerates them. Growling is generally a dog's communication of \"I don't like this\". I suggest you train him to *at least* tolerate it. I actively trained independence with Atlas as well. Because he was a timid pup that was velcro'd to me, I did things like kept him crated while I wasn't in the room (building up to it of course) and such.

{"e0s5nqq": {"text": "Hi there! Your pup is similar to the pup I picked out of my litter. The litter was a German Shepherd litter, so I expected energetic wall-bouncing pups. The one female pup was already spoken for, so that left four males. The first two had that bouncing-off-all-the-walls, playing, mouthing expected persona. They were adorable, but I almost instantly overwhelmed by them. The other two puppies were a lot shyer. The third puppy was the one I chose. He barely stepped in to the house when he was let in, and he sat in a corner, very wary. He had that German Shepherd wariness, even as a puppy. In some ways, it was concerning because, if gone untreated, this could turn in to fear based reactivity or aggression. The last pup was the runt. He helped me choose Atlas because this runt, when came inside, quickly came up to nuzzle Atlas. Atlas was his big brother and I saw care and nurturing. I knew the first two pups were not for me, so I got to know the last two better. Eventually, I had a moment that I connected with Atlas and he, after he finished assessing me and decided he trusted me, rested and nuzzled his head in my hand. I knew he was my puppy in that moment. Although Atlas was a ton more shy than the dog you are describing, I think they're a lot alike. They are both stand-offish and march to the beats of their own drums. I do predict that the puppy you have chosen will be intense and challenging in some ways. On top of the breed being known for being smart, you're likely in for a ride. It'll be fantastic, but I think it can be frustrating at times. I had to modify my training style when Atlas was younger heavily to fit him. Atlas lacked a LOT of self confidence. I had to double the amount of praise I'd give another puppy and reward him heavily. I was VERY careful not to raise my voice during puppyhood at all, which made things very difficult. Confidence building was a long and hard process. Your puppy may actually have the same issue (no one knows but him), and might be, instead, freezing when he is afraid. However, if he simply is just calmer and more confident, I would also be proactive. It may mean that he is stubborn and can develop independence quickly. While we love independence in a dog, too much of anything is not good. Too much independence can lead to disobedience and things like resource guarding. Not any of this has to happen at all. Atlas isn't fear reactive or fear aggressive at all despite being a timid, shy dog. This is because I worked really hard when I realized that I needed to build his confidence.

{"e0pmvtz": {"text": "This sounds so difficult for the two of you and I'm so sorry. Also, I'm glad you made it through benzo withdrawal and all those other things. It sounds really difficult. That process is no fucking joke and you are a warrior. So, here's the thing, I think that we are trained in society to think things like \"moving out for a while\" or \"sleeping on the couch\" are horrible awful things. The thing is, they don't have to be. Doing these things are what you make of them. The reason they are perceived as bad is because the couples do not work on the relationship. For example, my long distance partner came to visit me for the weekend. He made a drive out and I really appreciated it. However, I entered a really irritable spell and I basically felt like he was suffocating me with his love (even though this is not normally true). He volunteered to sleep on the couch that night to give me some space. After I had that recharge space, he was back in bed the very next evening. It had a lot to do with just the fact that he would do that for me. One of the things I would really like to touch on is that what he's asking is not unreasonable per se, but needs to be discussed a TON more before the two of you make any sort of decisions. So, I have a blog on dating with bipolar and I'm going to be linking a few things throughout my reply to you to help you out. **The things I think you need to discuss** I'm not certain how long you and your partner have been together, but you have stated that the disorder is pretty new for you two, at 4 months, there's still a lot to learn. One of the hugest concerns I would have right now is how sustainable he thinks the relationship is. I am sure that you love him a great deal, and I'm really sorry that I'm writing this out, but I have never seen the point in cherry picking. Bipolar is chronic. We do get a ton easier to manage when we are on the right meds and have good coping mechanisms, but bipolar disorder is chronic. Can he do this ins 5...10...20? years? Can you do this with him for that long? Again, it won't always be this bad. You're just getting started and learning from scratch, but it will always be there to a degree. It's important to discuss the finality of the condition, because if our loved ones only tolerate the condition, many of them end up resenting us. Here is my post titled [\"To Our Significant Others that \"Tolerate\" Us.\" ](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/2018/05/30/to-our-significant-others-that-tolerate-us/)I would also discuss why exactly he thinks *you* should be the one to move out of the home for the week. While I am not an advocate of the blame game, I think that a much healthier way to go about this would have been for him to suggest a separation and then for the two of you to discuss what method of doing that should be if, as partners, you chose to pursue that route. It strikes me as kind of strange that he would immediately go to you leaving. Between that and his language, it almost feels like he's placing the blame on you for all of this, and that's not super great. I think that your partner is completely correct in that he does need to take care of himself as well. An important part of any relationship is taking care of one another. However, sometimes, for those of us who face mental health challenges, we need more support from our partners than other times. Here is my article on[ Caregiver Burnout and Resentment. ](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/2018/05/24/caregiver-burnout-resentment/)I do not think that he is handling it in the best way though. Through your post, it does feel like there's already a bit of resentment built up. **Now a personal anecdote**I've had a span of time that was like the one you're describing about one year ago around this time. It felt like I had no control over my life and I was spinning out of control while life just kept tossing more obstacles at me. I thought it would never end. I am so fucking grateful for my partner during that time. I would constantly apologize for how much of a burden I felt I was being, but he would never fucking hear a word of it. He knew I needed him, and we don't keep score in our relationship. Even if it was something like housing me for a month when I had nowhere else to go, feeding me, or quite actually being an information conduit with my family, he would always shrug and say \"oh no it's no big deal\". He never let it phase him for even a second and he was the world's best support system. You are struggling right now, and need support, not to be cast out. I understand that he is having anger issues right now, probably stemming from resentment, and I do not think that they are great, but I do think he's reacting poorly. I would understand him wanting space and saying \"babe I want space, I am gonna sleep on the couch\". The way he asked you to leave is really insensitive and putting a lot of the responsibility on you while he know you are in a delicate state. He's using his own issues to justify a dick move. I think that separation can be perfectly healthy and beneficial, but it is something that needs to be thoroughly discussed and agreed upon by both parties.

As far as Kala and Wolfgang go, I honestly think that after the first sex orgy, they're all a little bit more... open to sexual experiences? It is heavily implied that instead of all having sex next to one another, they are also simultaneously experiencing the pleasure of having sex together. I would think that connection opens up a couple of new possibilities! As far as Rajan goes, I was pleasantly surprised! I wish that he would have battled with it in his brain a little bit more before really coming to the conclusion that he was cool with it, but I liked how well he took it.

{"e0plh3g": {"text": "Firstly, this is not normal puppy blues. Normal puppy blues is usually categorized by feeling overwhelmed and worried about failing the puppy. It can be more closely related to depression and sadness. What you are feeling is extreme anger. Frustration is normal. I see no issue with being frustrated at puppies, because, let's face it, puppies are fucking annoying. When mine was little, I loved him to hell, but god he was fucking annoying. However, the level of anger coming across in your post is really really concerning to me. Puppies take a lot longer than a week to bond to their humans. To be real, it took me probably a few months to bond to Atlas. We're inseparable now, but it was hard to love something that was making my ankles bleed and crying so much I couldn't sleep while not giving a shit about me, ya know? We got there. I honestly think that the biggest issue here, is that the entire post comes across as you placing blame on the dog. Although you got this puppy at 5 months, I am firmly of the notion that every time my puppy \"fails\", I should take responsibility and assess how I should have set him up for success better to improve next time. I never blame the puppy because he does not know any better. He's a blank slate and it's my job to mold him. He's learning from me and the examples I set for him, so I have to be positive and vigilant. The resentment you feel towards this puppy is concerning as well, because this much resentment will likely lead to a huge amount of difficulty applying yourself to train and love the puppy. Regarding mental health: I love Atlas now and he is probably the biggest aid to my many mental health challenges, but raising him from puppyhood was the most difficult anxiety-inducing thing I had ever done in my god damned life. I found myself sobbing in the middle of the night and having breakdowns. It was a nightmare. I powered through and it was good for me, but it can be a huge stressor and trigger for others. There is absolutely no shame in rehoming the dog if you choose to do so. I do not think hatred is, by any means, normal. I think that frustration and maybe overwhelming, but not hatred. I also think that if you do choose to rehome, it'll be for the betterment of all parties involved. Don't keep this puppy just because he makes your boyfriend happy.

Kanye West is also an artist on this album instead of just producing it like he\u2019s doing with the others because depression is the other half of bipolar disorder.

In Cudi\u2019s verse, he calls himself a boy and says that \u201cshe is all up on me\u201d about the temptations of his \u201cher\u201d. There\u2019s also the ton of spooky ghost noises in this song. Terms visited: you/he form, children/kids *Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)* This song is super positive and starts with saying if a man masters himself, he can master his environment. Cudi went to the hospital in the last song because he got \u201clocked up\u201d and has been put on medicine. He doesn\u2019t feel sad anymore, and thus saying he doesn\u2019t feel pain and feels free. It is called Ghost Town 2 in relation to Kanye West\u2019s Ghost Town 1 because of its discussion of medication. Mania and Depression are opposites with mania being extreme high and depression being extreme low. In Ghost Town, West laments that he feels \u201ckinda free\u201d because he does miss that high feeling a little bit, but in Ghost Town 2, Cudi and Kanye feel free because they do not need to feel the low anymore. They\u2019re both about the numbness of medication, but with different perspectives. Terms Visited: ghosts/demons/devils *Reborn* This song is about Cudi telling himself that he needs to continue moving forward with his recovery despite how difficult it can be. Kanye\u2019s verse discusses ways that he is choosing to take care of himself instead of going out. Cudi even says \u201cpeace is something that starts with me\u201d to really hammer in that he\u2019s coming to terms with how to recover. However, he does say that sometimes, he does \u201cfeel worthless\u201d and alludes to the ghosts in them \u201chauntin\u2019\u201d him. However, despite that, especially in the bridge and the last chorus, Cudi reminds himself that he must keep moving forward despite the difficulties. Terms Visited: ghosts/demons/devils *Kids See Ghosts* This one is about even though the artists have recovered, they do still see their ghosts/pasts and are tempted by them. These verses are about what their king version of themselves say. This isn\u2019t from their stable perspective, it is from the perspective of their ghosts/kings tempting them. It can be seen in the chorus ending with \u201cSpirit, yeah, that\u2019s the king\u201d. Cudi\u2019s verse is him being tempted in to death (heaven, angels) while Kanye\u2019s verse is about him being tempted back in to his manic ways. It ends with \u201cwhat\u2019s a crown to the clouds, movin\u2019 around\u201d indicating that the kings are nothing compared to their faith and God. Terms Visited: ghosts/demons/devils, children/ghosts *Cudi Montage* Cudi continues to really struggle with his ghosts/demons as can be seen in the beginning of his first verse. However, by the end of the verse, he says \u201cpain in my eyes, in this time I find, I\u2019m stronger than I ever was\u201d ready to overcome. The chorus echoes \u201cstay strong\u201d encouraging him to beat his demons off. There is a very meta verse about suicide and becoming aware of the consequences. The song closes in very uplifting \u201cstay strong\u201d language. ", "link_id": "t3_8r32w9", "time": 1529052212}}

He definitely got tired a lot quicker during that time. Personally, I wait until shots are done, but I know that's a point of contention so I'll leave that be. I think you CAN take them out, but you have to be really vigilant in monitoring them. I would frequently feel my dog to see how he was doing temperature wise and kept a water bottle handy.

{"e0nfd0u": {"text": "I have advice!!! This is one of the things that I am most passionate about in the world. I think that it is so devastatingly horrible that so many of us believe that we don't deserve love because of our mental health challenges. Please remember that one in four people suffer from mental health challenges, half of all marriages end in divorce, and think about how many left aren't happy. Love isn't impossible because of our mental health. It is just difficult because love is difficult. Love is not this romanticized easy effortless thing that we all are trained to think it is. It is hard work! All relationships are hard work, because you are sharing so much with another person. This is why, as of late, I've been using the term \"partner\" to describe my loved one, because the word \"partner\" implies that we are partners working together.  I think that a really important step in all of this is to remember that you deserve love. You are not your outbursts and you are not your episodes. While those are a part of you, the good and the bad, there is a person to love in there. This is going to sound corny as all fuck, but the most important thing in any relationship is communication. My partner and I communicate about everything and we are VERY open with both our conditions. Because he has Aspergers, I've learned to be very literal, direct, and straight forward. It's important. We don't play games and we don't beat around the bush. After every single episode, we talk about how it was handled, what we liked, and what we can do better next time. We discuss our feelings during certain times and why we think we felt that way. Earlier on in our relationship, we both tried to best to put in to words how our challenges felt, and we are both continuously striving to learn about how to better understand one another. Thus, when we come across pieces of writing or shows that depict how we feel well, we will send them to one another and discuss. We have talked about the hospital when I'm stable, and he has zero fear of me resenting him if I need to be forcibly committed. I know it's for my own good and I trust him more than anything to make that call. The answer really is to talk about everything and be empathetic to one another's feelings. In regards to bipolar rage (what I call Hulk moments), I've devised a protocol. My partner and I discuss protocols a lot so that we almost always have a guideline so no one is flying blind. Usually, bipolar rage comes FAST, but I have worked really hard to be able to capture warning signs and notice them. Then, I will say something like, \"Babe, I love you so fucking much, but I cannot stand you right now. I know we are talking about something that wouldn't normally upset me, and I know that this is probably the bipolar, but can we pLEASE talk about this when I've calmed down?\" An alternative is simply using a safe\\-word like some couples use in sex, but for feelings. This works because my partner and I have an understanding that I am not bailing on the problem nor running away. I am just making the smartest decision for us as a couple because I do not want to fight. It has dramatically decreased things like that. He is also incredibly understanding when I feel irritable and need space. There's this huge horrible connotation behind \"sleeping on the couch\". The thing is, we are long distance right now and he was visiting for the weekend. On the second night, I entered a manic irritable episode and I snapped at him when I should have just talked about it. He volunteered to sleep on the couch that night with no resentment whatsoever because I needed my space. It requires a lot of love and understanding of one another's conditions for us to be able to do things like this, and years of practice. In terms of the rest of your life... I mean yeah. That is one of the things I made very frank to my partner when we started dating. My disorder is chronic. It is not a matter of \"if\" I have another episode, it is a \"when\". I am able to contain them much better now thanks to my medication, but I think that a huge part of being a responsible significant other with bipolar disorder is trying my very fucking best to be as stable as possible. This means being med compliant and practicing healthy coping mechanisms while monitoring my moods carefully. It's a lot of work, but I know that he deserves to be loved as best as I can love him, which means in a healthy way. [I have a blog on love with bipolar disorder.](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/) I haven't posted in a bit because I'm finishing up a few things at school, but it's techniques and outlooks we practice (like the one listed above. I call it the safe\\-word). Please don't isolate yourself. Your husband loves you very much I'm sure, and seeing you isolate yourself is hurtful to you both. Instead, I always advocate working as a team to further your relationship. Best of luck! ", "link_id": "t3_8qtlsn", "time": 1528966071}}

It just turned out my crippling anxiety and attention disorder made it pretty hard to learn. I also never thought of myself as very pretty. These days, I'm a lot more comfortable in my own skin, and that's awesome. Because of these issues, I've learned to focus a lot on loving myself and I think that helps out a lot. For starters, I like to do girly \"shallow shit\". I hate that phrase because it's honestly kind of offensive to people that simply like certain hobbies. Yes, I like painting my nails and doing my makeup, but that doesn't inherently make me shallow. It makes me feel pretty, and that's something that is great for me. I rarely ever wear makeup, because I honestly value sleep a great deal. I sleep like 10 hours a day when I'm stable, so that doesn't leave too much time. However, when I'm depressed, I do break out my kit. The process is therapeutic for me. I guess it's something about the routine and blending that soothes me. I also feel really pretty at the end, which is nice. It also makes me feel artistic and creative. As a bonus, if I ever feel like breaking down during the day, I tell myself \"Sophie you're wearing way to much fucking money on your face to cry right now. Cry later.\" I usually don't end up crying later. This works with outfits too! I have a few blouses that I don't wear too often because they are more high maintenance blouses. There is one with like 4 ribbons on it that I have to wear pasties for and it's honestly the most ridiculous blouse. However, it makes me feel pretty and it makes me feel good about myself. I wear that on days that I need the pick\\-me\\-up. Because I don't wear it often at all, it makes it feel extra special. Is there something that you love that you don't normally indulge yourself in? I really love beverages. That seems kind of silly to say, but I do! It's sort of my vice I guess. When I'm feeling bad, you can find me buying smoothies or boba. This one is kind of odd as well. I really like eating fruit. I think something about the freshness and the sweetness of fruit makes me feel nice. I have a friend that specifically likes to eat grapes, so I've been doing grapes lately in honor of him. They're sweet and they make me feel sweet. I also let my (long distance) partner know that I'm feeling kind of bad, and ask him if I can just call the next few days during times that I just need someone to talk to.

{"e0megib": {"text": "Yes. There\u2019s this poster at my vets office detailing what can happen if a dog is effectively thrown in a crash. That\u2019s just something I\u2019m not willing to risk. He is also rather large and obstructs my view in checking blinds. I have the SleepyPod harness. I really like it even though it\u2019s a bit annoying to get on. I think it\u2019s sleek and effective. I see a lot of people complain about it saying their dog doesn\u2019t like it. The thing is, a dog needs to be trained to accept being restrained. Putting that sort of back restraint on the dog is much different than any feeling they\u2019ve likely had before. I believe this is the only crash tested harness on the market, and I value that a lot. It is also marketed as a walking harness but I really don\u2019t like it for that purpose personally. They also have sleepypod carrier things for smaller dogs and cats. They are pricy, but I know a dog who\u2019s life has been saved by his sleepypod and that\u2019s something I value a lot. It\u2019s an easy seatbelt through the back loops and viola! Another option I\u2019m looking at is the Ruffwear Load Up. The Sleepypod has straps that kind of slide that I have to adjust from time to time, and I\u2019m interested to see what the Ruffwear one offers in so far as daily use. While it looks less pretty than the Sleepypod, I feel like it would be easier to get on him. Like any car harness that really would tie a dog back like our seatbelts tie us back in a crash, there needs to be training to get accustomed. I believe this one is crash tested as well, but you should check my work. Because of the crash test reason, these are the only two harnesses I would consider. My dog really is my little one, and just like I would not put my baby in a non-crash tested car seat, I am not putting my dog in a non crash tested harness. If my dog was smaller, I would likely use a Sleepypod carry thing or a travel crate. If I had the space of a bigger vehicle, I\u2019d probably opt for a crash tested crate instead of a travel harness so he would have more room. I don\u2019t personally like car seatbelt thinks that click in to the car buckle on one end and a harness or collar on the other for a few reasons. 1. If the dog yanks hard enough, the belt will come out. And 2. Its a choking hazard if the dog is thrown and it is attached to a collar. 3. If attached to a car harness, the catch points of the dog being thrown forward will all come down on where that harness attaches to the belt, and it can cause compression. Imagine having a belt like that attached to your back and being thrown. It scares me so I stay away from those. ", "link_id": "t3_8quacl", "time": 1528921663}}

Again, for me, keeping my hands occupied is important otherwise I'll habitual grab my phone and make myself sad. * I put on makeup in the morning. I don't usually wear makeup as I'm lazy and value sleep, so it's for special occasions. It makes me feel nice and pretty and it gives me one good thing to focus on that day. Even if the rest of the day is horrible, I looked good as hell.

I like to save some outfits that I really like for days like this and don't wear them the rest of the time.

I think that relationships are entirely about teamwork and thus they are both party's \"fault\" (I hate using the term fault because it implies that something is wrong and blame worthy) I can offer some insight as to why she is getting frustrated. A lot of times, with people that know our diagnosis, we get our feelings invalidated. For one, when we are stable, people still ask us if it's the disorder when we are just having very normal feelings. In the case that we are having the episode, and it IS the bipolar saying it, that doesn't change the validity of the feelings at the time. Even if the bipolar is making her be angry, she truly feels angry. Being asked if it's \"the bipolar that's saying this\" sort of minimizes those feelings. I'm not saying that you should give in or anything because sometimes, we truly are unreasonable. I'm simply offering what she may be thinking. I'm really conscious of my disorder. If I'm feeling manic or depressed or mixed, I almost always know. This is because I put a lot of energy in to monitoring and observing my behavior. It is an important part of every person with bipolar disorder's recovery. Yet, during episodes, I will still say \"Look babe, I KNOW it's the illness talking and making me feel this way, but I am so god damned frustrated right now and it's a really bad time to talk.

{"e0laqvd": {"text": "Hi friend. Only you can really know when it's not going to work. I think that all relationships are hard work. Partners must take the time to get to know one another and communicate in effective and healthy ways. It's important to talk about the disorder when she is stable and discuss how the two of you can better address the next episode. While everybody is bound to get fed up at one point, snapping and fighting are not healthy ways. A better way of diffusing the situation in the morning would to state your feelings, \"Honey, it is very early in the morning and I love you, but I don't think I can have this conversation right now without getting upset. I don't want to be upset. Can we please talk about it after I've gotten up?\" It's also important to establish that both parties can excuse the conversation without being blamed for running away, because as long as both partners agree to talk about it after they are more calm, it is simply being smarter about discussing the problem. It's also important for her to take an active role in her recovery and for her to try to recover as best and quickly as possible. This way, she will be able to limit episodes and the two of you will be happier. It's a part of being a good partner for us. It's time to call it quits when the two of you cannot work it out, do not want to work it out, or know that long term it won't work out. Because our partners love us, many are inclined to stay because they once said that they would always support us. However, if our partners are unhappy and would otherwise want out of the relationship, there is bound to be building resentment. If you already know this isn't sustainable long term and you know you wouldn't be able to continue this 5, 10, 20... years later, it might be worth re\\-evaluating. It's a tough thing to hear, but I made it very clear to my partner that I cannot control my condition and that it is chronic. I will try my best to limit my episodes and take care of myself, but it's not a matter of if I have another episode, it's a matter of when. He has decided to be with me anyways, but he has fully accepted that information and doesn't hold resentment because of it. It's huge.

The first step I would take is encouraging him to do research on dog groups as a whole. It seems like he's not... superbly informed if he wants to make even part of his decision on butt wiggles. Don't get me wrong. I do love my butt wiggles, but I would never make a decision on it.

Arguably (I really hate using the dominate word), German Shepherds have that equally large possibility to challenge him. You said you trained them before, so I'm sure that you know their intensity and intelligence comes with a personality. In a smaller phrase, they're a lot of dog. Also, they can be known to be drivey as well and squirrels can be a problem for them. (They are totally a fucking problem for Atlas. He hits the end of his lead, but I'm lucky that a strict \"let's go\" make him move on. He does give me that initial issue though.) You also said he's interested in Doxies, and I would absolutely not go that route because they are truly the sass\\-queens of the dog world. While dog training is something you largely do on your own, just like with parenting, everybody in the house is involved. Your husband must react in line with your reactions when your dog does interact with him, or it will confuse the dog. This is where a lot of that anxiety and fear can con from in both dogs and children. Therefore, the hope is that the two of you can be on the same page and as stable as possible. Your shared dog will want to interact with him and play with him, thus, you both need to work as partners in this. That being said, when I got Atlas, I made it clear to my partner at the time that I was in charge of the training regime and the rules. With my partner now, we have agreed that we will alternate getting \"our dogs'. Whoever the dog belongs to/their person is will do the primary training and dictate the rules. It makes things easier on everybody involved. However, we do discuss when he didn't necessarily agree on my tactics. I'm open to feedback, but I'm given the ultimate call because Atlas is my dog. When my partner gets his dog, I will yield to him. This works because we essentially have the same opinions on a lot of things, with only small details being different. That being said, it's very important that we are on the same page so no one builds resentment towards the dog. Lastly, if I'm being honest, upon re\\-reading your post, I think Corgis are not a bad choice. We all know that we will love our dogs no matter what breed they are, and I think Corgis could be a really great compromise. They have that signature herding breed personality of the one I listed above for the Shepherd. Because they are herding dogs and bred originally to be with their human shepherds, they are eager to please, intelligent, and want to learn that obedience and training while maintaining that attitude and personality. They are quite in tune with their handlers emotions as you want because of this as well. Additionally, they are small\\-medium sized, so that medium does fall between his small preference and your large preference. Again, I truly hope that I didn't offend you in this post. I only mean nice things and to help. To be honest, if it were me, I would own German Shepherds for the rest of my life because I think they're the best breed in the world, but the health issues may prevent me from doing this. My partner loves Bernese Mountain Dogs as he grew up with them. I met his dogs and they're wonderful and they've made me love the breed as well despite my very heavy bias towards herding breeds. He loves that happy attitude and the loving everyone nature of a Berner. I like the intelligence and drive behind German Shepherds and I actually love that asshole\\-sass despite all my complaining. In the future, we are probably going to end up with an Aussie (plus they have wiggly butts which we both love). I think that compromise is really important in all aspects of a relationship, and when adopting a life to live with us for the next 10\\+ years, I think it's really important to take both person's preferences in to account as well.

{"e0jxfkg": {"text": "Firstly, reputable breeders do take dogs back. Secondly, you are not going to get flamed. What you are experiencing is very normal. I will put it out there though: you have selected a rather challenging breed, but I have good news! My first puppy is also considered a challenging breed and he is turning two in a month and is alive, well, and a very good boy. Alright, here goes: although it might be a little more socially acceptable for me to be sitting down on my bedroom floor sobbing and defeated because I was a 20 year old girl at the time, I think the feeling of despair is super duper relatable. It's called puppy blues! I deal with several mental health challenges that [Atlas is an incredible support systems these days](https://www.reddit.com/ However, during puppyhood, he was very harmful and anxiety causing. My condition causes actual depression. So, just as puppy blues are compared to postpartum, I actually legitimately had post\\-puppy depression. It was so terrible. I cannot even describe how truly terrible it was. I was waking up in the middle of the night just sobbing: overwhelmed, overworked, and exhausted. More than anything, I was so fucking scared I was going to fuck it up. I was so fucking scared that my German Shepherd was going to grow up to be that stereotyped fearful aggressive Shepherd that people are afraid of. People are still afraid of him, but that's because they have stereotypes about him and do not get to know him and understand that he is truly a big baby. He is not a fear aggressive, dangerous neurotic Shepherd. He is my baby boy. [This is how I did it](https://www.reddit.com/ You feel like you've signed the next 15 years of your life away because, in a way, you have. However, it may be the best god damned decision you ever made. Entering a marriage and having a child also means signing a few years away. Yet, they are wonderful happy things. These next 15 years will be full of loving memories, cuddles, pets, fetch sessions, and feeling like you truly have a best friend beyond what you ever thought possible. Although I know that it's difficult considering his breed and health condition, I truly hope that I am lucky enough to have signed up for 15 years. It gets better. It's all about celebrating the little victories. The first time he pooped outside instead of having diarrhea inside, I nearly squealed out of joy. When he learned his name the first night, I was beyond proud of his intelligence. When he showed me comfort and compassion for the first time, I was sobbing on my bedroom floor and he leaned his head against me for only a second. It reminded me about everything I was doing this for and I found the resolve to carry on. In order for it to get better, you need to believe that it will get better. The best way to do that is to channel your anxiety and worries in to training and being the best owner you can be. You can do this. Being a little bit anxious and worried is not completely a bad thing. Owning a puppy is a big deal! You are responsible for a little life. You're going to mold and help her grow in to the dog she's going to be. Your nervousness means you are taking it seriously! Most parents are scared shitless when they have their kids. They just pretend to not be and try their best. It's the same thing. Channel those feelings in to striving and being better. Again, you can do this. Puppy ownership is a lot of hard work. You can get burnt out VERY quickly and I encourage all pup\\-parents to set aside time for yourself. A lot of us get so consumed with our puppies when we aren't working every day that we forget to take care of ourselves. We are of zero use to our pups if we are falling apart ourselves. Lastly, if ultimately you decide this isn't for you, **do not let anyone shame you for rehoming**. I do think you should stick it out for at least a bit more because it seems like you truly do care about her. However, there is zero shame in placing her somewhere else if you ultimately decide that it will be better for you both. ", "link_id": "t3_8qjh9j", "time": 1528824769}}

He could totally drag me around the block when he wants, but if he hits the end of his line and I say \"Atlas, come back please\", he does. It's more a matter of training and I think it would be good to communicate that to him. I don't think you need to justify wanting a large breed dog. Honestly, I just like big dogs. I like that there's a lot of dog to love. I like how they are huge and it feels like I'm hugging an entire person, and I just like big dogs. Also, I totally get you on the feeling safe thing.

It's just important for you to know that it's mostly psychological, and you seem to, so that's good.

When you say things like \u2018I\u2019m busy atm so it won\u2019t happen\u2019\u201d it makes me feel like you don\u2019t enjoy spending time with me or do not feel like you actually want to\u201d. I find that it\u2019s helpful to be blunt about your feelings in return. I\u2019m sure he does like spending time with you, but his mind is focused on whatever it is right now: My aspie partner thinks in categories and evidence. He has been gathering data on me for 8 years so to speak. So, after 8 years (on and off) of me communicating my feelings and reactions, he\u2019s built a database of how he thinks I will feel based on what he says. He also has an internal list of the things I do when I am upset. Through this method, despite being an aspie, he understands my feelings and reactions better than anyone I have ever known. So, communicating over time can really help. Even so, he still hurts my feelings sometimes on accident. I remind myself that he likely did not do this intentionally and tell him that. Most of the time he will say \u201coh no I didn\u2019t mean that: what I meant is that, I\u2019m really busy right now so we can\u2019t hang out, but I\u2019d like to later\u201d. Just the little bit of changing in the words helps recover my feelings a lot and he can put it in his database for next time. It seems like a computational way of going about feelings, but I\u2019ve never had an issue with it. He doesn\u2019t just tell me what I want to hear, but instead has a better grasp as to how to better phrase the thoughts he has to be sensitive to my feelings.

{"e0h9li5": {"text": "Hi Hon! I got you. I just wrote a [really long post](https://www.reddit.com/ yesterday about how Atlas helps my psychiatric issues, but I barely touched on the flip\\-side of how horrible he made them when he was a puppy. If you wanted to read through that, the level of help he is able to give me now is directly proportional to the amount of anxiety I felt while raising him. (It didn't help that I was unmedicated at the time, but that's unrelated.) Raising a puppy is a stressful situation for anyone. It honestly is. It is actually a good indicator to be a little worried and concerned about his wellbeing because it means that you are taking dog ownership seriously and trying actively to do what you can for your dog. I remember waking up in the middle of the night actually sobbing that I wasn't going to be enough for him and that I would fail him as an owner. I remember getting insanely afraid he was going to be reactive because of an event that happened when he was really young. I was terrified that I wasn't feeding him right. We have a life in our hands. That's what dog ownership actually is. When we get these dogs, we are agreeing to take care of them. It is important that we do a good job. When Atlas was roughly 4 1/2 months old, he was jumped by 2 boxers and a pit mix at the dog park. It was his first time there and he was only like 30 pounds at the time. The other dogs were at least double his size and there were three of them. They had him pinned to the ground on his back with all three dogs just looming over him, and it is the first and only time I ever saw him bear teeth. I was horrified. The image is still sharp in my mind and I had never felt more like a failure in my life. I went over there and pulled them off of him and he was fucking terrified. I was afraid he'd be afraid of other dogs forever because one of his very early experiences was this. I sat there with him in my arms for a while until the rest of those dogs left and I put him down. He hid under the table for 3 hours. I refused to leave until he had a positive experience. He didn't allow any dogs to approach for 3 hours until he found one that he was brave enough to meet. They hit it off. I didn't force him. I just waited. It got cold and I just waited and prayed that a dog he liked would show up and he would find it in himself to be brave. If he wasn't, I would try again. He had a safe space under the table to escape if he wanted to, but he also got the opportunity to explore if he wanted to. He barked on a lead for a while and displayed some reactive tendencies for a bit too. What's really helped a lot was exposure and allowing him to take things at his own pace. I was so scared of everything for so long, so I did what I could. I channelled all of that fear and anxiety in to becoming the best fucking dog parent I could be. I obsessively read forums and educated myself on how to build his confidence and train him right. All my time not spent with him or work was spent on those forums getting information. I told myself that I love him so fucking much and I was not going to fail him. I think that a lot of my fear and anxiety came from insecurity in my ability to raise him right. The more I worked, and the older he got, the more confident I got. He is a good boy because of all of the effort I put in. I obsessed too, so I decided to put that in to something useful for both him and I. As far as being afraid he's going to bite a kid goes... focus on bite inhibition right now. Teach him that it's not okay to bite people. The kid thing will come later. It's important to socialize with children of course, and I trust Atlas with pretty much anything. However, I am wary with children because I know that my dog is still a puppy even though he's 75 pounds and way too excited to meet people and jumps. We're training it out of him but I have to wait until he calms down a bit. When he was smaller, he was great with kids. I trust Atlas a great deal, and that trust also came from the training. It all ties together and leads back to your confidence in yourself. Lastly, remember to take mental health breaks. I put a ton of effort in to researching any time I wasn't training or in school, but I would get burnt out. I would get insanely tired and worn down. I realized that I needed to actively make time for myself otherwise I would overexert. I carved at least 30 minutes out of each day to just do me. He would go in his crate with a Kong and I would take a bath or just browse the internet. To be fair, I mostly continued to browse dog training things, but that was because it had become a hobby at the time. ", "link_id": "t3_8q8jkf", "time": 1528715692}}
{"e0h8urg": {"text": "You got a puppy tax? I think that different dogs have different personalities. Herding dogs tend to have a little bit of a more obnoxious play\\-style. They tend to have an idea of how things should go and get very unhappy when they don't go that way. Kinda goes back to those herding roots I guess. I have a German Shepherd who is like the poster\\-child of the fun police so it's something I recognize pretty well. They also have the reputation of being kind of \"sassy\" like the trainer said because of those tendencies. That being said, I allowed other dogs to correct Atlas when he was a puppy. If the Doberman really was being too rough with your puppy and he didn't like it, I don't really see anything wrong with your puppy communicating that to the Doberman pup. It actually facilitates both of them learning. He clearly didn't want to play with the doberman as he went to hide under chairs! My dog is also really selective about his playmates. Just like with some people, he is picky about his friend and who he wants to hang out with, and that's okay! I wish my dog would indulge some of the dogs that want to play with him a little bit, but he is an ass and kind of walks away from them instead. However, if they proceeded to bother him and continue to badger him when he has already tried to leave, he might nip them. This usually doesn't happen though because the other dogs understand the body language of him walking away. I think that a lot of people have the misconception that when they go to take their dogs to play with other dogs, that they'll play with just any pup. That might be true for some dogs and their personalities, but it certainly isn't true for mine. I find this trait to be more common in herding breeds. I wouldn't categorize what he was doing as aggression. He was trying to disengage, but the doberman wouldn't stop bothering him. It was his effort to tell him \"back off! I don't like this!\" I do have a pretty laissez faire type of dog raising style, but as long as there's not a dog fight, I don't typically separate. I like allowing Atlas to learn from being corrected and to learn to respect other dog's space. The only time I get a little nervous is when he is correcting other dogs. I know he's not going to hurt them, but I know that other owners might not be comfortable. I think that it teaches manners! It was the same thing with humping. When Atlas was a teenager and wanted to hump everything in sight and other dogs gave him a firm correcting, and other owners were embarrassed, I laughed and said \"don't worry about it. he needs to learn!\" and now he no longer humps because those other dogs taught him not to. Don't get me wrong, I will get in there if it's a dog fight. Luckily, Atlas hasn't ever gotten in to one because despite his sass, he is absolutely a runner not a fighter. I have totally gotten between other dogs trying to hurt him though. ", "link_id": "t3_8q3div", "time": 1528714306}}
{"e0h8f7p": {"text": "Kids See Ghosts is really similar to Ye in my opinion. (I have this HUGE conspiracy theory across all 5 of the albums he's producing). KSG follows the same format as Ye did (1. illness 2. descent 3. darkness 4. discovering recovery 5. battling with the difficulty of recovery 6. where they are now 7. their truth). In Cudi's case, he has been very open about his battle with chronic depression and suicidal tendencies: * Feel the love: At this point, he is beginning to get depressed but he can still feel love. * Fire: Although his family is trying to support him, he continues to fall in to darkness and wants to die (angels, fire). * 4th Dimension: Cudi doing materialistic things and flying off the handle to feel anything &amp; ends up in the hospital. * Freeee: Okay this one is him seeking recovery and feeling free (possibly from the medication from the hospital in the last song) * Reborn: He is reborn from the medication and feeling better, and realizing that he needs to keep moving forward no matter how much his depression tries to get him down, thus the repetition of \"keep moving forward\". * Kids See Ghosts: This is about still seeing his demons (depression) even though he's better. Just because we have our meds together doesn't mean the depression just stops. I'm sure you can relate  frequenter that episodes still happen. We still see those ghosts. * Cudi Montage: This is about him praying to God to save him, but that he is going to stay strong and continue to recover. Although I don't think I'll ever love anything as much as I love Ye due to how much I resonate with it because of bipolar disorder, I think that if Ye is about Kanye &amp; Mania, I think that Kids See Ghosts is about depression (something Cudi experiences, and Kanye does through bipolar). Viewing it like that, I see a lot more depth. I do prefer the lyricism and style of Ye, but I think that's a personal thing for me as well (sorry just can't get super in to that freeee thing.

The hardest thing to address will be whether she cheated on you because she really wanted to, or because she was feeling hyper\\-sexuality. Then, it will be important to discuss how she plans to prevent this from happening again in the future. I cannot express how crucial it is for her to take responsibility for her actions. Although she may have been in an episode, it is important for her to realize that she still did it. The fact of the matter is, she did this thing and it hurt you and that's what should be important. If either of you excuse any behavior \"because she was manic\" or \"because she was depressed\", it separates those identities from herself as a whole. The fact is, if we clean our rooms while manic, the room is still clean afterwards. We still reap the benefits of a clean room. While taking responsibility is important, If she takes responsibility for the action fully, it opens up the possibility for you to forgive her. When I say forgive her, I really mean forgive her.

It also sounds like you have a really good understanding of yourself, and that's awesome. I think that relationships are work. They're not easy like many of us have the impression they are. They need you to put time and energy in to them, especially when long distance. My relationship is currently long distance and I am not a fan of video\\-chatting, so we don't do that. We do text a great deal though, some days more than others. For the most part though, we sort of live our own lives and text on and off. Sometimes, we chat and sometimes, we talk on the phone when we are commuting in the car. Going from being physically together to long distance often causes two people to want to fill that space. Because my relationship has always been long distance with visits every few weeks, I do not have that expectation. We love each other a great deal, and when we are together, we do talk back and forth a lot and it's great! However, when we are apart, we mostly just live our own lives. It's never been been a \"spend hours\" type of thing. If you do decide to pursue a relationship with this person, I highly encourage the two of you to discuss the frame of your relationship. Does he expect to spend hours video\\-chatting? Or would he be okay with texts when you can? What about phone calls on commutes? It is really important to discuss what exactly is expected out of the relationship in terms of communication in long distance mode. If the two of you can come to a consensus on the parameters, I do not see why you two could not date in this way. That being said, the two of you also have to decide if this situation is something worth pursuing. Long distance relationships are sustainable, but eventually, (hopefully) you will close the distance. Is the relationship you will have when you close the distance something that is worth possibly feeling the absence of a partner during long distance? For me, despite the distance, I know that we will close it one day (we're looking at hopefully 3 months from now right now!) and that is worth the effort of being apart right now, texting when we can, and taking time out of our day to do so. You said that you are in your early 20s and thinking you're too young to get settled down. What exactly do you mean by \"settled down\"? I'm in my early 20s as well and I know that I'm ready to \"settle down\" but only with my partner.

{"e0h59om": {"text": "I agree that we should try to limit negativity. One of the things that I had to come to terms with when Atlas left the cute little puppy fluff\\-ball stage was that people were going to discriminate against him (and me) and assume things. I own a German Shepherd, and I acknowledge that comes with certain ramifications. Because I'm a smaller woman, people assume that my \"dangerous\" dog is going to get out of my control and bite them. \"Does he bite?\" is the phrase I get asked first. I chose to take on those ramifications when I got him. This isn't to say that they are right or excusable, but that it's not surprising. There are a lot of stereotypes behind German Shepherds and their owners\\-\\- some of them good, most of them bad. They're seen as dangerous, aggressive, \"police dogs\", and scary. While I think those are the silliest things in the world, I can also see why people might come to that conclusion. I am a part of a German Shepherd group on another website, and it is truly scary to me how the vast majority of the owners advocate dominance theory and I once saw a photo of a mans face that had been bludgeoned saying he was \"showing his dog who was boss\". He received tons of praise after he said he \"proved himself alpha\" after bashing his dog over with a chair. Shepherds are bark\\-y and can be neurotic. Mine barks at new people he's excited to meet, and I can completely understand that to be scary for people. There are also lots of badly treated Shepherds like the one owned by the man above that end up fear\\-aggressive and bite. There is also the sheer fact that they have an impressive bite force. While I cannot speak for other stigmatized breeds, I imagine that they have similar experiences in their groups. I am a proud Shepherd owner, but I try to be an example of owners outside the norm. The stereotypes exist because certain breeds are seen as \"macho\" and \"dangerous\". Although stereotypes are not great, I do think that it is beneficial to discuss them and address why they are the way that they are and how we can learn from them by not being like them. In example, we can learn from the stereotype behind the neurotic fear\\-aggressive Shepherd that we need to take their natural wariness instinct seriously and be really proactive in preventing it from progressing.

As far as herding breeds go: I guess they can bond to the wrong person and as a person with a GSD, you know that can get dicey. They can absolutely love more than one person, but usually, Shepherds have their shepherd. For me, that wasn't an issue despite the fact that I actually raised Atlas with my ex boyfriend. He was heavily involved in things like training and basic puppy duties. It never was a fear that he would bond with the wrong person because I picked the puppy that I knew suited me and I put in that extra time. We had a very special bond from the moment I brought him home as he wouldn't stop crying on the car ride home unless I sang to him. Although puppy blues did hit me, I do see it better in hindsight.

I honestly was so pissed. I was looking at him like \"COME ON.

I have him sit next to me before we start walking in a heel. Once, he sat 180 degrees facing backwards ready to go. I was very curious as to what his plan was here. So I gave the command and began walking and he walked the other way. He walked very slowly and it would have been a perfect heel... if he was facing the right way. He looked at me like \"mom what did I do\"* Atlas is a proud asshole. I am really jealous when people have dogs that show any sort of gratitude when they're being pet. Atlas honestly just gives me the look like \"yeah. you know.\" I've only heard him do the low\\-satisfy grumble ONCE and that was because I let him on the bed for the first time ever in his life.* Once, my partner and I were at the dog park playing fetch with Atlas. Another gentleman shows up dressed pretty similarly to my partner: white T shirt, tan shorts. They're of similar heights and builds. My partner throws the ball, and Atlas deadass brings it to the other dude, drops it right in front of him, and looks at him like nothing is wrong. My partner looks at Atlas and says \"come on man, we don't even look alike\". We even gave him a minute to figure it out. He didn't. He did not get the message after my partner went over to pick up the ball and threw it again for him the first time, because Atlas still brought the ball back to the other dude.* Atlas met two of my friends on Tuesday this week. I was hoping that, at ALMOST TWO he would have outgrown his excitement pee. I was very wrong.* The nasty asshole's favorite thing to chew on is panties. I hate him. Those things are fucking expensive. He's sneaky about it too, going in to the bathroom and pulling them out of the laundry basket. I now close the bathroom door.* Atlas peed on all of the vet techs that he was around until he was like 6 months old. This is particularly terrible because there was a point in time where for about 2 months, we were going every two weeks. It was really embarrassing.* Once, Atlas walked headfirst in to my fireplace. It wasn't like he lost his footing or miscalculated or anything. He honestly just forgot how to walk.* As can be inferred from the rest of the details, he's a clumsy fuck. However, one day, the stars aligned and I happened to have called him from across the room where his only route was jumping over an ottoman. He fucking cleared that ottoman like he was making a perfect run in agility. I am now convinced that he just enjoys being clumsy and dumb.* If Atlas sees the open door to my car, he will jump in to it because he, like many dogs, loves car rides. However, no amount of calling will get him out of the car. If you try to climb in the car to attempt to forcibly remove his 75 pound body from the already small space, he will climb in to the front seat to stay in the car. You literally have to leave a door open and leave for 15 minutes before he gives up.

This behavior was possibly a little frightening to your dog and he reacted by barking/growling. A growl is a communication tactic. *Generally* it means \"I don't like this\" to some capacity. We cannot be completely sure because every single dog is different. Dogs react weird ways to things they aren't familiar with. I remember my friends were goofing around once and jumping and bouncing around like springs.

Mine was with his litter until 10 weeks old to minimize this and it was still awful. I couldn't believe how determined he was to bite my ankles until they bled. I did a really dramatic version of the yelp method. So, when we do the yelp method, we are essentially mimicking the interaction a puppy may have with one of his litter mates where the litter mate yelps in pain and disengages play. When I yelped like I see most people training their dog yelp, he seemed to not care and continue at my ankles. So instead, when I did yelp, I made the truest most dramatic \"you've hurt me\" noises ever. I would yank my hand back and actually act like I was going to die. (There was at one point where I was so hysterical from all of this that I might have believed it.) Then, I would disengage play by physically walking away and facing the wall for a good 15 seconds so he couldn't engage me even if he tried. If my yelp was not good enough, he would continue at my ankles when I did this. If my yelp was dramatic enough, he got the message. When in the room with multiple people, EVERYONE was required to commit to this training (including the wall facing) or they wouldn't be playing with him until this stage was over. It wasn't long before he realized he could just go landshark on someone else's hands/ankles when the first person left to face the wall, so everyone had to face the wall so he understood that it was bad to do so, because others won't want to play with him either. Honestly, it was super dramatic and really silly. I got really fucking tired of acting like I was going to cry every time he mouthed me because... well you can imagine just how much he was doing it (like your guy), but it was really worth it. This method worked so well that he didn't even mouth me when his teeth were coming in. He has fabulous bite inhibition now and at around a year old, he was allowed to mouth me in a friendly way again. ", "link_id": "t3_8pdbpx", "time": 1528453254}}

{"e0bfdni": {"text": "Hello victim of puppy ownership, you have reached the boss stage: adolescence. Never fear, your lovely puppy is in there somewhere. In adolescence, puppies push boundaries and challenge rules. They may \"forget\" their name or where to potty. This is very frustrating, but not abnormal. Simply be firm and reinforce your rules. For some dogs, it's like training a 10 week old all over again. Corgis can also be known to be rather intelligent and sassy, which makes them quite challenging in this stage. He is still happy to greet others which is actually a really great sign! It means that, again, your puppy is in there. He's just a teenager right now, and teenagers aren't exactly the most pleasant to their parents. In regards to resource guarding, I highly recommend reverting to hand\\-feeding. I am very fortunate that my dog has never developed food\\-guarding and I attribute it to a combination of hand\\-feeding, being very hands\\-on with removing foods from his mouth at a young age (this is controversial, but I am really glad I did it. He allows me to take away bones that I don't want him chewing anymore because of the hardness after he's stripped away the meat), and trading up for treats as well. Resource guarding isn't pleasant, but again, isn't abnormal. You're catching it early on and can nip it in the bud. Some people are in the camp of \"let the dog eat in peace\". Respectfully, I am not comfortable with doing that as I feel like it can exacerbate resource guarding, but again, that's just my viewpoint. He doesn't hate being around you!

{"e0avtn0": {"text": "We're sharing horror stories??? Border Collies are the most intelligent, and thus also the most \"horrifying\" hands down, which is why I do not own one even though I'm in love with the breed. I do have GSD horror stories for you though! Although they aren't as smart as BC's, they're still pretty intelligent, and huge assholes. However, being that you own an Aussie, it seems like you are already more prepared than most people are to own these two breeds, so keep that in mind. Also, some of these are just facts about dog ownership, and some of them might be exclusive to my dog, but here goes: * Atlas has learned how to open drawers. It's really fucking annoying. * Atlas has a wire crate that doesn't actually contain him. He stays inside because he's trained to (which is really great!), but he will exit whenever he wants which leads to some shenanigans. * Honestly, the entire puppy biting phase was one big horror story. * Also the crying. * His excitement peeing is also a horror story, but might just be exclusive to my dingbat dog. * Also possibly specifically my dog, he went through both a phase of **eating rocks** and **eating earphones**. He never managed to get a rock down, thank god, but he did manage to get a pair of earphones down and needed surgery. As for the rocks, it was so bad that I would hold out a rock and a treat, and he'd go for the rock. * This is probably just a big dog issue, but the adolescent phase was really hard for me and Atlas because he was like 60 pounds and a fully blown dick. * He seems to think he can dig a hole in my bed. * German Shepherd health issues are honestly the scariest horror story of all. * German Shepherd sensitive GI tract swimming in diarrhea is also a horror story. Like you could  pet them the wrong way and the next thing you know, you got diarrhea. (I'm exaggerating, but it's really sensitive). A professional pet nutritionist once told me \"A German Shepherd can eat rocks and turn it in to diarrhea if he tried\". * There's also horror stories about other owners and people being unkind due to breed stereotypes. * They are puppies forever (some people say 2 years, and some people say up to 4), except that they get to be 75\\+ pounds quickly but maintain that puppy energy and attitude. Mine is turning 2 next month, and although he has calmed down, he completely reverts to puppyhood when he meets a new person, and he STILL does zoomies. * Not so much a nightmare, but a big annoyance: Atlas' new favorite thing is to knock over things with his snout. I keep water in a Blender bottle by my bed, and he seems to enjoy just walking up to it and knocking it over. * He stepped on me up until the day he was 70 pounds. It hurt. * He is still convinced that if I tell him to drop something (he KNOWS the command), that if he runs away fast enough that he will get to keep it. He never does. I always walk over there and force him to drop it, but it gets annoying real quick. * The shedding in it of itself is a horror story. * Although it's to be expected, he is barky and that is also annoying. * He does not give a single fuck if I am crying. His first response is to jump all over my body and crush me. It sucks. Regardless of all of that, I love Atlas to pieces, but I say \"I hate him\" at least 10 times a day. Bonus: Some Border Collie Stories from my friends Border Collie * She knows how to open cabinets, remove treats, and then close the cabinets to hide the evidence * She is able to parkour the living room and escape out the window if she so chooses * Because she is so high strung, she's got a lot of anxiety issues so although she's an adult, she has bladdar control issues  ", "link_id": "t3_8pex7q", "time": 1528420598}}

I think that the most important thing in the world that we, as the partners with bipolar disorder, can do is be active in our recovery to try to minimize situations like these.It's been a year (11 and a half months to be precise) since my psychotic break, and I still feel a lot of fear and anxiety about it. I don't think that it's ever really going to go away. Just today, I felt something coming and I got deathly afraid that it was a seasonal thing. It's something we learn to cope with, but I don't really think it goes away.I think it's really great that he is saying \"we will regain intimacy\". I prefer more feeling based language like \"I will try my best to help us regain intimacy. I believe that we will regain intimacy.\" but that's mostly how I like to communicate. I do want to make a note that our symptoms can be present months after the episode is over. They're barely noticeable, but they're there. For example, heightened anxiety levels can persist. It is not obvious, but it's just small things. Adjusting back is really hard and it really can take longer than we assume.The irritability is something that is characteristic of the disorder. It seems like he is doing a really incredible job so far apologizing and taking responsibility. That is something that is actually really difficult for a lot of us to do. However, I don't like to talk things through thoroughly right away. We always do talk things through thoroughly, but after I cool down. I would maybe talk to him about creating an \"Eject Button\". At least for me, I don't snap instantly. It's pretty quick, but not instant. The moment I can feel it bubbling, I hit my eject button. I'll tell my partner \"Babe. I love you so much, but I cannot do this right now. Please can we revisit it at a time where I'm feeling more stable?\". Because that is a mouthful, I am also a fan of having a safe\\-word. A simple \"marshmallow\" or \"octopus\" to convey that message is great. It stops the moment from getting more heated.

I tell him specific things I like, and I make it very well known that it does not bother me at all that he is an Aspie. I fell in love with him before we knew his diagnosis, and I'm still in love with him after. He does have general issues with self\\-esteem, but not to a point where it impedes on his wellbeing. However, I still do let him know every day. To be honest, I really do genuinely like some of his Aspie traits. Because he has a difficult time picking up on nonverbal signals, he always makes sure to ask lots of questions and isn't afraid to say \"I don't understand\" when something I say doesn't quite make sense to him. He knows he has trouble with these things, so he consciously puts in the effort to level with me. Because of his efforts, he understands me better (verbally and nonverbally) than any person ever has. He jokes that I am one of his special interests, but it really means a lot to me that he has put in all this effort to learn these things that are difficult for him. I also communicate by asking lots of questions. It's been a while since he's had issues with this due to all the practice he's had (coming around 8 years!), but before I let myself get offended or hurt by something, I make sure to ask questions about what he meant. I may have misinterpreted it. I also communicate in sometimes repetitive ways. Because he may not really understand some of the expressions of gratitude that I have as well as I hope, I say things like, \"I really appreciate that you spend the time to get to understand my signals\" and \"I really do think you're wonderful to me. You always somehow know how to make me smile when I'm down.\" Those things are more tangible. Love is a difficult trait for everybody to define. It's not just an Aspie struggle! The rest of us have to find our own definitions of it as well, and it's not always the same as someone else's. I will say that for my Aspie partner, he says he knows he loves me because that is something he takes as fact. Like many Aspies, he takes facts very seriously. He knows that it shouldn't be a fact that he loves me because there's not really basis behind it, and he knows that even gravity is just a theory.

That being said, there is one big thing that I need to highlight: **Returning back to the hospital, if she needs to go, is not a failure.** Sometimes, we just aren't quite ready. Then, when we and the people around us view returning to the hospital as a failure, it shoves a huge wedge in our recovery. Now my questions: * Contact information for the physician that treated her in case you need to get in contact with them again* What are warning sign behaviors and how to address them in the moment * Does he think that she will benefit more from jumping back in to her normal routine or getting settled at home first? (I know I need to get settled first, and then ease back in to life. I can't just jump back in) * When is a good time to approach couples counseling (if you are open to this. I think it is awesome and can really benefit you) At the end of all of this... it really is up to you communicating these things with your wife and discussing her boundaries. Now this guy right here: **Do not let her drink alcohol especially with her Flurazepam. She is not supposed to drink (a lot of us do anyways, just in moderation) with any of her medications, but this one is particularly important. Flurazepam is in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines. When you mix benzodiazepines with alcohol, the two depressants together can cause what is the equivalent of a roofie. I know that is really fucking scary, but it's important to understand. She can become conscious, but not truly in control of her actions because her mind can black our while her body is still awake. This is something that is a huge danger as it has caused people to drive cars off of cliffs and, very sadly, get women in to bad situations.** ", "link_id": "t3_8or2ht", "time": 1528272391}}
{"e074mih": {"text": "I'm sorry hon. I see red flags. A huge part of being a good partner when you have bipolar disorder is being active and responsible for your recovery. I know that I hurt people around me when I am not stable, so I try my very very best to stay stable. I understand the sentiment of the medication making him feel like a zombie. I actually had a similar experience on another medication that I got off of very quickly, but I made sure to continue trying to find something that works for me. As far as therapy goes, it's not for everyone. I don't go to therapy. However, if he's not taking medication nor going to therapy, it doesn't seem like he's doing much in the way of his own recovery. Although many people utilize weed in their recovery, it can absolutely make things worse. Self\\-medication is never a good answer and it can turn to addiction and bad news quickly. The anger is, unfortunately, a telltale symptom of bipolar disorder. A lot of people seem to think it's just \"happy\" and \"sad\", but the scariest part, in my opinion, is the rage. It's a mood disorder and we don't have control. We fly off of the handle and we say mean and scary things we often don't mean deep down. It's scary for everyone involved. Stress can affect things a great deal. I also have a really severe anxiety disorder, so stress is a disaster for me, but it is **never** an excuse to treat you poorly nor verbally abuse you or anything close to the matter. You should **never** feel like you are walking on eggshells in your own home. Now listen. **Calling you a stupid cunt is verbally abusive.** There is no way around that, and I am so god damned sorry that you are in this situation. Understand this: he knows he is hurting you and verbally abusing you and calling you a \"stupid cunt\". He knows that this is his disorder talking and he says he loves you, so he should be reducing this the best he can. He should be active in trying to get better. It can be so fucking hard. So many of us do not get help until we hit rock bottom. For everybody, that means something different. Neither my father nor I hit rock bottom until my mother stopped dealing with us and we were separated. It was really hard, but it often times takes us having absolutely nothing to know how sick we are and to get help.

{"e074d14": {"text": "Hi there! It's not counterintuitive at all! I think it's really important for partners to support each other regardless of the circumstances. First, I would be really really careful not to dismiss hypomania s a non\\-issue. I think that our highs are always non\\-issues until they are issues if that makes any sense. It's never really an issue until that hyper\\-sexuality becomes for more than just your boyfriend. I'm not accusing you of anything, of course not! I am just sort of putting the statement out there not to discount the damage hypomania can cause. In fact, a lot of psychiatrists consider the hypomania to be the more dangerous pole of the bipolar disorder. I think that, if you are the type that needs to be alone when depressed and does not at all benefit from being around people, it needs to be something that you communicate to him. It's not useful to try to stay around one another if you know it's going to derail in to an unproductive (and usually meaningless) argument. For me, when I'm stable, I discuss with my partner things that I like and things that I don't like. He asks a lot of questions (just generally, like as a personality trait). I find that this is incredibly helpful during episodes. * Would you like me to hold you? * Do you think that would be helpful? * Do you think it'd be helpful if I stepped in to the other room for a moment? * If you don't know what you'd like, is it alright if I just sit here next to you until you do? Or would you like me to leave for a bit? When put in a caring and loving tone, I don't mind being asked questions. Some people might feel like they are bombarded, but that is not my personal experience. If that is yours, I highly recommend discussing protocols of what you would normally like. Communicating what he *can* do will really help with that feeling of helplessness that our partners can sometimes get when we are in episodes. As far as being in an episode goes... sometimes, I really just need his support. I try not to do it often, but i will admit it. Sometimes, I am just falling apart and I need my support systems. Through time, my partner has become my primary support system, but I do have a secondary one (my pup!). During these times, he steps up to the plate. I step up accordingly when he needs help too, sometimes with mental health challenges, and sometimes with things like editing a paper (I am much more linguistically inclined). It's a real give and take thing, and this is part of that give. Usually, when I'm depressed, aside from really letting him know how much I appreciate him and all he does for me, I really cannot realistically be too concerned with much other than holding myself together. I take care of him afterwards by showing the gratitude and just loving him. I try to be really really active in stopping spirals and arguments before they get there, particularly if I know it's going to end up being an emotionally driven shouting episode. I try to stay as on top of my recovery as possible to reduce these episodes and I try to communicate the best I can when things are happening. He is always in the loop and he always knows whats up with me. Even when it's bad, I do not keep him in the dark. ", "link_id": "t3_8ou57d", "time": 1528271378}}

Also you said you are a student and you have two young siblings that lives at home. Are you in college? While I got my pup in college, I never advise it to anybody. It is often an unwise investment that leads to a great deal of stress upon graduation in applying for jobs, moving, etc. Additionally, dogs are fucking expensive. I will never regret getting my dog, but I do regret the fact that he cost $4000 in vet bills in his first year of life. It's really something to consider. It also means no going out after school/work with friends/co\\-workers \\(esp. if you get a puppy\\) because you MUST go home to care for your puppy. Also, for the first 6\\-ish months, 8 hours of the dog being alone is too much. It's just a lot of work and not advisable. Also, this is a separate issue/word of warning, but raising a pup in a home with a child with autism spectrum disorder may require special precautions. My partner is on the spectrum and we totally have to do things a certain way. If he was much younger, he would likely respond poorly to the regular puppy crying, mouthing, and other things.

These are feelings that I encourage you to share with your wife in a positive and understanding fashion. At the end of the day, children often look to their parents relationships to assess the home environment. She should be actively taking a role in recovery in relation to parenting. My dad and mom raised me while my father was unmedicated and undiagnosed \\(still is\\). Honestly, I never really understood it was bipolar disorder. I really didn't until I was diagnosed myself. To me, it just looked like an unhealthy relationship where my dad got irrationally strong feeling'd about things and it would destroy the family from time to time. I don't think it's about shielding so much as it about understanding... As far as the fifth child comment: yeah I get it. Sometimes, I really fucking need support from my partner. Sometimes, I just cannot hold it together myself. I do try my best though and I phone the calvary when I need to. I am endlessly grateful that he has the patience to help me the way I need to be helped. However, I recognize this is not his responsibility and I always express my gratitude. How is your wife's reaction to these episodes after? Is she conscious? What does she say in relation to them? Does she attempt to make amends? I wrote [a blog post on it here](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/2018/05/21/accountability-in-apologies-identifying-whether-or-not-your-significant-other-with-bipolar-is-an-asshole/). It is important for her to take responsibility for her actions despite the fact that they were caused by bipolar disorder. The fact of the matter is that her actions affect you and your children. Although she is not in complete control, the things she does and the words she says still hurts. It is crucial to address these feelings that you mentioned as early as possible because they can build in to resentment over time. In terms of her rejecting getting a sitter, this seems like a huge red flag. There are a few possibilities that I can think of that she would do this, but the biggest one is probably that getting a sitter might make her feel inadequate/more ill. This likely isn't super awesome that she sometimes feels like a child instead of a partner to you. I think that, in a lot of ways, this probably has to do with her own relationship with her disorder. There is a great deal of both external and internal stigma that comes with bipolar disorder and it seems like she may not be completely to terms with it yet. Is she medicine compliant? If not, what is she doing in her recovery journey? Although medicine isn't everybody's path, if she is not being active in her journey otherwise, she is effectively being complacent in her recovery while knowing it is damaging both you and the children. Simply waiting isn't going to cut it. If we could simply wait out our illnesses, a lot of us would be in much different places. Here is a write up I did on [Disorder &amp; Diagnosis](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/disorder-diagnosis/). The latter section seems relevant. At the end of the day, I think that, more than anything, you have to talk to her. The two of you need to work as a team in order to function as a family unit \\(if you elect to do so\\). This may mean getting a sitter for the betterment of the children even if it takes a hit to her ego. When dealing with mental health challenges, teamwork is the groundwork. While as a partner, the Bipolar SO should support their loved one in their recovery when necessary, the SO with Bipolar should also play their part by being active in seeking recovery. Recovery is not easy. Recovery does not just happen to us.

Then, when she comes home, you can have a little part with corny streamers, a cake, and such waiting for her. It'd be very sweet. She'll get there. I think that a lot of people think that the moment we are discharged we are suddenly back to where we were before the episode. The thing is, we actually sometimes display symptoms for months at a time \\(albeit they are often very subtle\\), but we have to spend a surprisingly large amount of time to recover. For instance, I have a lot of trouble with memory because of my episodes. It's good she's popular and active in the hospital. The hospital is supposed to be a safe place where she feels like she can come out of her shell and find herself again. It means she's recovering and that is great! I cannot imagine how difficult it is for you. In scenarios like this, people tend to focus on the individual in the hospital saying that they are clearly the \\[only\\] one that needs help/to be focused on. I think that is really silly. The hospital is, again, a safe space. It is isolated from the outside world where we can spend all of our energy every single day trying to recover and get back on our feet.

Although we certainly haven't been dating the entire time, we are about to round 8 years of knowing one another in a few months. When we started dating, I realized that in a partner, more than anything, I value friendship. I think that too many relationships these days are actually inherently self centered. Couples get in fights where the most important thing is being right instead of coming to terms with one another. Couples forget to stay friends and become just a unit with no companionship. I value that companionship and ability to laugh. I want to always be friends. I am a really honest person. I have a really difficult time lying about near anything. I don't like to do it because I simply was taught not to. I don't like lies of omission \\(especially in a relationship\\) and I don't like white lies. If the top doesn't look good on me, just tell me. You can be nice about it too if you want. Say that you like some other one better. Just don't lie to me. When lies inevitably come to light, it causes me to have trust issues. I value trust so much. I think that trust is something that is necessary in a relationship. I trust my partner to do nearly anything and it makes us great. I learned that I value an ability to stand up for themselves and not take my shit. I have the tendency to push boundaries even if I do not mean to. I will steam roll if given the chance and neither me nor my partner is happy if that happens because I feel like there's no pushback and he feels like there's no freedom.

I am the individual with bipolar disorder in the relationship, so I will try to offer some insight from the other end. If she learned years ago that she has bipolar disorder and has not come to terms with it, yet, it likely indicates that bar a major event happening, she may be more content to stay where she is. This isn't a knock on her by any means. Learning we have mental illnesses is really difficult and can be the cause of identity crises. [Here is my write\\-up on Disorder &amp; Diagnosis. ](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/disorder-diagnosis/)I hope that it can provide you better insight on why she might still be in this stage and possibly a little better understanding of the condition. If you think that it might resonate with her, you may want to encourage her to read it over as well. I always say \"Recovery doesn't just happen to us. It's really hard and we need to choose it every damn day.\" I believe this to my core. I spend probably half of my energy each day doing various things for my mental health \\(mood monitoring, self care, etc.\\). A very difficult thing about recovery is that it often does not begin until we hit rock bottom. Rock bottom is different for everyone, but I know that my father and I both started getting significantly better when we hit that point. While this isn't an encouragement to leave your wife by any means, I find that much of the time, our loved ones prevent us from hitting that rock bottom point because they cannot bear to see us suffering so deeply. This can include placating our hypomanic/manic episodes, helping bail us out of financial situations, forgiving things that shouldn't be forgiven, etc. In both my father and my case, the loved one was my mother. Usually what happens when we hit rock bottom is we realize that something is truly wrong \\(acceptance!\\). It's often times a moment of deep emptiness and desperation. Then, somehow, someway, we find the motivation to get our shit together for those we love. If she doesn't take recovery seriously, I'm really sorry to say that there's not much that can be done. The first step to recovery is acceptance. I would begin by sitting down with her \\(when she's stable\\) and voicing your concerns. They are all completely valid and very important. Sometimes, it is a lot easier for us to acknowledge we need to get help and take recovery seriously when we truly take in the amount we have hurt the people we love.

I cannot imagine the horror. He was clearly not quite in his right mind, but only ran away in response of not wanting to be tased. It is very scary to me. I also continue to question the mother and her methods. I am sure she loved her son very much and worried a great deal, but having a minor involuntarily committed due to being underage and not being able to sign himself out, can be very dangerous long term. It forces treatment and perpetuates certain attitudes that may not be great for recovery. **On the State:** I get it. Police are usually the ones who respond to the 911 calls and performs the wellness checks. The inherent issue with this is that policemen are law enforcement. They are allowed to involuntarily commit a person if they are a danger to themselves or others. At the end of the day though, their duty  and what they have been trained for is to protect the public, not the individual. I believe that in order to change this, there needs to be widespread retraining and mental health destigmatization. The times of that are very far away, and the near future scares me a great deal. With the perpetuation of these ideas in the media through the horrible mass shootings being linked with mental illnesses, the fear mongering is creating pressure. While, by no means excusable, it is often the same stigmas and inherent biases that gets black men shot for small violations. It really does not help that we are installing more psychiatric wards in prison. While I do think that those with mental health challenges in prison need to be treated, it does serve to perpetuate the idea that mentally ill people and prison go hand in hand. **On 5150ing my SO** I have bipolar disorder, but I have called a wellness check on my non\\-bipolar SO. He does face his own challenges. I try my best not to involve authorities and call only when absolutely necessary. I only called because I was fearful for his life and had no other way of reaching him myself. I think that involuntary commitment is often times not very helpful for treatment as the most effective treatment almost always comes from an individual's commitment to recovering. If we admit ourselves, there are lots of stories about us leaving a lot better. **On Stigma** At the end of all of this, it is the inherent stigmas that are preventing us from seeking help early and getting us shot. I hate it, and I work to reduce it and provide resources to those in need each day, but I am scared. I am scared about the legislation that is coming. I am scared that they're going to link mass shootings to us every time they occur. I am scared that they're going to demand a roster be met. I am scared that they aren't going to let us buy firearms because while I don't even like firearms and think that no one should have them, that is a beginning to stripping of constitutional rights.

{"dzvbjwr": {"text": "Please don't do that. I've taken this excerpt from the About section on [my blog on bipolar &amp; love](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/): &gt;I started this blog as a passion project. All around me, I saw so many of my peers with mental health challenges lamenting over the idea that they would never find, nor be worthy of love. So many of these individuals had written themselves out of the possibility of romance just because they faced a unique set of circumstances. The profound amount of sadness and loss that accompanies the human feeling of being unlovable is unbelievable. Like many others, my path to love has not been easy. Despite our challenges as a couple, I have found my person and feel deeply loved.I hope that I can set an example through my own life that it is possible. Because this always helps me, I will try to appeal the logical side of things. Love is not hard to find because we have bipolar disorder. Love his hard to find because love is a beautiful and rare thing. It is idealized in media and we are taught to believe that it entails certain things. Take this train of thought: think about how many marriages end in divorce. From there, think about how many of those marriages are unhappy and remain together. What's left is a small sliver of people that have hit the goldmine. Those people are profoundly lucky, and, statistically speaking, we should all abandon the hope of finding love because it is astronomically rare. Yet, the general populace doesn't. We don't abandon it because we find it within us to believe in the possibility, no matter how statistically improbable. We go out in to the world with hope and with open hearts trying our best because that is all we can really do. I found my person. Every single day, I cannot believe how ridiculously lucky I am. I cannot believe how incredibly indebted I am to the universe for this to have befallen me. I let him know every single day. Yet, no matter how well matched we are, we work hard to maintain our relationship. We do not feel like it is \"work\" per se, because we are having fun doing it. With my bipolar disorder \\(amongst other things\\) and his autism spectrum disorder, on paper, we should be a god damned mess. Instead, we've worked hard to build up a communication system that works for us. We talk to one another and have a profound amount of love, respect, understanding, and compassion for the other. We do not keep score, and we do not view the other person's condition as a nuisance. These conditions are part of the persons we love and we do not pick and choose when to love them.All of that being said, the cliche is true. Before you can find love with other people, it is important to find love within yourself. Before you go out and seek another person, you must first have peace with who you are. You must know your worth and you must be a person that you would be proud to be with. This, for us, usually means getting stable. ", "link_id": "t3_8namcs", "time": 1527753426}}
{"dzvb750": {"text": "The two of you have the most important aspect of making this work of all: that you both want to keep trying. This is the basis of all relationships \\(not just ones with mental health challenges\\) and it is surprisingly hard to come by. A lot of the times, particularly in marriage, one party may become complacent. When this happens, there is a stunt of growth, understanding, and eventually love. All relationships and partnerships are work, but if the two of you work as a team, it dramatically increases your chances of working it out. You said he doesn't feel like you really know him and that he needs to censor. Negative behavior picked up while untreated and bad habits from childhood are things that need to be addressed in a positive way. Do the homework the therapist gives you and try to communicate as best you can. Most importantly of all: talk to one another. Be kind and understanding to facilitate and environment where he is less afraid to be himself. Find out why he is afraid to be himself \\(specifically\\). Talk about everything. Don't forget to hang out either. Sometimes, when couples acknowledge issues in their relationship and orient themselves towards working on them, it can overtake their relationship.

{"dztbxnf": {"text": "Preface: I'm like two episodes behind Yo this is cool. Octavia has been my favorite character for a long time, but with her actions this season, I have begrudgingly begun singing a different tone. I think that if we were to isolate her actions to this season, it would be super obvious the monster she is. As you stated, she's running the Bunker in anarchy and has somehow merged both of the scariest traits from the Ark and the Ground combined \\(systematically killing people &amp; violence\\). To understand Octavia, we should look at her history. Her character has changed dramatically from the trembling girl we saw under the floorboards in season 1. Yet, it is this very same hiding that won her the conclave. Octavia has been shown little to no guidance her entire life. She was forced to grow up a criminal simply for existing. Although we know very little about Octavia's prison life on the Ark, we can inference that there was not very much education and social conditioning going on. The first true social exposure and conditioning she got was on the ground. In the grounders, she found a group that welcomed her for her ability to fight. It was the first time in her life that she was accepted. After the grounders affirmed her violence, the former\\-Ark members also affirmed it. She was needed and hailed by the characters and viewers alike as the best warrior. I think that Octavia is the culmination of all of the horrible things that have happened to her along with the validation of this violence by everybody around her. I have to debate whether or not the grounders approach towards violence and their \"blood must have blood\" motto can truly be regarded as masculine. Although they are absolutely violent and bloody, I struggle to label them as masculine within the context of the show. It seems as if grounder culture is one of the most feminist ones depicted on television. Lexa is the supreme leader, it seems there is no gender regarding the flame\\-keeper, and nobody seems to be upset when other women come forward as Nightbloods to fight in the conclave. It seems that as long as a woman can prove her fighting worth, she is regarded with the respect she deserves and is fit to lead. I am interested in seeing where the show takes Octavia's plot as it could be written out that bloodlust overtook her without the help of the flame to pass the commander's wisdom. I think that Octavia can be a representation of masculinity, but it runs much deeper than just her character. It runs in to development and is a great example of innocence lost. As much as I have a disdain for toxic masculinity, I also recognize that men do not inherently behave this way. Instead, they are encouraged to be violent and \"macho\" through affirmations by society. In this case, society was both the grounders and the former\\-ark members. I do think that within the context of the show, Octavia is likely just a depiction of the grounder mentality of violence being the only purpose she knows. It cannot be considered an overtly feminine nor masculine thing as in this universe, violence seems to be gender neutral. However, in the context of our world, she can serve to show how brutal violence can be and the dangers of encouraging these sorts of attitudes \\(which are scarily similar to the attitudes we have while raising boys\\).

{"dztbajy": {"text": "Dear god nothing is wrong with you. Atlas was, and still is a little shit. He's almost two now and he is just now becoming that idea you have when you imagine a good dog and not a constant nightmare of responsibility. He's sleeping on my tummy right now and is very precious. I have heard from people that have both had puppies and babies that. in some capacity, puppies are harder. Having a puppy at home is like a second shift after work. It's exhausting and it is very normal for you to be feeling this way. Think about this realistically. This little creature is biting you until your ankles bleed, screaming hours in to the night so you can't sleep, demanding you run home from lunch like a madwoman to feed her, preventing you from getting one second of relaxation after a long day of work, and all while consistently draining your money and energy to care for her. God reading all of that makes me frustrated at my dog and he hasn't been like that for over a year. It's really hard. What you are doing is really hard, and you are not a horrible person for needing a break. Now that we've complained, let's talk about the upsides. I know that right now, you're probably too busy trying not to bleed all over your things to take photos, but try to remember to take little puppy photos. I really wish I had more. I know that the entire time, I was too exhausted to take them, but you won't regret taking them when she grows up to be a very good girl. While your puppy is currently a little shit and very annoying, it also means that you will get to experience all of these things for the first time with her. You get to learn her opinions on toys, treats, and you get to find out what her favorite spot to sunbathe is. You get to learn how long she will tolerate cuddling \\(once she settles down\\) and you get to have all of these amazing firsts with her. You can likely still take her to new places like the beach and the woods and watch her go nuts for the first time. If she hasn't seen rain or snow, you'll get to do that with her too! There is so much of the world for her little paws to explore and it's super exciting to be doing that for the first time. Train daily and motivate yourself. You can do this and it will be worth it. Celebrate the little victories. I basically threw a party when Atlas managed to potty outside successfully twice in a row. It was honestly a miracle. When he finally started getting the message that his dagger milk teeth were making me bleed and question my life choices, I basically celebrated like it was my birthday. Also, never ever feel bad for taking time to yourself. We want to head home right after work because we've been out all day and we want to be responsible owners and interact with our puppies. It's good that we feel that pressure because it keeps us on our toes. However, if I went straight home and interacted with Atlas every day until he was nine months old and slightly more bearable, I would have lost my god damned mind. I always set aside time for myself. I either used that time to get coffee, take a bath, or just browse the internet. I needed downtime because without it, I'd be burnt out and useless to him anyways.

What probably sucks most is the \"I fucking hate myself\" comment you listed in another thread. I'm here to say: I fucking get it. There are two routes to go about this. Either you decide to embrace your hyper\\-sexuality and explore the possibility of non\\-traditional relationships or you attempt to reorient yourself towards monogamy. The first route is totally plausible and okay! I think that a lot of people in non\\-conventional relationships be that they are open, polyamorous, or whatever else face a great deal of scrutiny. I find this super silly as all parties should be consenting adults and should be able to love and explore their sexualities in any way they please. However, this requires a great deal of open communication and consent from all parties involved. The second route could be a longer one. However, if this is something you ultimately want in your life, I encourage you to begin the process. It's important for you to confront the reason that you cheat. Is it possible that it goes beyond bipolar disorder? Is it possible that you have issues with intimacy or sex addiction? These are all issues to explore, and there are lots of support groups for that! I know that for me, my issues stemmed partially from a lack of comfortability and codependency issues. My self destructive streak did not help at all. In order for us to improve, we cannot just say we do it 'because of bipolar disorder'. We must strive to be better. Hyper\\-sexuality is a symptom. I would talk to your psychiatrist about this. Lastly, I would not hide your history from your boyfriend. He deserves to know.

I have a special dietary need dog who does really well on a raw diet, but I have plenty of friends that feed hydrolyzed plant protein diets which are pretty much as far from my preferred diet as possible. I am happy as hell for them for finding something their dog does well on because different things work for different dogs.I say this from a place of trying a billion different kibbles, having probably a year of diarrhea, emaciation, lots of tears, and feeling like a failure as a dog owner. **Do what works for your dog. Fuck the rest.**That being said, if you do want to move off of the prescription diet via your own beliefs, \\(I do know that I am not super comfortable with a prescription diet per my own set of beliefs\\) this is how I would proceed. Staffies are pretty notorious for allergy issues. Is he presenting any other allergy symptoms? This might be the beginning of an elimination diet if you choose to do it. I do warn you that the veterinary allergy panels are not super accurate. The elimination diet will \\(hopefully!\\) guide you as to what proteins to avoid. From there, there are a couple of things that you can try. You could start tests with a Canine GI profile that will test for several common issues such as: coronavirus, parvovirus, giardia, salmonella, etc. I did skip this one as I knew he was very up to date on shots and these were not of huge concern to me. From there, you could do the malnutrition panel which tests folate and B12 levels to determine if your dog has EPI or SIBO. Both of these conditions are pretty uncommon but not unheard of. They will present in different ways, but the telltale deal is diarrhea. There's also the possibility of IBS and IBD. The latter of which can only be \"officially diagnosed\" through as cope or a biopsy. Now, all of that is a buttload of tests and really fucking expensive. I know because Atlas put me through the ringer. If prescription food works, I encourage you to use it!However, I do have a couple of tricks that I have learned over Atlas' life thus far that can be helpful in digestive health:* I do feed a raw diet. I find that this helps a lot of people, but I know that this is super unrealistic for a lot of dog owners and a lot of time and commitment. I will put out there that this resolved my dogs digestion issues though.* Probiotics are great. As far as the ones on the market, Fortiflora and PetUltimates are pretty great. I do prefer to feed whole food ones like raw goats milk, kefir, and fermented veggies though. He likes them and they taste better.* Anti\\-inflammatories are also nice because lots of the time, diarrhea is the result of an inflamed digestive system. I like to give berries as treats and feed him fish oil \\(good for the coat too!\\) and kelp amongst various other things.* When shit hits the fan \\(heh\\), I grab some of everything listed above and Slippery Elm Powder. The stuff is like magic. The next day, miraculously, the stool has improved dramatically and the diarrhea typically stops.* Also, random pro\\-tip for episodes of diarrhea: keep unflavored pedialyte on hand to mix in his water. It'll help him replenish his electrolytes and prevent dehydration \\(particularly with summer coming up\\).Edit: Malnutrition panel was literally like a $400 blood test. Don't even get me started on the price of the biopsy. I had pet insurance so it was a lot more affordable for me, but it's considerably lower priced than prescription kibble.

I think that in a lot of ways, he has saved my life. Like many people's relationships with their dogs, Atlas taught me a love beyond what I could comprehend. I'd never had a pet and it was truly incredible to see the bond he and I forged. He makes me happy and I truly do believe he loves me as much as I love him. After all, he tolerates my annoying kisses and smothering, so that's gotta count for something, right? Atlas is almost two now! He's been so awesome. I think that a lot of people have this idea behind support animals that they are these cuddly creatures that show us affection when we get sad. While this is true for some human\\-animal relationships, this is the opposite of mine. I think Atlas does know when I'm sad or going through something, but he cannot be bothered to cuddle or be gentle with me. He's kind of a jerk... only on his own terms. Yet, the act of caring for this creature that I love so much has forced me to keep my shit together. I cannot fall apart. He needs me. That is what drives me.

{"dzjqpnk": {"text": "You sound so very sweet. Breathe deeply. Something that isn't discussed often is that it is actually not rare to \"fall in love\" in a psychiatry ward. I put it in quotes because that \"love\" is often times not love. It is often time just the adrenaline, endorphins, and other mumbo jumbo our brains produce pulsing through and making ourselves even wilder. Hyper\\-sexuality is a super common effect of mania and it is why, unfortunately, many relationships with bipolar deal with a level of infidelity. However, as with all relationship struggles, I always believe that if both parties are willing to give it their all to move on from any incident and recover, it is possible. Her \"going off the deep end\" and blocking you on everything is also not unusual \\(unfortunately\\). I tend to do stuff like this when I began spiraling out of control. I become reckless and self\\-destructive. I blow up everything around me. There's not really a rhyme or reason to it, but that's sort fo the nature of mental illness. I think that maybe, during those times, I feel so lost and shitty that I want to push things away to a degree to make myself miserable. Other times, my impulse control is so terrible that I cannot, for the life of me, resist doing something. I can change my mind about major life things at the flip of a light switch. I can make horrible mistakes. The reality is, all of this sounds like expected behavior by an individual with bipolar disorder. The good news is, this doesn't have to be permanent. Is there any way for her to not be bouncing from hospital to hospital? The longer she is in a place, the longer they can evaluate her mental state and tweak her medication. It usually takes a few tries to get it right, esp. if they come in during an episode. However, with the right balance of medication and coping mechanisms, episodes like this will be \\(hopefully\\) eradicated. This isn't to say episodes will disappear. I still have good days and I have bad days, but instead of being a hurricane, I'm just waves in the ocean. It's a lot easier to handle. In regards to how to deal with her: at this moment, she isn't herself. But as hard as this may sound right now, you need to respect her, her feelings, and her wishes for space. Nothing hurts more than having your feelings dismissed. Even if these aren't her \"true feelings\", these are her true feelings right now, in this moment. In this moment, she doesn't want to see you. If you press her, you will become the guy that didn't respect her feelings. You can read about this in more detail at my blog [Love From a Distance: Respecting Space](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/2018/05/23/love-from-a-distance-respecting-space/). After this is over, I encourage the two of you to go over [\"I Understand Your Feelings\" ](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/2018/05/21/i-understand-your-feelings-starting-a-conversation-during-an-episode/)and [Safe\\-Words](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/2018/05/22/safe-words-not-just-for-sex/). For you, to understand a little bit better what she may be going through and feeling, here is [Disorder &amp; Diagnosis](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/disorder-diagnosis/). You sound like you want to stay with this girl if at all possible. One thing I need to warn you of is Bipolar is, in it's current state, chronic. My partner is aware that he will need to deal with the ups and downs until his last day and he is okay with that. I try actively to never let it get to this point again \\(because I have been here too\\), but it is in the cards. This means, in some capacity, always being a caregiver. This means, from here on out, taking communication to the next level. I suspect that when she comes out of this, being that this is her first psychotic break, she will be profoundly delicate. I know that I was. I'm not a delicate person, but during those few months, I felt like if the breeze hit me wrong I would shatter. She will likely question her identity, her actions, and much about herself \\(this is all in Disorder &amp; Diagnosis\\). Episodes end. The worst of them end, but many of us can be recovering from them and feeling the symptoms long after. If you choose to continue being with her after this, I ask you to be patient and to be kind. In regards to the girl who impersonated a nurse, I urge you to contact your girlfriend's old psychiatric ward and alert them of the incident. It can be extremely dangerous that she is doing this, and someone could very well get very hurt. ", "link_id": "t3_8lyzxg", "time": 1527234838}}

Also, congratulations on your new relationship! Although I'm really happy that you are being proactive in trying to assist with his condition, remember to enjoy this time. A new relationship is exciting and hopefully, our disorder doesn't detract from that. The volatility, although unpleasant, is unsurprising. It is also really great that he is asking you if he is being intense. It shows that he is self aware and, hopefully, willing to make changes in communication and actions based on your feedback. The talking about his exes is not great and really just sort of has the same issues as if anyone else was talking about their exes excessively. The one difference is that I find that I can get hyper\\-focused on something very quickly, and even if I want to stop talking about it, I find it very difficult to. I find that when the conversation gets too intense and unpleasant, it's best to press pause and revisit it when I am in a more even mood. This way, it stops me from spiraling out of control and I can maintain some sort of handle on the situation. It's really nice that he's med compliant and phoned his psychiatrist himself as well. A lot of us, unfortunately, are not. It shows he's being being conscious and active in his recovery. This is the #1 thing people with mental illnesses can do in our relationships. Making sure we are as stable as we can be causes us to lash out less and benefits all parties involved. A couple of things to note now: do not stay in this relationship with this man if you would normally walk away. It builds resentment and it never really works out in the long term. However, if you do want to give it a go, I do have some advice. Firstly, I find that people with bipolar disorder often don't have too many friends due to the exact issue you listed above. We can get intense about a lot very quickly and that can come across as crass. People don't like when we lash out at them either, and it becomes very hard for us to apologize for our inappropriate behavior.

There is no going back, and ignoring it will be pretty damaging as it just leads to more of the same. Clearly you guys like one another, so take that as you will.Sticking around and \"just being friends\" while wanting to be with him breeds negative feelings of inadequacy in yourself. For him, it puts him between a rock and a hard place. It's a bad time for everybody involved, and over time will grow painful for you both.Your first step is to back off. It cuts the losses and allows him to focus on his own relationship. Whether he decides to break up with his girlfriend and pursue you or not is up to him. If this is not clear, it means telling him you would like to do this and it would benefit you both to have space. It means not talking to each other or hanging out indefinitely. It sounds like it sucks, but feeling like you are perpetually in the middle of this is awful.Your second step is getting the balls to go after what you want. This is where the unpopular opinion begins. Look, I firmly believe that you cannot \"steal someone\" from someone else. If that person leaves, they leave on their own accord. If they can be \"stolen\" they were never really theirs in the first place. If this is something you would be able to get past as a couple \\(if that happens\\) if you were together, then that's for you to decide. For many, the issue is \"If he did it to her, he will do it to me\". I had a very similar situation as you did. My friend and I dated for a few months but split up for college. The difference is, we only saw one another for about 2 hours every 3 months and always made sure to be appropriate and maintain distance. We did grow closer over time. I never really got over him, but I kept that very internalized. I never acted on it because I knew it was inappropriate. One day, I couldn't handle it anymore and I phoned him \\(while very drunk I will admit\\).

{"dzipeaf": {"text": "Forty seven pounds compared to seventy is a really stark difference. If this German Shepherd is recently adopted, you cannot really be sure of her history. One thing you will need to do is add food slowly. Similar to humans that have been starved for long periods of time, too much food \\(particularly rich food\\) too fast can make them become ill. Furthermore, if she is emaciated, she will likely be wolfing down her food as fast as possible. This is not great as another user mentioned, GSDs are prone to the fatal condition called gastric torsion \\(bloat\\). It would be best for your friend to educate him/herself on the condition and be proactive in preventing it. Basically, they shouldn't be moving around too much before and after their meals. When my dog was younger and really energetic all the time, I'd crate an hour before and an hour after his meals. Another way to help prevent bloat is things to slow down the eating like slow feed bowls. Eating too quickly and being too active afterwards can also cause the dog to vomit up the food \\(very unpleasantly\\). GSDs are prone to every single digestion issue in the book. Mine suffers from IBD and SIBO specifically, but theres also EPI, thyroid issues, standard allergies, etc. I once heard a veterinary nutritionist say \"Oh yes. German Shepherds can eat rocks and somehow turn it in to diarrhea\". This is honestly the truth of it. Then, over long periods of time of diarrhea and undigested food, they end up emaciated. So, aside from slowly reintroducing more amounts of food in safe ways, you're going to want to watch her weight and poops very carefully. The poop is the holy indicator of digestion health. The goal should be a healthy, solidly formed poop. If the dog is producing those, bar any major issues, she should gain weight over time. I would brace your friend to be prepared to make a few vet trips. I know that I had to and it was unpleasant for all parties involved. As far as what you can feed her goes, another user mentioned that the sensitive tummy issues make the standard bulking recipes a little bit risky. Although reading the recipe, they should be fine, I would fly on the better safe than sorry side. First, I'd pick up whatever she was eating at wherever she was adopted from, then I'd transition her to the diet your friend wants her on. From there, I might add canned food as it's good for putting on weight quickly. I would also consider adding cooked white rice. Carbohydrates offer very little nutritional value, but can be very useful in putting on weight \\(thus the amount of carbohydrates in satin balls\\). Rice is generally non offensive and does not really cause GI upsets as it is quite a neutral food. The rules do change if you want to feed a raw diet. That is a great way to put weight on a dog quickly, but requires a large amount of commitment. If this is something you'd be interested in, let me know. I'd be happy to do a write up.

{"dzhu5oh": {"text": "First, in regards to your significant other, I would talk to him. Not tell him to stop seeing those women of course, or that it's his fault or anything, but just talk to him. You'd be surprised at what the person you love laughing and saying \"Babe you're so silly. I love you and your face and I love everything about you\" can do. Talking about your feelings is important! Also, anyone's body having natural longings and urges is natural. What matters if we don't act on them \\(unless consenting by both parties in the relationship of course\\). Otherwise, I'd be worried every time I see Chris Hemsworth on the screen that I'm offending my boyfriend. I like medication, but not everyone does. Seeing a psychiatrist can be really helpful, and seeing a therapist can be great too. As far as what you can do personally: first, always, take care of your mental wellbeing. A lot of people undercount how much depression can effect every single bit of our lives. This is one of those ways. It sends this horrible cascade throughout our lives and makes us feel inadequate. It sucks. Therefore, first and foremost, make sure you are in a good place mentally. Start small, even if it's just getting out of bed to clean that day. So, I'm going to pretend the hobby is rock climbing because it's a little easier to type out when it's given a name. I totally get how depression and mental illness can sort of put a stop to all your hobbies. I also understand your sentiment in being out of practice for rock climbing and feeling a little embarrassed. My boyfriend is actually currently too self conscious to go back to his rock climbing gym because he broke his arm and is out of practice now. I'll tell you what I'd tell him if I did the sport: that is silly and you are dumb, let's go together! If this is something you and your husband do together, by all means. Would he want to give you private time to practice just the two of you? It's a nice couples building exercise and you can get back in to it. Also, you'd be less self conscious. Getting back in to the sport you like and are good at can give you a huge boost in confidence! It feels good to feel like you're making progress and are good at something! As far as this girl... I'm sure she's a great person and very pretty, but your husband married you! He likes you! My boyfriend actually did a lot in helping me build my self confidence. I would sometimes make offhanded comments about how pretty some of the girls he used to date were and he'd laugh. He'd say that I was, by far, the most attractive woman he'd ever been with and loved me very much. I'd blush and tell him he was just in love with me and biased, and then he would go over all of the parts of me that he loved. It made me feel really loved and really beautiful. Over time, it really strengthened both our relationship and my love for myself and my body. Now, specifically for other women and not regarding your husband: women are wonderful! I think the most wonderful thing in the world is women empowering women. We all are so mean to each other and compete for no reason. I compliment random girls on the street when I like their hair or outfit because I know that a compliment can make their day. I want them to feel pretty! I want them to feel great about themselves! I think that jealousy almost always stems from insecurity. Therefore, if you focus inwardly, you will be less concerned with the attributes of other women. These days, I do notice when another girl is cute and I will point her out to my boyfriend. It's kind of just a thing we do now. What do you like about yourself? Work on those. Again, being good at something is a huge confidence booster, but as with all good things, the confidence comes partially from the hard work and grind it takes you to become good at it. For me, I also like to wear a little makeup. It makes me feel pretty! For some people, they like to go to the gym because it makes them feel healthy, pretty, and successful. Love who you are.

I guess I am \"factually pretty\" \\(I'm so fucking sorry this sounds like a humblebrag but this is going somewhere I swear\\), but I honestly normally don't feel that way. It seems like no matter who the person is, I don't think it's common to feel pretty. I could go off on a spewing tangent about media and unrealistic standards, but that's not really relevant. What I'm saying is, I think that even at the end of the day, I don't think Megan Fox looks in the mirror and thinks she is pretty. However, I do think I'm pretty, but not on the outside. I think what makes me pretty is what's on the inside. Correct. I am about to give you the \"what's on the outside isn't what's important. It's what's on the inside\" speech. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. People see the outside first. People are nicer to people they find attractive, and girls that are outwardly pretty get hit on, and told they are gorgeous when they complain ironically on social media. Now I'm going to say that this is actually the most stupid trivial shit. Those girls that post about how they're ugly when they clearly aren't are seeking validation and don't feel pretty like the rest of us. The girls that truly **feel pretty** are the ones that are posting confident photos of themselves being conventionally pretty, but also aren't afraid to get that ugly snapchat screenshoted by their friend and posted on social media as a joke.I started my confidence building on the outside. I started wearing makeup and got really in to it for a while. I liked how it made me look and I liked how it made me feel. I fell in love with the artistry of it all as well. I don't give a shit if anyone is going to tell me I'm shallow for doing so. It changes nothing about who I am. I wore makeup every single day for a while. Then, I started deciding that I wanted to sleep more, and now, I literally only wear makeup to look presentable at work presentations and for special occasions. However, the confidence that I had while wearing makeup every day has stayed. I still think my nose is WAY too big and that I too have linebacker shoulders that can literally not be measured by a rule because they are too big, but I don't really care. I still cringe a little when I accidentally open the front camera on myself on my phone. I still only post instagram photos that I look nice in \\(for the first photo. the second one if you swipe is probably me doing some stupid shit\\). However, all of that aside, I think the key to being confident is not giving a shit and liking who you are.  ", "link_id": "t3_8lop1y", "time": 1527156900}}

It doesn't seem like she cares enough about you or your relationship to commit herself to recovery as much as she needs to. By no means is recovery easy. It's actually really fucking hard. We have to choose it every single day of our lives and we need to work at it continuously. I will be collecting different recovery tools and coping mechanisms until my last day. Smoking recreationally is a pretty big sign. Has she talked to her doctors at all about this? I am sure it's a coping mechanism, but in a lot of ways, it doesn't seem like a good fit for her as she is still clearly symptomatic. In some cases, it can even heighten our mental health challenges. A healthy approach towards recovery would consist of being proactive. Ideally, she would be paying close attention to her moods, monitoring her own personal triggers, working on communication skills with you, working on ways to de\\-escalate the situations, etc. There is no easy path to recovery, and it will always be paved with many obstacles.

However, in this instance, I would not recommend pursuing this route because of the following:\\) I've copied and pasted my thoughts on the matter from my Philosophy page on my blog: &gt;While I promote a great deal of love and understanding, I am vehemently against the \u201clay down and take it\u201d approach. **Do not, on any level, accept abuse from your significant other with bipolar disorder.** It is not acceptable and, after the fact, makes both of you feel horrible. Instead, if it is escalating to this level, excuse yourself from the situation. To what degree depends on the specific situation. On a level of verbal abuse, I always encourage the significant other of the person with bipolar disorder to excuse themselves from the situation and disengage. It is better to talk about it after the other party has calmed down. On a level of physical abuse, excuse yourself from the situation before it gets to this level. Do not engage. On a level of chronic abuse through refusal to recover, I must suggest terminating the relationship. **Caregiver burnout is a very real thing and nobody deserves to be chronically abused even if their significant other is mentally ill.The responsibility of this person\u2019s wellbeing is not on your shoulders. The responsibility of this person\u2019s recovery is on no one\u2019s plate but their own and it is imperative to remember this.**\u00a0You may choose to assist in their recovery journeys and for that, you are an extremely wonderful person and partner, but their path to recovery and stability is for them to choose and find.I hate that this is the reality of things, but I find that often times, many of us don't get better until we hit rock bottom. Your loving and unconditional support of your wife sounds like it's preventing her from hitting that rock bottom similar to the pattern I seen in my own parent's relationship.

I know that no matter the situation, Atlas will love me until the day he crosses the rainbow bridge, and honestly, that cannot be said about any person. No matter what bad stuff I do in life and how many mistakes I will make, he will be there. That means a ton to me as my mental health challenges have led to some pretty bad abandonment issues. For me, Atlas' main contribution to my mental health is his existence. He relies on me and because I love him to pieces, so I work hard for him. He makes me get out of bed every day and he motivates me to be a better person. I go to school each day because I know I have to provide for him one day. He makes me keep my life together because he needs me. I am do very poorly with being alone. My anxiety gives me racing thoughts like many people's do, and it's always nice to have his company. However, Jesus Christ, raising Atlas was the single hardest and most anxiety\\-inducing thing I have ever done in my life \\(and I've been to the emergency room for my anxiety attacks\\).

I was \\(and am\\) responsible for a life, and that is a huge responsibility. I'd wake up in the middle of the night crying because I was so scared.

I don't think backyard is as important as I have my pup in an apartment with me and he is very happy. It does help A LOT with potty training though as the access is easier. The worst thing in the world would probably be getting your dog before those things were set and stone and not being able to make ends meet for him/her.

{"dzfouvi": {"text": "First, I am so happy that you are making progress with your dog! It sounds like you are doing awesome.This sounds like a pretty scary situation for your puppy. He is just a baby and not used to things running up to him yet. He reacted completely incorrectly in the moment and after as well. I can relate to the sentiment of being disheartened by other comments based on prejudice against my dog. I saw in the comments that you own a German Shepherd. Here's the thing. I'm so sorry to tell you this, but the reality it, as the owners of one of \"those breeds\" \\(GSD, Rottie, Pittie, Dobie, etc.\\), we will always receive a certain amount of scrutiny and prejudice against our dogs. It's unfair, but people are afraid, and that's how it is. My dog likes to be little spoon, but people cross the street when they see him. I've had people look horrified and fearful of him at the dog park \\(we don't go anymore\\) when he was only your pups weight and size. He wanted to play, but they cowered and I was heartbroken. Granted, they just saw an adult asshole GSD biting at and bullying my dog, pinning him down, and my dog has that standard GSD look, but it was deeply hurtful. The only thing we can do is try our best to be as good of owners as we can to show them by example. Your dog is 4 1/2 months old. He might currently technically be reactive by terminology, but he is very young and has plenty of time to learn his manner sand conquer his fears. You can do this!Your dog is not vicious. Reactivity is not vicious. It might look scary, but it's not. He's learning about the world, and the breed has the tendency to be wary of the unknown \\(and that's everything right now\\). As long as you continue your socialization and encouraging him, he will be learning and improving. I don't personally like doing places like Petsmart as I find it unpredictable. The recommended thing is always to do \"puppy play dates\", but those can be high commitment and difficult to arrange, leading to a lower frequency overall. I like the park! \\(The regular park, not the dog park\\). There's usually lots of people on walks there with their dogs. The thing to watch our for is naughty off leash dogs with irresponsible owners, which might not be great in your instance. I also like walks through the neighborhood, but my neighborhood is pretty dog populated.Also, I commend you for not minding that it's embarrassing. I can relate to the sentiment, but our pups are always worth it! Mine continues to be embarrassing in a different way to this day. If you continue socializing him and committing to normalization of seeing other dogs, it should subsist with time. I'm still working on not pulling, but at this point, he is pulling towards other dogs and people because he wants to play with them so badly.Unfortunately, having a puppy means a lot of unsolicited judgement and advice. I have no idea why. People just like to do that. It gets worse with the negative stereotypes behind the German Shepherd breed. I used to get really hurt whenever people did stuff like that. I once had someone say \"Don't let him eat him\" when my dog was sniffing a Chihuahua's butt. I got so heated that I nearly yelled at the guy. For reference, he was a huge fully grown man and I am a small young woman. I eventually learned that these were strangers, and there was nothing I could do to change their minds. They were going to continue to be ignorant and they are not worth my breath in explaining.Edit: Also, the jury seems to be split on whether petting your dog while they are scared is a good idea. While I do not think I reinforce his fear and behavior by petting him to calm him down, I also do not do it excessively. I tell him \"Calm down baby it's okay\" and I have seen it decrease his fear and behavior overall. ", "link_id": "t3_8ld7a6", "time": 1527068731}}

Lots of people say having a herding dog is difficult \\(and it is\\), but I think we are so used to putting people off of them that we sometimes dramatize how difficult it is to own one. There are a couple of things I do want to note. You want to dog to protect your family, and I think that is a little bit of an unrealistic expectation/idea people have of dogs. Most dogs look to us humans as a teenager looks at their parent. The dog jumping in front of a stranger to protect their family is actually more unlikely. Many dogs would look to their human in times of crisis. However, usually, a bark is enough to deter undesirables as it draws attention. You cannot expect the dog to be completely calm before your visitors come. A knock on the door usually warrants a bark. However, the expectation that they will be behaved after the visitor enters \\(and maybe greets the dog\\) is very realistic. The Corgi sounds like a pretty good fit for you! I nearly never recommend Border Collies as they tend to be... intense. Personally, I'm enamored with the Border Collie breed \\(as many herding breed enthusiasts are\\), but I would not get one unless I planned to do a dog sport like agility. I have a friend who has one and she is just a neurotic crackpot genius. She opens cabinets to steal treats, and closes them so there's no evidence. She climbs things to jump out of windows. And she never really did nip excitement peeing in the bud. She's a very good girl, but it's a little bit more stress than I am looking for in handling a dog. I'd also personally look at Aussies \\(Smart like BCs, but a little less intense. Tendency to be a little more goofy\\), Sheltie, and Collies.

{"dzfnfvc": {"text": "Jesus Christ. I have a lot of feelings on this topic so here goes: **the fact that you are asking if they can be unnecessarily violent is indicative that they are not the right dog for you.** Many people say that GSDs are bad for first time owners, and very very good reasons. They are prone to neuroticism, they require an unreasonable amount of exercise, they are very sensitive to nearly everything, they are known notoriously for fearfulness that can lead to reactivity and aggression, the list never ends. Furthermore, given GSDs fearful tendencies and the jaws/teeth they come with, a fearful GSD is no fucking joke. I think a large number of GSD owners will say that we are sad to report that most GSDs are poorly trained and that is where the stereotype behind \"unnecessarily violent\" GSDs comes from. That being said, I got a GSD as my first dog. I love him to pieces and I got him despite the warnings because I fucking committed. It was so fucking hard. He had notorious herding breed teething. He was not confident as a puppy \\(insecurity breeds fear\\). He had health issues that were to be expected with GSDs. He was stubborn as all hell and required a lot out of me. Despite the fact that I still had to live my daily life, I went out every single night for 3 months in a row \\(carrying my dog until he got his vaccines\\) to socialize him. I go to school and stopped working at the time to take care of my dog as a puppy. I committed nearly every single hour of the day to my dog for months: training, exercising, researching, etc. It was worth it.

Dominance theory has been debunked, and in this instance, it can be very damaging to subscribe to it. Most dogs bite out of a place of fear, not malice. Fear aggression is amongst the most common types and is rooted in insecurity. Therefore, training should be guided and comfort building while being direct and strict. The balance is really important. My dog was a very insecure puppy that lacked self\\-confidence. In order to prevent fear aggression like this, I did a lot of exercises to build his confidence. However, this dog is already a teen, so it is important to intervene appropriately. Your boyfriend is right in some ways, cattle dogs \\(along with all dogs\\) tend to have rebellious teen phases. However, this isn't a time to give in to the rebelling or challenges. It is a time to double down on training to make sure the behavior does not continue.As of right now, this dog should be considered a liability. If that bite was on anybody that wasn't family, they could have taken your boyfriends family to a court of law and easily won. This dog is dangerous and your boyfriend needs to acknowledge it in order for her to make any real improvement. His lack of doing so and acceptance of her behavior is super alarming and indicates that he is not taking the situation as seriously as he should be.In all honesty, this dog sounds like she requires very serious and very professional intervention. She sounds like she may require intense training that is beyond the scope of what most people can manage in their homes along with their daily lives. This dog sounds like a case that even professionals would have a difficult time with, much less average pedestrians like us and your boyfriend's family.No one should need to live in fear of their dog.

{"dzfi7dn": {"text": "I can understand what your counselor means. I know that my mother and my father has a relationship that is very much like that. I have high suspicions that my father has bipolar disorder and my mother has a personality that is just like yours. He does not intend to be manipulative- he's not nearly devious enough. She simply gives in to his \"craziness\" because she wants to see him happy. I'm not going to armchair diagnose or evaluate his medication. What I will say though is that being on just antidepressants for daily medication has the possibility of inducing mania. I have had peers that have had this experience. Ativan is a great tool (like all benzodiazepines are), but without a full understanding of it, it can really cause lapses in judgement. I take mine for anxiety attacks and I need to be hyper aware of my decisions because I learned from my mistakes. If he is not aware of the extend of the effect, it is something to be noted. Therapy doesn't always work for people. I know that for me, I'm just not a therapy person. I do talk to my dog though, so maybe that counts. However, traditional therapy isn't always effective and that's okay. We all have our own ways. Personal issues in life can also contribute to spirals. Just as a particularly bad day with building stress can lead to sadness, feeling overwhelmed from it can lead me to one bad slip away from depression. For me, this all began with a robbery and was exacerbated by my surroundings. External situations do play a factor. You sound like an incredibly mature and together person. I know that I, and many others, would not have been able to keep their head in this incredibly upsetting situation. God I know that I'd be crying, kicking, and screaming. I am honestly stunned and I commend you. As a person with mental health challenges, I am aware that it takes a profound amount of love, understanding, compassion, and patience to be with one of us. Although these traits can be found in nearly every person, it is often difficult to find someone that has the exorbitant amount of them in their hearts as they are often the best of people (and thus rare). You sound like you were an excellent significant other and support system, and you loved him very much. It is a shame that he ended the relationship this way and have reason to believe that he will grow to regret it deeply. It is very rare that we stumble upon individuals that are full-hearted as you, and for those that we stumble upon, we can only pray that we are lucky enough that they love us back. Damn straight you should be proud. You have handled this with the grace and dignity of a queen. For now, I encourage you do take care of and focus on yourself. Because I'm sure you are tired as hell from hearing that phrase, I have made a list of my favorite break-up tips. * You mentioned you have dogs. Dogs are incredible during a break up. Mine is a snuggly baby and he definitely gets exercised more when I'm distressed. Walks, parks, general time together and such keep my mind off of the break-up and it can be really helpful. * Self love! There is never a bad time for self love. Get your nails done. Get a massage. I do my makeup because it's a fun activity for me and makes me feel pretty. I like doing it because, even on really bad really depressed days, it gives me one good thing that went right. The same logic is super useful during times like this. * If you're in to it: redecorate. In my last relationship, we cohabited much like you and your ex. I ended up moving not long thereafter and the change of location really helped me out a lot. You'd be stunned how much meaning a place can hold even though it's just a place. Redecorating it can transform it in to a new feeling. * Swimming is a weirdly specific one. I think it's really nice that the water sort of makes it sound like the world is on mute and at peace. If you like the water, it's something to consider. * Lastly, and always most importantly, know your worth. I cannot say enough how kind and compassionate of a person you sound. I am so very sorry that this has happened to you and although you have come across as very put-together in your writing, I am certain that you are going through an incredible amount of grief. To mourn the loss of a relationship over something like this is different from what most breakups are like. At once, it is difficult to completely blame him as he is clearly ill, but also there's nothing really to rationalize with. It just sort of... is, and that can be incredibly disarming.

{"dzfe3pl": {"text": "Jesus Christ. This must be a nightmare for you. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna take this post apart one point at a time to try to get it all in here. For starters, I think I can sympathize with what he is going through. Less than a year after I got diagnosed, I also went through a very very similar episode. It was a nightmare and excruciatingly hard for me and my loved ones. I will preface this by saying that I am still happily dating the man who, in my story, would be the equivalent of the woman who had the bike incident in your story. However, my previous relationship \\(in this parallel example your relationship with your boyfriend\\) was not happy and I had expressed this. I confirmed with my close friends after the fact that this was not just in hindsight, but I also said similar things during the relationship. I warn you of this to say that our circumstances are quite similar, but distinctly different in that way as to not scare you about what might or might not happen. Disclaimer: no where in this post am I going to claim to be a good person. I have made a lot of mistakes, and many of them have been fueled by my bipolar disorder, but this doesn't justify any of them. I am not proud of the people I have hurt and I am not proud of many of the things I have done. However, my partner and I have found loving and accepting ways to move past my transgressions and for that I am endlessly grateful. It required a great deal of love, understanding, and compassion. In my ramblings, I will be referring to my current significant other as C, and my previous significant other as K. First, who is this person he reconnected with? Have they truly been out of contact for multiple years? Have they been long\\-distance friends? What is the context of their relationship? Context here matters a great deal. The reason I spun out with C when I was with K at the time was because C and I remained friends and were in regular contact. Furthermore, I think to a high degree, I never got over C. I was extremely above board with this. K knew it and my friends knew it so it was a surprise to my peers when C and I reconnected, but not completely out of the blue. Have there been any signs at all? K broke up with me \\(after two years\\) over my unresolved feelings for C combined with a buildup of other issues. \\(Again, I never claimed to be a good person. I have a lot of regret here and I did not know any better.\\) However, he still loved and cared for me very much and I cared for him, which complicated things. We shared a dog, so K was still around &amp; C was long distance. Then, I had a disastrous episode brought on by grief over my dog and a robbery combined with benzodiazepine usage before I had a full grasp of the effects of them. During this transgression, I called C in a daze and terminated the relationship hastily, and K and I were intimate and I was unsure as to what it meant for me and C. I regret this action deeply. At the time, my judgement was impaired by substances that I had been prescribed and again, did not  understand the limitation of inhibition and judgement they would have. From that point on, I begun spiraling. Instead of immediately realizing it was a drug induced episode, I begun to question my nature. I thought that maybe I loved and cared for them both \\(wrong\\) and maybe that's what I wanted to do. I will say this again: I am not proud of this next part. I was talking to them both and seeing them both to a degree \\(C was long distance\\), but I was always extremely above\\-board with both of them. They knew about the other and it was, in effect, an open\\-relationship on all ends. To me, I thought \"wow i never do this, but I guess this is who I am now\". The action of me being so rash and terminating my relationship with C to sleep with K despite the fact that I cared about C deeply and knew I wanted to be with him long term was something that I never really understood. I'm not a person that usually gives in to my impulses. I had been in love with C for many years prior and finally we were together, and it just wasn't like me to do what I did. Doesn't that sound like mania? Again, mania does not excuse any of my actions and I have since then regained my footing and a great amount of stability for the sake of both myself and my relationship. You're going to have to think really hard. You've known this man for six years. You know him and you have to trust that. Is he like this? Is this something that he would do? Try not to be biased, and consider his behavior outside of your relationship. Is he a rash person? Does he make spur of the moment decisions? Very importantly: Has he been put on any new medication?This was the very beginning to my first psychotic break. As I stated before, I \"knew it wasn't like me\" but thought \"I guess this is the new me\". In retrospect, the signs were clear and I should have noticed them. However, I had been diagnosed less than a year ago and was not yet familiar with how... nuts things could get. I had never been in an individual situation that stressed before \\(due to outside occurrences\\) and it was my first episode on medication \\(which can totally effect things\\). I have a lot of regret and I have learned better, but he might not be there yet. Unfortunately, infidelity is more common than it should be \\(it shouldn't be common at all, but that's another thing\\) in relationships with bipolar disorder. It often stems from the issue of hyper\\-sexuality and lack of control. It can totally be managed. I am not saying that people who have bipolar disorder are chronic cheaters and should never be trusted. God no. What I'm saying is that we face a different set of temptations and must know how to regard them. The same things can be regarded with romantic feelings \\(albeit less common than hyper\\-sexuality\\) as it might be what his mania is \"on\\-a\\-roll\" with right now. Moving forward, I'd like to begin by saying this: your ex\\-boyfriend is quite ill and not in his right state of mind and should be treated that way. This does not excuse any of his behavior and this does not minimize any of your feelings, because all of that is real and all of that has happened. It only serves as an explanation with how his actions should be regarded moving forward. Although he can and should be held responsible for his actions, there is a certain level of understanding that will benefit this situation by knowing that mania can cause erratic behavior like this. I'd like to begin by to saying: you, under no circumstance, should feel inclined to stay with this man. It does not matter if he is ill. At the end of the day, this entire situation has hurt you very deeply and I cannot imagine what you are going through. You are not responsible for him \"getting better\" and that is something that is very important to know. If you should not feel obligated to accept this situation due to the illness. If you believe that your relationship can never and will never recover from this incident, I encourage you to permanently terminate the relationship due to the betterment of you both long term. I will now begin by suggesting what you should do moving forward *if you choose to pursue a relationship with this person.* If you choose to pursue a relationship with this person, it is very important that you understand bipolar disorder is currently considered chronic. I hope that one day, there will be a cure, but as of right now, there is not one. This does not mean that he will behave like this periodically for the remainder of his life \\(although it may\\), it simply means that this is something that he, and his life partner that he chooses, will be regarding for the remainder of their lives. What if very important right now is maintaining a safe and comfortable distance for you both. Although I know that in this situation, there is likely no way that you will feel comfortable, we can only try our best. Since you have elected to pursue a relationship with this person, it is imperative to know that no real work can be done in the relationship until the mania ends and he subsides. Until that happens, I advocate loving from a distance. This means respecting one anothers space while simultaneously letting the other know that they are loved and cared for and you think you can work this out. This can mean anything from sleeping on the couch that night to moving out to sending flowers at work. It really depends on the person. The goal here is to establish a supportive presence as if you disappear entirely from his life, in my experience, I have a tendency to cut out people that do so. It justifies the reality that mania has conjured and I roll with it. Do this at your own discretion and always put your own health and wellbeing first. After this is over, and it will end, you will need to have a calm and safe discussion about what to do moving forward. There should be a review of the events that occurred, sharing of your feelings with positive language and not accusations, apologies, and plans. If the discussion gets too emotional and heated, it should be tabled for another time. Moving forward from here, the most crucial point of all is that he turns himself towards recovery for the betterment of you both. He should feel guilt for the situation and he should know that he has hurt the person he loves. He should understand that he needs to try his best to get better and prevent this from ever happening again. This usually means being med compliant but not always. Then, the both of you will  have to commit yourself to your relationship. This sounds really silly and obvious, but things don't work if only one person/no person is trying. Both people need to 100&amp;#37; believe in repairing the relationship and working together as a team. I am a huge huge huge fan of couples counseling. I have an entire blog on love and bipolarity that can be found [here](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/) that discusses tools, philosophies, and tips that I have found work for my relationship. Most of it can be applied to any mental health challenged relationship, or any relationship in general. I find that a lot of this really is understanding and kind communication. I highly recommend, in deciding if you wish to pursue the relationship further to read [this one](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/2018/05/21/accountability-in-apologies-identifying-whether-or-not-your-significant-other-with-bipolar-is-an-asshole/) and if you do choose to pursue the relationship, I highly recommend reading this one on[ \"I understand your feelings\" language. ](https://bipolarityinlove.wordpress.com/2018/05/21/i-understand-your-feelings-starting-a-conversation-during-an-episode/)I know it can be so hard. Believe me, I am so endlessly grateful to C for being the wonderful partner he is. It's been a long strange road to get here, but love with bipolar is possible. It just requires commitment, love, and understanding from both sides. Under no circumstance should you feel compelled to stay with this person because you'd be a \"bad person for leaving them while sick\". Always care for yourself, and whether or not you decide to pursue the relationship, I wish you the best of luck ", "link_id": "t3_8leqqz", "time": 1527048617}}

Littermate syndrome does not apply to just littermates. It applies to any two dogs of similar ages as they will bond more closely with one another than their humans leading to not listening very well and general disobedience. In order to prevent this and err on the side of caution, it would be best to effectively raise two dogs completely separately in the same home having your wife raise one and you raise the other. It includes crating in different rooms, training in different sessions, separate walks, etc. It's unrealistic and exhausting for two parties as it is effectively like each of you raising a dog alone. This also eliminates the point of having them tire one another out as their most rambunctious period in life is puppyhood. While it would be safe to introduce them back to one another as adults, that is in multiple years, and their energy levels would have been down by then. It they were both adults, 1500 is small but workable as long as they were both low energy if you tried really hard. I would still prefer something bigger though. However, if you were to separate two puppies completely separately, maybe not. Raising one puppy is fucking exhausting. I couldn't imagine raising two at once.

Although always worth it, it's probably the most stressful thing I've ever done in my life and that's including when I was in the emergency room with an anxiety attack. I think my personal most frustrating thing was the puppy mouthing. Herding breeds have the reputation of be notoriously mouthy and dear god it is true. I was around for another puppy's rearing and this breed is typically considered pretty mouthy \\(Bernese Mountain Dog\\) and it was nothing compared to what hell Atlas unleashed on my ankles. I was actually bleeding regularly. It wasn't as if he was separated from his litter early and lacked early socialization, he was just fucking mouthy. That, combined with the lack of sleep that comes with puppyhood, was extremely demoralizing and draining for me in addition to being painful. He also did not respond to normal levels of yelping. Just a yelp wasn't good enough. I had to scream like I was dying, do a very dramatic reenactment of pain, and walk away to ignore &amp; face the wall so he got the message. It sounds dramatic and funny, but he was so mouthy that I was doing this continuously. I am not even exaggerating. It was constant. It got old real fast. This isn't even to mention that whenever he got too excited, he'd mouth my hands during play. Good god I am so happy he's not a puppy anymore. On the bright side, it was completely worth it. It nipped mouthing in the bud as a small puppy and he didn't even mouth me when he was teething. I was pretty proud of myself when that time came around. These days, he knows how to appropriately mouth during play and I wrestle with him with my feet while I lay down. It's nice and I trust him a lot with his teeth. So, in this regard, I wouldn't do anything differently I don't think! I'm really proud of this aspect of my puppy training. There are obviously other things that I would change as I am not perfect, but I'm happy with this. ", "link_id": "t3_8lc38s", "time": 1527018839}}

I know that Atlas would be miserable outside. Therefore, to take care of him the best I can and maximize his happiness, I want him inside with me. Other people who have outdoor dogs take a different approach. However, to me personally, I do not understand the appeal of getting a dog if they were going to be outdoor dogs.

I have totally been in a relationship like the situation you listed. Albeit, a lot of people go through this worry I think, even those without anxiety. However, anxiety does exacerbate the situation and worry \\(like it does with everything\\). In my many years of being with my lovely significant other, I have never questioned my love for him. To me, it's simply a fact that I love him. It's a simple truth like the sky is blue and the earth is round. It just is my reality. I do not need to justify and I do not need to rationalize. \\(I know, this was foreign to me because of my chronic anxiety as well.\\) When I see him, it is a soothing presence that actually makes my anxiety levels go down. I do love him quite a great deal. All of that being said, it seems like there is a lapse here in your communication that is preventing your relationship from reaching it's full potential. \\(I sound like a self\\-help book. Please forgive me.\\) For me, my anxiety issues \\(and other mental health challenges\\) are such a huge part of my life that it would feel sort of disingenuous not to share them with my partner. Although I would not bring it up to a new partner immediately, you two have been together for several years and I would have absolutely told them at this point. To me, communication is the most important part of any relationship. It is what all partnerships are built on. It is how we let our significant others know how we are feeling! My boyfriend and I talk about everything. Hell, after sex, we have review sessions to discuss what we liked and disliked so that we can be continuously improving. It's a super exaggerated example, but yeah. I would talk to him about these feelings that you are having! I would explain your anxiety and how it effects you and what he can do to address it. I know that, for me, it is really helpful for my signifiant other to reaffirm me. It often involves him repeating the same things a few times if I need to hear them a few times. It's nice and I appreciate how patient he is. The communication and support her provides me has made him a huge asset in my recovery \\(opposite of being the source of my anxiety\\).

{"dze3vq7": {"text": "Good god I\u2019d be so scared. You were not wrong I\u2019m going to the police. Always err on the side of caution especially when it comes to your safety. I will go ahead and say it: this man exhibits tell tale signs of sociopathy. One of my least favorite things is armchair accusations and preventive diagnosing from people that are not qualified, but in this instance, I feel it is important to note the gravity of the instability. I work in the field reducing stigma, so this is sort of against what I\u2019m *supposed to* say because the vast majority of mentally ill individuals are not dangerous, but I know every single person I work with would say that this is a huge red flag of instability and lack of wellness and he should be regarded as possibly dangerous for the sake of your own safety. ~~I would possibly begin by contacting the wedding couple and trying to retrieve a real name of this man. He is harassing you and it is for your safety. As women, we are made to feel bad for rejecting men. This can be illustrated in how you were being polite despite the fact that he was acting like, quite literally, a stalker. You owe this man nothing (I\u2019m sure you know) fuck being polite.~~ you did not know the couple never mind Now, the things I\u2019m about to suggest might sound dramatic, but I really don\u2019t think anything is too dramatic when it comes to your possible safety. Do you live alone? If so, maybe tell a friend what happened and have them check in daily with you at a given time. That way, someone will be alert. If you have an iPhone, there\u2019s a find friends App that comes with the phone that broadcasts your GPS location to your friends who you approve. My best friend has my location so if something were to happen to me, she\u2019s able to contact the authorities with a location. I\u2019m sure other smartphone companies have an equivalent. Again this might seem dramatic, but honestly, just like multiple others have mentioned Facebook, you would be amazed (and horrified) to find how easy it is to access information online. Public data bases keep names of colleges we attended, jobs we\u2019ve worked, and people we know. You just need to know where to look (and that\u2019s fucking horrifying). Looking at you NSA. I\u2019m sorry, I kind of sound like a crackpot, but I once had a friend that went of a creepy date and it turned out the man was terminated from the line of work as a nurse because he abused an old lady. So, I obsessively google anyone I meet now because I\u2019m paranoid and such. Do you have pepper spray? It\u2019s a great thing to have and readily available. I also have a [Brutus Bulldog Keychain](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bulldog-Self-Defense-Keychain-in-Black/192873474). It\u2019s cute (I think so) and doesn\u2019t really look like a weapon, but the ears are distanced apart to be roughly the distance of an average persons eyes. There\u2019s also a cat variant for kitty lovers! For work, I\u2019d have someone walk you back to your car for the next week or so. It\u2019s a small gesture out of their day and it would make me feel a lot safer. Also, always check your surroundings before exiting your vehicle. In hearing about situations like these, I\u2019m always really thankful for my dog. He\u2019s a sweetie but he looks big and scary so men don\u2019t bother me and I feel very safe at home. It does kind of irk me that I need him to feel safe, but that\u2019s the world we live in. I\u2019m not saying \u201cget a dog\u201d, that\u2019s a huge commitment. However, I suggest every woman take basic self defense classes as a precaution. Again, I\u2019m sorry if this all sounds dramatic, but I\u2019m a pretty dramatic person. \u201cBetter safe than sorry\u201d is something I live by, and when it comes to my life, it\u2019s not something I am willing to mess around with. It is fucking appalling that society has validated men that this behavior is okay. The most recent tragedy in Santa Fe was because a girl rejected the guy. This isn\u2019t to mention the bus in New York or the shooting in Santa Barbara. It really illustrates we need change. There is a shocking and extremely terrifying sect of people who share this ideology that are surfacing (incels) and although it makes me cringe, it fucking makes me scared. I\u2019m studying sociology in school (graduating in less than a month!!!) and I read about a scary amount of incidents like this and it\u2019s horrifying how deeply this runs, how embedded this is in our society, and how we constantly validate and allow it. This is so much more common than we think and can honestly happen to anybody, as women, I think it is important that we keep ourselves safe.

There are actually apps that utilize wifi for texting under a different number that looks like a real phone number. It\u2019s free and really great! ", "link_id": "t3_8l7nvm", "time": 1527003835}}

My dog is not afraid to correct another dog if they're invading his space. I trust him to correct appropriately and he has never hurt another dog. Yet, I still worry that other dog owners are going to get upset. I think what did the last straw for me was the children. I've had a \\~8 year old girl fall down next to my dog. He didn't trip or anything, she was simply a child and fell down. She was belly up and my dog thought she wanted to wrestle. He wasn't going to hurt her, but the sheer terror that comes with someone seeing a German Shepherd standing over an 8 year old girl is not great. I knew it wasn't Atlas' fault and he was behaving like a dog, but I was compelled to apologize to the mother anyways due to the situation. I was fortunate that she was reasonable, but the situation could have easily escalated. In another instance, a small \\~5 year old girl decided to blindside my dog and embrace him while he was full blown wrestling with another dog. The fact of the matter is, regardless of the fact that it is a dog park and that the children were acting inappropriately, if one of these parents decided to take me to court if something as small as an accidental scratch were to happen, I would have a very hard time defending my dog. Honestly, after those incidents, it just wasn't worth it. I just don't really trust people. If I want my dog to get the engagement of playing with other dogs, I prefer to take him to day care.

Bipolar disorder is considered one of these \"severe mental illnesses\" so when I got it, it felt like I got a \"big girl diagnosis\". Somehow it felt like I was even \"crazier\" than before. I really hope within the next few years, we see a change in this attitude. That sounds like an incredible point to bring up at your next appointment.

{"dz9rc0v": {"text": "Out of the breeds you listed, the only one I would consider is the Dane. * Corgis are, at heart, herding breeds. That means they have the asshole herding breed exercise requirements, the asshole herding breed desire to herd kids \\(and cats\\), and the asshole herding breed attitude. I say this from a truly loving place of a herding breed owner and lover. I always joke and say herding breeds are for people that hate themselves. They seem to be an okay fit for everything else you listed, but particularly during puppyhood, Corgis tend to be rather mouthy, which can be not super great for kids. * You are right in saying that Chows are cat personalities in dog bodies \\(typically\\). However, the important thing to note is that the personality is, in fat, in a 50\\-70 pound body. They can be rather bull\\-headed and not the easiest to train and have rather protective instincts. There is also a stigma behind chows being aggressive, but I own a GSD and think the same stereotype behind my dog is hurtful and incorrect. These dogs are typically not great for first time owners. * Malamutes are assholes. I love them, don't get me wrong, but Jesus. They are also cat\\-dogs. They are bull\\-headed, will challenge you at every step, and are always too smart for their own good. They need lots of exercise, and the biggest deterrent of all for you is that they have rather high prey drive. This is a warning flag found in many spitz breeds. They are not recommended for first time owner due to the stubbornness and intelligence of the breed. * Great Danes are great creatures! One thing I will note though is that they can be rather slobbery. They are these huge lovers and typically get along great with children which is a plus. They're sweeties that love to please and have moderate prey drive. I feel as if a Dane would absolutely be worth considering for your family as long as you are all welcome to managing the sheer size of him/her and the inevitable \"you have a horse for a dog\" jokes. Now on to other dogs! * Retrievers are all around incredible dogs. I am sure you don't need me to tell you how incredibly friendly they are. They're typically easy to train and eager to please as all hell and have moderate prey drive. They're also good running mates. * Chinooks seem to fit your bill, but I am not well versed in the breed so I would definitely get a second opinion. * There are few situations where I wouldn't recommend a Poodles. Poodles are fabulous dogs that fit in to a family dynamic incredibly. They have prey drive on the lower end and are smart and eager to please along with being friendly. They also make nice running mates. It is a little bit difficult to nail down a dog breed to recommend because of the narrow requirements. That's not your fault or anything, but all dog breeds have their shortcomings, ya know? Because you have small children, I'd steer away from herding breeds as they are known to herd and nip at them. Because you hate kitties, I'd steer away from breeds with higher prey drive because... well yeah. This tends to knock out terriers and quite a few herding breeds. The desire to have a larger dog does make this a little bit more difficult as well. Companion dogs tend to have lower prey drives and low herding instinct due to them being bred for companionship. However, these dogs tend to be on the smaller side. The thing is, I really hate using language like this because I feel like it strongly generalizes dogs down to their breeds. At the end of the day, each pup is an individual, but I understand wanting to maximize the chances of a dog that has minimal kinks to work out. ", "link_id": "t3_8kmez7", "time": 1526792358}}
{"dz9lkhg": {"text": "There is a lot going on in this post, so I'm going to try my best to hit it all. I'll start with how your wife is likely feeling so that you may get a better picture of what's going on with her. Getting a new diagnosis is really scary. It makes us call in to question everything we thought we knew about ourselves. The societal stigma around mental illness is very minimal compared to the internalized stigma. Many of us struggle greatly to come to terms with our diagnosis and that can manifest in many ways. A very common way is rebelling against medication or some forms of denial. To some degree, I think we may do this to attempt to cling to our old identities that we think is slipping away. Much of the time, we question where we end and where the illness begins and we often question our life choices and reflect on our entire histories. It's an incredible amount to take in and your wife is in a very delicate place. Furthermore, if this is your wife's first encounter with medication, she is likely experiencing what I call \"the orange pill bottle moment\". It is really really hard seeing your name in bold print on an orange pill bottle with a psychiatric medicine beneath it. Underneath that, there are tons of instructions and a very large amount of warning labels. Due to the stigma fueled behind mental illness, a pill bottle with mood stabilizers in it makes us \"crazy\" whereas a pill bottle with vidicon in it just makes the person that needs it in pain. It's a great deal to internalize and can make us feel bad. I know that \"bad\" is probably the least descriptive word that I could choose, but I don't really have the proper diction to describe how horrible it is. Unfortunately, addiction and alcoholism is a very common issue amongst those with mental health challenges, bipolar in particular. It is absolutely a form of self medication and, in many ways, it feels a lot more \"acceptable\" than our prescribed medicines because we can get alcohol from the store and the general populace does drink. However, I am certain your wife knows that she should not be drinking, but as we can only imagine, it is a very slippery slope. There is also an extremely problem amongst those suffering from bipolar disorder that we get stable on them, and for some reason convince ourselves that we don't need them and go off of them. I'm not really sure why we do this, but it's something that I have seen a lot. Your wife was just diagnosed recently, and this is likely very new for her. In regards to her behavior, it sounds like she's having an episode. No one can really say except for her doctors of course, but her erratic behavior and irritability does resonate with me. I really feel bad when I get this way to those around me. Luckily, my significant other and I have developed unique ways to communicate. I know that when I am having an episode, my feelings are heightened. I am irritable because everything in the world is moving too slowly for me. I am moving at 100 mph and everyone else is going at 50 and I cannot, for the life of me, understand why it is they're moving so slowly. It's frustrating. I snap easily and my already short fuse gets shorter. I get uncomfortable easily because I feel like I have all this energy to expend. My mind races at a million miles per minute and it's truly something else. One way that I explain this best to NT's is that cocaine aims to emulate mania. If you've ever seen a person coked out, it's a very shitty version of what our brains produce. I'm sorry if we're irritable and I'm sorry if we get to be a handful during that time. I know we can really be a lot, but please try to be understanding. It's not easy. I'm not quite sure what exactly set this situation off, but the fact of the matter is, to your wife, you are not safe right now. She does not want to see you. You need to respect that. Dear god I know that can be fucking hard. I cannot imagine how much your world is spinning right now, but if you push her, it does not leave room for her to reach the conclusion herself. I know that this is an incredible amount to ask, but I recommend you approach this with as much love and understanding as you have in your heart. Collaborate with her parents. There is a very fine line that needs to be walked between being there to support her and not overstepping your bounds. I know that you are very new to this and it seems impossible at this time, but I promise it gets easier. This is a very important point: Just because she is having an episode and her state of mind is altered, this does not mean her feelings are not real or that they are not valid. There is nothing more hurtful than having your feelings invalidated by the person you love. You and your wife have been together for 10 years now. I'm sure you love one another very much. Right now, that might not be the case for her, and that is something you are going to have to respect. It is a hard reality, but this version of her is not any less \"real\" than the wife you know. Thus, just as you would treat your wife with respect to her feelings if she was in the right state of mind, I ask you to do the same while she is like this. Give her space respectfully, but make it known that you love her and are there to support her. I am going to list several examples that would work for me personally, but I do not know your wife and I cannot say whether or not they will work for her. You do know her though, so you will be able to make the best call. For me, if I say \"I do not want to see you\", my significant other will ask me to look in to his eyes ask me if that's what I really want again. If I realize that's not what I really want, then I will begin crying and we will talk about it. However, sometimes, I really do need space. The last episode I had, I was feeling particularly suffocated by his love. This is absolutely not how I normally feel, but it's how I felt at the moment. He was visiting for the weekend and staying with me in my apartment. I expressed these feelings to him and he simply said \"Okay love, I'm gonna sleep on the couch tonight and give you your space okay? Just let me know.\" The next night, he was back in bed with me and we were okay. The fact that he gave me that space and showed that he respected me and supported me meant a lot to me. He didn't leave town \\(even though he had every right to\\) because he understood. I recognize that this is a lot to ask. I am endlessly grateful for him and I express that every single day. If I were in her situation, I wouldn't really want to feel pressured to contact you. I am unsure of how close you are to your in\\-laws home, but bringing her \\(and her family of course\\) her favorite coffee in the morning and just handing it to your in\\-laws to have them tell her \"oh your husband got this for you\" with no pressure and no ulterior motive other than to make her feel loved would be wonderful. Bringing her a few of her favorite things from home to let her know you're thinking of her is good too. I would also like handwritten notes \\(not very long!\\) because they do not have the pressure of replying like text messages, internet messages do. A quick, \"I hope you're feeling better. I love you and support you always.\" would be nice. Again, to some people, they might think \"wow that seems like a lot to do for someone that isn't grateful\" or something. The thing is, I promise, I am so fucking grateful. I truly truly am. I am ill and that means, in some situations, I need special care and a little bit more love. I am extremely fortunate that my significant other provides that for me. Now, I'd like to discuss the dog. I am unsure of your wife and her relationship with your dog. I know you have said that the dog is her lifeline and she hasn't asked, but it isn't quite enough detail for me to gauge it. I know that I rely very heavily on my dog. He is probably the number one stabilizing element in my life because I love him to pieces and I know that I have to hold my shit together for him. The fact that he's physically next to me helps a lot. I don't know if that is your wife's relationship with the dog, and if it is, she may benefit from being near him/her. However, I have a very high level of dependency on my dog that even most people with mental health challenges do not reach. It is possible that the dog would be a little bit too much responsibility for her right now and she wants to focus on her other manic things. In this instance, I'm sure a few photos and an update on how he's doing would be appreciate nonetheless. After this ends, and the episode will end, I highly highly highly encourage couples therapy. I know that you two have been together for a decade, but dealing with a mental illness is a whole new beast. My significant other and I have had seven years to get it right and we are still working on it. There will need to be a great deal of communication, love, and new understanding. I am a fan of psychiatric\\-safe\\-words to basically say \"Look I'm not running away from this situation, but I cannot handle you/this right now. I need to stop so we can revisit later\" I am also a huge fan of sitting down after the fact and reviewing the episode. We go over what happened, we go over how one another felt \\(using non\\-accusatory language. Not: you hurt me. Yes: I feel like you hurt me\\) and informing one another how we would better like the other to handle the situation in the future. I have a lot of thoughts on the matter and these are only a part of them. You sound like a very genuine and loving husband. It shows a ton that you are not worried about what your friends think and only her right now. You are completely and utterly right. Those relationships can be mended later and public image should be much less important than your relationship with your wife. It is really shocking how many individuals react otherwise. I know that you are going through so fucking much right now. I can't imagine what it's like being on the other end of this. For now, help her feel loved from a distance and let her know you are there. If you are feeling lonely, you and your dog are in this together. I love animals, and my pup has always made me feel less alone. I recommend academic research about bipolar disorder. I do not recommend WebMD. Reading a couple of journals about relationships and symptoms and such can be helpful. I always like to be informed. Also, when your wife is ready to come home, I highly highly recommend having flowers, a bath bomb, and a huge amount of love waiting. After these episodes, I am always really really fucking guilty and feel worthless. I feel like I hurt the person I love most in the world. I feel like utter crap and I feel undeserving. My signifiant other always finds ways to make me feel loved and that is, above all, the most important thing. ", "link_id": "t3_8kp6ld", "time": 1526784064}}

I encourage you to talk to her about your feelings when she is stable. I think all relationships benefit from communication, and those in relationships with those with mental health challenges benefit especially. When communicating, it is best to try to use neutral language as opposed to accusatory language. Instead of \"what you said hurt me\", say \"I feel like what you said hurt me\". This can be very helpful in facilitating a calm discussion. Also, ask her \\(again when she is stable\\) about how she would like you to handle the situation next time.

{"dz8cfi5": {"text": "You sound like a fabulous match for a Berner. They tend to be rather large though, which is not always ideal for renting. My SO's family has a rather small female \\(albeit she is rather young at about a year\\) who is roughly 80 pounds. I'm a herding breed girl at heart, but Bernese Mountain Dogs are amongst my favorite dog breeds. They are easily biddable and generally friendly dogs. I have also seen several Berners act as excellent therapy dogs. However, out of the three Berners their family has had, one of them has been a particularly slobbery dog. That being said, the Berner breed does come with several worries. The first is their massive size which means training needs to be quite strict \\(jumping is a definite no no and can cause a large amount of damage\\). The second, and one that I am personally most concerned about, is the huge amount of health issues in the breed and short life span. These are things to consider very very carefully in choosing a Berner. Other than that and the renting issue, I think Berners are amongst the best dogs and they seem to fit your bill. Now, I personally own a GSD and you mentioned that you were interested, so I will also comment on that. GSDs are going to make renting a place &amp; renters insurance a living nightmare. My GSD doubles as my psychiatric ESA \\(yes I see someone and it's sanctioned and all else\\) and is permitted to stay with me in my apartment, but it does not stop renters insurance from being a bitch and a half to pay for. As far as aggression and separation anxiety, the breed is prone to both so that is something to look in to. Also, you said you don't mind \"some shedding\" but you said you grew up with GSDs. The breed is nicknamed German Shedders, but I'm sure you are familiar with the amount of coat blow. A teenage GSD may need more exercise than the things you listed, but will likely be okay with what you listed as an adult. However, similar to Berners, GSDs face the plight of being extraordinarily sickly. The breed pool is so huge and there are a lot of diseases just rampant. Many of them are digestive and there are other ones where the entire breed is just a bit high strung and neurotic. This makes them not a great choice for therapy work. If therapy work is something you are very much interested in and would like to keep that potential open, I recommend the Bernese Mountain Dog. Based on your list, the following breeds sound like they could be good for consideration: Golden Retriever, Poodle, Corgi \\(if you are okay looking in to something smaller\\)  ", "link_id": "t3_8keg4z", "time": 1526726797}}

There are all of these rules: * Do you want to feed BARF or PREY? That means either religiously follow 70/10/5/5/10 or 80/10/5/5 * Are you prepared for the cannon butt during transition * Are you prepared to find things like pancreas, brains, liver, kidneys, etc? * Are you aware of what kind of chewer your dog is and the proper way to safely allow him/her to eat bone? * Did you know Heart/Lungs/Gizzards/several other can be fed as muscle meat but not more than 15&amp;#37; of total diet * Do you have time each day to get it all together if you're going to prepare it with a calculator, a scale, etc? * Do you have an extra freezer? that's almost the only way to keep this affordable because the fridge freezer is often not large enough. * Are you prepared for the germs? I don't say this to discourage you. I just know there is SO much misconception about raw diets out there. It takes A LOT of work. I remember two months ago, I spent about a week straight prepping the school quarter's worth of food. I had 300 pounds of raw meat defrosting in my bathtub and I was dissembling an entire duck. Last week, I handled a stillborn rabbit. That being said, a raw diet saved my dogs life. He has special dietary needs due to medical conditions and it is the only thing I have found that he can safely eat without having cannon butt and getting no nutrients. A lot of these questions get resolved by the companies if you want to do pre\\-packed raw food. However, there are also things that come with that. A word of warning, you want the food to say \"balanced\" or \"complete\" there are a lot of pre packed raw foods that are not completely balanced and do not provide all the nutrition your dogs need. Most notably, many of them are missing either bone or organs. Also, it plays in to a difficult aspect of when you are boarding your dog or traveling. I have accepted this part, but it really is something to think about. Commercial raw diets also tend to be quite expensive. DIY is significantly cheaper and I can feed my 80 pound dog for roughly $130 a month, which is about the price of two bags of premium kibble. With pre\\-made raw, at best it would cost me $150 and I would be limited to only one protein, which is not as optimal.

We are in a LDR so, to some degree, we are forced to be independent and rely on ourselves. We provide one another emotional support, and I once called a wellness check via 911 on him due to his own safety. When one of us is having a particularly hard time, we call one another because we know how to make one another feel better. I like hearing his voice. He's my person to hash things out with. I am usually the one who calls him, but he doesn't mind. During my psychotic break, he tried not to do anything *for* me, but instead tried to remind me and walk me through doing it myself. He would talk to my mother *while I was sitting by of course* for me sometimes because my mother is a huge trigger for episodes for me and I tend to get very emotionally charged and lose control easily while speaking to hear. However, we would discuss what I wanted him to go over and I would be present for the conversation.

However, it seems like they might be rather co\\-dependent which is \\(imo\\) not always super great. It makes it so when someone leaves the herd \\(like your boyfriend\\) they are not as equipped to handle situations alone. I would find a way to communicate these concerns with your boyfriend in a positive way.

In order to recover, we need to choose it ourselves. in most cases, recovery does not just happen to us, we need to actively choose it and work on it. It's a lot of work. In your boyfriend's case, his family would have likely superimposed the recovery on to him which means he might not have learned the independence in this aspect. In my opinion, that independence is so important. It fuels what I do every day. It fuels my recovery and drive to improve. I find that a lot of that comes from addressing my relationship with my illness. Not to plug my own mixtape, but [this](https://www.reddit.com/ is a writeup I did on addressing my relationship with my illness, myself, and the future. You cannot really make him want to recover, he has to choose it himself and I'm sorry about that because it's gonna be rough. Not finding a therapist/counselor might have deeper implications going back to his relationship with bipolar. This is going to be really tough to hear, but it seems like he has never hit rock bottom before. A lot of us realize we want to get better when we really hit rock bottom because of our disorder. Rock bottom is different for everybody, but in a lot of ways, he knows he can leave the hospital because you will keep taking care of him. ", "link_id": "t3_8khqhq", "time": 1526705943}}

People that are mentally ill can be fucking assholes. In this case, pardon my french, but he is being a mentally ill asshole. Look, I get it. I've known my boyfriend for 7 years. Although we haven't been together this whole time, people often think we are married and we go on trips together. It is a similar boat as you. We don't live together as we are LDR but we are very much entertained in one anothers lives. We have planned an entire future together and consult each other when making major life decisions. He keeps me stable as I had bipolar, anxiety, and some other smaller stuff. I keep him stable as he has panic disorder and is on the autism spectrum. We support one another **in a healthy way.** Your boyfriend is a grown ass man. I know that he is ill and may need certain things to succeed, but he is a grown ass man. He should be able to see that the way he is relying on you is unhealthy and very harmful to you. If he doesn't, then he is ignorant. If he does, he is continuing to damage your mental health while fully knowing what he is doing. I had a psychotic break last summer and had to live with my boyfriend for a while. He supported me in all the ways I needed to be supported by encouraging me, holding me, taking me to the ER, watching me, etc. However, you damn well believe I was appreciative. I told him every day how appreciative I was. I asked him every single day if I was putting too much on him. I tried to handle my own shit as best as I could. He has his own life to live and just because I was falling apart, doesn't mean I was allowed to dump my shit on to his plate. Your boyfriend does not want to get better. He refuses treatment and won't stay in the hospital even though he needs to be hospitalized. He wasn't diagnosed too long ago and is likely still coming to terms with his diagnosis. However, this doesn't make it your responsibility. **YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS LIFE.** More than anything, I think the best course of action is for him to move home from school and have his actual mother watch him because you have your own life. I am so so sorry if this comes across as belligerent. My boyfriends ex made him responsible for her life, and it damaged him significantly. I vowed I would never ever do that to him despite how ill I was. I want you to know that you going to see therapists and going this far out of your way for him is fucking incredible. You are an amazing person and your capacity for love astounds me. It just really hurts for me to see him taking advantage of it like this. ", "link_id": "t3_8khqhq", "time": 1526701430}}

Training protection \\(IPO\\) is also a very serious commitment.

{"dz49rpc": {"text": "Hello friend. Firstly, it seems like you are in a pretty rough patch in your life, and I am sorry about that. I believe in you, and this will pass. I have found myself in a similar position with similar thoughts as well. This is usually indicative of a depressive state. Try to keep that in mind, and work towards recovery. I'm going to break this down in to a few sections to better organize my thoughts.**Working on Your Relationship with Bipolar**You said in your post \"when I was a teenager\" which indicates that you have had your symptoms. We are in the same boat here. We are roughly the same age and I can completely relate to the sentiment of feeling myself getting more and more symptomatic. It can suck a lot, and make me feel profoundly ill. It makes a lot of sense on paper as the 20s are usually when Bipolar manifests and the condition usually gets worse with time. While that is all bleak and horrible, I think it is a really important part of recovery. In order for us to move forward to where we are going, we must understand where we are so that we can make our plan of action. Your post says that you were diagnosed in October, which is only 7 months ago! That is a very short time to adjust to all of this. Even though we are not any different than we were before our diagnoses, there are often a lot of complex emotions that we need to regard along with attempting to get our medication right. Give it a little bit of time. How you would like your relationship with bipolar to be is completely up to you. However, I truly believe that we can benefit greatly by seeing it for what it is. In retrospect, both my Bipolar and my Anxiety have been factors in my life since a very young age. My youngest memory of an anxiety attack was when I was roughly 6 or 7 years old. My mental health struggles suck big time. I do not like how I've been called names; I do not like how I cannot drink alcohol casually without worrying that it'll mess with my meds; I do not like constantly needing to monitor my moods; I do not like how it has shot my memory to crap; I do not like a whole lot of it. The thing is though, just because I don't like it, doesn't mean it's going to go away. While those are all aspects of life that I need to deal with because of my challenges, that doesn't take away all of my other accomplishments in life. We all have things that we are proud of. Do not let your illness take that from you. In fact, I have things that I have only been able to accomplish because of my illness. I have a special needs dog that I raised from 10 weeks old. I was terrified of the responsibility and the possibility of me \"messing him up\". I would have anxiety attacks and wake up crying. My obsessive compulsive tendencies went haywire every single time anything was a hair out of place. I was pulling my own hair out for about 15 straight months. However, he turned out to be a damn good dog. I attribute that to my dedication and drive fueled by my fear of failure. I do not allow my struggles to stop me. They might hinder me, but any time I can, I channel it in to something useful. Try not to think of Bipolar as this end\\-all\\-be\\-all evil. Bipolar disorder has taught me more kindness, compassion, and humility than anything else in my life. Bipolar taught me kindness by seeing how cruel people were to myself and my peers. I learned to be kind to them and show them better. Bipolar taught me compassion for other people and their struggles, see or unseen because I learned about how we do not know what battles anyone is fighting. I choose to believe that even if a person is rude to me, it is possible that they were having a rough day where their dog got really sick or something and that it is better they lash out at me than someone else. Bipolar taught me humility by forcing me to swallow my pride every time I exploded in bipolar rage and alienated my relationships. I have learned all of these things and so much more because, as Carrie Fisher once said, \"Living with Manic\\-Depression takes a tremendous amount of balls\". **Working on Your Relationship with Yourself** This was strange for me. Honestly, my relationship with myself was really shitty before I got my mental illnesses diagnosed. I had difficulties in school as a child due to my differences and was dismissed as lazy and not applying myself by an authority figure at a young age. This hurt me deeply and it stuck with me for a long time. When I got diagnosed and someone finally validated all of my efforts, it changed things for me. Getting diagnosed can do a fucking number on our self worth. It comes with the horrible stigma of mental health. It makes us wonder if we are broken or out of place. It makes us yearn to be like \"normal people\". Hell, I still do sometimes. Fuck that. I'm not some broken little vase because of this condition. Hell, I'm stronger than most people because of it. I think that a really important part of recovery is taking care of ourselves. I know this is going to sound corny as all hell, but please bear with me. There's this thing called the 9 dimensions of wellness: emotional, career, spiritual, physical, financial, intellectual, creative, and environmental. It sounds like one of those cheesy self\\-help books, but it fucking works. At the end of the day, it's just taking care of yourself broken down in to easier categories so it seems less overwhelming. When my day is bad, I get a smoothie. Last week, I bought myself a new duvet cover that was on sale at BBB for 39.99 \\(from 89.99!!!\\) and it has made me so fucking happy sleeping in my bed because it is just nice to be there. **Psychiatrist** The psychiatrist \\- patient relationship is sacred. I would never ever fucking go to a psychiatrist I did not like or who's values did not align with mine. Simply put, it is setting ourselves up for failure. It is extremely beneficial to feel like I can call my psychiatrist \\(or at least leave a message\\) whenever I'm having a psychiatric emergency. It is also nice to not dread appointments every month. It is nice to feel cared about. It's an important part of my recovery. Once you have confidence in your psychiatrist, it opens up a world of possibilities. It hasn't happened in a while, because I've been stable for a minute, but I know that if I fall in to a bad depressive state, I can call right away and get it sorted. This way, I don't wallow. **Things You Can Do Each Day** There really are things you can do each and every day to facilitate your recovery. I watch my moods to a stringent degree. I can now tell when I'm about to have a swing \\(most of the time\\). Identify your triggers. It gets easier over time. I promise. From there, you can start identifying ways to mitigate or reduce the swing if possible. I'm not perfect, I still have episodes, but through medication and my coping mechanisms, I've found ways to limit them. For example, I knew I was at the edge of a depressive spiral two weeks ago. I was having a really fucking bad day. Late to work in the morning, had to drop car off at the dealer \\(always a bad time\\), late to exam, water on computer. It was all piling up so fast and I wanted to cry so bad. However, for me personally, I know that if I cry, it'll send me down the spiral. Instead, I took a bath, watched some tv, and got myself something I like to eat. It helped. I made it through without spiraling. Everyone has their own coping mechanisms and I am sure you can do it too! **The Future** No one can tell you what the future holds. What I can tell you is typically, the more episodes we have, the more damage we do to our brains and the \"worse\" it gets. We can look at that the really negative sadistic way and say it's doomed, or we can choose a brighter outlook. I choose to look at the positive that I have my condition under control so it's not getting \"worse\" and I am in control of my life. I hate dwelling on that I can't change. We don't know where things will be and we don't know where we are going. However, what I do know is that I love my dog, I love my boyfriend, I love so much about my life. Fuck I have hard times. Hell, I had a fucking psychiatric break this summer. I was on a rooftop, and a psychiatric ward that doesn't take self surrenders wanted to take me. If I wanted to hone in on all of the shitty moments, then it would paint a really bad picture. It would be full of me crying alone on my bathroom tile, my sister calling me a drug addict, a former friend calling me a sociopathic manipulative self diagnosing piece of shit, the vet finding the possibility of lymphoma in my dog, etc. The list wouldn't end. I choose to work every fucking day to make my own life worth it. I choose to believe that I can do it. I choose to take fucking control and you can, too.

{"dz2960p": {"text": "Friend what you are experiencing is perfectly normal! It's called puppy blues. At 23 years old, you have the life of a little creature in your hands. It is perfectly reasonable to be wigged out. Some might even say that it is better that you are a little anxious than not. I know that for me personally, I attribute how good of a dog owner I am to my anxiety and fear of \"messing him up\". That being said, it has absolutely not been easy. I got Atlas at 20 years old, which is even younger than you! I had only been on this Earth for 20 years and I decided to be in charge of another life and I regarded that with a great weight. After all, he was going to be a big dog (and a german shepherd at that) and an ill mannered large dog has grave consequences. I found myself waking up in the middle of the night (on the rare occasions that I got to sleep) sobbing and worrying that I would \"mess him up\" or fail him. There was one point where I was just sitting on the floor of my bedroom, looking at my fluffy little land-shark and crying because I was so overwhelmed. He ended up coming and putting his head on me for a brief few seconds and it was enough for me to get it together. I was beyond stressed. I visited / and / daily as they were resources I agreed with. I read nearly every single post on those subreddits for months. There has been many an instance that I've posted on the latter subreddit in panic and they've been wonderful to reassure me. They basically held my hand in raising Atlas and I am so grateful. I was also a student at the time, which meant that I had studies to keep up with while I wasn't sleeping. To say my grades to a hit that quarter would be a severe understatement. I have several mental health struggles that I face. One of my struggles is chronic anxiety, which you can imagine was quite a challenge to face during the time of raising a pup. I am not going to lie. Having Atlas at the time exacerbated my anxiety to levels I had not experienced before at the time. Nowadays, he is one of the two pillars of strength that I could not picture living life without. He quells my nerves and I am so thankful for him, but it's been a long strange road to get here. ######In regards to training: **Crate Training:** I was fortunate that Atlas took to the crate fairly quickly as his breeder fed the pups in crates. However, some dogs do not take to them as immediately. Some tips I have are as follows: feed him in the crate. Your dog understands very little about his world right now. He has just been taken from his mother as a baby. However, even as a baby, dogs (and human babies!) understand the value of food and that it is a positive thing. Thus, getting him to associate the crate with food helps him associate it as a \"home space\". Tossing treats in there helps based on the same logic. Something that some people see success with is the Snuggle Puppy toy or a ticking old-school clock as it emulates other puppies from when he was sleeping in a pile of fluff. I also recommend sleeping next to the crate and running your hands in there at first to assure the puppy he is not alone. If he is peeing in the crate, you will likely need to take him out more frequently in the night. (I did every 2 hours. It was a living nightmare.) The barking will also go down with time. Atlas reacts to sounds much less when he's crated then when he's out and about. I find that it is because he truly does associate his crate as his safe space. I also gave Atlas his peanut butter Kong exclusively in his crate so the high value item was associated with the crate. Also, make sure it is the right size. **Routine:** A lot of people see success with creating a schedule for themselves. I think that it helps us feel like we have some sort of control and order in our lives with the new puppy. **Me Time:** Crate training is a key part of my dog ownership style. It helps me provide a safe space for my dog and it allows me to have some sanity. Something that helped me crate train my dog was that once he got used to it, sometimes, I would crate him while I was home and sitting right next to it so he knew crate =/= abandonment. I also actively made sure to crate him for my own sanity. I know some people that are able to tether their dogs all the time to themselves when they are home. Realistically, I do not have the stamina. I did actively interact, train, and play with him as much as possible. But for an hour or two each night, I set aside time for \"me time\". I took baths, I surfed the internet, I relaxed. I was no use to him if I was a mess. This leads to my next point that... **Puppies need a LOT of sleep:** Just like babies! They're growing and need up to 19 hours of sleep a day! (?!?!??!?! I know it sounded nuts to me too because it seemed like he was awake 24/7). My dog had the tendency to get EXTRA terrible when he was tired. He didn't want to go to sleep because he wanted to stay awake and learn about the world, but he would get cranky and over-tired. This was the time that he went in to mandatory crate enforced nap time. Some people see a lot of success in the \"you sleep when the puppy sleeps\" method. I find that this can be true for naps as I wake every 2 hours for potty breaks in the night.   Now: you can do this. One of the hugest issues and stressors for me was my insecurity of not being a good enough dog owner. I know that when I get my next puppy (whenever that will be), I will have all of my tools that I've learned from Atlas. However, I will still be nervous because that's who I am. I will be equipped with the knowledge of how I want to train and the most important confidence in my own abilities. You can do this. Breathe. ", "link_id": "t3_8jrybt", "time": 1526456239}}

I have been diagnosed with bipolar I as my primary diagnosis and try very hard to work consciously every day to keep it under control as best as I can. I have observed through my encounters with other people with the disorder and in my own life that many of us have abandonment and trust issues. This might have something to do with behavior similar to what your ex-girlfriend is exhibiting and it's cyclical nature. One common misconception about bipolar disorder is that it's just high moods and low moods. In fact, saying that it is *just* mania/hypomania &amp; depression wouldn't be right either. Bipolar disorder manifests in so many ways across so many different people. One very common one I've heard about is bipolar rage/temper and isolationism. The best way I have to describe it is, a dirt ball starts rolling down a hill slowly at first, but before I know it, it's gathering dirt as it grows and 10 times the size and you cannot help myself. I don't even want to be saying the things I'm saying or doing the things I'm doing but it comes out like word vomit. Then, I are alone again. Like you said: \"Your relationship may last one month or one year or 3 decades - eventually they will turn on you\". This is not always true in my experience, but is a very very strong overarching trend in my relationships (platonic and otherwise) in my life. Because we are so accustomed to people leaving us, it's sort of just what we know. It's really sad. There's a chance she might have wanted you to say \"wait... no\". I know I've had that happen to me before. I promise she's not trying to play mind games. It's a part of the condition. There are lots of different ways to move forward from here. I think that when dealing with a person with any sort of mental illness, the rule is always to be kind, compassionate, and caring. If I were in your shoes, I would leave a message that says something along the lines of, \"I care for you very much. I know that you want to be alone right now, and that's okay. Just let me know if you ever want to talk. I'm always happy to listen\".

Ironically, he has Aspergers and I have Bipolar (read cannot read emotions / emotions blatantly obvious), but he understand me better and can read me better than anyone else in the world. It's because he loves me and has put in the time to practice and to get it right. He's been with me in the emergency room and he's talked me down from rooftops. He does NOT view my bipolarity as this \"annoying nuisance\" he has to deal with. Whenever I'm crying and apologizing to him, he simply says that he loves me and that does include all of me. He doesn't pick and choose pieces. I could go on and on about how incredible he is, but all that really matters is that he's real for me and there's someone out there for you, too. I always say, loving someone with a mental illness is actually not that different from loving someone without. In all honesty, we don't require any special training or anything to date.

Love isn't hard to find because we are mentally ill, love is hard to find because love is hard to find. If we turn ourselves to blame it on our bipolarity, I believe it is finding yet another reason for self deprecation and we don't need that.

{"dyj1vss": {"text": "It seems like you're doing amazing! I wish I was as together as you are when I first got Atlas. I have a couple of thoughts: * Personally, I wouldn't use the term \"aggressive\" when he bites, mouths, and lunges when he's tired. The term \"aggressive\" implies something different than what this is. While this is unpleasant and very annoying, I wouldn't classify it as aggression as it is the puppy learning how to release his energy properly with your help! * Puppy blues: I had them fucking hardcore until like 7 or 8 months in. It seems like you have it together for the most part. Pretty soon, you will see the little accomplishments and make sure you celebrate those. It'll help the puppy blues a lot. * For crate and you placing him in it, I encourage you to try to get him to walk in to it himself. It's a tough bridge to cross, but I'm really happy Atlas has such a positive relationship with his crate. It has come in handy. You can toss treats in there and you can \"send him home\" when you want him to go. * Notably, I didn't see anything about socialization in your write-up. He shouldn't be on the ground without all his vaccines (there's a debate here, but for me, it's all vaccines). Prior to his vaccinations, you can carry him places. You can also do things like introducing tons of different things within the house: textures, sounds, different sorts of people if you can get your friends to come over. Now in regards to your questions: * The puppy rage is easier to manage once you can go outside. Learning all about the world is really tiring for their little brains. Mine did the same thing, going nuts when he was too tired. When he did that, I knew it was crate nap time. * My dog, to this day, at a year and 9 months old is crated when I am not home. I simply do not want to risk him getting in to anything. He needed surgery once on his first birthday because he swallowed a pair of earphones and it is just a choice I have made personally. Thus, I don't really have an answer for you here. * Atlas started playing independently at maybe... 6 months? He's a really smart dog, so he isn't one to just lay there and chew on a ball by himself. If the chew is high value enough, he'll usually chew it for a bit but he makes work of them quickly. As a pup, Atlas typically prefers engagement in his toys (as all dogs do), and he would rather lay down and nap then play on his own. I am pretty sure that's just a personality trait of his. One of the things that really really helped Atlas play on his own was a jolly ball (it's actually a horse toy). The idea is that it taps in to the herding breeds herding instinct and they roll and chase the ball around. Atlas was also a pretty insecure puppy, so he didn't start playing by himself until he did. * Atlas just sort of gradually became okay with me not watching him over time, but again, I still crate to this day, so I cannot really reflect upon you being out and him being out and about. Atlas doesn't seem to care when I'm somewhere else in my apartment. * Dogs like different things. There isn't really a one-size-fits-all. If you feed through the Kong, he'll be hungry enough to work for it (I think). Lots of people see success with wet dog food as well. * There's some mathematical rule about this about multiplying by the month, but I don't know it off the top of my head. * My pup is crated so he plays with his crate toy and sleeps. * As far as the doggy smell goes, a lot of a dog's smell depends on diet. Also, corgis shed a lot so vacuuming frequently will be a good idea. (Also, just as a tip, you could try to get him used to the vacuum now in preparation for the future).

I have so many feelings on the subject, so here goes: I am a few years older than you (21), and not that much wiser, but I have been blessed to have met the love of my life when I was 14. We got back together earlier this year and we have been best friends for 7 now. It's been really awesome. Firstly, in my opinion, dating with bipolar is really difficult because of all of the reasons you listed. I can relate to all of them, with the \"quirky and fun until it gets too much\" part particularly. I think that the allure of the girl that wants go to ride the motorcycle and is passionate about stuff at first is really appealing to guys, but the other side of the coin isn't so great. I think bipolar has really shown my ability to love. I know there is so much flux between our truths between states, but it is ALWAYS true that I love my dog and I love my boyfriend. That is incredible to me. I am blessed with a man that understands me better than anyone else in the world does. It is ironic because he has aspergers and I have bipolar. He is patient with me. He talks to me. He holds me when I need to be held. We have communication that is out of this world and I think that is the real obstacle that a lot of people struggle with whether they have bipolar or don't. I always say that dating a person with bipolar doesn't require anything outside of what a regular relationship requires: kindness, love, understanding, communication, etc. If I were to marry a man in a wheelchair, I wouldn't be upset or bail because he needed help with a mobility issue.

{"dyhs1b9": {"text": "Hello friend! I have a lot of thoughts on this. Getting a dog is a beautiful and wonderful thing. They are creatures that are capable of a level of love that us humans can't even comprehend. Atlas has changed my life and provided me more companionship and happiness then I ever thought possible. He is everything to me. That being said, I do need to warn you. I think there is a huge difference to growing up with a dog and owning one. Typically, people who grow up with dogs don't have a hand in training them much less full responsibility. Keep in mind that this will be different. I will now diverge in to two categories of if you get a puppy or if you get an adult dog. **If you get a puppy:** Puppies are so cute. I love puppies so much. However, puppies are possibly the most stressful things on the planet earth. I have heard from people that are parents that puppies are harder than babies. I cannot speak to this fact, but yeah. You will be waking up every 2 hours (not even exaggerating) in the middle of the night to pee him/her for at least a week. Most people do this for like a month. The lack of sleep can really get taxing. You will be stressing over viruses. You will be stressing over food. You will be stressing over training. All while dealing with your own issues. I cannot stress enough how fucking exhausting being a puppy owner was. Furthermore, I was having anxiety attacks. I was waking up in the middle of the night crying in fear that I would fail him. Getting a puppy, however, was the single most rewarding experience I have ever had. I do not have children myself, but the fact that I have raised this living being from infancy to his state now is incredible to me. I am so fucking proud of what a good boy he is. I am so fucking proud of the dog he has become. It is insanely rewarding and a wonderful confidence building thing. Also, he does provide that glorious wonderful companionship. He's a snuggler and it's awesome. **If you get an adult dog:** Getting an adult dog is a really wonderful alternative to getting a puppy if it's your first time owning your own dog. However, adult dogs typically come with their own sets of issues and will not be trained exactly the way you like as you didn't train them. They come with things that you don't quite know yet as expected. I think adopting is a wonderful wonderful thing. However, if you're looking for an animal to offer you support and stability, I might look in to contacting local breeders to see if any of their adult dogs have \"aged out\" of their breeding program. In closing, dog ownership is no joke and is a huge responsibility. It can be even more so for a mentally ill person and it can help a tremendous amount, but can also hurt a lot as well.

{"dyhg3v3": {"text": "Heehee Winry like Full Metal? I love Winry. She's such a strong yet feminine character. I kept Atlas' crate in my bedroom! I actually just moved it outside yesterday night. He's a year and 9 months and actually really fucking adores his crate. Here are my thoughts: I ended up with his crate in my bedroom for a variety of reasons outside of like a conscious \"I want the crate in my bedroom\" decision much like you with the air conditioner. Honestly, he was a very self conscious puppy and I spent most of my time in the bedroom which is why he was in there. Also, my housemates at the time were less than ideal. All in all, it really did help him settle in his crate because he associated it with being with me. I also spend most of my time in my bedroom in general so he got to be near me. It was nice. The reason I moved his crate out was that he sleeps with me on the bed anyways and really is only crated when I leave the apartment. I realized that it would be good for his slight separation anxiety (maybe) to have his safe place separate from where I primarily reside. Also, I realized that having the crate in my living room would create a lot more training opportunities for me personally. In example, I was putting my sheet on the bed yesterday night. Atlas was laying on the bare mattress and didn't want to move. I got to reinforce both \"off\" and \"down\" and \"stay\". Previously, I would have just crated him real quick to do it.

He does also look just a bit like a Berner (Don't kill me). I love Berners. &amp; those almond eyes are SO precious. Your dog looks like such a good boy! I would begin the conversation at a place away from the dog, maybe out over dinner so the dog isn't in the moment. I would start by saying He is lashing out by calling the dog chubby and saying he is too big I think. Maybe start by saying \"i know you think so and so is a bit chubby and large, but let's talk about your feelings towards 'dog'\". He is going to start by saying mean stuff again probably, but he is just lashing out, try not to fight with him. Then, I'd say \"okay I recognize your opinion, but that is really hurtful to me...etc.\" Listen, your husband goes away for months at a time for work. My boyfriend and I are long distance so I think we share the sentiment that our dogs are our main companions when our significant others are away. Atlas keeps me company. I don't know what I would do without him. Our bond is so special because he provides me that companionship when my boyfriend isn't around. I would express this to him and let him know how important your dog is to you. My boyfriend totally has opinions about my dog-parenting. He isn't mean about it or anything, we just talk about our opinions for the future and stuff. However, he compromises and doesn't ask me to change anything because Atlas is MY dog. I wouldn't worry about the chubby comment. Your dog isn't chubby and it doesn't effect him at all. As far as smell and mess go, there are things you can really easily feed your dog as supplements that change that. There's also wipes if you'd like, but I prefer to add a small supplement to the dogs diet. Also, is he actually smelly? If he is, changing the food might be an option and usually directly relates to smell. Unless you're attached to the dog food for some reason, it can help and such. Lastly, if he does actually smell, I would advise going to the vet as smell can actually indicate some health problems. As far as dirt/cleanliness goes. If he has that signature double coat, he's gonna shed. Vacuuming and cleaning the house is just a thing we gotta do. For the relationship, do you think cleaning a bit would be okay? Also, baths everyday are not good for dog coats typically. Atlas sleeps in the bed with me. He also has a crate but he sleeps with me. I like to not feel alone when I'm sleeping and obviously my boyfriend isn't around. Atlas serves that purpose for me. Hopefully, your husband can understand that.

If you try it, get diagnosed, take medication and don't like it, you are free to stop taking it. You have choices! The person that I met that was diagnosed the latest was a lovely woman that was sixty years old. I've heard her story and I've heard about her successful life. She was a wonderful college educated teacher with a successful marriage and a happy family. She had dealt with depression her entire life, but it was \"normal\" to her. That is, until she encountered one of her biggest challenges in life: her mother's passing. It decimated her. She didn't know what to do, so she finally did seek help. She is so happy that she did because she has found so many different outlets now and has a better understanding of herself. It's never too late. Also, just because you have a diagnosis does not mean you need to take medication. A lot of people have diagnoses and it helps them gain perspective. It allows them to research more in to their condition and assess it better to come up with coping mechanisms. Information is power blah blah blah. One of the biggest things is, nothing changes about you the day before you get your diagnosis and the day after. The only difference is that you went to the doctor. The only difference is the one you allow it to make. ", "link_id": "t3_8gwcqa", "time": 1525428006}}

We concluded that it would be best to review them at the end of the day so we weren't sacks of tears by that point. We also left time at the end of each period where all the team members collected in the front and shyer kids were able to come up and talk to us themselves when everyone was leaving.

There was a girl that came up to me afterwards with tears welled in her eyes thanking me. All in all, I spoke to over a thousand kids today. I can say that I, for sure, genuinely connected with maybe 4 of them because we had conversations and I gave them hugs and such.

That being said, Bipolar disorder onset is usually in the mid-20s but can certainly be earlier or later. It is also not this constant thing. Our illnesses change as we grow older. I have an older peer that was diagnosed with Bipolar II, but she experienced her first full on manic (not hypomanic) episode earlier this year and her diagnosis is floating a little bit closer to Bipolar I. It is possible that this is the first time in her life that she is experiencing these things. It's a really tough decision. The cynic in me wants to say \"get out\", but the person with BD in me wants to say \"hey, she's suffering, and I've been there. I'm grateful 'SO Name' stuck around\". It can be so fucking tough right now. I think that the first episode is almost one of the most tumultuous point in many people with BD's life. Often times, we come out of it scared and quite confused. During this time, support is everything. From there on out, therapy, psychiatry, communication, and love can work wonders. Honestly. I know this is going to sound really fucked up, but I personally respond best to understanding and love above all. I know that it most certainly may not be completely true, but I want to go ahead and say that you love this woman and you want her to be happy. I would go with \"Hi [name].

{"dydgiep": {"text": "Hi friend! I have a lot to say about this topic so I apologize if you don\u2019t feel like reading a dissertation tonight. I\u2019ve spent a great deal of my higher education pursuing the repression and ideologies our (western) culture holds towards women, womanhood, and sexuality over these few years. In the most recent year, I\u2019ve delved in to the social issues and romanticization and cultural shift people are taking towards mental health (as it is one of my personal interests) and it\u2019s relationship and effect on women, womanhood, and sexuality. I think that the \u201ccool girl\u201d has had quite a few names over the past. We can say at one point the \u201cpin up girl\u201d could be considered the \u201ccool girl\u201d. Similarity,  I also hear \u201cmanic pixie dream girl\u201d being thrown around quite a bit these days. In the excerpt you posted, there seems to be a great amount of female-on-female animosity. Words like \u201cdoing this for men\u201d and \u201cnot doing it for themselves\u201d come to mind. Justifiably, women should not need to alter their own beings to the pleasure or convenience of men. Yet, we cannot idly blame these \u201ccool girls\u201d for being \u201ccool girls\u201d. Our westernized patriarchal society has superimposed a very old set of gender roles in our brains. As much as we attempt to discredit them and claimed we are modernized, it cannot be ignored that I still don\u2019t feel safe at a gas station. Saying that these women are \u201cdoing it for men\u201d or saying that these no way she could \u201clove chili cheese dogs that much\u201d is yet another boundary and expectation placed on women. It becomes a damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t situation. As silly as it feels typing this, it is within no one\u2019s right to say \u201cshe can\u2019t love chili cheese dogs that much\u201d. Hell, maybe she grew up eating them with her dad every Saturday after softball practice. Who knows? What I\u2019m saying is, she can love chili cheese dogs that much. And, while men may be enamored with it at first, the rose colored glasses do not typically last. I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ve all seen the memes on fragile masculinity. I hope there never needs to come a time in your life when you (a woman) know how to properly change a tire and your companion (a man) does not and you attempt to assist. It is truly incredible just how quickly it can shatter in a situation like that. For a man to want to be with a \u201ccool girl\u201d who smokes cigarettes, drives fast, blah blah. Unfortunately, as with women having very old ideals passed down to them by their parents, men have too. There is no way around it. America is, and always has been a patriarchal society. We are working towards gender equality, but there is a long way to go. In turn, men often get enamored with this idea of the \u201ccool girl\u201d and pursue her because she is, radically, a simultaneous display of both masculinity and femininity. In short, men want the girl that wants to go smoke and party with them, but they don\u2019t want the girl that is crying after she\u2019s had a hard day, even if they are the same girl. In a radical notion, she was supposed to be \u201ctoo cool for feelings\u201d.I pose to you a scenario: a girl has all of the \u201ccool girl\u201d traits, but she is not conventionally attractive. Is she/can she be considered a cool girl? I propose not as the very paradigm of the \u201ccool girl\u201d relies on the simultaneous existence of commanding both gender roles. By the excerpt posted, to be a \u201ccool girl\u201d hinges on what is subjectively \u201ccool\u201d and desirable in mainstream culture at the time. Gender and gender roles have been seen as segregated binaries for so long. It is only now that we are seeing challenges to the dichotomy. The \u201ccool girl\u201d is one of those challenges. It embodies the idea that women can be both great homemakers and breadwinners. They can be both nurturing and outwardly. This freedom is relatively new and being explored by women everywhere. The \u201ccool girl\u201d is not without its problems. At the end of the day, as said before, one of the defining traits of the \u201ccool girl\u201d is her ability to attract men and command sexuality. I believe that this can be attributed to a number of factors, with a few notable ones such as: women\u2019s empowerment and body positivity in the last decade, the embedded ness of patriarchal attitudes in our country and lifestyles, and the perpetuation of the status quo. Yet, the alienation and the casting off of the \u201ccool girl\u201d seems, in itself, \u201canti-feminist\u201d in a way. I care not if one of my peers is, pardon my French, the most \u201cun-cool girl\u201d ever and I am a \u201ccool girl\u201d. I will not lash out and say that she is making herself \u201cunattractive to men on purpose\u201d. In a radical notion, I drive a 6 speed because my dad never had a son and he taught me. I know how to change a tire because he damn sure made sure I did so I wasn\u2019t stranded at the side of the road by myself. I own an 80 pound German Shepherd that I love with all my life. I refuse to make myself small and I swear like a sailor. In contrast, god do I love makeup. The process is so soothing to me. I\u2019m not a very good cook, but I do love it. My favorite color is pink. In a radical notion, I did not do any of this for men. If anything, while it has \u201cattracted men\u201d and very notably repelled women, in the past (as attitudes reflected in this excerpt), none of the men have stayed (save one. I love him very much). Often times, they eventually find themselves uncomfortable with my combative nature or squirm in their seats when I challenge them on the masculinity. If you watch Game of Thrones, think Daenerys. She takes multiple lovers throughout the show, and she is absolutely a \u201ccool girl\u201d. One could argue that at the beginning of the show, she was not a \u201ccool girl\u201d. During season 1, she was sold off by her brother to the Dothraki for an army. She was raped and humiliated. Yet, through her trials, including one where she learned to open up about her sexuality, motherhood (of dragons), and conquest, she has reached \u201ccool girl\u201d status. Daenerys is a prime example of the duality of masculinity and femininity. Yet, I would never pose that Daenerys is \u201cdoing it for men\u201d or \u201cpretending to be something else\u201d. She is on her way to take the iron throne. That is not for men. That is for herself to reclaim her name. Thus, I conclude what is now likely the longest reddit post of all time by saying: yes, it resonates, but I think it\u2019s damaging to label other women as \u201cman-pleasers\u201d when we can be fostering a global women\u2019s culture on acceptance and growth. I might not love chili cheese dogs that much, but you haven\u2019t seen me with French fries. And I promise I\u2019m not doing that for men. ", "link_id": "t3_8gmc8i", "time": 1525340469}}

{"dycmd4l": {"text": "Hi friend! I would like to start out by commending you on setting aside time to get to know yourself and your disorder. I think that's something really tough for people our age to do, particularly when it feels like many of our peers are zooming head first as fast as possible in to their career paths/futures. It's really great that you've taken the time for yourself. I also want to commend you for staying abstinent. I know that I, personally, would have a really hard time with this even if it's something I wanted to do due to hyper sexuality being one of my symptoms.  Here's the thing about Bipolar Disorder. We don't really grow out or get past it completely. The condition is chronic. With that in mind, we must find ways to date (if we choose to do so) with bipolar disorder. A lot of people with mental illnesses seem to not want to burden someone else with their disease or fear that it makes them unlovable. I think this is so very silly. Although my significant other doesn't have a mental illness, he is on the autism spectrum. Many people would put that in the same vein with the \"unlovable\" category. I love him more than anything, and I like to think he loves me despite my challenges. It is totally possible for you to date! One thing that I would be tactful about is how to bring up the disorder. I was fortunate that my significant other and I were friends for many many years before we began dating. Thus, he already knew. If I were to meet him \"from scratch\", I'd likely go on a few dates and waited until it felt like we were getting on the more serious side to bring it up. I would try not to wait too long. I think I would also be prepared for him to bail at this point. Honestly, it doesn't make them a bad person if they bail after hearing about the disorder. We can visit / and know it's not easy. However, I kind of regard it as similar to being with someone with a physical disability. If I were to marry a man in a wheelchair, I would not be upset nor surprised that sometimes I would have to help him with mobility issues. This is not unlike regarding being with someone with mental health challenges. We have procedures to handle my episodes. If they bail, then they are just not the one for you. I always say that dating a person with mental health challenges actually is not leagues different from dating someone without them. I know that seems kinda nuts to read, but hear me out. At the end of the day, to love anyone, all you need is love, understanding, kindness, honesty, compassion, patience and other very human traits that are available in every person. There is no \"special requirement\" to date a mentally ill person. There isn't a \"you must be this tall to ride this ride\" sort of deal. Honestly, as long as they are a kind, patient, understanding, etc. person that loves you, it will be enough. That being said, I know it is a very doom-and-gloom topic, but I'd like to urge you (when and if you do tell him) to visit on the fact that it is chronic. I am a pretty blunt person so I would say \"to be clear, this is something I will be managing and living with for the remainder of my life. It is chronic.\" I think this sort of highlights the grand scheme of things. I think that it is really easy for people to say, \"oh things are going well right now\" and continue dating without very much thought going on. Furthermore, just as with the unfortunate reality, many people have inherent embedded stigma about mental illness. A person might be opted to say, \"oh no I will be loving and supportive during your episodes\" early on, only to get \"tired of them\" 6 months in. One thing I'd like to stress is communication! Pretty funnily, I'm a girl with Bipolar Disorder (a person with emotions that are very present) dating a person with Aspergers (a person with the lack of ability to pick up on social cues &amp; emotions of others). Despite all of that, my significant other understand me better than anyone else, and it is because we have put in time. Seven and a half years of it to be exact. We have communicated about nearly everything. I am free to say \"Babe I cannot deal with you right now\" and it won't be offensive. An open channel is very important. Lastly, one of the hugest pitfalls I had in my previous relationship (combined with the fact that I was diagnosed and he got tired of my rapid cycles), was the fluctuation of truth. For me, my world and my truths morph and change depending on the state I'm in. Some things that aren't true are true the next day. It made \"truth\" a very slippery slope. Because of this, my ex-boyfriend would consistently call me a liar when I was just trying to express how I felt. So, just a word of caution. ", "link_id": "t3_8gk3t4", "time": 1525299718}}

Bipolar disorder is considered chronic. However, there very much is management. In that vein, I would not personally use the term \"remission\", but I see no actual flaw with it. I can reflect on finding a medication regimen that works for me though: Honestly, it's fucking awesome. I know it all sucks right now, but I wish I was diagnosed at 15.

It's really sweet that you put that disclaimer up there. It's a growing trend that people are diagnosing themselves these days and, in turn, minimizing the struggle we go through, so thank you! Firstly, try not to listen what other people call you \"autistic/bipola Try to think of it this way. You seem to know you shouldn't be self diagnosing, so what more right do those other people have to diagnose you? I doubt they're licensed psych professionals. The first move of action I would take is to find a psychiatrist that you are comfortable with. It seems like your past experiences have not been positive, and I am really sorry about that. I cannot stress enough what a healthy and positive doctor-patient relationship can do for a person with mental health challenges. A good doctor will work with you on what medications you want to take and which ones you are comfortable with. A good doctor will be available for a phone call (or a message) about how the medication is or isn't working for you and will be happy to adjust it if it isn't (given that it's been the allotted time). In example, if your medication is making you fall asleep in school, you should be able to call your doc to see what can be done about that. Now, I do not black out nor does my personality switch (mood disorder not personality disorder here), but I think I might be observing something similar. When I feel bipolar rage, I absolutely lose it. It feels like I cannot control the vile words that are pouring out of my mouth and I have this goal to hurt everything around me.

{"dy3z74x": {"text": "Hi hon. I think we're around the same age. I'm a fellow mentally unstable girl. I'd rattle on about my diagnoses, but it doesn't matter too much. Just know that I share the same anxiety issues and obsessive compulsive tendencies. The rest isn't too important. Do keep in mind that everybody's definition of love is different. We all experience it differently and we all have different things we would call love. Thus, everything that I say is just going to be from my viewpoint and I'd like you to take it with a grain of salt. That being said, I've been in a relationship where I doubted the definition of love and my feelings like you seem to be. I really thought I loved the guy. I cared for him so very deeply. I did until he said some very hurtful stuff about my mental health after we broke up. I realize now that he and I were never right for one another and question if we were ever truly in love. I have known my current boyfriend for 7 1/2 years. We dated once briefly a few years ago and separated on good terms due to going to separate universities and mutually agreeing that we wanted to grow. We got back together a while back. Through the time that I was away from him (and dating my ex which I know is shitty okay), I never for a second doubted that I loved him. I went through so many episodes, had so many states, but I never doubted it. He makes me better. He makes me more stable. He understands me better than anyone else in the world. He's been with me in the ER while I was quite actually psychotic and talked me down from rooftops. He is able to do these things because, above all, he makes me feel safe and I love him. It sounds fucking big headed but there are times that I feel that we were made for one another and the cosmos have aligned for us. I know that's ridiculous, but it's how I feel. When I am with him, my anxiety goes away almost completely. I know that sounds astronomically shocking for a person with an anxiety disorder, and it shocked me too. Don't get me wrong, my mood disorder still acts up, but my anxiety sort of quells. It's because... despite it all, I trust the guy. Usually, I can't do that, but with him, I can. He works with me for my mood disorder. One of my manifestations is irritability. It's really bad. It will cause me to say hurtful things and will spiral rash behavior. About a month ago, we had our first real fight. What came out of my mouth shocked me. I have never been able to control my temper or be this kind in an argument in my life. I said, \"Okay. Babe. I love you and I respect your feelings. That makes me really sad, but I understand and I hope that we can work through this together.\" This was fucking mind blowing for me. I didn't even say it through the grit of my teeth. I was calm and collected because I meant it. I share all of this with you because, through all of these experiences, I, without a shadow of a doubt, love this man to pieces. I know that my mental disorders have made that hard, but it is my absolute truth. I experience a condition where my reality can change very easily. Things that I hold near and dear to me can become worthless in the blink of an eye. I only have two absolute truths in my life. I love my dog, and I love this man.

It has taught me so many things that I don't think I could have learned otherwise. It has taught me love, appreciation, humility, and so much more. I agree that it is currently a \"trend\" to be mentally ill and have bipolar disorder. I find that this is super unfortunate as it is romanticizing our struggles in a way.

{"dxm8sav": {"text": "Hi Friend. I am the one with BD. I hope it is okay that I throw my hat in to the ring. Bipolar rage and losing control really sucks. I know what I'm doing is bad and what I'm saying is bad and I don't want to do or say it but I cannot stop it from coming out like a vomit of ugliness. If the target of this ugliness resists, it usually makes me vomit ugliness even harder. It's so bad and I hate it so much. The most important thing that this illness has taught me is humility. I am a very prideful person, but I love my SO. I want things to work out between us and I want us to stop fighting. So, I will have some humble tea, swallow that pride, and say \"I'm sorry\" &amp; I'll usually cry in the process. I don't know if it's my own pride, or something about the nature of my beliefs towards what I said, or shame in what I said that makes me not want to apologize naturally, but I do. I do it because I know it's for the better and I do mean it. I'm very lucky that my SO is kind and will just hold me at this point. We just exited an episode a few days ago. It was really rough, but we did it. I did some anger inducing stuff. We both cried a lot. At the end of the day though, we both chose one another like we always do. Now, I don't think it's right of him to accuse you of never forgiving him. If I were you, I would have a hard time in this situation as well with the way you described it. If it's been cyclical where it's straight fight -&gt; victim mode -&gt; sex pressure, then, no wonder he feels like you never really forgave him. Hell, that doesn't even seem like enough time to process. To me, forgiveness and relationship building require communication, and that doesn't seem like the case from what's written. Self Pitying victim mode is a fucking trap to fall in to. It's really difficult as mentally ill people because we have all these resources nowadays. I'm really happy about these resources, but I take it upon myself not to abuse them. For example, I am a student, and I am able to get my tests postponed if I'm having a particularly bad episode. I do not do this willy nilly. I genuinely only try to use it when I need it and even then all of the emails asking for it all sound like \"look I'm so sorry, I understand if you can't. I know I'm not special. I am just having a really difficult time with...\" &amp; the reason I have told you this long and rambly story is that I believe, even with BD, we have to take responsibility for our actions. BD might explain why we did certain things, but it doesn't justify us doing them. In example, if I cleaned the house while manic, that's awesome! Then, when I'm not manic, I get to reap the benefits of my house being clean, because well, it still is clean. I cleaned it. It's a similar concept imo. This is why apologizing is such a big part of it to me. I don't want to hurt the person I love. I know I did. I have to apologize. I am the one who hurt him. I should be the one seeking forgiveness. On the sex thing... I'm sure you know it's not great. &amp; again, this, by no means, justifies it, but hyper sexuality is absolutely symptomatic. ", "link_id": "t3_8da1xl", "time": 1524131696}}

I was bouncing off the walls all the time and it was really starting to affect my health. I decided I wanted to stop that, so I weaned myself on to 22 instead of 34 ounces a day. Through that experience, I learned that I need to have something to sip and I enjoyed coffee more for that factor than anything. So, I simultaneously swapped out for pre-bottled iced tea and water. I would drink roughly 64 oz. iced tea a day and 96 (yes. 96) oz. of water a day. Then, the iced tea started getting really pricy, and if I'm being honest, way too sugary. So, I invested in a tea brewer and some fresh tea leaves. I make 2 quarts at a time an drop it in my fridge. I drink maybe 22 ounces of the stuff a day plus my 96 ounces of water! I think the important part of all of this was that I didn't just decide to try to quite cold turkey. I knew that I would fail horribly at that. Honestly, a lot of drug addiction is the same way. Cold turkey makes you go in to horrible withdrawals and increases the chance of relapse. Obviously in my case, I was playing for smaller bets, but I'm proud of myself for kicking my bad habit! Edit: Weird tidbit, I also found out that I like drinking out of straws an incredible amount. Getting a tumbler with a reusable straw has changed the game for me.

If this meant rehoming him if I was in a situation where I couldn\u2019t care for him, I would do that too. I took him in and I made that promise. I will live up to it. Not only that, I always say that how a person treats their pet is a true indicator of a type of person they are. ~~I\u2019m not sure if you and your SO cohabit, but mine and I don\u2019t, but when he visits,~~ my SO does the dog things with me. Hell put the food down, take him out, hold him on a leash, etc. because my SO understands how important this dog is. He understands that he and I are a package deal\u2014 not only that, but the fact that my dog is a living breathing creature. My SO and I are long distance. When he visits, Atlas gets crated a little more, but hell yeah we structure our days around being back at appropriate times to show him some love. That\u2019s how my life is structured. I\u2019m still in college and I tell every college aged student debating on getting a dog \u201cno more spontaneous outings with friends after school. No more sudden dates. No more parties all night if you haven\u2019t made adequate arrangements. You\u2019ve been at school ALL day and it is time for you to go home and love your dog. He deserves it\u201d. It comes with the territory. Again, to me, how a person treats their pets really says something about them. Your SO has been around Sadie for 3 years. He has had a chance to bond but has chosen not to. Maybe he\u2019s not a dog person... and that\u2019s okay. The only thing that might not be okay about that is if you plan on owning dogs in the future. What is absolutely not okay is giving you an ultimatum. This is a fucking shitty thing of him to do.

You have taken the time and effort in to training her, loving her, and being with her. She has BEEN THERE FOR YOU. The most significant part of all of this I think is: **Sadie has enough love in her heart to be there for you if you decide to leave your boyfriend and have to deal with heartbreak. As long as she is able, gross or not, slobbery as fuck or not, she will be giving you kisses, cuddling with you, and making sure you are never fucking alone.** **Your boyfriend, on the other hand, if you decide to keep your dying dog, has decided that he will NOT be there for you through what will likely be the most heartbreaking time of your life. (I'm sorry love. I cannot imagine how fucking hard this is. I cannot imagine what sort of wreck I will be in when I get to that point with my dog and I cannot fucking express enough of my care and internet stranger love towards you.) He cannot be there to support you through not only something that you care for, but again, for what is undoubtedly a significant loss.** **Sadie doesn't ask questions about sadness from a breakup.

I will say it again before I go off on my spiel: I will never ever advocate that someone do something in adjusting their dogs diet this large without the consultation of a veterinary nutritionist. Even amongst veterinary nutritionists, there are those that support raw and those who do not. When you feed a DIY Raw Diet, there is no AAFCO watching what you're feeding. It's all you, and that can be a ton of pressure. I prepped 3 months of food for my dog in advance. Atlas is roughly 75 pounds. Dogs (besides puppies) eat anywhere between 2%-4% of their body weight per day. Atlas happens to eat 3% of his 75 pounds so he eats 2.25 pounds a day. I feed him at roughly $2.20 a pound. It's actually quite a bit left as I ran those numbers with roughly 25-ish pounds of meat left over as well. I would realistically say it's closer to $2.10 a pound. So, if you do the math, monthly, it costs me roughly $141.75 to feed Atlas raw a month. There are a few other things that haven't been factored in like supplements and various other things like ziplock baggies, but for Atlas, I actually found it roughly as expensive as premium kibble. Moreover, his IBD really wasn't manageable with anything else that I've found. If that seems manageable and is something you'd be interested in, I would love to chat with you more about it! At the end of the day, if that seems like something you want to do, then I'm happy to chat about it! If not, the things listed above can also make a world of difference.  Edit: The most \"important\" supplement of all I think is the fermented veggies &amp; raw goats milk or kefir. These foods supply amazing natural probiotics.

On another note, I am super grateful to the people who were my friends at the time of Atlas' puppyhood. We have since then fallen out, but I am grateful for the time they helped me. What I will say though, outside of my significant other at the time, I ended up, after 2-3 months not letting people interact with my dog outside of friendly visits. I no longer could stand how people were NOT following my instructions when interacting with my puppy. This isn't me being anally retentive.

However, I will do anything for his happiness and I will do everything in my power that is best for him-- even if that means saying goodbye. I'm sure your husband loves your dog very much and I hope that he has a similar view. I would start by keeping a journal of the good days and the bad days. Personally, I think it becomes an easier conversation when you can look at numbers. I would also try to have this conversation at the end of a not-so-good day. It's easier to put the thoughts away when the dog is having a good day. It's easier to sort of say \"no no. it's fine. see, she played today.\" In this way, we tend to sort of try to lie to ourselves. At the end of a bad day, there is the stark reality that we have to face: there are now bad days. I think that \"well, we need to kill the dog soon.\" is the furthest thing from your attitude! It seems like, more than anything, you don't want to see her suffering. Personally, I'd try really hard to use gentle language. \"Honey, I know that you love dog name very much. I do, too.

She wasn't happy that day...\" Everyone is going to go about it differently, but that's where I'd come from. I do think it's really important to talk about all of this before you get to *that point*. For me, I would also have the discussion of \"long life\" vs. \"good life\". I am, and always will be, team \"good life.\" For me, it means more in my dogs last days for him to be going to his favorite places like the beach, eating Rib-Eye Steak, and receiving all the nuzzles and kisses in the world. Unfortunately, some of that just isn't enjoyable if you wait too long. I don't want my dog on his deathbed hanging on for dear life when there's not even a quality of it left and going out in a shadow of what his life was.

I was really happy with the experience because he was one of my closest friends of four years. I don't think I could have thought of anyone else that I would have trusted more in the vulnerable situation. I think one of the most important things is to be able to laugh off the blunders. I know that it might sound really intimidating, but in all honesty, that's a lot of what sex is. There are sounds and fluids and lots of different un-glamorous things that happen during sex that no one talks about. Sometimes things don't fit. Sometimes, during the heat of the moment, you sneeze. Things happen. It's important to be able to laugh things off and not let it affect your self esteem after. The first time, things didn't quite fit right. It really blew a hole in my self esteem, as silly as it sounds. I was also 17 so I really couldn't find a way to talk to him about it. I was lucky that he was super understanding regardless, but a few years later, when we got back together, we did talk about it. We agreed it was silly. Yet, sexually, we're put under so much pressure to \"please the guy\" (ugh) that we get all nervous about it. At the end of the day, in the many years to come, I hope you can explore your sexuality and find it to be fun! Because, contrary to popular belief (ugh), it is also fun for women! * Use protection. * Try to relax. I know that this is almost pointless to say because it's difficult to relax in this situation, but relaxing will get the \"juices flowing\" if ya catch my drift * You can stop the session at any point in time you feel uncomfortable. I've done it. \"Babe, I'm sorry. I don't really feel good about this right now. It's not you. I just don't feel in the mood. Can we cuddle for a bit?\" * Don't underestimate the importance of aftercare (particularly because it's your first time). Cuddle. It's nice. Regardless of all that's happened, it's nice. * Cleanup. These days, I always shower after. I don't like being sticky and it's just my prerogative. * Don't be afraid to talk about it. Honestly, so many adults having sex are afraid to talk about sex afterwards. It's really good to get in to the habit early. Sex isn't shameful or taboo. In fact, you'd be talking about it with the person you just did it with! Obviously this is really hardcore and I would suggest some lighter version of it like \"oh I liked when you did this with your hands...\", but my SO and I have recap sessions in the shower of what we liked and didn't like to make future sex better for us both! So much of sex is communication. Edit: Also, as silly as it sounds, if you are young and both a bit inexperienced, I would try to use \"praise, polish, praise\" language. I know that my SO wasn't exactly confident when we started out and it's important to communicate while fostering an environment for further communication. His feelings can get hurt, too. I say this, because, after the first time, it's usually a whole lot of \"that hurt\" which is useful, but if he's a bit sensitive, may make him feel inadequate due to stupid societal standards. * Don't be afraid to say \"ow\". If it hurts, seriously. Let him know, otherwise you might be feeling it a couple of days after. * Lube! There's nothing wrong with using a bit of lube to make things go smoother (no pun intended). It's really useful to have on hand and you won't regret it. Remember to use a type that is compatible with the condom you'll be using (if you're using one). At the end of the day, it's a whole list of tips. The most important thing is to try to relax, communicate, and enjoy it for what it is. ", "link_id": "t3_8bc31n", "time": 1523442581}}

I may not be going this year, but it never fucking hurts to get a reality check and to try to keep others safe. For those of you that are at all curious, the most common Roofie drug is Rohypnol. It is in a drug class called Benzodiazepines. There are about a dozen other drugs in this class and any of them will work for a roofie. When combined with alcohol, users are often known to black out, but their bodies remain conscious. This is what allows the predato (I honestly have no other fucking words for this.) to guide the victim away with little to no struggle. To most other people, it may look like a friend taking someone who's had too much home. There's often not kicking and screaming, nor is there a person collapsing and being needed to be carried out. They're often \"walking out themselves\" with their future rapist. It's really scary. As a person that takes Benzodiazepines medically, it is a very well known rule amongst patients **never** mix alcohol. The same effects can actually be achieved with a high enough dose of certain benzos (other ones just make you fall asleep) without alcohol involved at all, but booze is a fastrack way to blackout town. People have known to drive their cars off cliffs in this combination. Never be too careful ladies. Don't accept drinks from strangers that you haven't seen the bartender pour.

{"dwykw4z": {"text": "I have a pretty laissez-faire dog parenting style, so that's something to consider before reading my response. To me, as long as no one is hurt and they're not fighting, I don't really care. I didn't care when my dog was only 25 pounds, and I don't care now that he's 80 pounds. That being said, with this approach, it is ultra important to know your dog and keep watch. My dog makes some pretty guttural sounds when playing. In fact, sometimes his hackles even stand up, but I know what he looks like when I need to step in. I also know how much my dog can handle. Although this was still my attitude at 25 pounds, there was a pile of 2 boxers and one roughly 30 pound pit-mix dog-piling him and you bet I stepped in and pulled them off of him. So, if it were me, just a yelp is not a huge deal. However, as the person with the bigger dog, I always take care to communicate my apologies to the person with the smaller dog as it's important to acknowledge that not everyone shares the same philosophy. I'd start an open dialogue about what they're comfortable with and use it to map out possible interactions in the future. I think that communicating with other dog owners during play is super essential and not necessarily talked about enough! I know Atlas has a pretty \"scary\" playstyle to some people that are just not comfortable with it. That's totally cool with me, and I would rather have that established before something they're not cool with happens. Since you have had your pup for about a month or so and he's a year and a half old, I will be writing under the assumption that you adopted him. (You're super awesome for that!) It hasn't been too long, and since you aren't too sure of his habits yet, I personally would limit his interactions to bigger dogs (for now) to assess if he has a short fuse, his \"warning signs\" when playing with other dogs, and his general behavior. Although we can all google \"dog warning signs\", every pup is an individual and, like I said, mine happens to display a lot of them in normal play. After that, I'd work on introducing smaller dogs. All of that aside, what signs were there that your dog was being protective of you? Was he lying very still? Hyper-focused eyes? What was the behavior of the other dog like? Was the dog a younger puppy? Some dogs just don't get along with puppies (they tend to be annoying). Was he disrespecting your dogs space? The leash scenario may also have made it \"too much too soon\". They weren't quite free to move toward or away from one another as they wanted and were sort of forced in to bubbles one each others spaces, which isn't always great. How long was the Cockapoos head in your dogs mouth? Long enough for you to observe it in there? Usually a nip is just that, a nip. It seems like your dog might be a dog with a shorter fuse based on this interaction. That's totally cool. It's not a bad thing, people have short tempers and that's fine. What's really important here is that your dog knew to be gentle, which is good. That being said, it is still a concern for the future until you get to know him a lot better. Something I would take note of is the fact that although your dog is aware of the need to be gentle, he might not be \"gentle enough\". There is a chance that this was just his \"nipping strength\" and he uses it as a default for all dogs. Has he displayed spacial awareness before? I know that mine actually takes on an entirely different playstyle with smaller dogs. He doesn't wrestle them. He moreso hits them gently with his paws... which not a lot of them like but hey, it's safe. I know it's a lot of questions and a lot to think about, and gets more stressful as the scenario slips further and further in to memory.

{"dwsipzy": {"text": "Hi there! I'm going to offer a little bit of a different perspective. You've gotten some super strong responses so far, but you've taken them in stride and even went as far as to say \"yes people are passionate about dogs\", and I think that shows a lot of maturity. I'm going to start by saying, I got my dog at 19 in college. I am going to be graduating this Spring and I'm fortunate to have my family to fall back on if need be. I will never ever say I regret getting Atlas. Atlas has quite actually saved my life. I owe everything to him. He's taught me how to love again and has given me light to my life. He's helped me cope with my severe mental illness diagnosis and he is everything to me. With all of that said, I never recommend getting a dog to college students. Honestly, based on your responses, you seem very collected and a lot more prepared to own a dog than most dog owners. You aren't belligerent or stubborn in your replies and very open to what we have to say. I think that shows malleability and gentle heartedness that will be very useful in raising a dog. Based on this alone, in my opinion, you are already a league above the average dog owners. Unfortunately, I have little faith in the average dog owner. It sounds like you genuinely want to provide a good life for this dog and want a companion and honestly, I don't think there is anything wrong with that. I will now give my spiel about why getting a dog in college is a bad idea- by a person who got a puppy in college. Atlas was so much work. The responsibility of having this little life in my hands at 19 years old was horrifying. It was exciting but so terrifying at the same time. I own a German Shepherd, which unfortunately, comes with implications. My biggest fear was failing him as a dog owner, him growing up to be fear reactive, biting someone, and me having to put him down and lose him. I would have nightmares about it. It was so scary. To have a little life in my hands at 19 was world shaking. Everything this dog does and everything this dog becomes will be your responsibility. This includes even if he/she turns out to be fear reactive. As long as you understand that, it's fine. I'm a hardcore introvert (kinda comes with my illness), so I really hate leaving my apartment. I just do not like it. It worked out for me and my pup, but at least for the first year, there is no going out to the bar with friends. There is no spontaneous outings after school. In fact, for me, there was coming back with a 20 minutes drive in-between classes to check on him and let him out as a young puppy. It was exhausting. On top of all of that, I have to stress that I was not sleeping because he was crying at night and I was panicking about all the responsibility the rest of the time. On top of all of this, I had to keep up with my studies. To say I took a hit that quarter would be to say the least. It works out now that Atlas is over a year and a half and is pretty independent now. I can go out every once in a while if I want, but I usually don't. This was unthinkable when he was young. Additionally, if you have your living situation and a job nailed down after graduation, I see no issue financial-wise. This is a HUGE worry for college students getting dogs.I see so many of my peers being ... not great dog owners. I don't generally like to judge people, but I see people carrying like 4 week old puppies and putting them on the ground like every other week at school. It's probably why you're getting so many negative responses-- because that is just sort of the pool of peers we're working from. Yet, I like to fancy myself a pretty good dog owner... at least I'm okay. I want the best for my dog. I love him to pieces. I spend so much time with him. I want him to be happy. He is a sickly pup and I try my best to maintain his health, even if it requires me to spend a ridiculous amount of time and money on his diet. All that is to say, yes, I think there are good dog owners in college. Getting a dog is so stressful. Again, I will never ever say I regret getting Atlas, but if you're looking for a pup to come home to that loves you, have you considered fostering? You can help a pup in need and he/she will be equally as happy to see you at the end of the day! Plus, since you haven't owned a dog before, you could think of it as dog ownership lite. You're fostering so you're helping him/her find his/her forever home and you'll likely start with an adult dog instead of a puppy with the responsibility of this living creature on your shoulders. That being said, based on a quick skim, it looks like a golden or poodle may be a good fits for you. I am also a huge fan of the bernese moutain dog.

He's not the worst dog, but he spent the first 5 months of his life peeing on all the vet techs, the following 5 months bolting for the door whenever he had the chance, and only now is he getting a tiny bit better.

{"dwmg3fs": {"text": "Hey there! I'm going to echo what everyone else said and encourage you to hit up your veterinary nutritionist. That being said, a raw diet is something that I personally believe in. I know it's not for everybody, but my pooch has a lot of digestive issues and this is just about the only thing that has worked for us and he's not in danger of malnutrition, so that's all I could ask for. I'm going to preface all of what I'm about to say with the words again: I am not a veterinary nutritionist and before you make any major changes in your dogs diet, you should see one-- particularly because you are considering feeding a Dal raw. Now here goes: There are two camps of raw: pre-made and DIY. Because you are feeding a Dalmatian, your pup has special dietary needs. It means that while pre-made is an option of course, you would have less control in it and might need to mess with it in other ways. I fed pre-made for a while, but ultimately decided to go DIY because I wanted more control over Atlas' diet because of his sensitive GI system. The first step to feeding DIY Raw is this is this: **There is no AAFCO balancing your dog's meals. This is entirely your responsibility.** This can be really scary actually. It really scared me for a long time. Not only was there the financial aspect to juggle, but nutrition was all on me. If something went wrong in his GI system, it was going to be my fault. DIY Raw feeding requires **a LOT** of hands on time. It's significantly harder than just throwing a chicken breast in a bowl. It's hunting down pancreas and kidney at a reasonable price and setting apart multiple hour blocks during the week to slice and dice meat. I took apart two turkeys, a chicken, and a duck this week. Not only that, you have to get a separate freezer. I know no one really has to do anything, but trust me when I say a separate freezer will save you a fortune in the long run because you will be trying to buy like 20 pounds of meat from the grocery store at once. Even more up in the air is that your pup is 5 months old. That means puppy nutrition. For a raw feeder, that means every single day has to be balanced. Most people do weekly balance, and that's okay for adult dogs, but for puppies, daily balance is crucial. The numbers for puppies are constantly changing too, his weight will have to be monitored like a hawk so that food ratios can be adjusted. You will likely be feeding BARF instead of PREY model. That mens a STRICT 70/10/5/5/10. Additionally, because of the purine levels [this](https://www.rfas.uk/raw-feeding-dalmatians) will be your bible. One of the hugest issues with this is that the list incorporates basically every type of liver, and liver is essential to a dog's diet. This is a perfect example of something to take up with a veterinary nutritionist. On top of avoiding all of those high in purine things, you need to provide enough variety to the dog to have a balanced diets. In the end, I feed raw because it is what I believe in. I feel like my dog is getting nutrition that I am proud to feed him and he is really happy I think. Most important of all, he is healthy. It is A LOT of work. I just prepped ~3 months worth of food over the last week. The cost is comparable to premium kibble (because I am familiar with deals in my area), but it probably took me a cumulative of 24 hours to get it all done. I also had to drive like 4 cities over to a warehouse to get a good enough deal on some meats. I'll say it again. It's A LOT of work and A LOT of responsibility. There's something really uplifting for me to know exactly what I'm feeding Atlas so I can tweak the amounts based on his bowel movements (he has IBD), but it is also a lot of pressure to get it right.", "link_id": "t3_88kljk", "time": 1522583190}}

I like that their treats are super high quality and simply just dried proteins. They also come with chews which are essential, and they rotate every month so it's always exciting! Plus, they account for allergies. * Pet Insurance: This is probably the most must-have on this list for me. I know there are different camps on it, but it's saved me like $3000 in little under year and a half I've had it. It's awesome. * Crate: Again, this is a choice some people choose to take and one that others don't. Atlas has learned to love his crate from a young age and it keeps him out of trouble when I cannot watch him. Trust me, at one point, he was a 5 month old German Shepherd puppy and that is just not something I would recommend leaving home alone to eat furniture. * **NATURES MIRACLE.** ", "link_id": "t3_8873vr", "time": 1522382170}}

There isn't necessarily a wrong or right here and I might say some things that are not the nicest to the opposing camp. I mean no offense. I just have strong beliefs. I like to compare it to the same choice for humans. What would I pick if I had a terminal illness? For my example, I will use cancer. I would weigh the odds. I would see what the chances were of chemotherapy and my god I would try it. I would do what I could to try to get better, but there comes a point where I would reach a crossroads or choosing long life or good life. (Example of human being sick, NOT dog) The selfless act is go to choose long life. The people around you and your family members will be grateful for it because, to me, death is not painful for the dying. It is painful for the ones left behind. It would be more selfless of me to try to fight the disease to my last day. Unfortunately, as much as I want that, I also know that I only have the one life. If I have a terminal illness, I only have a limited amount of days and I do not want to spend them miserable from chemo. I do not want to spend them eating gross food I don't like. I don't want to spend them in a hospital. (Example of human being sick, NOT dog) To me, a good life would be a selfish choice. Sometimes, in the one life we have, we have to pick the selfish choice. I don't define my life by what would make others happy. At the end of the day, I want to live a life that makes me happy. In my last days, I want to be traveling. I want to be having sex. I want to be gorging myself on sushi and burgers. I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can, because that one shot at life is all I have. I would hope my family and friends would understand that. Now, our pups don't have that choice. It is up to us to make that decision for them and it's a huge one. Atlas has IBD and he is only a year and a half. It will only get worse with time. We're managing right now amazingly and I am so happy we've found something that works for us. However, I will never allow him to suffer just to prolong my time with him. I think that's really selfish of me. By god, he will spend his last days catching a ball, swimming at a beach, and frolicking. Medicine is amazing. It can extend the life or both humans and animals. The price we pay is that there is a point that the medicine does so at a cost of quality for length. For both me and my pup, no matter how fucking painful it will be to see him go, I choose quality.

{"dwcn5xi": {"text": "Hey! I got Atlas in college and I think I have some pretty valuable insight to share. Overall, I will never regret getting Atlas. He's changed my life and helped me overcome various mental health issues. He's stuck by my side and he is incredible, but I would generally never recommend college students get dogs for these reasons: * You guys are looking to get a dog as a group. The main issue with this is hashing up responsibilities: training, vet bills, food costs, and worst of all: who will get the dog after school. Training a dog also requires consistency otherwise the dog will get confused. It gets even more difficult if it's a puppy in question. Even if all of the responsibilities are discussed beforehand, everyone sort of has an emotional stake. For me, I assumed ALL financial responsibility (toys, vet bills, pet insurance, food, everything) so I had autonomy to dictate training and play regimens and such. When everyone has an even stake, it becomes much harder to come to consensus. * Situation after college is also a hard one. On top of who is going to get the dog after school, we all have to look for jobs when we graduate. I'm graduating this Spring, but I'm fortunate enough to have a family to fall back on if I need. If this isn't the case for you guys, the added financial burden of a dog and renting difficulties will be a hurdle in your newly graduated life. * Not having time for the dog is also an issue. Honestly, in college, a lot of dogs get neglected. Lots of people get them, but unfortunately, many people don't end up putting in the time to training or spending with the pup. In college, we have things like parties, school, interviews, etc. As a complete homebody, it kind of works out for me. The only times I ever leave my house are to go to school, the store, and various meat markets because my dog is raw fed. Other than that, my dog has plenty of time to spend with me. This isn't the case with a lot of dogs owned in college (and adulthood tbh). You would think that with multiple parties owning the dog, it'd be easier, but much of the time it isn't. * A dog can also be limiting on social life. Of course, every situation is different, but if you have a dog, there's a lot less possibility of finishing up class and going straight out for a night out with the guys/girls/whatever. After school, I don't get to go out for drinks ever. I've been at school all day and it's time to go home and love Atlas. He deserves it and I do. Ultimately, there's a lot of warning signs. Unfortunately, all of these issues combined with seeing so many poorly trained dogs that my peers own, has made me lose a lot of faith in my fellow college student owners. I see one or two 8-10 week old puppies at school every week. They're obviously too young to be out without their shots and it's not a good sign. I also see tons of people having their dogs out in 85+ degree weather (I live in a desert). There's a lot of people that I don't think did very much research. Don't get me wrong, I have met awesome owners as well, but they feel far an in-between. On the bright side though, it seems like you guys are all really good guys that honestly don't want to harm a pup at all costs, so I do believe that if you choose to go with a pup, that you'll be responsible. So yeah, consider all of the points and assess what you guys will think is best. I will say it again. I will never ever say I regret getting Atlas. He has quite actually saved my life and taught me how to love life again, but he has been the most difficult task and the biggest responsibility I have ever taken on.

A lot of people don't like pet insurance because people usually end up paying much more than they get back. This is the business model of pet insurance and the reason why the pet insurance industry can afford to sustain itself. I think the most important thing about pet insurance is knowing you're paying for peace of mind. For some people though, like me, it's crazy worth it. I have never had Healthy Paws give me any issues whatsoever. Everything has been to the T and I am pet insurance's worst nightmare. [This](https://imgur.com/a/dDnPo) cutie patootie is Atlas. If you look at the background, you'll likely notice it looks vaguely like a vets office, and that is because it is the vets office. Atlas has been through the ringer. He's only a bit over a year and a half, but he's been in and out of the vets office so many times I can't count. He's had to get multiple blood panels done and has already had to go through minor surgery. He's not a healthy pup by any means, but I love him to pieces. My policy has been active since October of 2016. Atlas was around 12 weeks at the time of me purchasing pet insurance. Around this time, he did have a giardia bout that Pet Insurance did not cover due to waiting period. This is the only (very very minor) \"problem\" I have ever had with them. It was just unfortunate timing and I do not fault Healthy Paws at all. **Here is my policy outline:** &gt; Policy start date: 10/28/16 &gt; Annual Deductible: $100 &gt; Reimbursement rate: 90% &gt; Monthly: $71.44 Using these details, I have thus far paid Healthy Paws 16 months worth of monthly payments totaling **$1143.04**. This may sound like a lot, but you are not even ready for the bulk of it. **Here are my claims details:** &gt; Number of claims I've filed to date: 11 &gt; Total covered amount: $4820.40 &gt; **Total amount reimbursed: $4138.36** (subtracted $200 for two annual deductibles) &gt; **Amount I paid: $682.04** &gt; **Amount I paid + monthly installments: $1825.08**To be perfectly frank. I could not have afforded to pay four thousand dollars in vet bills over the course of roughly 16 months. That just is so mind blowing to me. A lot of people can put away a monthly fund and that works perfectly for them! For me, this works. Now, I should waive off some things about what pet insurance is not. I love pet insurance, but I won't oversell it. Those totals do not include the examination fee ($30) per vet visit, nor do they include vaccinations, nor do they include the spay/neuter. They have, however, covered everything else. I'm talking the time when Atlas swallowed an obstruction and they needed to open him up. I'm talking a biopsy. I'm talking extensive blood work.

It won't take you away. * Know that bipolar is a lifelong condition. * Begin tracking your moods! It'll be really helpful to understand your own patterns better. * Set up a support network.

{"dvmekvk": {"text": "Hi! Owner of a washed out GSD SD here. I feel you. I see really successful GSDs working as SDs from time to time and I think it's really fucking awesome. I actually saw an incredible Malinois a few weeks back that was trained to detect epilepsy. Because of him, his handler could operate a motorized vehicle safely. It's awesome. At the end of the day, breeds are just breeds and dogs are individuals. You're right. I don't think an entire breed should be written off, but I think, when looking for an SD, you want to maximize your chances at a successful one. It is so very easy to wash out, and for good reason. That woman's Mal absolutely cannot be distracted on his job. If he is, and she is driving, she could get seriously injured. They wash out for the smallest of infractions because they cannot afford to not be perfect. This includes mental fortitude, physical fortitude (health), and much more. German Shepherds are known for being really in tune with their owners (someone should really notify my dog about this) and that's great! It's one of the traits that's desired. But they're also known for their reactivity, which is not great. One undeniable thing the breed is known for is having really shitty health. It sucks. I hate it. The thing is, SDs can wash out due to health reasons very easily. Unfortunately, HD and ED is super common in the breed. A service dog cannot perform if he is having health issues him/herself. The pain itself is a distraction. Now, bring it back around... I'm not generalizing and lowering it down to say \"every single GSD would make a bad SD\". All I'm saying is, it's really really easy for a SD to wash out (for good reason) and their jobs are no joke. In this extremely difficult and rigorous process, it would be advisable to attempt to choose a dog to maximize the chances of success. ", "link_id": "t3_83xu2x", "time": 1520936901}}
{"dvmedz8": {"text": "There are actually several programs set up that match shelter dogs that they vet for proper temperament with potential owners. They also sponsor training and the cost of the dog. [Here](http://www.sheltertosoldier.org/) is a fantastic example. Although this is for veterans, it's the basic idea. [Here](https://freedomservicedogs.org/) is another really cool example as well. I actually met a girl diagnosed with schizophrenia that got her dog through a program like this and her dog is absolutely incredible at her job. There is still a lot of handler training involved, but it's usually guided by experienced service dog trainers. Also, as the owner of a service-dog-GSD-washout. They are not fabulous for the task generally. I love my pup to the ends of the earth, but he does not have what it takes and that's okay. Also, he doesn't seem to want to do that job, but my shepherd just happens to be a lazy potato. Also, the extreme health issues that come with the breed can serve as a huge hinderance to the SD job. I am not comfortable with my familiarity with Aussies to comment on them. When looking for a SD, you're going to want to maximize your chances of getting a functioning working SD. Above all else, SDs are granted the privileges they are because they are necessary tools for the persons' wellbeing. This isn't to say they are just tools. I don't mean that at all. They're also wonderful and loving companions, but any dog you get will be a wonderful and loving companion. The narrower focus right now is maximizing your chances of getting a good service dog. So many of them wash out. It takes a lot of grit and a lot of skill to become a service dog along with, unfortunately, a good amount of luck. Thus, when selecting one, it is not recommended that you go for a breed you like, but a breed that yields the best chances of success. ", "link_id": "t3_83xu2x", "time": 1520936441}}

I find my SO's presence really comforting during times of crisis, but that's after years and years of practice and building up my trust with him (an issue I have). I think a really important part of it all is my boyfriend and I talk so much, about everything, endlessly for hours. We even do sex recaps so we know how to better communicate and move forward as a team. I'm not saying this level of communication is easy or even natural, but it really helps. When one of my episodes ends, I'll sit down with him holding me and talk to him about it. I'll tell him how I felt and I'll tell him what we could have done better so we can prepare for the future. I cannot stress enough how much can come from just being open with one another. I think there will be a person and a level of relationship above all that a person can make you comfortable. It's been really rough but mine has talked me out of climbing on to a rooftop by simply promising to take me to Taco Bell once I came out. It came from a place of undeniable trust. I knew that anyone else in their right mind would have taken me to the psych ward and I should have probably gone to the psych ward, but he promised me Taco Bell and I knew he was going to take me there. Trust during anxiety attacks and episodes starts outside of those episodes. Trust in the other person begins every single day and builds up by being there for each other every single day.

We've been dating for a cumulative of about a year, but I honestly don't even attribute that as the important part or our relationship. Our friendship has been the basis of it all. Everyone experiences anxiety attacks differently. Mine don't really result in anger as much as full on meltdowns. My meltdowns are pretty obvious like shaking and such and things, but if he doesn't notice, we have a signal. He's also really good at reading just me. He is an Aspie, so this doesn't apply to everyone, but he's worked really hard over the last 7 years to pick up on my cues. Also, my Bipolar Disorder sort of makes my emotions more glaringly obvious than the average person's, which helps. How I stop myself from snapping during irritable spells is that I talk to him. I'll actually say things like \"Babe, I love you so much. I know you know that. But right now, I really need you to shut up and for us to stop talking. I'm not mad at you. I just know that if we keep doing this right now, I'm going to blow my top.\" He accepts this. We talk later. It's cool. As far as reminding him about insensitive comments, it's pretty hard for me to say. He and I have a type of relationship where we call one another fat like 10 times a day, but promise to love each other when we are giant yoga balls that the other has to roll down the stairs. That being said, I, like all people, have my sensitive spots. Honestly, direct communication. \"Please stop that. It hurts my feelings\" is a pretty direct one. I don't see the point in trying to send signals, and even less so with my partner. Don't forget his needs too. For example, I'm sensitive to his need to stim. The fidgeting used to annoy the crap out of me, but I have accepted it. As I always say in all of these types of questions: it's not that different from two neurotypicals in a relationship.

I have a size of ACG 07 KMTRS that are in a 6.5 mens that fit me perfectly, but I managed to find a pair of vapormaxes (!!!?!?!?!) at my local Nike Outlet in a size 6.5 mens as well, but no matter how hard I tried, my foot was not going to get in to that shoe.

{"dv0cfz5": {"text": "Alright. I'm not going to invalidate your feelings. I'm not going to tell you how to feel. I'm really sorry that this happened to you two. However, your reply does come across as a little bit condescending and holier than thou to a person that has actually experienced the illness.&gt; My fiance is out of psychosis and coming out of his mania and is extremely sorry for everything he did. He definitely wasn't truly making his own decisions, he had no idea what was going on in his head because this was going on in his head because this was his first time being manic. Yes, we do get really sorry for what we do when we are in our states. It really sucks. I come out and realize that I've lashed out and cursed at my boyfriend. I've treated him like shit because I couldn't control myself. And yes, I get really fucking sorry after because I feel like garbage. The thing is, I still did it and I still have to take credit for it. Just because I wasn't in my right mind doesn't mean it didn't happen. I wouldn't describe it as not knowing what I was doing as much as not being able to control what I was doing. However, we do all experience the illness differently and it is very possible that his and my experiences have manifested in different ways. &gt;  You made me believe I didn't know my closest friend of 7 years at all when I actually knew exactly why he was doing everything, even in his madness. My SO and I have also known each other for 7 years. He knows when I'm acting out and he knows when something is up. He does not invalidate what I'm doing just because I'm in a state. He knows my truths are in the moment and regards them as such. He takes me at face value for who I am at that moment in time. He knows that \"stable sophie\" wouldn't have done that, but \"manic sophie\" or \"depressed sophie\" did. All of these are faces of the identity of Sophie as a whole and he does not pick and choose to only love stable me. He chooses to love me in my entirety, which means taking me in any state at face value. These states make up a part of my life and I don't appreciate the way you used \"madness\". It's a little bit offensive. We are always \"mad\" and we are always \"insane\". By definition, a person with bipolar and psychosis (including your fiancee) is permanently a clinically insane person. There is not one state of madness.  &gt; He thought I put him in the hospital for no reason and he wanted to make me suffer. That's something between you and your SO. Given your description, the hospital was the right call. If this was his first manic episode, he's likely still coming to terms with the illness. The psychiatric ward is not a place of punishment. It is not a place that we are sent because we have \"gone crazy\". It is a place we go when we know we need help. It is a place we go when people we love know we need help. &gt; He also made a big deal out of me slapping him because of that. To me, a slap is a big deal. I truly am sorry if I misunderstood your situation and the value you attribute to it. If my significant other hit me because I was acting manic, even out of the state, I would leave him. Please do understand though, the delusions and god complex(es) can very much happen again and there are more appropriate ways to react. While I have been in a mixed state, I have absolutely placed blame and taken things much further than \"stable me\" would have intended. Emotions are high and everything is amplified by like a hundred fold. I can take things way too far, but I always come back and say I'm really fucking sorry after. I may have done it while I was manic or depressed or whatever, but I still did it. I still have to apologize for it. I may have taken it too far because I was manic, but it doesn't excuse the fact that I did and deeply hurt my partner by blowing something out of proportion. &gt; I was a wreck for days because you implied he was consciously making the decision to 'fall in love with someone else in the psych ward'.Again, I'm really sorry you felt that way. I, in no way, intended for you to take it that way. I can see now that my language was a a bit aggressive and I do apologize for that. What I meant to say is that, in the moment, he could have believed wholeheartedly he was falling in love because he was manic. That's the thing about bipolar. Our truths fluctuate from stage to stage. And please, do not belittle a person with the illness when I say from knowing what mania is like firsthand, that having someone else to vibrate off of mania with is intense and incredible. In my opinion, this is not love. However, it can be love in the moment. **In closing, don't let an internet stranger tell you what to do in your own relationship. If what you think you're doing is right and working, then by all means, continue. I will say this though, if this is his first manic episode, there is a very long road of self discovery for him regarding his illness. It's a road of (no pun intended) many ups and many downs and it is not an easy one. I've wanted to die multiple times and I've had feelings like I was the highest person in the world multiple times. If you're going to say my advice is shitty, that is your opinion and that is fine, but /u/Lucifursmom raises a really valid point in getting couples counseling and I hope you listen to her.** ", "link_id": "t3_7wbrdl", "time": 1519899999}}

That's $700 for the 10 months. The price tag on the surgery is $3000. I already had used the deductible, but for the sake of making it just about this surgery, we'll pretend I didn't. I still would have gotten $2600 back for this procedure alone. To date, I have filed a total of 11 claims. They have covered a total of ($4820.40).

I'm not going to say this is going to work for everybody. In fact, most people end up losing money. The reason pet insurance still makes money and is still going today is because most of the time, people are just paying for the peace of mind that if something happens, they'll be protected.

I love him more than anything, and when the Vet wants to run a really expensive blood test, I can say \"yes\" without a second thought because that's how I am with him.

This is only a lull, and it will get better. I'm sorry if this is about to be super long winded, I just have a lot of feelings on the subject.I work in the field in stigma reduction. Stigma from other people hurts, but it doesn't even compare to stigma from within. I cannot stress that enough. It fucking sucked when my mom said \"no. our family doesn't have those types of problems\" and basically just dismissed my condition. You know what sucked more though? Sitting and crying and looking at my first orange pill bottle and just thinking \"I don't want this. I don't want this. I do not want this.\" It bred a sense of self hate and shame in me that was awful. \"Oh god I'm not normal\". I start my presentations with, \"Hello, I'm Sophie, and I am a certifiably insane crazy psycho person.\" I do this, not only for shock value, but because it's true. All of those words do attribute to who I am, but none of them mean what the stigma says they mean. I do my best to prove that in my talk. So, what the hell? What if you're a certifiably insane crazy psycho person? I am, too. I'm damn well fucking proud. Do I wish I didn't have BD? Yes. Am I really hesitant at the thought of my future children having it? Yes. Do I hate it about myself? Only when I'm having a bad downswing. When I'm stable, it's cool. I get up every day and I live my life. Some days, it's too hard and I need to stop. I postponed an exam last week and I have to schedule to retake it tomorrow. I felt really shitty doing it, but my depression was taking it's toll and I needed to. It's just a small moment. It'll be just fine. Every single day, I fight my BD along with the ocean of other stuff I'm diagnosed with. It doesn't make me who I am, but it's been a part of me for as long as I've known. Look, I'm only ever going to be me. You god damned fucking bet I'm going to love me. That means my illness too. I hate bipolar, yes I do, but you know what? Bipolar has taught me what real love looks like. It looks like loving the same person when I'm manic, depressed, stable, anything. Bipolar has taught me humility and how to swallow my pride when I fucked up a friendship because of an outburst. Bipolar has taught me to appreciate every single good moment I have. Bipolar taught me that I was a god damned fucking warrior every single day of my life fighting a battle I didn't even know existed. There is so much more that it has taught me. Recovery doesn't just happen to people like us, we need to choose it every day. I think that acceptance is the first step towards recovery and you've been strong and brave enough to fight this for almost 30 years already. You can do this. Now for your questions: &gt; I came to accept it by realizing that I was the exact same person before I got diagnosed and after. I just had an explanation for why I was so \"crazy\". I still had no excuse for them of course, just an explanation. I accepted it because there is no point in denying it. I don't dwell. If the circumstances are unchangeable, I make the best of it. &gt; I didn't know at all. I went in because I was having attention issues. &gt; Medication, sleep, my dog, my loving boyfriend, self love, and stopping to breathe when I need to.  &gt;  I explain it if I want to.

On Socialization and GSD Temperament Issues: I was blessed with a GSD with a wonderful temperament. It actually could work for SD training, but ultimately, it wasn't something that he himself wanted to do. Socialization is crucial in any dog and every single breed can benefit from it, but GSD's are notorious for temperament issues. They tend to be one person dogs yes, but they're also aloof and \"too cool for you\". Although they're insanely loyal, if I were you, I wouldn't roll the dice on this one. On sharper looking breeds: This is actually somewhat of a drawback when it comes to SD's. I face a tremendous amount of backlash for owning a GSD, just as many GSD, Pit, Doberman, etc. owners will tell you. People cross the street and look away. I know that SD's need to be allowed places by law, but there are more hoops to navigate here and people tend to be very apprehensive at first glance-- which is not great. Additionally, if you are looking for a SD, ultimately, you are looking for a health tool. I know that dogs are living creatures and beings, but you will bond and love any dog you end up with. When selecting a SD, you should be stacking the odds in your favor for the highest chances for a successful SD. Many SD's wash out and many for just the smallest of reasons. SD's Washing Out and GSD Health Conditions: Dogs with HD wash often out of Service Training because they it will end up encumbering their handlers and disrupting their jobs. There are dozens of other trivial reasons that SD's wash out, and I would not challenge myself in not getting the best breed possible for the job. Silence on Yard And Visitors: GSD's are territorial.

{"duh1kme": {"text": "Alright. Let me tell you a story about my dog and my mental health issues. Atlas has been the best thing ever for my severe Generalized Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, and Obsessive Compulsive Tendencies. He has provided me more companionship, love, support, and understanding than anything else in the world. He has stayed by my side no matter how horrible I've been. I love him more than anything. When I can't get out of bed, I do because someone has to feed him. I'm never lonely because he is always there. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Getting a puppy was unbelievably anxiety inducing. I would wake up in the middle of the night sobbing because I was afraid I wasn't going to be the dog mom he needed me to be. I would get overwhelmed with the ankle biting and the training. I would get frustrated and then anxious that things were not going right. Most of all though, I was afraid that I was going to fail him. All of that aside, 4 days ago, I hit a hardcore depressive episode (from bipolar). The stars aligned and Atlas has Giardia along with several other issues resulting in epic diarrhea. So, along with a depressive episode, I was waking up every 2 hours of the night to poop him. Whenever he'd rattle his crate, I wanted to scream. I would come home and he would have broken out of his crate and I would have to clean up the poop mess while I was already fucking exhausted from being depressed and having to go through my daily life. He still needs all the things he normally does even though I am down. He is not the type to just know when I'm upset and snuggle. He does snuggle, but not like that. It has been fucking hard. I'm lucky that my LDR SO came 2 days ago and has been caring for the both of us. Today, I slept roughly 15 hours because I'm just so fucking tired and I can't help it. He took care of him. Sometimes, the animal isn't enough and will actually hurt your mental health. Don't get me wrong. I love him more than anything in the universe, and any other week, the diarrhea would be unpleasant but not game-breaking. Any other week, the depression would be terrible, but not unmanageable.

I fold both sides of the aforementioned meat over the top of the pills, then I rotate it 90 degrees and fold another side over so only the opposite end is open. Atlas is trained to know that \"open\" means I want him to open his mouth (whether to take something out or to shove something in) so he knows what's coming. I will then present him his salami/pepperoni pill treat and stick it in there. I will cup both sides of his snout as he chews with my hands. When he is about done chewing, I will hold his snout closed with one hand, and use the other to stroke the throat until he swallows. I will check periodically by saying \"open\" and opening his mouth again to see if I can still see the pill. If I can still see it, we go back to shutting and stroking. I used to do this method with just sticking a pill in the back of his throat, but he would thrash about and give me a hard time. When I'm like 110 pounds and he's 75 pounds and has a much lower center of gravity, it's a pretty bad time for me. Thus, I wrap it in Salami and we are both happier.

{"du7uifn": {"text": "&gt; &gt; I just... I can't help him if he doesn't want to help himself,You nailed it on the head right there. We don't have a choice whether or not we live with BD, but we do get a choice on how we live with it. The thing is, I just don't think he's at a place with himself where he's going to be receptive to change or criticism yet. Unfortunately, the reality is, some people live their entire lives in denial and, although it is a personal choice, I would not wish it on anyone. I think a lot of people have an \"aha\" moment where they choose recovery, because that's the thing. Recovery doesn't just happen to a person. We have to choose it and work hard on it every day. I chose to see a psychiatrist one day because I had a lot of trouble reading a passage. I was getting really frustrated with my attention problems. I went in, got meds for anxiety, and a few months later, got medication for BD. I think that he just hasn't had that moment yet. Very unfortunately, for many people, that moment is the lowest point of their lives. I know for one of my peers, he states that it was in a psychiatric ward that he had that moment. Your post says that he thinks as long as in a psychiatric ward \"he is fine\". It sounds like if he does ever end up there, that would be a good example of an \"aha moment\". I do not wish this upon him, but I'm just trying to drive home that there has to be a point. (Also, psych wards are not bad places like media makes them out to be. It really sucks that they're depicted that way.) Usually, that moment also forces us out of denial. There comes a point in too bad of a mania spree where we've spent all of our money and wind up homeless that we are finally open to saying \"fuck. there is something wrong with me.\" Accepting that we are ill is one of the first steps to recovery. Accepting that I was ill and wanting to improve myself made me attempt to get as informed as possible. I consumed every bit of literature on bipolar that I could get my hands on because, above all, I was dedicated to learning about my condition and myself. I was determined to notice the signs and to find a better way for myself to live. I no longer wanted to feel like I didn't have control of my life or my own mind. I did not want any of that for myself anymore. I chose, day after day, to live positively and to track my moods. Again, it doesn't just happen... we have to make it happen. He does seem like he has a ton of internalized stigma. I understand that so much. I hated the term \"bipolar\" in the beginning. Before, I \"just\" had Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It wasn't \"too far from normal\", but bipolar was a \"big girl disease\". I use quotes to highlight just how deeply stigma was rooted in my own brain as well. The thing is, if we allow this stigma to infiltrate our minds and start accepting it in our own minds, recovery becomes near impossible. Instead of focusing on ourselves and improving ourselves, we are focused on self hate. Now, in regards to your questions at the end:  I reached the point of being more self aware not through a sudden choosing. It was a learning process. I chose I wanted to get better and began educating myself and observing my own behavior. It wasn't just a small thing. It really is a lifestyle change. Lastly, ultimately, I will say it again. From what you have posted, you are such a wonderful and caring person. But you're right, you can't help him if he doesn't want to help himself. ", "link_id": "t3_7x7muc", "time": 1518579852}}

You state that \"I'll never understand what bipolar is like because I've never experienced it\" and I think it is a very kind and open minded way of addressing our condition and I'm really grateful for people like you. **Now, on the two of you:** First, have you talked to him when he is stable about all of this? That would be step one. Communication is always step one. Thank you for always trying to support him and understanding his mood swings. From what I understand from the post, he was unmedicated, but now is. How does he act after these alcohol binging? Spending spree? Does he talk to you about them? Does he apologize? The thing about BD is that the disorder explains why we do things sometimes, but it does not excuse the behavior. If I cleaned my house while manic, my house is still clean after mania. If I spent 10 hours in bed watching netflix because I was depressed, after that time, I really did waste my entire day and have to make up the work. Bipolar should not be used as an excuse or used to dismiss bad actions. I think it's wonderful how understanding you are. My boyfriend is quite similar. I had an episode this weekend and he was unbelievably kind and understanding. I snapped at him a few times, but by the end of the night (the episode), when we were back home in my [safe place] and I had cooled down, I was in tears telling him I was sorry and I loved him and that I snapped because I was having an irritable downswing and I didn't want to spoil the day. Even as I'm typing it, it looks like racing thoughts. It was actually quickly turning in to depression as I blamed myself for ruining the day. He reacted perfectly and supportively and held me and assured me I hadn't ruined anything. You sound like the type of partner that would do exactly this and that is so admirable. However, does he react to himself after? Does he hold himself accountable? I know that a lot of this sounds like I'm ragging on him, and I do not mean to be this way at all. Jesus I see a lot of myself in him. I treated my old partner the way he and you interact and I recognize myself in him and his actions. I think that what really helped me become a better partner is that I became acutely self aware. Sometimes, I'll get sideswept, but generally, I know when either mania or depression are coming and I address as such. I tell my partner \"hey. I think I feel an upswing/downswing. I'm giving you a heads up.\" He knows how to react appropriately because we have communicated and practiced it. I don't think people with BD are much different when it comes to relationship requirements than other people. In some ways, we absolutely can be more difficult to date, but so much can be addressed with communication and caring about your partner. ", "link_id": "t3_7x7muc", "time": 1518519394}}
{"du6a54n": {"text": "I've been to Coachella! I wish I was going again this year, but unfortunately, ya girl is broke. Please do keep in mind that every single event is different so my responses will be different. This doesn't just include the lineup and venue, but also the weather, the time of day, and lots of other factors. &gt; What is the best one you ever attended?Coachella! &gt; Who performed at it? Lots of people. I went last year, so if you'd like you can look up the lineup for 2017 Coachella. &gt; Who are your favorite artists?   I'm going to go ahead and answer as if this means my favorite artists there: * Big Gigantic * Mura Masa * Kendrick Lamar * Porter Robinson &gt; How much did the concerts/festivals/raves cost? So much. ~$400 for the ticket, ~$80 for airbnb, ~$240 total for food, ~20(?) for locker plus the gas getting there. Festival'ing is a lot of YMMV. For example, if I had camped instead of stayed in an airbnb, I would have incurred less expenses because not only would I not have to pay for the airbnb, but I'd also be able to eat my meals at the campsite without compromising the opportunity to see someone I'd really like to. **Tips:** Honestly, it's a little bit difficult for me to give you tips if I don't know what type of event it is. A single event is a lot different from a 3 day festival. I will give tips based on single day event and if you will be attending a festival, you can let me know. * Read up on the venue's rules beforehand (what you can and can't bring) * You may be tempted to leave your wallet in your glove compartment. For the love of god make sure you remember your driver's license for when they ID you. It sounds dumb but trust me, I've done it. * If the venue allows it, nothing will be more helpful than a Camelbak. * Water is going to be something ludicrous like $3. If the venue does not allow you to bring your own water (again read the rules), for the love of god, purchase the water. I know it's ridiculously priced, but these events are HOT and you will be sweating, please don't get dehydrated. * If someone next to you looks dehydrated or fucked up and dehydrated, give them some of your water. It's just what we do. We don't want any bad stuff to happen to anyone. Dude can have some of my $3 water. * Go with a group of people you like * Dance like no one's watching because no one is * If you will be under any sort of influence, have a DD that you trust. Sometimes, in the heat of the night, people can end up being tempted and taking something and that is always bad when they're the DD (obviously). * It's going to be a lot less glamorous than you think it is. In all reality, there's a lot of sweat, no personal space, and a lot of bodies. Also please be careful not to end up in a mosh pit if you don't want to be there.

I will warn you though, 1/3 of the Berners my SO's family have had was a slobber-er. I don't think it would be super likely that a Berner would be as velcro-by-your-side as your Aussie is.

I would do almost anything to feel \"normal\". Although I absolutely don't agree with subs banning and ostracizing your experience because \"oh no drugs!!!!\", I can see where they're coming from. Some of us are super young and impressionable, and because of our unbalanced brain chemistry, we can react to certain drugs differently (legal or illegal), (e.g. Schizophrenia and LSD). I don't need to tell you about the lack of regulation/uniformity in the illegal drug world. We can't even predict how we individuals will react to regulated drugs too well (thus it is common practice to try several different drugs within the same class even from a pdoc). Thus, the potentiality for a young and impressionable kid seeing the post might be like \"oh my X worked for this person, and I'm super desperate to feel normal. I'm going to try X\" exists and that can be really scary. It can be okay, particularly when we've done our research, but unfortunately, not everyone does. I am also super happy to see an increase in MDMA used in PTSD patients. It is really amazing that we are branching out and really trying all of the things we can. However, I also thing the best course to take with drugs is legalization and regulation, and that is obviously a contested topic. Also, unfortunately, it says you grew up taking a lot of antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are no joke and it makes me wonder where the research was at when you were that age. These days, it is highly discouraged to prescribe certain things to younger children [e.g. Ritalin for kids instead of Adderall]. It doesn't always work obviously, but there's an attempt. All in all, again, I'm not in a great headspace right now to be reading and digesting your writing with the attention it deserves, so I will be doing so at a later date.

{"dtz7yns": {"text": "The thing is, it's not only in appearance are you looking for different things. In your answers, it seems like you have a very clear image of not necessarily what dog breed you want, but what you would like your dog to do. Unfortunately, most small fluffy adorable companion breeds are not suitable for the type of work you are interested in. Notice how a companion breed has the word \"companion\" in it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with these breeds. However, you aren't just looking for a companion. Hounds also seem to be super popular amongst the community.  I also don't think the \"wolfy\" breeds would be too great either. Most \"wolfy\" breeds are spitzes which have tendencies to bolt at first opportunity and have pretty high prey drive. GSDs miiiiiiiiiiiiiight work. I say that with a lot of hesitation, because I know that my particular GSD would be garbage at what you want him to do. I like to say \"a gsd can never do anything best, but can do everything second best\". They're incredibly versatile as a breed, but I think that there is a better fit out there. After poking around on the internet, and considering your boyfriend's preferences as well, I would ultimately go for a Dachshund. It's still \"small and cute\" and the falconry community seems to think highly of the breed for your field. Also, what /u/beavizsla said is super cool! if you're really seriously in to falconry as a career (I don't know if this sounds dumb? I literally know nothing about falconry), I would go with the best choice in the job. Lastly, depending on how often you falcon(???), and the training that goes with it, it is highly likely that this dog will be super duper bonded to you and not so much your boyfriend. I know that dogs can absolutely bond to multiple people, some dogs do have a preference. It also seems like you will be spending a great deal greater of time with this dog than your boyfriend (correct me if I'm wrong please!) and you should search for something more suitable for the job you're looking for. ^Is^\"falcon\"^averb? On budgeting, getting a dog is fucking expensive. Granted I have a notoriously unhealthy breed, [this](https://www.reddit.com/ is how much I spent the first year and a half. People frequently have two choices: safety fund or pet insurance. I ultimately chose pet insurance because (1) I simply don't have the money or self control to have a safety fund, and (2) my dog is a very sickly breed and the piece of mind is worth it to me. Because of pet insurance, I don't have the need for a safety fund as long as I do have the money in my account to make the payment upfront. So, in my budget, my dog factors exactly $60 a month for insurance. Food costs me $180 a month. Those are the only fixed costs.

Now, I hate to say it, but your boyfriend doesn't sound like a great dude. I know that it's a lot of generalization based on a text post, but I am of the firm belief that how a person takes care of their animal(s)/pet(s) tells a lot about them. (Hence you see why I think you're so awesome.) To me, what this says about him is that he's selfish and neglectful, unreceptive to criticism, and complacent. Things would be a little different if he was overloaded with work, or tried his best at training, but just wasn't really good at motivating/rewarding, or something else. However, he has shown that he is okay with what he's doing. He is okay with you doing all the work for him, then being upset that the dog doesn't listen to him. Next, do you think maybe he's not training the dog because he knows you will do it if he doesn't? I know that's really shitty, but could that also be a possibility?

Obviously, it's okay for you to spend more, but if you go in with that mindset, it'll help a ton. Offbrand shit is almost the same as onbrand shit. Meat that is on sale, as long as it looks okay, is fine. Buy fruits and veggies that are on sale. * Also, fruit is fucking expensive. I love fruit, and have just recently been buying grapes because I found them for cheaper around me. * Rice. Rice is gonna save your life. Some stuff that I make that's easy and cheap:  * Tomato Scrambled eggs: Tomatoes are a cheaper vegetable and eggs are eggs. You just put oil in the pan, toss the tomatoes in, crack the eggs in to the pan, and stir that shit. You can add milk if you want. Throw this on top of white rice and you got protein and veggies. If you're familiar with the Asian topping of Pork Song, that makes this taste great. * Stir fry: Stir fry is called stir fry because you literally do that. You stir and you fry. Toss some stir-fry meat (lower in cost total. Higher in cost / ounce but worth the difference because you need so little). Toss in some cheaper veggies you found. Toss in the rice. Stir that shit. Toss some soy sauce or sesame oil or garlic or ginger or whatever you want in there. You got stir fry. You can make this and eat it for a few days, which is great. * Pasta: boil noodles per instructions. I can make sauce from scratch and it's incredibly delicious, but it's cheaper to buy it in a jar. You can either heat and pour over or stir it in which is what my lazy ass does.* Pasta with Cheese: Aw man we are getting fancy all up in here. Not really, it's still super simple, but a little more \"fancy\" than the other things. Do the same thing as with the pasta, stick it in a casserole dish, sprinkle some mozzarella on top. Cheese is a little more expensive though, so you can decide if you want that enough to pay for it. You can also make these two in bulk. * Fry up some chicken in a pan, throw in whatever seasoning, put it on some rice. Lastly, keep track of your finances. I use an excel spreadsheet.

{"dtxd89x": {"text": "Hey dude. I get it. I've been there. Something about the word \"bipolar\" left a bad taste in my mouth. Ultimately, I came to terms that it was the stigma around it. In this situation, it's really hard to tell because we aren't seeing you on a daily basis and such and things. Just from your post history dude, I'm pretty worried about your mental health in general. I am a person of reassuring and double checking, particularly when I don't like something. I would go to a second shrink to see what he/she says. Honestly, if the second shrink also diagnoses bipolar disorder... it might become easier to accept. If you truly do have BD and you're convincing yourself it is an anger issue and flushing your meds, oh geez, I got a warning for you. If your BD is just acting up now, you should familiarize yourself with the true dangers of it. As your post history states, you've managed to sever every relationship you have (relatable tbh.) and think of suicide. This stuff, unfortunately, is just the tip of the iceberg. A lot of us, in our mania sprees, spend hundreds of thousands of dollars plunging ourselves in to massive credit card debt. Some of us end up homeless because of this. Some of us cheat on our long term partners whom we love and destroy the relationship. This can break families apart if you have kids, or one day intend on having kids. Sometimes, mania can just cause you to do dangerous stupid shit. Sometimes, depression can make you not get out of bed for days. And bud, I got bad news, it gets worse with age. Now, I know I'm making it seem bleak as all hell, and it sucks, and you probably want to deny it even more now, but I am just trying to highlight the severity of what we are [potentially] dealing with and to please not quit the whole mental health thing.  **Now, like I said, I am a person of facts, so let's get to the facts:** * BD shows up typically in your mid to late twenties, so you're in the \"correct\" age group (again, creeped your post history). * Sorry dude, but based on your post history alone, I'm really worried about you man. Something is clearly not very \"balanced\". * Think of a time where you experienced adrenaline and thrill. Gambling is a good example. I know I can never fucking gamble. The nature of it will trigger mania and I will lose all my money. Is there anything like that for you? It could be anything, from exercising, to picking up a new hobby (fuck you Hobby Lobby for taking all my money) or my personal favorite: driving fast cars recklessly and dangerously. * Anger issues can be a manifestation of BD problems. Trust me, I was so fucking angry before I was medicated. I have smashed keyboards. I have punched through walls. For scale, I am a 110 pound small girl. That's how angry I was. * Do you sometimes feel like life is meaningless...? Think of suicide? Many of these are telltale signs. In closing, the medication isn't so bad. We aren't supposed to drink alcohol with them, but a lot of us do it anyways (just in moderation), but other than that, it's fucking worth it. Meds have changed my life. My focus has never been better. My anxiety has never been lower. And I have not gone on a reckless spending spree in like 6 months. I really do hope you stick with the mental health thing. I know that you're an adult and can make your own decisions, but I do worry about you internet stranger. I hope that I can see you on the other side of this med-tunnel.

The issue with that is, if you have bipolar disorder, the \"killing of the depression\" can lead to full blown mania or our worst nightmare: mixed episodes. Thus, we are usually prescribed mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. The reason I'm still on such a high dose of antidepressants is my Generalized Anxiety is out the wazoo. All in all, my regimen now has been incredible. I'm still titrating lithium levels up because I'm a little bit hypo all the time now, but I haven't had an episode in over 4 months now.

What you'er describing sounds like a classic anxiety attack that definitely should be addressed by a professional. Also, this sub hates on SSRI's because they tend to fuck with some recreational drugs, but dude they're a godsend. I don't get anxiety attacks anymore. I'm not uncontrollably shaking. I do not have random impending senses of doom. My general happiness is higher. It's great. Docs give them to us for a reason.  If you want my advice, go to a psych and actually get help for your anxiety. If I had to guess, he'd give you an SSRI and an Ambien for sleeping. You will likely get a benzo for acute situations (panic attacks) later down the line. Do not mention recreational benzo use. You will not get them that way. When you bring it up, again, make sure you know the dude so he doesn't think you're just trying to shill pills, be really chill about it. If you do follow my advice (which I hope you will because I'm just lookin' out), taper off of Benzos ASAP. You don't want any chance of not getting your meds in order when the time comes.

It **can** if the dog is trained to perform certain tasks to mitigate your depression. A really fabulous example of this is psychotic depression. In some cases, a handler may train their dog to paw their hands or jump on their laps or something to alert the owner to psychosis. In a more advanced setting, a dog may be trained to guide the owner to an isolated space. Psychosis alert is another great example. However, if the dog's purpose is to exist and to provide company and comfort, this would be an ESA.    This isn't to say ESAs are any less important than SD's. They simply have different jobs.

{"dtx2siq": {"text": "I cheated on my boyfriend during an episode. It was one of the first times I took my Ativans for anxiety attacks and to calm my nerves, and I was not fully aware of the effects it would have on my judgement. Here's some history: &gt; My current boyfriend and I have known one another for 7 years. We dated briefly 3 years ago for 5 months and ultimately split up for college. In college, I met my ex boyfriend and we dated for two years-- ultimately, we broke up because I was never really over the first guy. After my ex boyfriend and I broke up, my current boyfriend and I got back together. I tell you this because it's important for you to know that I was in love with this man for two years that I was dating someone else. That's fucked up, I know, but I really have to drive home how much I love him. He's probably my best friend in the universe and he understands me more than anyone else ever could. He makes me happy when skies are grey. He is everything to me. **But I fucking cheated.** I didn't just cheat with anyone. **I did it with my ex.** Some unfortunate circumstances arose and long story short, **my current boyfriend was on voice call on my laptop as my ex and I were fucking**. It was so fucking bad. How I felt: &gt; We will start with how I felt because this is a concept that I most easily grasp. I felt like a piece of shit. In all honesty, that time in my life was super fucked up. I thought I still had feelings for my ex, but I didn't realize how drug-lubricated the entire incident was until months later. I was talking to them both. I was sleeping with my ex (current boyfriend is LDR). It was all around a fucking disaster. I flew back home and stayed with my current boyfriend for 2 weeks and I remembered everything about why I loved him completely and absolutely. I abruptly ended things with my ex, and my current boyfriend and I took to working on our relationship. I felt like a fucking piece of shit. I still feel like a piece of shit now. This was ~6 months ago so it hasn't been too long, but it hasn't been short either. I can't stress enough how worthless and ugly of a person I felt like. He knew it was an episode. That didn't make it any less hard for him.   How he felt:  &gt; Now, I cannot say for certain how he felt because they are his feelings, not mine, but he was betrayed beyond all belief. Keep in mind, he knew he loved me. He and I have been close for 7 fucking years now. To have someone you love hurt you like that... it's almost unfathomable. He dropped me like a sack of rocks. The only reason we are still together is because he had a twang of hope. Just a twang, enough to stay around just texting me, but not enough to commit to anything anymore. I took what I could get. He did fall back in love with me, but it took time.    Where we are now: &gt; It's been roughly six months. Our relationship is wonderful, but I cannot stress enough that **we are still recovering**. Just two days ago, we had an episode where I did something while I was out and it scared the living daylights out of him because he thought I was going to call him and say that we were broken up and me and my ex were back together. In contrast, I was actually calling because I wanted to hear the sound of his voice. He gets insecure about it. I can't blame him. I am working every fucking day to make him feel loved and prove myself worthy of his affections. I am the luckiest fucking girl in the world that he forgave me.  He also has a lot of fear on the aspect of me cheating again. The thing is, I think even though I have BD, I should be held accountable for my actions. I want to say that I won't cheat again. Fuck I never want to hurt him like that ever again, but he's afraid that one day... the episode will line up just right and it'll happen again. Again, **I am trying every single day to be worthy of this man.**  &gt; I found that it was crucial for me to \"own my actions\". I did not hold my BD accountable. This was all me. It doesn't matter that I was in an episode. I still did it. I still hurt him. It stung my mouth saying the words \"I cheated\" or \"I'm a cheater\", but it was a very important part of **taking ownership of what I'd done.** Lastly... &gt; There is nothing we really can do. We know we fucked up. It doesn't matter that we have BD... we still did it. We still hurt that person that we love and that's what matters. In the end, it's up to him if he wants to still be with you. Does he know about your disorder? I hope he does. It might help explain (not justify) what happened. Be open to communicating, don't try to guilt him back in to a relationship, and respect his wishes. Tell him you are open to working on it and communicating openly and proceeding forward with the relationship if he wants to as well. Last of all, if you're anything like me, you currently feel like you are the scum of the earth. This isn't about you right now, this is about him. Think about how much it hurts him right now. When I was in my mixed state, I couldn't really comprehend that. I regret that very much.   Jk this is lastly... &gt;Bipolar is hard. We do lots of things we will regret. However, I want you to know, most of all, \"once a cheater, always a cheater\" is not fucking true. Don't think of yourself like that. Don't let people tell you that. If that were the case, people that cheated once when they were 13 years old would simply not deserve a shot at love when they are 45. That's just silly. No matter what happens with this boy, you will be okay. ", "link_id": "t3_7w2edh", "time": 1518068914}}

{"dtvc50u": {"text": "Alright. One mentally ill person to another, I have a couple of things I'd love to address with you.    We're gonna start with a dog in regards to your mental health.  &gt; I got my dog a little over a year ago, before I was diagnosed. I'm also a college student. I have Bipolar Disorder (Type 1) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder with Obsessive Compulsive Tendencies. I'm a fucking bag of nuts. My dog has changed so much for me. His partnership, his company, his snuggles, and his love have done so much for me. I love him more than quite literally anything in the world. Even my boyfriend gets jealous sometimes. He is everything to me.  That being said, getting a puppy in college is fucking hard. Like really fucking hard. I am not exaggerating when I say I had to build my schedule around my puppy and my SO at the time had to help me out too. He could not be alone for more than around 2 hours at a time. Housebreaking was a bitch. It was exhausting. Classes were particularly hard. It's not fucking easy. Furthermore, I'm graduating this year. I'm fortunate that I come from a culture where my parents will support me until I am able to be on my feet myself, but that isn't always the case. You don't know what would happen to your dog in that case.  I cannot stress enough that raising a puppy is fucking hard. Doing it while dealing with my own mental issues was eve worse. I went through hardcore puppy blues and depressive episodes thinking that I wasn't enough for my dog. My mental health suffered an extraordinary amount. I was waking up in the middle of the night crying because I loved him so much and was afraid I'd fail.  Person to person, please get your mental health in order first before you take on another life. I know I didn't do it, but don't be as dumb as I was. Please.  Second, **a pet, an ESA, is not a substitute for medication and therapy.** It does not matter to a puppy if you can't get out of bed that day. He needs to potty every 30 minutes. It doesn't matter to a puppy if you can't get out of that day, he needs to be supervised or he will chew through your wall. Second, I'm going to address the difficulty of raising and mixes you've listed:  &gt; I own a GSD, what some people consider a \"wolfy breed\". Let it be known, herding breeds are fucking assholes. GSDs are known as landsharks. They will bite your ankles until they bleed. They will cry your fucking ear off because that noble picture of a GSD you have in your head is bullshit, they're whiny babies. Also, GSDs are notoriously easy to mess up. Due to the breed's popularity, the breeding pool is littered with dangerous and bad genes. They're prone to separation anxiety, extreme nervousness, fear based aggression, and let's not forget hip displaysia. A fearful or separation anxiety GSD is no fucking joke. They will chew through your dry wall, and in fear, they can absolutely bite. They're hard fucking dogs to raise and not recommended to any first time owners.  Huskies are notoriously stubborn and honestly, would make a really poor emotional support companion. Huskies have a \"fuck you\" attitude. They love you, but will run away at first opportunity because they like to run. They're mischievous. They're escape artists. My neighbor owns a husky and I once saw him running his husky in the pouring rain. I said to myself, \"That. is a good husky owner.\"  They need that sort of exercise. Need. If now, you will see next level husky destruction. [This](https://www.reddit.com/ is what owning a husky is really like.  Now, since you are looking at a mix between the two, you have no way of predicting how this dog will be. It is possible that you will get the shit lottery and get the neuroticity of a GSD and the exercise requirement of a husky with the escape capabilities of a husky. You have no idea what to expect other than his \"wolf like appearance\".  Last, I will address the unethical practice of both buying from this \"breeder\" and specifically buying a GSD/Husky mix:  &gt; There is nothing wrong with mixed breeds. Mixed breed dogs are beautiful and good boys/girls just like purebred dogs. Every dog is a good dog if you let him/her be. That being said, specifically seeking out a mix is very unethical. This puppy mill that you listed is charging $800+ for a mixed breed that is not bred to any standard whatsoever. No ethical or reputable breeder is breeding GSD x Husky mixes because there is no standard to breed towards with these mixes. They are breeding their dogs for profit and nothing else. By buying a puppy from them, it would be contributing to a puppy mill. If your heart is set on this mix, frequent local shelters. Please don't contribute to puppy mills.  In closing: I don't mean to be mean at all. That is not my intention. I am just very passionate about the concepts of mental health, German Shepherds, and puppy mills in specific. It is really important to me that it is made clear that I am attempting to, as clearly as I can, warn you. I'm happy to answer any more questions. Edit: holy shit gold?!?!?

The other option is to get one as a puppy which is a whole new issue in it of itself. They're little landsharks and come with the territory of holy herding breed. I don't mean to bad mouth the breed. God damn I think they're the best dogs in the world; mine's snuggling next to me right now. It's just a word of caution. ", "link_id": "t3_7vtwdh", "time": 1517996765}}

{"dtria38": {"text": "Sorta! Nearly every relationship my SO has is an interracial relationship as he is from mixed descent.

People think that we are siblings a lot, which is kind of strange because you'd think otherwise as we are clearly different \"colors\" so to speak. However, this might have to do with our demeanor with one another as we tend to be a pretty laid back non-PDA couple. He has very little issue with my family as he is of Chinese descent as well. Although he doesn't speak the language, he is very accustomed to the culture and such. Also, we grew up in a pretty Asian dominated area so it was pretty normalized. The only issue we've faced so far is that we are tactfully avoiding telling my grandparents because they can be pretty conservative. Also, my parents like him, but they tend to focus on his Chinese half and excuse his Hispanic half as they just really like him as a person. His family and I are a little bit different, but as his mother married a Chinese man, they are quite open to interracial relationships. I get to learn a lot about his Hispanic half's culture, which is really cool to me! Also, it's more similar to east Asian culture than one would expect.

{"dtptnup": {"text": "Hey! I would totally post on the subreddits that the ~~bot~~ loving and gracious moderator /u/johpick  listed. The communities are really great and receptive to responding. Also, they're always straight forward and to the point... which I suppose is self-explanatory given the Autism Spectrum Thing, which I am sure you understand. I'd also hop on over to / am diagnosed with Bipolar I and GAD with OCD tendencies while my SO is on the ASD spectrum (Aspie) and suffers from panic attacks from time to time. We both need things a certain way and struggle on some level with social interactions. I think that the individual diagnoses don't matter too much in this case, because we can't just make broad generalizations about each person based on their diagnosis. That being said, as peers, I think I have a few tips for your situation. * Listen to one another: This is so important in every relationship, but even more so in mental health relationships. When he communicates that he wants things to be in orde listen to him. When you feel like you need to get out of the social situation, he should listen to you. It seems simple as hell, but you can't imagine how good it feels. Now, what this would mean ideally is that you structure your life in schedules just like he needs them to be. I'm very similar actually. If he's like me, he will constantly ask where you're at to check if you're \"on schedule\" and absolutely go bonkers if you're off schedule. What my SO does for me is that he simply respects the schedule. I know this can be super annoying for some people (like my ex), but it's something that would significantly lower his stress levels day to day. Of course sometimes, you'll mess up, and that's okay! The important thing is that day-to-day, you're trying to make this part of his life easier and to lower his overall anxiety. For him, he should respect your need to not be in those types of social situations. For us, we have a cue. I will squeeze his hands really hard and I think he can see me panicking in my eyes. He will immediately move me out of the situation with no question of where we are or what we are doing. When I quite literally run away, he walks after me and catches up to me. He knows what is happening. Then, he sits down next to me and comforts me. A perfect example is that I once had an anxiety attack in the middle of a crowd at a festival my SO and I were at towards the end of quite a tumultuous time in my life. I was, ironically, thinking about if I had an anxiety attack, he'd have to miss seeing Gorillaz. Then, that anxiety gave me an anxiety attack. As I was sitting on the ground sobbing and shaking and telling him that I'm sorry about missing Gorillaz, he looked in to my eyes and said \"Sophie, all I want to do right now is go back to our hotel and relax. It's really late, come on let's go.\" Which brings me to the next point...* Be an Understanding Partner: Again, this seems so basic, but it's so important. He genuinely would rather have gone home to see me relax and end my anxiety attack than see Gorillaz. At that moment, that's what mattered to him more. This matters. God this matters. Be and understanding partner. Like your boyfriend, I need things to be a certain way. I need to drink my drinks out of containers that I can see through (translucent/transparent). Why do I need to do this? I have no clue whatsoever. This is just how I am. My SO respects this and he has never made me feel silly for it. It's in the small things.* Communicate:  Don't bottle things up. Talk about them. * Try to understand one-another's conditions the best you can: No one can truly understand someone else's condition as it is not possible to feel their own. Since you both have ASD, you both have an understanding of ASD. Keep up on the latest studies, be informed. Honestly, a lot of this is just being a loving partner. It's actually not too different from any other relationship if I'm being honest. Above all, love one another more than you love yourself and you will be just fine.", "link_id": "t3_7v3f3d", "time": 1517745678}}

{"dtgi4to": {"text": "Hey hon, there's a lot of comments here saying that they feel unethical or bad about it. First and foremost, I want you to know that you are worth being loved and feeling love. Bipolar does not limit or change that at all. That being said, I want to tell you about two of my relationships: &gt; Relationship 1: I met this boy when I was 18 years old. We'll call him K. I was unmedicated and undiagnosed at the time. Things started out awesome with K. Doesn't it always when you're just a little hypomanic/manic? We fell for each other hard and fast. We were moved in together by the end of the next year. Things were still amazing. We were going to Disneyland and hanging out and the sex was awesome. Then, what I call the true test of every relationship came: the first big fight. Before we moved in together, about two months in to our relationship, he came home disgustingly wasted. This is something that I just am not comfortable with. I know that we were 18 at the time, but I have my reasons. We fought about it and it was what it was. As our relationship went on, he got less and less patient with my outbursts (mixed states) during our fights. He began to accuse me of lying to him all the time. I never lied to him, not ever. In reality, in my reality, the truths just fluctuated depending on what state I was in. Neither of us understood it at the time. Eventually, the accusing of me lying did break us up. Additionally, he could never understand why I was so annoying about needing things to be a certain way. You guys understand that there is sometimes there is a need for certain things. We dated for two years and the last entire year was us simply tolerating one another.         &gt;Relationship 2: I met this boy when I was 14 years old. We were friends until we were 18. We dated when we were 18 for a brief 5 months before amicably splitting up to go to different schools. At 21 years old, we got back together. I love this boy beyond words. We have known each other for a cumulative of 7 years. He recognizes that my various mental illnesses requires things to be a certain way without complaining. (e.g. my cups need to be clear) When I was dating this boy, I had my first panic attack. I melted down, shaking. We have been to the ER together while I was in a dissociative episode.

{"dtfv2c9": {"text": "Firstly, \"Gerberian Shepskies\" are a designer breed. It would be more correct just to call him a mixed breed or a German Shepherd/Husky X instead. This way, the connotation doesn't promote unethical breeding. Secondly, since she was selling mixed breeds for next to nothing, the breeder wasn't likely very ethical, which can mean many things for your dog along the lines of lack of health testing and temperamental issues. Please do keep this in mind for the future. That being said, since your dog is a X, there is very little you can guarantee. Huskies are aloof and distant while German Shepherds are absolutely follow-you-in-to-the-bathroom types. It could land anywhere on that spectrum. Huskies require an insane amount of exercise  and while GSDs require a lot, they don't compare to husky level. It can land anywhere on that scale. GSDs are super prone to separation anxiety, so watch out for that. Huskies are known for bolting out the door, so you should watch out for that.    Basically, it's a mixed bag and you should watch out for the worst (and best) of both breeds.    One thing's for sure though, it's gonna shed like a motherfucker. Edit: Edited to say that since you were 3-6 years old when you were around the previous dogs, you only know how to behave around them. (e.g. don't pull their ears, don't kick them, how to feed them treats possibly) You do not have experience training a Husky. I am unsure of your history with other dogs. Huskies and GSDs are both smart dogs. However, a Husky has very much a \"fuck you\" attitude towards training. They love you, but are basically eternal angsty teenagers that will give you a hard time. If your dog takes after a husky, this is what you can expect. GSD's are very biddable and want to please their human counterparts-- as they are evolved to bond heavily with their human-shepherd.

{"dtd2ahd": {"text": "Hey, I am going to say I agree with /u/louiseifer and /u/warmfuzzies in regards to not bringing a puppy in to this situation. However, as a GSD owner, I have to say my piece. You said this will be your first dog, and GSDs are very much not recommended for first timers as they are easy-to-fuck-up-dogs. The entire breed is plagued with neurological issues and are super prone to separation anxiety and reactivity. We get a really bad rap as it is. People are afraid of our dogs. It sucks. Raising a puppy is really really really really hard. Everyone in the house has to be in unison. A great example is that GSD puppies are known as landsharks. They will bite your ankles to oblivion and you will bleed a lot. It will suck. You can implement your way to train him out of this however you'd like, but if your wife doesn't do the same thing, it will set training back. It will confuse the puppy. Potty training is also not great. It really tests your patience with another person. When you are at odds and slept like 5 hours over the span of 48 hours, people tend to get... unpleasant. Here's the thing, you can't force a dog to like you more. GSDs are herding breeds and thus more inclined to choose a person to bond to primarily (this is not always this case), but can totally bond with other people to an extreme level, too. In example, I have been Atlas' person since I got him. This does not mean he didn't love my ex-SO who helped me raise him. This doesn't mean that at all. Lastly, the alpha theory has been debunked. Owning any dog is a partnership. It is not a superio boss/worker relationship. For reference, the opposite of master is slave. I know that's super dramatic, but it puts things in to perspective. I like to think of it like this: my dog is a 75 pound GSD with a scissor bite that can exert a 200+ pound per square inch bite if he wants to. I am a 120 pound small woman. There's no way that I am this creature's master. I don't expect him to worship me or anything of the sort. I do expect him to listen to me. When I tell him to sit, I expect him to sit. However, I also listen to him. When he shows me he's uncomfortable in a situation, we leave. It's a friendship. ", "link_id": "t3_7tc769", "time": 1517144072}}

To top it all of, it's a Belgian Mal. which is notorious for being time-consuming and highly demanding. Aussies are also high energy, but a Mal. is on a different level.  Additionally, your Mal is only 4 months old and you've only had her for two weeks. As of right now, there hasn't even been enough time to properly bond with your puppy. Also, I would at the very least wait until your Mal is through the teenager phase.    I own a shepherd, aka the softcore super tame version of a Mal and his energy spiked around the 8 month mark (teenagerdom). I couldn't imagine the difficulty of raising two pups during this time period.    Of course your mileage may vary, but it's just my two cents.

There's a reason your doctor selected this medication for you and requesting a antidepressant of a different class (SSRI/SNRI/Aminoketone) can cause different affects. Unfortunately, many of these medications do have sexual side affects.    That being said, I started Sertraline (Zoloft) at 50 mg and I have titrated up to 200 mg and have several other medications. In the beginning, my sex drive shot straight to the ground. Even when I tried to have sex, I just couldn't get wet. If there was lube involved, I couldn't orgasm. It sucked so bad. However, to me, I wanted to put my mental health before my sex drive because I could feel my antidepressant working. It was just worth it to me. I won't say it was easy though. After around two months, my sex drive came back in full! It's still a little more difficult to orgasm than before, but it's completely manageable and I do manage to do so every time I have intercourse.    Separately, the side effects are the worst. Make sure to keep note of them for your psych. All of mine (except the sex ones) went away after about two weeks.

We originally got on raw because, after trying every premium kibble in the book, Atlas proved to be really picky combined with SIBO (high folate, low b12).    I have to say switching to raw has been the best decision I've personally ever made. He seems so very excited about his food like he never was before. He lights up when he sees it. His coat is shiny, and he is thriving. This is a huge change from his underweight appearance before due to SIBO.     I don't trust myself to make the raw food yet. The BARF diet is what I feed, but I feed a premade version from a local meat processor. They do a wonderful job with competitive prices. It is actually cheaper for me to buy from them than for me to put it together myself due to my inexperience. [This](https://www.happeedawg.com) is their website. They won't ship to you unless you live in California or Nevada, but you can browse through and possibly start looking for something local in your area like this. I prefer to buy from a locally sourced pre-made raw brand than a big chain pre-made raw brand. Dog food companies that produce mainstream kibble are starting to catch on to the raw trends (hence the raw fridges popping up in pet stores) and my preference is simply to go with alternatives. Again, I buy straight from a meat factory that produces human grade product and I have a fantastic relationship with them.    Now, if you do want to take a go at it yourself, as another user mentioned, butchers are amazing resources. I also highly recommend you find a co-op in your area. (You can just google raw feeding co op). There's also a raw-feeding subreddit here, but it is not too active. Lastly, there is a wonderful facebook group [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/preymodeldiet/) that is open to the public to join. There's 60,000 of us and I have found everyone super helpful in answering questions regarding raw feeding.    Best of luck!    Edit: Edited to add, the raw food that I currently feed is actually exactly on the money for what it would cost me to feed premium kibble. However, this doesn't account for shipping and the cost of having a stand-alone freezer for it. I don't count shipping as I am local and pick it up from the factory myself. Additionally, many raw feeders invest in a second freezer for stockpiling raw meat. This way, we can buy in bulk and cut costs. ", "link_id": "t3_7savif", "time": 1516696081}}

I would sit right next to the crate on my computer or something. In the beginning, I'd even coo and settle him down.

That being said, I think, as a parent, the most you can do is never make him feel like his worries are invalid. He knows what they are, but he can't help it. If he wants to talk, talk to him. If he wants to be left alone, leave him alone. Support him always.    If he needs things to be a certain way, try to accommodate it. I don't mean just lay down and give him everything he wants, but sometimes, things being a certain way makes us feel safer. In example, I need to have the door closed when I sleep.

I sobbed so much in those few days, not to mention they found enflamed lymph nodes, but that's another story.    If it makes you feel better, Atlas has also shit out a lot of stuff. He's shit out undies and socks should be no issue. Dogs can pass a lot of stuff, but surgery might be what is needed and you might need to prepare yourself for that.    If at all possible, I would have someone keep an eye on him all night. (Unless you are the only one in the home and to drive him to the vet tomorrow, in which case, please do get some sleep or call a friend. Hysterical emotional people that are sleep deprived are not the safest drivers.) I would also monitor what he does and take notes for the vet. The night is probably moving in a blur right now. At least it was for mine. Lastly, please cuddle with your Monty. Pet him and let him know that you love him very much.    I know that the last thing you need right now is an ad, so please consider this afterwards. In the future, since you said you had financial strain, I cannot recommend pet insurance enough.

Everyone's mileage may vary, but in my experience, going to the ER goes one of two ways. Keep in mind that I also have anxiety, so again, your mileage may vary. One, it's during a specific episode where she is during some sort. I get panic attacks, and that's one of the reasons I've been sent to the ER. They shot me up with 2 mgs of Ativan and sent me home. Again, I'm not sure if this would apply to a person with just Bipolar and not Anxiety as well. Second, a psych ward is also possible if she is a danger to herself/others as deemed by the attending physician. Also, I beg you, please do not suggest that she lie to the physician to keep her out of the ER. I know you don't want her to go there, but if she truly is a danger, she may need to go and will be better for it. If she lives in the US, she can be forcibly confined for 72 hours. There are lots of threads on here about what those are like. In the ER, they will put her on a med regimen and she will attend daily therapy.    Regarding your questions: If she goes to the ER, she will be discharged very quickly likely or sent to psych. You should be able to visit, but again, this really depends on the place. She will not be instantly given medication in the ER. ER doctors are attending physicians. Medication (particularly for a tricky mood disorder like bipolar) is usually prescribed by psychiatrists. She will encounter these only if she goes to the psych ward in this instance.    Lastly, you mentioned that she is not on medication. I would encourage you to talk to her about considering getting on it. It is very possible that her coping mechanisms were enough before, but as this episode indicates, it may not be enough anymore.

Following that, we are very conscious of our mental states and if it ever gets bad, we take a step back and wind down together. I find that the ability to do this is very important, otherwise, the entire relationship will be set in mania-- which we all know cannot last forever.      I have a special take on love and Bipolar.

{"dsjetdv": {"text": "Visit / We're nice. I think the people there will be able to provide some insight that you might not get here. Don't let the subreddit name deter you, it is actually generally a very nice and supportive place.    As background: I am woman weighing in here that is not interested in rape play, but a connisuer in rough sex.     Most of the time, rape play isn't about actually being raped, it's about control and dominance or desire. It's just a little bit difficult to convey what exactly some women (and men) like about it. Much of the time, they like the feeling of feeling seemingly powerless. On the other hand, some women (and men) like it for the desire factor in that \"he wants me so much he cannot contain himself any further and will do this taboo thing\". Do either of these sound like your girlfriend? You should have a conversation with her about it when she's ready!    Now, what has happened has happened. There is no use placing blame here. Now, she was crying and asked you to sleep on the couch. That kind of sucks, because a CRUCIAL part of BDSM is aftercare. Imagine holding your hands in the air in front of you at equal height. This is how your relationship is on a normal level outside of sex. Now, imagine lifting one of the arms up as high as it'll go and the other as low as it'll go. This is how your relationship is during BDSM. She likes this. However, afterwards, you have to make the effort to bring the relationship back to the arms being extended out in front of you. This usually means cuddling, caressing, and talking to her.    You guys tried out a new kink and it didn't work out. That's okay! As tactical as it sounds, I always find it very important to discuss the sex me and my partner have afterwards. I find that it makes for better learning experiences and notes for next time. This definitely encompasses trying new things. Although I know it's unorthodox, I cannot stress enough how this has helped our communication and sexual growth.     However, as a woman, although I don't necessarily agree with her reaction/fear, I can see where she is coming from. Should she have used the safe word? In my opinion, yes, but again, none of that maters now. It already happened. Being raped is amongst the scariest thing in the world for a woman (and a man too, but the expectations and social contexts are different). She is probably feeling very conflicted right now as she feels a great deal of affection towards you, but feels violated. This isn't to say you violated her. It was all consensual. It is only that she feels violated. She is allowed to change her mind, yes, but she did not communicate that her mind changed. Moving forward, as others have said, have a conversation when she is ready, perform aftercare.     As silly as it sounds, if I were in her situation, I would really appreciate gestures. I would do an exaggerated version of aftercare. I would buy flowers and light candles and make a nice dinner, possibly draw her a bath. I know it all seems excessive, but in all honesty, this would be about making her feel safe again and bringing the relationship back to equal terms, not about blame or who did what or who did or didn't use the safe word.

We would have to scream in horror and everyone in the room would have to collectively face the wall and ignore him for him to learn.  * A lady that lives a floor beneath me in my apartment screamed in horror one of the first days I was living here. That really hurt my feelings.  * Before I knew better and was a dog park frequenter, I saw a family pick up their small dog in horror when mine ran up to him/her to play. Granted they had just seen another Shepherd in the park terrorize mine, but it was heartbreaking.  * When he swallowed a pair of earphones and he had to go under the knife to remove it (so thankful for pet insurance right here) and they found enflamed lymph nodes. I had to wait 48 hours from then to see if it was cancer. Those were the worst 48 hours of my life.  * When he was a young pup (~6 months) and he was diagnosed with SIBO (related to EPI) and I felt as if I had been failing him by not feeding him adequately. If you're interested in shepherds, I encourage you to familiarize yourself with EPI and SIBO.  * Whenever he would bark at strangers when he was younger. I work hard with him, but he still barks sometimes. All dogs do really. He's still a puppy and he gets excited when he barks. This is particularly terrifying when a Shepherd does it to people.     Best Experiences (the last two are mostly funny):  * Every single day of our lives together.  * The day I brought him home and how I knew he was my puppy.  * The day I got my ESA letter for him for my mental health issues.  * The first day he made his successful potty outside.  * The first night he slept through the night.  * The first night he was finally able to sleep outside of the crate and snuggle with me in bed.  * When his ears stood up!  * When my dog met my new boyfriend, he was very conflicted. He barked at him (I was alone in my home and he tends to be wary of strangers under the circumstances) and then proceeded to kite around and spread pee. Luckily, my boyfriend is good with dogs and very familiar with them. He knew to wait him out and they were best friends within the hour. It was awesome.  * My dog thinks he's the great protector of my apartment. Other people think he's some large beast. In all reality, I was walking with him in the complex and he jumps behind me so fast. I look over, and he saw a spider. My 75 pound German Shepherd saw a fucking spider.

{"dshyuiq": {"text": "First time dog Shepherd Mom Checking in!    Preface:  Whenever I see someone post about GSD's, I get a mix of worried and excited. Make no mistake. I think they are the best dogs ever. (Doesn't everyone about their dog heh.) They're ferociously loyal, hysterical, goofy, and loving as all hell. I wouldn't trade mine for the world. That being said, I saw another user comment about how they aren't good for a first time owner and your reply that you're set on a GSD. On this sub, it is very unpopular to recommend GSDs as first time dogs because they are particularly easy to screw up and the consequences of doing so are typically pretty great. That being said, I personally didn't want to get another dog under the pretense of practicing for my GSD. It just didn't seem fair to that potential other dog. Thus, I did the research and bit the bullet. Not all is lost.    It will take a lot of training. A GSD is lumped in with the \"bad breeds\" list along with Rottweilers, Pitties, Dobermans, etc. This means that there is absolutely a preconceived notion there. People will be a little more wary on the street and people may automatically assume your dog is dangerous. This automatically makes for a tougher time. You have to socialize this dog that, at 6 months, people already view as a \"danger\". This doesn't exactly help you depending on what you look like. I know that that's terrible, but the stereotyping exists. My SO's uncle owns a GSD and is very large, very muscular man. No one messes with them on the street. I am a 5'4\" small girl, and no one messes with me or Atlas either, but they're a hell of a lot more willing to talk to me if I need directions. Additionally, they're a bag of nerves because of the popularity of breed. It's kind of a crapshoot. They're so sensitive. You scare them once when they're young and you have to work 5 times as hard to remedy the experience. If you don't, it can grow in to fear. Combined with the fact that their nerves are crazy, the fear and can turn in to fear aggression really quick. Then, you have something to deal with for possibly the remainder of their lives.    I look at my pup and I cannot believe people people think he is a vicious beast. He cuddles with me all night and kisses my face good morning. He follows me around because he likes my company more than anything and he is so full of love. Yet, people do not see him that way, and it was not easy to get him this way. It took training from 10 weeks old every single day and extensive socialization to get him where he is today. He has his problems as he still jumps when he gets too excited and he sometimes tugs a little on his lead when he gets too excited, but we're working on those. I couldn't ask for a better dog. All in all, it is possible. You will get discouraged from getting a GSD for a first dog, and I almost always agree with those statements, but if you want to make it happen, it is possible.    Now that that's over (sorry):  1.) Most other users have done a great job covering this. The best thing you can do is to rig the odds in your favor. Go with a reputable breeder that's done tests as you stated. Secondly, keep them off of hard surfaces, stairs, or any extensive exercise. In example, I limited my dogs exercise severely. However, you need to know that it is not guaranteed. The sad reality is that sometimes, it just happens. It's fucking shitty, but it does. Sometimes, you can go to the best breeder in the world and limit all the stairs and hard surfaces, but you just got unlucky. You have to be prepared for that. The best possible way I recommend doing that is getting pet insurance that covers Hip Displaysia and Elbow Displaysia. GSDs are a fucking sickly breed. Like, I won't lie to you. My dog is always fucking sick, but pet insurance has saved both of our necks. Here is an excerpt from another post I made:  &gt; Atlas is about a year and a half old right now and pet insurance has been worth every penny. I have filed 7 claims so far and Healthy Paws has reimbursed me a total of $3596.11. Compare this to the amount I have paid for insurance ~$60/mo for 14 months now comes out to $840. That's mind-blowing to me.    I cannot recommend healthy paws enough, and I do think that they provide to Canada (please correct me if I'm wrong).           2.) This is depending on your area as well as some choices you're going to want to make. I would absolutely talk to a vet about parvo in the area. It isn't widely talked about, but the German Black and Brown Breeds are, for some cursed reason, more prone to parvo (per my vet). You can exercise them inside. When they're little pups, chasing a ball across a living room floor is plenty when coupled with brain games. Pups sleep a great deal anyhow. The remainder of the time will be spent socializing. This isn't limited to other dogs. You have to get him on different surfaces: tiles, vinyl, hardwood, carpet, etc. Check out Sophia Yin's socialization checklist. Also, you CAN take them out of the house before they have all their shots, they can just have ABSOLUTELY NO CONTACT WITH THE GROUND. This means carrying. And he/she probably won't like it. It's a pain, but I think it was worth it for me. That being said, GSD's are notorious for being dog reactive. It's critical that, as soon as you can, you start providing positive experiences socializing your puppy. I cannot stress enough that you have to do everything in your power to make sure these experiences are positive. At the age you will be doing this, your pup will be so young and impressionable that a bad experience can really set you back. I recommend private play dates with differently sized pups and dogs of people you trust.    3.) They have supplements and such and things that they market, but again, it really is down to mostly luck and you doing the necessary precautions. My vet said we will start supplements when he is a bit older.    4.) I am not Canadian and cannot weigh in here.    5.) Atlas loves his Benebone. He loves bully sticks and this stuffed dragon he has. Honestly though, his favorite thing is to cuddle. I love the Sleepypod: a car harness I think everyone should own. I also love my Rok Strap Leash which is ridiculously expensive and I would never buy myself but was gifted.    Now I know that was long, and thank you for reading it all the way through if you did!

This might be an unpopular opinion, but I would pee him at the 2 hour window on the dot, then he'd go straight back in to his crate because 3 AM is sleepy time and I needed him to understand that. I would ignore all crying because i know it wouldn't be a need to toilet and just be attention crying. He got the picture pretty fast.

{"dsgkc61": {"text": "My SO's family has raised three: Leo, Taz, and Joy. Unfortunately the first two have already passed and Joy is a puppy that's coming up on a year. Each dog has been very distinct.    Leo was like a sentinel. He played, but was never much of a toy dog. He was full of love and drooled a great deal. In his last few years, Leo loved nothing more than laying in his spot in the sun and laying near the people he loved. He was quite intelligent and picked up commands on their own.     Taz was so energetic and really never grew out of being a puppy. He would ram in to stuff and destroy toys until his very last day. He was the type of dog that would run straight up to you for affection and was always going at 100 all the time.    Joy is the best. Holy shit. Joy is like the best dog ever. (Except my dog of course). She is everything you would want in a dog and is the medium between Leo and Taz. She can settle down (working on it, she's currently a teen pup) but she has so much love to give. She rolls over on her back right next to you for belly rubs frequently.    Traits that all three have shared are the follow:  - Large (Joy is on the smaller size, but still roughly 80 pounds) . - Tail Wags of extreme strength (Leo actually broke a glass paneling on a shelf and Joy wiggles with her entire butt. It's adorable) . - Walks up and sits on the feet of the people they care about . - Cannot, for the life of them, hide their affection for people . - Even the higher energy ones do fine without exercise, but they appreciate if they get it.    Edited to add: Also the shedding. They don't shed as much as my dog (German Shepherd), but they do certainly shed a lot. However, they shed more in clumps instead of individual hairs (if that makes any sense whatsoever) so it's easier to pick up.", "link_id": "t3_7p9d7o", "time": 1515572113}}
{"dsgb5hy": {"text": "You were very clever in putting the puppy tax first. I cannot resist answering to a good puppy tax. Your baby is adorable.    Your first concern is valid, and I want to commend you for being a great dog owner for actively thinking about not raising a needy puppy. Nap time in the lap once or twice a day is fine, but there needs to be other time designated to \"alone time\". I saw that you're crate training. What I did with my pup when he was young was sometimes, I'd put him in his crate while I was next to it. That way, he wouldn't associate it with abandonment. Slowly, I increased the distance I was from the crate until I could comfortably be in the other room. I had to be very careful with this because my pup's crate is next to my bed. You could possibly implement a similar method. All in all, tl;dr, train your puppy to be alone as well and you shouldn't have issues.    Second, the shot/socialization debate is hotly contested. I think that it's important to assess parvo levels in your area with your vet and discuss what they think is the best course of action. If you do take your pup out, I highly recommend carrying-- no ground contact. However, if you decide not to, all is not lost. Yes, there is a prime socialization window, but it's not as if your pup closes itself to all outside experiences after that. My pup had a nasty virus all throughout his prime socialization window and had to be quarantined. It sucked. I was extremely stressed out over socialization. However, after he got better, I made it my mission to socialize the heck out of him. He gets along well with other dogs now and I haven't run in to any glaring socialization issues.", "link_id": "t3_7paql5", "time": 1515556599}}

{"drm4pfd": {"text": "I don't know why you're getting downvoted if I'm being honest. I'd like to preface my reply by saying that I am a mentally ill individual currently on medication living in California and pursuing and will have my Bachelors degree this coming summer which I've gotten in four years. This is absolutely not to brag, but to paint an illustration of my viewpoint on the matter and how it might be skewed due to my standing.    I'd like to start by addressing his ADHD. I saw in one of your comments that he got on medication a few weeks ago! That's awesome! However, unfortunately, with mental illness medications, it's kind of a crapshoot. Often times there's tons of medication trials including different medications, dose changes, interaction adjustment, and more-- and this needs to be done every single time a medication is added to the regimen. It can take years to get a good combination for an individual. What I'm saying here is that just because he's on medication now and he's started his medication journey, does not mean that it is the right dosage or the right medication at all. In fact, there is absolutely a chance that this medication is making his condition worse. This could have influenced his recent behavior including but not limited to how erratic he's been and how he blew off the essay.    Moving on, if you care to share this with him, and if he ends up deciding to pursue this degree whether next quarter or much later in his life, most colleges have student disability services that helps students with mental illnesses. I've found them extremely helpful and I'm so very grateful. I've gone from being a mediocre student to a good student through their services. I ask you to share this information with him regardless of what you choose to do with your relationship as it is a resource that he can utilize.    Now, I see some people saying you are elitist (I don't think you are) and listing that many people are successful without college degrees. This is absolutely true. Many many people can have bright futures without them. Not to be cliche, but Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc. College just isn't for some people, and that's okay! Different people find success and happiness in their own ways and we are not inclined to imprint our own definitions on anyone else. That being said, a college degree, given where we are here in America today, is required for many different jobs. This isn't for everything, but particularly in California where we have a very high population and a high cost of living, competition can be tough. It's just something to consider. Again, this isn't to say there is no path for success.    Lastly, you entered this relationship with an idea that you would be dating (and one day marrying) a man with a college degree. If that's what you were looking for in a relationship, then that's okay. It does not matter what your reasons are. I actually understand and identify with your reasons via logic of my own, but that doesn't matter. Just because you are already in a relationship does not mean you are obligated to stay with a person. In example, if I only date men with blue eyes (lol), and one day, my significant other got colored contacts and decided to wear them for the rest of his life, I would break up with him. Even though this is insanely trivial and stupid, I only date men with blue eyes. He no longer has blue eyes. Therefore, I no longer want to date him. It's very simple. Do not let anyone shame you in to staying with someone who do not see taking a life path that synchronizes with your own. Even if it's something as stupid as their eyes no longer being blue, you have every right in the world to break up with them and not feel bad about it.
