I want to let you know, though, I\u2019ve had several doctors say I\u2019m not bipolar, and several doctors say I am bipolar. You may encounter different opinions. Your reaction to Celexa sounds pretty hypomanic to me. I am not a medical professional, but I do have experience working with a disability agency. The DSM-5 requires hypomania to last several days to get a BP II diagnosis. In my experience, more and more clinicians are thinking there is a bipolar \u201cspectrum\u201d and just because you don\u2019t meet the strict criteria on the DSM, doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t somewhere on that spectrum.
