No. I just quietly wished I had it easier.As it turned out, I was a late bloomer.

I\u2019d spent my whole teenage years wishing I was pretty and now I looked a little better, people stopped taking me seriously (I worked in finance at the time as a mortgage advisor - people often thought I was the receptionist instead).Being attractive ISNT the be all and end all.

I noticed the other girls becoming more and more distant and didn\u2019t understand why - I wasn\u2019t telling them the things he said I just wanted to come to work and do my job.2.5 months later I had my first performance review with said manager...and he tore me a NEW one.

I\u2019m 5\u201d7 and on the left weight around 126lbs. No exercise, just starving myself, hating myself and drinking heavily. Fast forward to now, I\u2019ve been stable for over a year with no major episodes, have bought my first house, have maintained gainful employment and I\u2019m finally happy! Focusing on my mental health meant completely sidelining any diets or exercise - Bipolar is all about extremes and so if I was to continue with diets I would have fallen back into the same extreme patterns of starvation and self loathing. Instead I focused on my therapy. This in combination with medication has lead to weight gain. Turns out being happy can make you go the other way! Eating and drinking till my hearts content - the picture on the right is me today, currently weighing in at 151lbs. I\u2019ve found this community as I\u2019m finally ready to find (and accept) *balance*. I\u2019ve learnt so much about myself in the last few years and I\u2019m finally ready to take control. This isn\u2019t so much about weight (although I would like to slim down a little) but about health. I want my hair to keep growing, I want my skin to keep getting better. I like my nails being strong enough that they don\u2019t snap every time I bump them. I see the progress made by you guys and it\u2019s so inspiring!! I want that lifestyle, that balance. So today I\u2019m going to start IF 16:8 five days a week with light exercise. I\u2019m not going to set goals as I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for me.

{"eizh2wx": {"text": "Hmm. NAH. I have bipolar disorder and psychosis and things have been very difficult for me and my family through the years because of it. I suppose the difference is I actively take my medication and don\u2019t use my illness as an excuse for poor behaviour. For this reason my family are extremely supportive and I\u2019m grateful and lucky for that. If your brother is unstable and irresponsible regarding his illnesses then I can understand why you feel you can\u2019t be around him right now. Please try to understand though - having these illnesses is no fun for the sufferer either. He existence won\u2019t be a happy one, believe me. Mental illness is a very lonely, distressing place to be.
