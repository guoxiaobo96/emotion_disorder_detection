{"ezt0q1b": {"text": "Take care of yourself first.  Get healthy and plan for your future.  College nowadays is being able to network.  I am a very awkward person who does not socialize very much so I never took advantage of college life.  I started to head into a depressive state my last year of high school.  Then it carried over to college where I isolated myself and missed out on a lot of stuff.  My first year I was kicked out for failing my classes, went back home and started community College, finished a semester then went back into the same college where I failed again.  Lived in the same neighborhood and went to the community College.  Failed, semester after semester.  I moved back to my parents house where I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, taking medication, have been hospitalized once, finished a program at the local community College.   If you can, learn from your mistakes, I'm just realizing this myself.  We all have struggles.  Get the help you need.Thank you for sharing your story.  You are not the only one who has failed in college.  Learn and don't be ashamed.", "link_id": "t3_d26a0m", "time": 1568117682}}

{"ezrp75b": {"text": "Daniel, I know your pain.  I suffer from Depression, anxiety, and voluntarily, involuntarily submitted myself into the hospital about 5 years ago.  I am socially ackward, I can go throughout the day stationed in a silent room (not healthy at all) and my thoughts run a million times a second while my speech is like an old man, slow.  You are very lucky to have been married because I'm in my 30's and have never been on a date that we both agreed on.  My thoughts look towards the negative and I have a bad habit of trying to read body language.  I know the feeling of not being a talkative person, my past shows that when I have too much anxiety, I want to stay silent and not reach out to anyone.  You are doing well with a support group right behind you.  Stay focused and push your self to explore a little more out of your comfort zone and I as well.Too bad comments are blocked on YouTube as their should be a main social board where all comments from the community are posted.  I'm thinking of a program one can make.Thank you Daniel for sharing your world.", "link_id": "t3_d1z961", "time": 1568076905}}
