Saint Francis of Assisi is one of them. Matthew 19:24 says that it's is harder for a rich man to enter heaven, but he doesn't say it's impossible. Luke 12:48 Talks about your commitment as a person, if you're given much, you'll be require to give much. Makes sense because poor people can't help as much as a rich person can. Matthew 6:19-21: talks about where your heart is. A person can have wealth and still have a heart focused on helping others. However, if you're rich and your heart is just focused on becoming richer, then you know what happens. Matthew 13:22 talks about becoming rich by fraud when it talks about \"the deceitfulness of the riches\" on the other hand, by \"receiving seed among thorns\" represents all those who receive the word into hearts full of worldly cares; which sooner or later destroy whatever convictions or good resolutions are raised by the word.
