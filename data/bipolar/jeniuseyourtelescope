He is probably the worst out of all of them. The WORST bedside manner I've ever encountered by far. Called me fat when I said one of my meds made me gain too much weight, did not listen to anything I said at all. I was being treated for depression but KNEW IN MY HEART there was more to it, and he ignored me. ANYWAY.... I had Ali for my next two inpatient stays and he was fine. Nothing special. Not as bad a bedside manner as Malik. Fourth inpatient stay got me Mulder and his resident. She was awful, but he was nice and took the time to listen to me and get to know me (as much as he could, anyway), but I've heard his waiting list for outpatient is 6 months long or something. I did the outpatient day program after this stay (Feb 2018) and needed to talk to a psychiatrist because my family doctor who had been following my care didn't know what else to do with me, so I got Hakim as he had the soonest appointment available. He's alright. Kinda the same as Ali and Malik. They make you wait 20 minutes for your two minute appointment where they ignore everything you tell them and then send you on your way with a prescription that you just said isn't helping and then see you a month later.

The first was Girl Talk, and it was for girls only, ages 16-24. We talked about our issues, learned some basic coping skills, how to deal with our disorders and when/if to tell people about them in relationships. I found this one super helpful, and I made friends I still talk to today. I was 17-18 when I was involved with it.The second one, was called Emotions Management, and I'm 22 now. I'm supposed to be there right now, actually. The problem is that everyone else is 16, so while I'm trying to figure out how to manage my emotions and get back to work and become a functioning adult again, they're mad and pissed off because \"some bitch started shit with me in the cafeteria so I threw a chair at her\" (an actual quotation from the one session I attended). They are only attending because their schools/parents made them.That was a lot to say, but if you find a support group where the ages are all similar, I'd say go for it, but if you're with a bunch of people a lot younge than you, it may not work out as well because the issues you all face will be so different and it'll be very hard to relate and get anything from their participation.", "link_id": "t3_4dlv3q", "time": 1460062627}}

Ontario, Canada Registered Practical Nurse (LPN is the equivalent in the US).1) I was trained to work in a hospital. I do not currently work in a hospital. I feel as though I was not prepared adequately for where I work as a nurse. I work in a retirement home.2) Not really. I had 3 days of orientation at my job. Two were day shifts, one was an evening shift. Guess who exclusively works evenings... The Director of Care at my retirement home is not actually a nurse either (don't get me started) and I am the sole nurse working on a shift, so.... if I have a question, I've gotta text or call school mates for general knowledge.3) My last semester of nursing school was consolidation and we were paired with an established nurse and trained with them to eventually take over their patient load, so I've got her. But unless I seek her out, I don't have a mentor.4) I love my job but I don't love nursing. If that makes sense. I probably will nurse until I find something I'd want to do more.5) I have not. 6) If you're not working in a hospital, you're probably the supervisor of where you're working.
