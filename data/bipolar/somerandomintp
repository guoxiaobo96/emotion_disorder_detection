As far as I remember it's written from the aliens/professors point of view and pointing out the weirdness of the human race (imo it's really funny - I laughed my ass off).The alien slowly learns how to adapt human behaviour and suddenly feels somewhat of an \"emotional connection\" towards his \"family\" (wife, son and dog) and generally starts to enjoy the human way of life, even though it's actually inefficient, led by emotions and overall pointless.Ok, that was a really short summary, but I didn't want to spoil too much.

I actually think that everybody uses all functions, just in a different way and intensity (the use of certain functions basically \"creates\" the type, if that makes sense).

{"flkj66a": {"text": "I'm an INTP...Fist of all I think it's primarily about maturity. Of course some types tend to get along better than others, but I think if everyone is mature enough to spot and accept the differences between types and acts accordingly even an (just an example) INTP and ESFJ could genuinely get along. It's not about the type, it's about maturity.But now to your question:I/E: I notice, that I tend to get along with introverts slightly better, because they are usually better at accepting my need for alone time. But a lot of people I get along with very well are extroverts. I'm slightly more overwhelmed when I'm hanging with them and definitely need a break after, but when I'm fully recharged I always have a good with them!N/S: I think we're all on the same page about this one. There are a few xSxx I get along very well (one in particular), but when I'm really not getting along with someone it's mostly S types. I don't really understand them and vice versa. In case you're both very mature and patient, you may complete eachother quite well, but it's gonna be difficult for sure. I think this discrepancy is the greatest and most challenging one!T/F: It really depends. I think F and T types have the potential to get along very well and kinda balance eachother out, but it can also be a difficult relationship. As a thinker I'm often overwhelmed when someone is overly emotional. I tend to devalue emotions (I don't say that this is a good thing) and I'm therefore often seen as cold and unemotional especially by feelers. But when you find a way to communicate it can be a really good relationship. Personally I, for whatever reason, have quite \"a lot\" (for my conditions) ENFP friends and I get along with them very well, because we found a way to communicate. And to be honest they often help me to stay in touch with my own emotions.P/J: Most of the people I know are xxxJ I got used to them and their behaviour pretty early on. My parents, my best friend - all INxJ's. Most of the time I don't notice any problems, except they are sometimes a little annoyed that I'm so indecisive. Personally I enjoy having a J type around, because they help me getting my shit together.All in all: there are noticable discrepancies, but imo it's about maturity, not about the type!", "link_id": "t3_foarvc", "time": 1585241914}}
