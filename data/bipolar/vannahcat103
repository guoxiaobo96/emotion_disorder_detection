As far as the sensory stuff, it seems like it might be more severe for you right now but doing things like trying to be on the best sleep schedule you can be on and eating healthy foods/ drinking lots of water can help your senses feel a little more normal. but I also experience stuff like that, like sometimes my perception of objects in the room im in change and sometimes sounds kind of stir and blend together for me when I feel like that. I just try to ride it the best that I can and give myself pleanty of time to think before making big decisions or communicating. Also remembering that it passes eventually", "link_id": "t3_gws7ps", "time": 1591317020}}

When she would come over to stay the night, she would do really sexual stuff like grab my boobs and my butt and tell me that I was really attractive, she even joked about being gay for me n all that. I don't know if anyone else has had a friend like this? She was pretty upset when I told her I actually liked her one day. She pulled the whole \"you're just confused\" thing. I think the whole situation was weird though. She ended our friendship abruptly one day, and she basically hates me now lol.", "link_id": "t3_gwgrjq", "time": 1591303364}}

Personally I feel like compassion is essential for coping with humanity and its flaws, but its been difficult to find it.As far as observing yourself and your actions, I feel like failing in that is a result of too much pride, like of empathy, and lack of self forgiveness. Ive met a lot of people who struggle with this and unfortunately sometimes they go their whole life carrying that perspective on themselves, also feeling like they have to constantly defend against the world.", "link_id": "t3_gwnv2l", "time": 1591302236}}

{"fsri6b7": {"text": "How do you feel when you see your to do list each day? Sometimes lists help when you can look forward to them but naturally our feelings change over time so it can be easy to feel overwhelmed by the same thing that was helping you so much before. But its okay that sometimes we feel like this and become not as productive as we were before. When that happens I guess I sort of take a break and become more productive in self reflection and self forgivness rather than organization. But at some point you'll feel yourself change again and find that you can take on more. This is just my experience, I hope it helps \u263a", "link_id": "t3_gvcuju", "time": 1591203073}}

I tried to assign actual times for my morning activities but you can see on the right side my afternoon activities are kind of just \"do this at your own pace\" type stuff. When I have a successful morning schedule and do everything on time it helps put my mind in a place where I can apply that time management on my own later in the day. Also throwing in activities that are a little more recreational but still productive, like yoga and me time.

It doesn't work for everyone, but I've always had a strong sense of spirituality and lots of questions so searching for answers isn't only exciting but it also puts certain things at ease for me. In eastern philosophy they teach about our sense of self changing and evolving constantly. Its the whole \"who you are today isn't who you were yesterday\" thing. The reason I like to see things this way is bc I feel like I'm always adapting to my environment, and I think that's a good thing.
