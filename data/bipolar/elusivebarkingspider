I brush with an electric toothbrush and use a waterpick (or floss).  It only takes minutes to do, but i feel SO MUCH better after.  But even that can be hard to do when you're really down!

It can seem daunting to do \"everything\" you need to do to stay mentally stable, but just starting with one small task a day (e.g. brushing your teeth), and then gradually increasing to that routine (adding a 5 minute workout after) can make a world of difference.OP, it's so hard, I totally sympathise.  Try taking care of yourself in one SMALL way each day and hopefully over time you can increase that self care.

{"foshc31": {"text": "I honestly didn't think he would win orignally as a Dem, but even left-leaning media outlets were touting him for a while.  One podcast I listen to (The Daily by NYT) really prepped him up all the way up til the last couple of caucuses, when Biden started pulling ahead in the polls.  Before that, it really seemed that (surprisingly) Bernie would have a chance.Once Biden took the lead, the left-leaning media ran with it and seemingly forgot Bernie.  They went blank on reporting him.  Even here on Reddit, where previously I would see (guestimating) 20 - 30 Bernie posts a day... Those all but disappeared and the focus went to Biden.  At that point I knew it was not possible for Bernie to win the nomination...And THEN the left media started downplaying Joe's documented perversiveness.  \"The Daily\" should specifically be ashamed of themselves... They did an entire podcast episode (with a female guest reporter) to try and convince their viewers that the way Joe presents himself to women is just the type of polititian he is - handsy, touchy/feely, \"affectionate\" to his constituents.  In this episode, they went on to talk about how things he does, like rub shoulders, smell hair, etc. aren't considered sexual harrassment, which is a very serious accusation.  Things that in any regular office environment could hands-down be reported as sexual harrassment, because that's what it IS.Anyways, to get back to your question, I hoped Bernie would win based on his grassroots movements, the left-wing media hyped it up, people (including myself) took the bait, and then the rug was pulled from under my feet.

{"foruc9l": {"text": "I wanted Bernie to win, but then Biden became the top candidate.  While not surprised by this, I remember when the \"creepy Joe\" videos started coming out, back when he was VP.  So when he became one of the top contenders for the DNC (him or Bernie), I thought for sure Bernie would win because Joe already had public dirt on him.  Seemingly everyone has forgotten about how creepy he is to young girls and women, and his new sexual assault accusation is being completely downplayed by the dems (shame on you, New York Times).I changed my party to Democrat to vote for Bernie.  I don't like Trump, but I sure as hell don't like Joe.  It is realy frustrating because I started trying to get into politics around the 2016 election; I ended up not voting because picking between Clinton and Trump was like trying to choose between the lesser of two evils (in my mind).So  this year I switched to Democrat for Bernie only to have the same thing happen again, this time with Biden and Trump.For what it's worth, I grew up in a conservative home, and I'm totally open to voting either Rep or Dem.  However, it's important to me to vote for someone who has honesty and stability in their policies.  When it comes to policies, I'd rather vote for the person who won't change their stance on issues, even if it's something I don't 100% agree to; at least I know I'm not being lied to just to get a nomination.  If the Republicans can come up with a more honest (and intelligent) candidate, I'd be likely to change my voting party again.  But I don't see that happening in the foreseeable future (honestly not sure I'll see it on the Dem side either at this point now that Bernie's out).

He tells me it's \"not about the person, it's about their policies\" (which seems to be a common theme among like-minded people - baffling since they are saying they are ok with hypocrisy).  He says that God used David, who started off a horrible person, to ultimately do God's bidding.Personally, I'd rather vote for someone who has different policies from me BUT is known to be honest... and the current administration is devoid of honesty...There was a documentary on Netflix about Roger Stone, one of Trump's (former?) henchmen.  In it he talks about their lying strategies.  First deny, deny, deny, then if they can't continue denying for some reason, have a good excuse and downplay the issue (and maybe add more lies), rinse, repeat.  (I'm paraphrasing their strategy but the gist is that it's based on a foundation of lying.)  I can't stand Roger Stone after watching that documentary, and that's a man which whom Trump used to associate frequently.

It's late and I'm too lazy to look up specific Bible verses right now, but Jesus preached to love everyone, and surrounded himself with sinners of all kinds, including becoming close with a known town whore (Mary of Magdalene).  His whole philosophy revolved around loving everyone, including one's enemy (which, of course, is an extreme challenge).So why would someone disown their own child for not believing, when Jesus himself taught his disciples to love everyone?  There's a saying \"hate the sin but love the sinner\", which is what that parent should be doing if they have a child who has renounced the parent's faith.  Please note I am in no way saying that the child has actually sinned by renouncing the faith, only that the parent should be looking at it from that lens.  Now, trying to re-indoctrinate the child is a completely different beast.  I don't think a parent should do that, though I do empathize with why they would try.  Honestly, if the parent is coming at re-indoctrination out of love and tries once or twice to bring up the topic, fine, but any more attempts are completely disrespectful to the child.It also depends on the relationship of the parent(s) and child while the child was growing up - if they were not good parents in the first place, my above logic is waived.As someone who knows people on both sides, and also many people who have left religion after they became adults, I can see both sides.  It really comes down the the parent/child relationship as a whole AND the ability of all parties to be open-minded and/or (at least) respectful of each others' beliefs, even when they are not in agreement.", "link_id": "t3_efhuh2", "time": 1577342745}}

ALL of my appointment reminders are set via text/email, and I communicate with my doctors via their messaging system unless I specifically have a scheduled phone appointment (that I previously scheduled in-office or via their messaging system).  Recently 2 of my appointments were cancelled - one for one of my children, and one prenatal.  It is definitely possible that they called and I missed it; however, they didn't follow up via message or text.  So I didn't realize I missed the appointments until after they were scheduled to happen (I try to schedule things on a calendar but I sometimes forget, so I rely on the text reminders that are sent out the day before the appointments, which I didn't get because the appointments were cancelled).When I went in after rescheduling, I asked the doctor why they didn't message me, and she told me they ONLY cancel via phone... but they message me for literally everything else, why wouldn't they message me about that?The doctor (one that I've never met before because my regular OB was out) also gave me grief for not having a prenatal appointment in a long time. I was a week late from my originally-scheduled appointment; it wasn't like I waited 3 weeks to go in.

{"eo70ryr": {"text": "Lots of small changes leading to feeling better overall, especially eating healthy, exercising, and taking care of myself - spending time to make myself look/feel nice (actually styling my hair, putting on makeup, etc.).  That said, even when doing all the small things, some days are still not great. It really is one day at a time.  Therapy also helps if you have a good therapist.I did medicate but stopped because they were not working for me and they were not allowing my body to lose weight, even with healthy eating and exercise. (Not saying meds don't work, but I don't have a great mental health network through my insurance and that has been a real struggle on my journey).That said, if something I deem bad happens, it can trigger a huge depressive episode that puts me back at square one, and it takes a while to dig back out of the hole.  Also, for me, it's important to look nice if I'm going out in public, but it can be impossible to find the time to style hair, do makeup, etc., and that definitely feeds into my depression when I'm in a low phase. I wish I wasn't so vain about my outward appearances, but it's something I've battled with since my teenage years; it also makes it easier to hide the depression if I can make myself look presentable.", "link_id": "t3_bqqzvq", "time": 1558329642}}
