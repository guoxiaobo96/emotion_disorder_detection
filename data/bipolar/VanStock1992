I know he enjoyed the scene too on a logical level but emotionally I don\u2019t get it.2. All my restraints removed and massage anywhere they were straining/digging. Even the sound of this part is necessary. Chains clinking and drawers being opened and closed to our things away.3. Fed/given a bit of sugar in some form and ice water since I likely can\u2019t hold it myself4. Snuggles with very little skin contact so we both get redressed in long sleeves and pants. The skin on skin is too sensory harsh for me.5. Sleep. Like 12-14-16 hours of it.6. A good late breakfast out to eat where we talk about the scene and reminisce7. A massage for any soreness, pulled muscles or strains. Typically oil or CBD lotion.8. A quiet day. Not expecting much of myself or him but spending time reconnecting as partners instead of victim/attacker or whatever I mentally to cope with since we do a lot of fear based play9. Check ins often for the next week, both every morning/night in person and several times over the course of the day at home. He asks because I have a habit of shutting down or not even realizing how I am until someone asks and I have to come up with an answer.10. Often times, a therapy appointment where I can talk through any feelings I still am having a hard time with. Most commonly guilt over my enjoyment of the scene and conflicts with my faith. I see my therapist weekly so it isn\u2019t that far of a stretch to do this every time. Yeah, that\u2019s my aftercare routine in ten parts lol.

If so, how long has it been since her meds have been evaluated and adjusted by an ADHD conscious psychiatrist? Not a GP.Medications can be an ACTUAL life saver for people with ADHD. We have increased risk of death by lifestyle related issues and accidents based on our impulsiveness. If she is not medicated this would be step #1 as far as I\u2019m concerned. 2. Does she experience sensory overload? If so, reduce that uncomfortable sensory input. ADHD and autism have this in common. It can be impossible to do a task like the laundry of the sound of the pipes squeaking when you run the washer makes you want to remove your own fingernails. If it\u2019s sounds, get ear plugs and white noise. If it\u2019s textures, a pair of gloves she likes (rubber, leather, micro etc). Clothes that are comfortable to move in as well. Curtains if the house is too bright or new lighting fixtures. This leads me into 3...3. Create an ADHD friendly environment for living, work and play. Beyond the sensory things I listed, adhd makes organizing something BEFORE a task damn near impossible. And some habits cannot be broken. So, what do we do? Well I drop clothes everywhere so we have a hamper in every room. Then there is a posted schedule that has every Wednesday as laundry day. I do as much of it as I can because ROUTINE and RULES make all the difference. We also have a post it system. Reminders that I can leave if I need my Sir\u2019s help to *accomplish something or if he needs me to handle a task. We also use white boards, calendars, a roomba, and the 15 minute method. That means let\u2019s say your main upkeep tasks are floors, bathrooms, table tops, and clutter. So I have 1 of those a day and i or he sets a timer for 15 minutes. I get more done in that set amount of time than if I ADHD cleaned for a whole day. Then I run the dishwasher 1x a day and I run the laundry on laundry day. But you could also do 1 load of each a day! Then big projects, I serve by helping him on a day off or weekend.My book recommendation for ANYONE who has a more fragile partner for one reason or another is \u201cLeading and Supportive Love\u201d because it puts more emphasis that traditional D/s texts on being a guide for your s type instead of only an authority.

I guess I just feel like I start something like working outside and I can\u2019t stop until it\u2019s done.

After he ate I was cleaning up my kitchen the best I could when I was cut off for the evening.

{"eb38avc": {"text": "I\u2019m a service oriented sub outside the bedroom and this is an awesome question.Essentially, I see my Dom and I as a family unit or household and he is the head of household while I am a member that follows the orders of the head. The division of labor is that he works and I handle domestic tasks. These are clear expectations we have for one another. Through it all, laundry gets done and meals get cooke and bulls get paid and the world keeps on turning.When we\u2019re with family this dynamic doesn\u2019t stop, though we do not involve others in it as they have not consented. I sit at my Dom\u2019s feet in a lounge area and to his right at the table. The floor sitting is only done when it can be discrete like when there are already people bringing in dining chairs and a mother playing with her baby on the floor. When buffet like diners are served, he sits down so I can fill and serve him his plate before getting my own. The same with drinks. And I will watch his plate and drink so that I can ask him if he would like it filled or freshened. Typically, I freshen water (as everyone needs water to live) but ask if he wants another soft drink, milk, juice or alcoholic beverage. Sometimes I get my own drink and sometimes I am supposed to ask for sips from his, but I\u2019m free to have water any time. Of course, I clean up after him in public and at home and fetch his jacket/boots/keys/phone (and instruments as instructed) when it\u2019s time to leave. Besides some teasing comments from select knowing family members or \u201clucky man\u201d and \u201cyour so sweet\u201d from older men that don\u2019t know people seem to keep their thoughts to themselves.As far as rewards go, we tend to go out for brunch after a late night intense scene as a reward to me. I can also spend more on fun BDSM toys or pretty things when I do my chores and keep up with them.My personality is a control freak in a lot of ways so this helps me keep my hands busy and have influence other my environment in a way that serves my dom instead of inconveniences him. Which is a pretty important part of it all for us.Mr K and I are spiritual and philosophical but do not follow organized religion. If we have to describe our faith we joke that we\u2019re hippie-catholic and it\u2019s reflected in our love of nature.Intelligence wise, not to toot my own horn, but I\u2019ve tested fairly highly on IQ, ACT and standardized testing for most of my life. I don\u2019t give those too much weight, as someone could succeed on those but be uselessly dumb in terms of their common sense, and yet I still find them to be a small marker that mean something. Perhaps just that I\u2019m very good at multiple choice tests.My Dom is very mechanically inclined and could rig almost any engine or machine to work with only half the right equipment. He spends much of his time in his own head so having the rest of the world turn without his explicit coordination (chores, bill paying, etc) is a weight off his shoulders. Did I miss anything?

{"e7nntsi": {"text": "Four years experience as a sub, this is my advice. Restraints - Start with high quality cuffs. My current set was $34 for the wrists and $37 for the ankles and that did not include anything to connect them together. Comfort and safety is the top priority. Cheap cuffs can come undone, leave permentant marks and cause other issues. Good cuffs will NOT come with a chain/bar and you will buy that separately. My chains were $14 and $15 respectively at a BDSM boutique. I do not use bars at this present time as they are just bulky to store and transport.  Striking Implements - Hold your horses, here. Keep it simple to start. A SOFT leather flogger with a plastic handle is plenty to start off with as it can't be used too harshly. My softest was $20. Otherwise your Dom can use her hands but NO MORE than 1/4-1/2 of her strength to start with until your endurance is determined. Once you're past the beginner phase you can move on to paddles/crops/canes and so on with higher intensities.  Senstation Play - A fun little feather tickler is enjoyable, stimulating jellies are fun (nipple or genital) but test them on a small area of regular skin first for allergies.  I'd recommend finding a boutique (not a dirty sex shop... they're very different) and actually going in to touch the items you are going to purchase. It's worth the tactile experience of seeing what you're drawn to. ", "link_id": "t3_9neac8", "time": 1539376114}}
