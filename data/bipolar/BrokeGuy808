Similar to you, I was diagnosed by my therapist while having a manic episode with psychotic features, one in which I really should\u2019ve been hospitalized. Also similar to you, it sorta forced me to completely reevaluate my life and realize that some of the career paths I was looking into were probably non compatible with me leading a stable life. But In the now year since then, I\u2019ve learned so much more about myself and how this disorder affects me, I\u2019ve learned how medication, while not a godsend, allows me to manage my episodes far better than I ever could before, I\u2019ve learned how having a close support network of friends and family along with therapy keeps me from losing myself in my own thoughts, how although the life I imagined for myself prior to being diagnosed may not come to fruition, the multitude of options I have in life are truly immense, and I personally feel are considerably more consistent with what I actually want to accomplish with these short years/decades we have on Earth. Take time to grieve your past undiagnosed life, eventually you\u2019ll find that this disorder ain\u2019t necessarily all that bad when treated with the respect it demands, and may even allow you to excel in ways you haven\u2019t even realized. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re 18-21 years old like I am, and with that something else I realized was that adult life is literally just beginning for us, we have our entire lives ahead of us still, and to think we are only fit for one career or job in that lifetime simply limits ourselves to an astoundingly acute degree. Life\u2019s too damn imaginative, vast, and unpredictable to plan out, and taking it as is, in its crazy self day by day, might just allow you to accomplish things unfathomable to your own prior beliefs.I wish you well going forward, and please never forget you\u2019re not alone in your struggles, as isolating and estranged as it may make you feel. I\u2019m glad I was fortunate enough to be diagnosed at such a relatively young age, because now I can truly work on myself, instead of letting this disorder work me.
