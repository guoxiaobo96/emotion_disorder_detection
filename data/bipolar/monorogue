{"ehe3ahu": {"text": "First of all, take a step back and breath.I sense a lot of confusion and anxiety in your text.Some of the symptoms you describe are very close to how bipolar disorder manifests. I get manic during spring/summer and then I hit depression during winters.You gotta keep in mind that nobody experiences bipolar disorder the same way. We\u2019re different and we act differently. And many times bipolar disorder comes with other issues. Anxiety disorders, schizophrenic features, etc. So it\u2019s not uncommon to have more than one issue. Plus, there\u2019s also mixed episodes, in which you have both features. And the same goes for meds. Each individual responds differently to meds. And it\u2019s a long and frustrating road until you find the right one/s for you.My advice is to talk openly to your doctor. Describe everything just as you described it here. With as many details as you can. The doctor is the only competent person to give you a diagnosis and then work together with you to find the right treatment (meds, therapy, etc)During my last manic episode I thought I\u2019m cured, I stopped taking my meds, stopped going to therapy and I was convinced I\u2019m healthy. You need to keep track of your moods/thoughts.I keep a journal, and I can always see if I\u2019m spiraling up or going down. I managed to see some patterns and signs that lead to mania (less sleep, lots of energy, ideas, constant need to change my hair color, buy useless stuff, very productive, etc). And this can help you see if whatever you feel or think is a red flag, and you should see a doctor to adjust your meds.My last depressive episode was very bad. I\u2019m just now feeling stable. And it took 3 different meds for this: a mood stabilizer, an antidepressant and an antipsychotic. Sometimes one single med won\u2019t work for your depression, that\u2019s why you need to work close with your doc and give constant feedback.Be open with your doctor. Express your thoughts, doubts, feelings. The doc is there to listen and understand you. Together you can pave your road to stability.Good luck!!", "link_id": "t3_avcid5", "time": 1551271449}}

It was a long ass time flying that I needed to go through. My lay-off in Dallas was just an hour but I was happy that I don\u2019t need to wait around for hours.So I leave Colorado with the destination Dallas. Once we got there, I looked at the clock and realized the flight was delayed with 30 minutes. I started to panic.Once I got at the airport I looked for my gate and I realized I needed to get to a tram. I jumped in, and then I realized my gate had the latter D, and it was basically the last stop. The god damn tram stopped like 6 times and I had a full panic attack because I realized I might lose my flight. I ran like crazy towards the gate, jumped with a heavy bag through the escalator and people on it. I arrived at the gate and there were like 5 people left to board. I managed to catch my flight, and once I sat down in my seat I started crying.Dude, 1 hour lay-off - NEVER AGAIN!!", "link_id": "t3_atv9np", "time": 1550927939}}

I know it\u2019s scary, and confusing, but don\u2019t forget there\u2019s a \u201cyou\u201d behind that diagnosis, and nobody can take that away.As about meds, if you only recently started you might have worse symptoms, as some of them do that before they start to work. Most pills also take some time to work and you can only notice a difference after a while.If you are taking the pills for a while now but they don\u2019t work, you can contact your doc and get another treatment. The right treatment for BP is a must.You can also try therapy that goes hand in hand with medication, and you can get support there when things go crazy.As about the episodes, one way to catch a mood shift - so to speak - before wrecking havoc in your life is to monitor your moods.You can use an app like Dailyo or keep a journal. Monitoring your moods can help you see if you\u2019re going down or up, and you can then act accordingly. Also, it\u2019s good if you start noticing some of the signs.For example, my signs that mania is creeping in is that I start sleeping less and less but still have a lot of energy, my mind just floods me with thoughts and ideas, I become more creative, more open, I start spending more money... Those are my early signs. If you catch the early signs, you can then contact your doctor and have them adjust your meds accordingly so you avoid the episode reaching it\u2019s peak.If you start a journal you can also write short details about your day. Like what did you do that day, if you went out, if you had an argument, etcAnd you can then see which actions influence your moods, so you can identify some triggers.Don\u2019t be scared, bipolar disorder is a pain in the a** but you can handle it.
