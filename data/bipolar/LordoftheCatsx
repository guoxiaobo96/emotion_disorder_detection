I've had it for around 3 months or so now :P.&amp;#x200B;I'm not sure how this monitor would fare against a BenQ E-Sports Zowie. So far, though, this monitor has been great, no dead pixels, great colors out of the box, adjustable stand, etc. I'm not 100% on the 1ms response time, but if i remember correctly, I believe the response time can be changed in the settings for the monitor to change the response time, under \"game mode\" or something similar. I will check when i get home to be sure, though. &amp;#x200B; The monitor is a VA panel, not a TN, you probably know this, but some people have mentioned a bit of ghosting. Have I noticed it? eh, not really. its pretty negligible. I personally prefer the VA because of the better colors, viewing angles and whatnot, but I know people playing competitively sometimes prefer a TN over VA.&amp;#x200B;Also i know you didnt ask but but It is G-Sync compatible even though it's Freesync. I have a 1080Ti, and besides some very occasional screen flashing, (that's normal) It works great and I've not had any artifacting or anything strange with it.&amp;#x200B;The colors are awesome, the screen is pretty big (so you might want to sit farther away if that bugs you), 1440p is perfect and the 144hz is definitely great! Again, sorry if i'm not much help at all, I know i didn't answer any questions you had but if you have any more, feel free to ask and i'll answer them the best I can.&amp;#x200B;Also just a side note: I got mine for $399, Sometimes it does have a great sale going on with it, so if you see it for $400 or so, that's a steal for its size, &amp; 144hz.

I felt somewhat satisfied when I moved out and my ex step mom called me a plethora of names including my favorite: \"that sneaky fucking slut\" xD. I never did drugs, though I could have. After i moved out at 18 though, i did let loose and hopped on the heavy party train for a few years. because, you know, FREEDOM!&amp;#x200B; i was grounded for grades, too, occasionally my dad would ask *why* i was doing so bad, and even though i was clearly suffering from MIs and C-PTSD from some heavy childhood trauma and ofc the current abuse, it didn't matter. So, i had to get sneaky with my grades. I would sneak to the mailboxes to throw away deficiencies, and i was required to get weekly report cards from teachers. If my grade wasn't up to par, i would lie and say we had a sub. my problem was, the subjects i was good in were too easy and i had the highest grades, and though i wanted to be put in AP, my ex step mom decided i was too stupid, so I never joined. However, I struggled hard in math and sciences just because i wasn't interested in algebra and chemistry was too much LOL. and i was always told how stupid i was and that i wouldn't amount to anything anyway, so of course i stopped trying at that point. &amp;#x200B;Yeah my punishments were always 2 weeks+. I think at one point i was grounded for over 2 months. no friends, no phone, no socializing at school, etc. It was always a trip to hear friends be like, \"oh i'm grounded this weekend, but i can hang out next weekend!\" or something like that. like, what? you only get grounded a weekend?? damn.

She gave it to me, I had my doors taken off of my room and everything else except for a mattress on the floor. good times.The grounding could be anything, rarely was it physical, but 99% of the time it including a humiliation of some sort, something being taken away, including electronics, clothes, toys, etc. Sometimes it would be me not being allowed to talk to my siblings or any of the family. just depended on the mood my ex step mom was in at the time. I think abusers in general love to isolate their victims.&amp;#x200B;oh, and i was grounded a lot, because my ex step mom would come home every single day on her lunch break, rip mine and my little brothers rooms apart, I mean like, mattresses flipped, dresser drawers spilled out everywhere, like we got robbed or something. when we got home from school we had to clean it up, 100%.

I'm exhausted every single day, but somehow i just keep pushing myself. When i came out to my parents that i was very suicidal and depressed when i was 13, they laughed at me and told me, \"if i was depressed, then I was the best actress they've ever seen\" since i seemed \"happy\" all the time. I may laugh a lot, at damn near everything, but that doesn't mean i'm not hurting. I suffer from psychotic features as well and sometimes it gets to be way too much, but alas, the show must go on.&amp;#x200B; I've been told, even when i was first diagnosed, \"there's no way you're bipolar\" because of how well i mask my symptoms. For me, I feel like I HAVE to keep going, i can't stop, I have to stay busy, I have to keep my brave face on, it's how i survive. I was raised in an extremely abusive household, and attempted suicide 3 times, and after that i decided that i could never let my abusers win, ever.

I still live in the same city as my ex step mom, albeit on the opposite side of town but anytime we have to go to her side, my anxiety is like, 10-fold, because running into her can send me into a severe return of C-PTSD symptoms. &amp;#x200B;I also would like to add...that i too had an abusive biological mom (she is an alcoholic) and though my dad sucked at protecting my little brother and I, i still love him. Your story literally makes me want to cry and hug you OP. I get a lot of what you're feeling and i totally know how hard it is for people not to take you seriously because how these step monsters act on the outside.

I love my husband dearly. but i would have been much happier to just elope and go on a trip. I sound super harsh, but this was my experience, and i hope you have a better one.

But I also feel like not everyone who has BD, is text book. I mean, you can have a cold, but not have every single symptom, and its still considered a cold because you have *most* of the symptoms, and of course i'm not comparing Bipolar to a cold, but i'm just trying to say that just because someone doesn't have all the textbook symptoms, doesn't mean its a fake diagnosis.Personally, I don't have textbook bipolar. I don't get the elated highs usually when manic, my hypo-mania's are great, but my manias are usually dysphoric, and i'm left in a crippling state where i'm so paranoid i wont leave my house, stand near windows, i hear voices, and i believe everyone is in a conspiracy against me and sometimes i'll end up trying to hurt/kill myself. We never seem to truly know whats going on in another person's life. Maybe they've been struggling more than they let on? who knows? But i don't know this person so i'm in no place to judge.

Moira can run out of heals. So she has to damage in order to get it back, and her heals can run out pretty quickly if the people shes trying to heal are taking a lot of damage. Mercy doesn't have to reload her heals, she can switch between damage boost and healing instantly, there's no CD for her heals, she's the most mobile hero in the game. she is slippery and hard for the other team to catch. she can even do the trick where she can slingshot herself straight into the air. i've rezzed teammates in the middle of a fight because i can tell if they're reloading, their abilities are on CD, they aren't paying attention, etc. and for me i find that *so satisfying*. her Valk is great for initiating a push. they got a pick? ult to counter it. her ult is great to combine with other ults on your team. Pesky Widow or Hanzo going uncontested that your team can't get? Battle Mercy incoming! An ulting pharah? it be a shame if a Mercy killed her mid barrage. xDMy point is, every healer has their pros and cons. Mercy heals less now, yes. But it allowed the chance for other supports to come back. It's still possible to solo heal as a mercy, you just need to communicate with your team that they need to be somewhat patient for heals. I do this all the time, and usually they are okay with it, and come back or someone is kind enough to help out and switch. SShe isn't dead. Her rez is still really powerful, especially when you rez a teammate with a game changing ult like a Genji or a Zarya with Grav, or something.

It allows for more flexibility.It also makes other people *switch to heals* on a team because everyone knows its difficult for a Mercy to Solo Heal. If they want heals, then someone else needs to play healer.

I say this because even though she is nerfed hard right now, her *raw healing* capability, is still the highest &amp; most consistent in the game.Think of it this way, Moira can and *should* be able to out heal a Mercy. she heals multiple people at once. however...she can *run out* of heals, and has to damage in order to gain it back. When that happens, you're technically down a healer, especially if she doesn't have her healing orb.Ana, used to be gimp, and an Ana and a Mercy together is *a lot* of heals. especially with Ana being able to pad Mercy's stats and help her heal faster. It's an awesome combo.I honestly think that yes, shes a little more gimp right now, but i feel like that's because she was extremely powerful for so long. Rez is still powerful. Use it at the right time, and you will get good value. The same goes for Valk. People think its not powerful but, uhm, I use it constantly to help my team initiate a push, i use to to contest. I also kind of am okay with these changes because before, Mercy could solo heal and that was great and all, but it was kind of frustrating, now she can...but its a bit difficult, so *other people* will usually switch to another healer, and that helps a lot.

Along with my BM's daughter as my \"bubble\" girl. (can't throw flowers in a national park)we aren't doing a bridal shower or a bachelorette or anything but the wedding. hubby's two sisters live across the country, and my ex- step sister lives 4-5 hours from me. On top of that, hubby and i are paying for this by ourselves, and both work full time jobs.I told the girls to just buy whatever dress they feel comfy in, as long as it was around the color i had chosen &amp; wasn't too revealing. Same goes for shoes. We are going to be in the forest so keds or heels, i don't care as long as they look nice and you can walk in it.I just asked that they be there the night before the wedding to help set up the reception room,do a quick rehearsal so we all know what to do and how we want to do it, and then after for some drinking and board games. :D I will also be getting them some small gifts.I'm planning this pretty much 100% by myself, so my expectations are already pretty low.

You're bitter, for whatever reason, about men &amp; have this fucking tendency to go out and judge other women acting like you aren't flawed yourself. Maybe instead of insulting someone, you could *ask first* before making rude comments.Women have this weird superiority complex. everything is just a fucking competition and it needs to stop. I honestly feel bad for men in this day and age, they have less rights and can't get away with nearly as much as women do. &gt; The racial metaphor was demonstrative of a wider idea, but clearly it went over your head. I also don't see where I assumed you were white.I just didn't see the need to enter race in there at all. There was absolutely no reason. None.Race and gender are also 2 different things entirely, so i don't see why a correlation needed to be made there in the first place.&gt; Enjoy your special snowflake life and wedding.

I just happen to prefer males over females for my own reasons. That doesn't mean i *gasp* HATE ALL WOMEN. Some of them can be nice. I never said anything mean about the girl who wears stilettos, we just have nothing in common.

{"e272tla": {"text": "&gt; I hope this experience helps you take a long hard look at your internalised misogyny.LOL. That's cute. Okay, #1:This response is the exact reason i dislike women. Maybe that's just in your experience. I've been friends with these guys for 8 years, some of them i've known around 15. In high school i had all guy friends, and then when i moved out to my hubby's house it was me, hubby and like 10 other guys xD. Now, before you go and call me a *enter typical girl name calling here*, i actually was and always will be faithful to my husband, hence why we're married. Girls always manipulate and always want what is in their best interest, and attack &amp; judge other women when they need support. All throughout High school &amp; middle school I had some pretty terrible experiences with women. I've seen those girls that yes, are usually the source of drama, but that's not me, so get your political ideals out of here, because i don't give a fuck. :)I should have explained this better:The only reason im having my hubbys sisters is because i wouldn't have had *any other girls*. i barely *know* them. i've met them twice. they live clear across the country. I'm not even close with my hubby's friends fiance, we have *nothing* in common. She's the girly girl who likes to wear the crop tops and 6 inch stilettos with a full face and hair always done on a daily basis. Don't get me wrong, more power to her, because i wouldn't be able to. But that's while i'm over here always in jeans and a t shirt with my hair in bun playing video games. So, if i didn't have hubby's sisters, and hubby's friend's fiance, i would have my ex-step-sister, and my other friend (my hubby's ex)..While he gets around 8 people on his side, and i get...2. So, i had to come up with something &amp; was hoping that my \"friend\" would be a part of my wedding.We separated the groomsmen and bridesmaids because that's what my MIL wanted. She's the only motherly figure in my life and wants it somewhat traditional. I deleted this post simply because i don't want to start dealing with \"omg Misogyny\" comments, lol. I don't care for the SJW, feminism stuff. Not my cup of tea.

If i need to rez, i always ask for a bubble. Not only does is protect me, but it feeds our Zarya lol. God, Pulse bomb. I got stuck the other day literally mid GA, (Tracer on my ass the entire match) and i just stopped immediately. No one was harmed, except me, RIP.There was one time where a tracer stuck me *right* as i was mid GA to a teammate, i was actually fairly close to them and got them killed by accident. I apologized and they were cool with it xDMcCree is great at protecting healers. Brigitte, though, is also decent. The armor keeps me alive a bit longer especially if there's a pesky sombra/tracer.Fun Story about a Genji: One time, we had a masters Genji on our team in QP. I liked his gamer tag so i was poking fun with him. he was a great Genji, did his job very well &amp; always came back for heals, said thank you, all that..even told me i was a great Mercy. Well the next round...He was on the other team. and he even put in chat \"No one is allowed to go after Mercy but me\"Lets just say that entire game, I've never had to do the \"Genji dodge\" more in my life. He chased me constantly, even went as far one time to camp me at spawn. My husband and my friends playing had to focus him down the *entire* time. Every time he killed me, he apologized. It was just QP fun and there was no reason to get salty over it. but i was spooked LOL.Another tiny tip, Winston is not very scary, His ult may be kind of annoying and knock you around, but just do what i call the \"monkey dance\". Basically, if Monkey jumps you (and not in ult), and you see him, fly a different direction, keep doing this as his jump will be on CD, so it gives you a bit more safety &amp; if you have a widow (i do this with my husband) I fly to him, and keep dmg boosting him because it's not hard to kill monkey and if i'm pocketing Widow for a  bit, Winston won't be able to kill him. okay, ramble over lol.", "link_id": "t3_8ttzqt", "time": 1530029258}}

{"e1a84re": {"text": "Hi! 250+ hour Mercy main here. :)Honestly it depends on the situation at that time.Doomfist- be in the air or if you *know* he's after you, make sure you have an escape route, if you time it just right you can dodge his ult. Blade- because Genji can dash pretty high into the air, this one is a bit scary. usually stay spread out or if we have pharah, dash to her and try to stay faarrrr away from the Genji.Tire- i've seen a lot of Mercys ult when they hear that tire, i'm guilty of this too, but i hate panic ulting. (sometimes though you can help your team kill the tire by damage boosting.) One great way to avoid tire is **stay by your Zarya** preferably in front of her or behind her, depending if she has bubble or not. D.va bomb- lol, This one just depends, really. Just GA to safety. If in valk, fly to the top of the sky box or fly to a place where you won't get bombed/ just a quick tip. Usually, rule of thumb (since it's being ran so often now) a Zarya will have ult around every 3rd team fight or so. Count ults, and around when to expect them, When you think Zarya has grav, spread out. Stay in the back lines or in the air.

Make sure to take *plenty* of time for yourself, and take breaks from planning if you are able!!If it starts to become nothing but stress, take a break or start asking family members/ friends to help you out with planning a bit more! it definitely helps!Remember, it's okay if you guys take a year or two to plan so you have plenty of time.

My pdoc just put me on lithium and if this doesn't work, its depakote, after that...???? My brain is apparently sensitive, but also resilient as hell.

I hope it gets better! &amp; its almost the end of the week! :)I don't know a whole lot about the environment in salons themselves (which sounds horrible by the way, standing with no tennis shoes or mats???) but the environment in Cosmo school was enough for me. I'm already sensitive to criticism and stuff and also probably the most socially awkward person you would ever meet. Probably wasn't the best thing for me to go into, lol. i had some girls threaten to beat me and another girl i went to school with in the parking lot one time. They actually almost hit us with their car, luckily other people saw and stepped in.  The reason they did it was cause they didn't like the other girls lifestyle choices and didn't like me cause i was friends with her (i dont care what people's lifestyle choices are as long as they're nice lol)Hair splinters are legit the WORST!!! ugh those things hurt especially when they get under the nail. Ouch.From talking with stylists, they have to hustle and i really give them mad props. Every time i do go to a salon i always give a 20% tip or more, cause i get the struggle. I don't really know if my experience is similar but while in school the first time, i worked a part time job at Sally Beauty Supply.  this was WAY before they had the scanners.....lucky bastards. We typed everything in by HAND on a program similar to MS DoS.So if you brought up an entire cart full of stuff...i  low-key hated you xD.Anyways, I got close to one co-worker there but my boss had a vendetta against me because way back in high school (it was like 3-4 yrs after i graduated at the time) I dated her step-daughters ex boyfriend and her REAL daughters went to high school with me and for some reason HATED MY GUTS. ( i was a loner in HS) so my boss therefore made my life a living hell until i quit (later to find out i was manic, because i quit a very unprofessional way &amp; then disappeared for like 3 weeks... lol) . Working there was pretty similar to most beauty industry places, You had to look your best, no matter how you felt, your hair had to be perfect, if you had a piercing or tattoos, they couldn't look unprofessionally done, You had to basically harass customers to buy a certain product because we got points or w/e and you had to practically BEG customers to get the sally club card to meet your quota, which was SUPER annoying. especially if you have social anxiety. lmao. All in All i think the beauty industry is one of the hardest for women to be into as it requires tons of competition &amp; things can get really nasty. You still have that accomplishment &amp; experience under your belt. be proud of how far you've come and i know i seems almost impossible sometimes, but try to look forward to the journey ahead.

He let me stay home, put me through school TWICE and both times i dropped out due to mania &amp; once for a mental breakdown. He never held it against me. I was so incredibly proud of him, he did so much for that company and us &amp; when the oilfields crashed, they just dropped him...like he was nothing. It tore him down hard. He has a few ups but mostly he's very down, he's mostly open about it, telling me he's always found it very hard to feel much of anything or care most of his life. He obviously loves me and is incredibly patient with my symptoms. but it's oh so hard.Our house is usually pretty messy, and after me working a full time job, i just don't have the freakin' energy to clean. He does his best when he can and i have learned patience with it. When the fog lifts a little, he cleans, cooks, runs errands for me, he really tries his damn best.I guess it's more of a mutual understanding than anything. Hell, i know what its like to feel that depressed. I just always try to encourage him and honestly do my best not to tear him down. He probably already feels terrible &amp; guilty about how he's feeling so me saying everything negative obviously will not help, and i notice he does the same for me when i'm in a low swing. It does not help that my family hates him now because of the whole \"omg your husband doesn't have a job what trash\" \"you married a lazy good-for-nothing\"  They don't understand it at all, sadly. All i can say to help is honestly, we have built a support system for each other. We luckily are both big introverts, and when i'm sad i like to be alone, and he won't say anything other than offer the comfort or something nice when i'm feeling like that. I do the same for him, i do my best to do something nice. i feel like the key for us is to never tear each other down, ever. It's okay to be honest &amp; talk things though. Communication is important when both are suffering from MI. Also, Its really good not to bottle things up, if you're feeling a way, don't be afraid to say it or talk about it. it really helps. I'm not saying it's easy. It's not a walk in the park and honestly i am guilty of being a total bitch. my illness is no excuse, but sometimes a filter is hard for me to find and i'm just MAD. for no reason other than my brain wanted to be a jerk. We've had some pretty bad fights, and it sucks when you're both thinking the same depressed things. At the same time though, at least we have someone to talk to, always who will understand.This may be crappy advice, and i'm sorry if it is. Every relationship is totally different and we just know what works for us. I really do wish you luck! :) ", "link_id": "t3_89y7qu", "time": 1522944710}}

I try to be the best tank possible and try to fulfill my role as much as i can, I have sword &amp; shield and run with heavy armor. i use abilities that aggro/taunt as much as possible along with shielding/stunning and protecting myself and my group, and i'm fiercely protective of my healer (most of the time i play heals in games so i know the struggle of not having protection.)I got my inspiration from a fellow player when i ran a normal dungeon for the first time way back, i was low level and our team kept getting wiped, i sucked, we all sucked, except for this GODLY tank that..just killed everything &amp; never died and cleared the entire boss all by himself. i was inspired by this player &amp; now I too have experienced tanking a boss all by myself when the rest of my team got wiped (STOP STANDING IN THE RED CIRCLES, DAMMIT). i'm always last alive when this happens, it seems. Its pretty awesome, overall. But when i was a lower level tank (no CP yet) i queued as a DPS &amp; a tank, just in case. (this probably is so wrong but eh) and...the \"tanks\" we got...yikes...one time we had a Magsorc with no...\"tank\" abilities...at all..just DPS. I've also experienced a NB tank, which seemed cool in theory, but it didn't work very well...As a tank i've also sadly experienced a lot of lack in heals, I love &amp; respect healers, but when they legit aren't healing anyone, and just focusing on DPS, i get frustrated, mostly cause, yes, i can live through a lot but i'm taunting the boss i need some help sometimes or just even a buff or two. i ended up reallocating, and switching my second bar to a resto staff, &amp; its helped a lot. (plot twist) And since i've experienced the lack of heals, i decided to make one on PC (Breton MagTemp), and hopefully have helped players as much as i could. :) yikes this was long ramble, sorry!", "link_id": "t3_87rmbi", "time": 1522271615}}
