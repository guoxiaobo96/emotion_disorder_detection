I don\u2019t know what that means but I jumble words when I speak them. I used to stutter a lot. I read Dr. Peterson\u2019s 1990 study on Son\u2019s of Male Alcoholics recently for my General psychology course. My therapist told me I am not crazy but that I have PTSD. Well I she told me many stories and many things. Chief among them was to spread my message.Here I am, aye.Sincerely,A recovering veteran,Brian M.", "link_id": "t3_d6z60s", "time": 1569009509}}
