Freud described the id as the most basic part of personality that urges people to fulfill their most primal needs. The superego, on the other hand, is the moralistic part of personality that forms later in childhood as a result of upbringing and social influences. It is the ego's job to strike a balance between these two often competing forces and to make sure that fulfilling the needs of the id and superego conform to the demands of reality.     Glutamate is a pivotal transmitter of the brain, the crucial link in circuits involved in memory, learning and perception.
