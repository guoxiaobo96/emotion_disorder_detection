Students took a teacher's school issues laptop and ran away with it again on camera and when the teacher went and took it out of the students\u00b4  hands they were accused of assaulting the students and fired.  the administration really liked me and I was one of the few teachers who seemed to be getting some results in the school but every class was a battle and I knew it was probably only a matter of time before something happened to me like what happened to the other teachers. I had a standing job offer to work at an educational startup that did privet tutoring so I called them up and asked if I could start in January and they said absolutely. So I quit during winter break and I could not be happier with the choice I made.

Most adults who learn a second language will only be 80% as good as native speakers. So yes brains are similar and different people who can pick up a language by listening are a bit of an anomaly as far as psych is concerned. I would say it is probably similar to people who  learn an instrument by ear. It sounds like you have a good ear and a good understanding of grammar.

I lived in Mexico for a year before I could really listen and start \"picking up Spanish\" during that year I was studying a lot. It was great to use the Spanish that I had, but when I found myself in spaces where only Spanish was spoken by natives I was often deeply lost. Now that I am intermediate being in a more immersive environment is great I hear words and can use context to figure out the meaning, I can ask people to explain what they mean another way, or I can explain what I mean another way. If you are intermediate I  would say go for it. If you are still working on getting to that level I would say maybe go for a weekend once a month to practice what you are learning in real life and supplement with italki and meetup groups.", "link_id": "t3_bm8urw", "time": 1557342846}}

Other students would have to go around the room and answer questions about the artifacts. This works really well if you can assign students different regions and then have students guess where artifacts are from.  Other fun ideas were to have kids prepare court cases of events that happened in history or town hall meetings about an important event where they would have to take on a certain character and explain their views of the event and explain why they would want a law to pass or not. I would give them guiding questions but they would have to do research on the subject, for the more shy kids I would give them the option of being a fact checker ( usually 2 or 3 per class) and they would make sure that characters where historically accurate in their statements  which meant they had to do more research but less talking.I also liked to do simulations if I could like we did a sharecropper game where students quickly realized how bad the odds were for making money as a sharecropper. We played a game about imperialization where some groups had armies some groups had navies and some groups had navies and armies and then they would try to invade each other.  We did one with the Senate and the House where students got to change the rules for the class for a week. Showing is better than telling. Socratic seminars are great if you have a source document that they can work from, have them annotate the document and create a few questions before the discussion begins. Don't interfere let them talk some times they get a bit off topic but you can assign a student leader to help them stay on task.  If you are studying a part of history that has a lot of art you can have them do an art walk around the room. Have them make connections between the art and the events of the time.

I think  it said that other blood types needed very meat heavy diets for ...\"reasons\". I do think that it is possible that some bodies just process food differently maybe not directly related to one's blood type but related to their genes or environment. Perhaps these people could transfer to a mostly vegan diet ?  I think everyone's path is different and it isn't for me to tell someone how their body feels and how they should live their life.

He asked me how long I took lithium and how effective it was for me. He asked me about my suicide attempt and how I felt afterward, he asked me if I felt like therapy had been effective for me in a meaningful way (I told him yes in regards to processing trauma and dealing with my eating disorder, but not really for bipolar ) He asked if I had ever had a seizure and I said no  he asked if I had been diagnosed as ADD or learning disabled as a child I said yes.  A lot of the same boxes for bipolar get checked for this type of epilepsy the difference as far as I can tell is the response to therapy, how you describe your depression, and your response to medications.

In this article, Roy Freedle argues for a corrective scoring method, the Revised-SAT (R-SAT), to address the nonrandom ethnic test bias patterns found in the SAT. The R-SAT, which scores only the \"hard\" items on the test, is shown to reduce the mean-score difference between African American and White SAT test-takers by one-third. Further, the R-SAT shows an increase in SAT verbal scores by as much as 200 to 300 points for individual minority test-takers. Freedle also argues that low-income White examinees benefit from the revised score as well. He develops several cognitive and cultural hypotheses to explain the ethnic regularities in responses to various test items. Freedle concludes by offering some predictions as to how ethnic populations are likely to be affected by the new designs currently being proposed for the SAT, and describes the implications of the R-SAT for increasing minority admission to select colleges", "link_id": "t3_a5jc5j", "time": 1544652622}}

Sometimes thinking about the whole day was overwhelming  but thinking about the next class was more manageable so I would do that. 2. Make self care easy. For example when I would grocery shop I would look for the healthiest things I could by that took the least amount of effort to make, when you are depressed taking care of yourself can be hard so anything that makes that easier makes your job easier. 3. Find someone you can trust at school. I had a teacher friend that I trusted and could talk to when I was having a tough day and needed a little extra support. I would usually just let her know I was having a rough day and she would come by and chat with me during our planning period. 4. I knew how to modify my lessons based on my energy. Some days you just aren't going to have a ton of energy to teach. These days you should teach the big idea and then facilitate a lesson where the students are filling in the details. I teach high school so sometimes this would be a 15-20 minute lecture followed by some sort of research that I could supervise or presentations  that they would do in groups. These are activities we use as teachers anyway there is nothing wrong with using them on days when you have lower energy. 5. If it was really bad I would take a sick day. I didn't do this often but your mental health is just as important as your physical health and sometimes you just need a day to rest and try again tomorrow. 6. Get help , I mean professional help . I tried to deal with my depression on my own for a long time and when I started getting help even though nothing had really changed it did give me some hope and it made everything feel a bit better.

But I can also tell you that college (at least in the US) is not as crazy as the IB. There are not nearly as many hoops to jump through. Your professors  have the freedom to teach what they think is important to your career not what the IB ( which is just a room full of bureaucrats) decides. I did my Masters degree while I worked 3 jobs and I still think I wasn't as stressed as some of my students in IB. I am leaving the program after this year because I have fundamental ethical issues with the amount of material they want students to learn.

{"e5zf8gf": {"text": "Ok so it sounds like you need a classroom managment plan, my first year teaching was hell. I had a really hard time controlling the classroom but I kept a notebook of all the things that went wrong and my 2nd year I went in with a plan and I haven't had many problems since ( this is my 6th year) . I am sure you heard it is easier to loosen up than to tighen up so the things I am going to suggest are going to take a while to take effect and you are going to have to be consistant and do your best to pass out punishments fairly and expect push back. So first thing is you need to set the expectaion of what rules you want them to follow ( I wouldn't have more than 5 ) These were mine : 1 please be quiet when the teacher is speaking, 2 please ask permission to be out of your seat, 3 please be respectful to your classmates and teacher 4 please only use your cellphone or device when asked to 5 please raise your hand to speak .  Then you have to set up a plan for when rules  are broken , when I started out I used a card system green was a warning, yellow was a 10minuet lunch detention, orange was a call home, red was referral. I would put them on the kids desk so they knew where they stood , and kids were not allowed to argue about what card they got during class. I would just pass out the card and if they wanted to argue about it I told them they could stay after class to talk about it if they wanted to. If a kid was a no show for denttion then that mean the dention was doubled and they were also getting a phone call home.  If they didn't show up twice then it was a referral. If I saw kids with their phones out I would take it until the end of class if they would try and refuse I woudl say well you can give it to me now or you can give it to the principal and your parents will have to come get it.(the school policy was if a phone was taken it could be turned in to the office and parents would have to come get it)  The thing about effective classroom management is you have to be prepared for the next thing the kid is going to say . You also have to be yourself, and work with your personality a lot of teachers told me that I needed to be meaner and that just wasn't going to work for me I needed a system that allowed me to say to kids hey it isn't personal you just broke a rule and this is the consiquince I still like you .  Also never get into it with a kid infront of the class because they have everything to gain and you have evrything to lose , if things start to get escalate you can always ask them to step into the hall and you will be out in a moment to speak with them about the issue.

Depression rarely just goes away on its own so he will also need a long term plan, unfortunately a symptom of the disease is that it makes the person feel worthless and a burden for asking for help. So telling him you are happy that he shared his feelings with you, and encouraging him to seek some professional help from a doctor or counselor could be really helpful. If he is reluctant to all of this you may have to break his trust and tell your friend or his family so that he can get some help, he may be upset at first but if you feel like his friends and family will be supportive then it is probably for the best in the long run.

The hospital keeps you safe and gives you a break from life , it let's you focus on just yourself for a few days. Most of the people are nice.

I started learning in June and here are some things that have helped me. * 1 Getting a spanish tutor from the country I was moving to , she not only taught me about the language , but tons of helpful cultural things that made my move that much easier. If this is out of the question for budget reasons then skip this and move on down the list. * 2Youtube is a great free resource lessons on spanish they have a video for everything. I like The Spanish Dude personally, but you will find someone who explains spanish in a way that makes since to you.* 3 Hand written flashcards and verb conjugations, lots of people will say just use an app for this , but I find I remember words better and more quickly when I write them. * 4 in the very beginning I labeled everything in my house with post it notes * 5 once you have some vocabulary find someone to speak to, you will struggle, it will be hard you will forget words you will only be able to say a few things keep pushing through it. It will get easier. **Here are some things that I did not find very helpful although you might** * 1 duolingo, the phrases are not very useful, although sometimes I use it to review things I have already learned * 2 trying to watch spanish TV shows, I find I get overwhelmed and then I  just kind of tune it out, I am getting to the point where I can do short podcast though.

{"dpah2jf": {"text": "So this is my first year teaching in Mexico, I am at an international school so I am still teaching in English ( and working on my Spanish). The school I am at I think has a lot of potential, they just got a new headmaster who seems to really know his stuff. However it seems like over the past few years they have had a lot of turn over and bad hires. Which has caused some distrust between the staff and administration, that coupled with the fact that many of the teachers are foreign and are relying on the school for support makes for an interesting dynamic. I was thinking that if I could do a few little things to boost morale then it might help. On another note I love the kids that I have , but they are not where they should be for an IB school ( they have been the victims of the high teacher turn over), and many of them do not have the work ethic required to be successful in the program.

We broke up. I month later I checked into the psych ward after a suicide attempt and ended up meeting my current boyfriend. We have been together for 2 years and he gets my mental illness and I get his ( he has major depression). We encourage each other to stay healthy, go to therapy , take meds, exercise, keep a good sleep schedule. Oddly enough it is probably the healthiest and most adult relationship I have ever been in.
