One depiction of a way for confronting trauma that I heavily prefer over forgiveness was shockingly displayed in a child\u2019s cartoon! In Avatar: TLA There is a confrontation with a character and the man who killed her mother. While this clip does contain heavy spoilers, I identify far more with this portrayal of coping.Before COVID-19 I would have heavily suggested not just a therapist in PTSD/PTSS, but would also look into one that does EMDR. EMDR is a technique used for overcoming trauma- I, and many others, absolutely LOVE the technique.I would also suggest looking into credentials- What kind of degree do they have? How specialized are they in for such care? Do they work for an organization, and if so- What are their requirements/standards? I would also look into insurance (if you have it) and see if it covers the therapists that you are considering as your new one.", "link_id": "t3_gebft9", "time": 1588745229}}

{"fpeytap": {"text": "The only reason I have that comes to mind is that it has us sympathize heavily with Carl right from the start. To only be introduced to Carl as seeing him grouchy, closed off, and refusing to befriend others- It can feel annoying, pointless, and stupid without a reason given. And while the reason can be given later on in the movie and the sympathy may hit harder (especially with guilt for having judged too quickly.) Having people sympathize with your character later in the movie is too big a risk. People do leave movie theaters if they don\u2019t like it and it \u201ctakes too long\u201d for them to like a character.However, when we see Carl\u2019s life explained, it has us immediately sympathize with him, and like him because we understand his crankiness and closed-off behavior.I also find it as a great hook, line, and sinker. Everyone\u2019s immediately invested. They see how they fall in love and the depictions are genuine, thought out, and strong. And when everyone cries from Ellie not being able to have children, to Ellie\u2019s funeral, to when you see Carl is left all alone- You empathize so much that when Carl has an idea to make himself feel happy- You\u2019re all for it.This explains the motivation of Carl\u2019s desires- Making it so that the audience roots for him immediately. When there\u2019s risk or obstacles, you are genuinely worried about how Carl (and later Russel, Doug, and Kevin) are going to get through. Because you empathize with Carl greatly, and when you see him struggle, doubt himself, and think about giving up- You worry, you cry, you empathize. When you see him revive, get a second wind, and try try try again- It feels more like him conquering fears, emotional scars, and sadness.

I hated saying something and being cut off every time. I hated being near friends because they always had me near people that would be mean to me. I even hated speaking, because someone would make fun of me. So I stopped talking. To friends or classmates. For four months.I didn\u2019t want to die- But I hated living. When I got to choose a high school- I went to the one my sister went to, and no one from my grade went there. I had a new slate, a new start at life, a second chance.My sister and her best friend Josh found out that they have sisters the same age and both were going to their high school. They immediately wanted us to be friends, but I was bitter and angry and scared. But when I first met her- She had Avatar the Last Airbender on a class folder and it was all down hill from there haha. I\u2019m still best friends with her today.I eventually broke down for seemingly no reason on my junior year in highschool-  only to realize how bad my bullying had affected me. I suddenly began to slip again, having to go on different pills and seeing different therapists for years.I am so much better now, with good meds and an amazing therapist.One day, my mom said she was able to get me a job for the summer in between school. She said she knew someone who would refer me. It was a daycare, and I had some but not much experience with kids. I got the job, and worked my first days with 2 and 4 year olds.I immediately realized what I was meant to do in life. I had to make sure kids didn\u2019t have what happened to me- Happen to them. To tell them to stand up, say they didn\u2019t like what someone did loudly, and tell them to stop. And the other kid would listen. And if they didn\u2019t- We told them why it mattered and they would understand.I learned so much about how to act with kids. What to say, what to do, what to practice. It\u2019s the best job in the world- And I would take a bullet for any one of those kids.My purpose in life is to teach and protect others. Others like me, that were like me, that are struggling to be themselves. To tell them they have a right to be important and loved and respected just because they are themselves- And that\u2019s all they need to be. To tell them it\u2019s okay to shout and call someone out on being mean and rude. That they shouldn\u2019t be scared, and that if they are they can lean on someone.

It\u2019s still an obstacle in today\u2019s society for men to hug each other, and ESPECIALLY cuddle, sleep next to, or just lie/lean against. Society stigmatizes physical contact between men as gay- When it should be seen as caring.I always remember a saying I saw somewhere on the Internet (ugh I can\u2019t cite it) but it said, \u201cHumans aren\u2019t hugged enough.\u201d And I think this is ESPECIALLY big for men.I know people will probably roll their eyes at \u201cmale toxicity\u201d but that shit hurts men like hell. Men aren\u2019t allowed to open up, to cry, to explain their feelings, and he\u2019ll- Their consent isn\u2019t seen as important! Men need physical contact just like everyone. That and they need to be allowed to talk about their emotions.Now, there are controversial topics, however a subject that has a fact should be talked about: Men use more [violent means](https://www.verywellmind.com/gender-differences-in-suicide-methods-1067508)  to kill themselves, the most common being guns. Most people suggest a mental background check before purchasing guns- But it is not the only way for one to acquire guns.However, another BIG problem is drug or alcohol abuse.

{"f931hjp": {"text": "I had the same whiplash that you had when I entered my first Highschool. I had made a friend and quickly began to wonder if I had feelings for her, but looking back- I was most likely going from a desert of social interaction to a puddle.Now I\u2019m not saying an ocean because again- It\u2019s one person. But if you were to throw a bunched up piece of cloth from the desert into a puddle- the changes would be dramatic and instantaneous. It seems that what you crave may be romantic love, but what you NEED is platonic love. Don\u2019t think of her as someone who only loves her boyfriend way more than everyone else. She loves you, and while it may not be romantic, it is still genuine.If you\u2019re worried you may hurt yourself with developing feelings- A lot of people would say to push her away, but that wouldn\u2019t be really fair to either of you. She clearly enjoys your company as she is sending you texts and thank yous. And you seem to clearly delight in talking to her.The solution to this is very hard and will look very undesirable but will be very effective.What I needed when I was finally able to be a human aka- a social creature- was not romance. Society over glorifies romance as an answer to all of our problems when in reality- We don\u2019t need it that badly. What we need is a social circle, a friend group, a community.I suggest that the best answer to this is to make more friends. If you focus on one friend it will become an obsession- But if you have more than one, you can divert attention between them so you don\u2019t put all of your social emotional happiness into one basket. As hard as it is to be depressed and put yourself out there, making friends will make this situation a LOT EASIER.There should be tons of posts on here about help for making friends- But the easiest thing that worked for me was making online friends and strengthening that bond by making video chats and watching movies together.", "link_id": "t3_e3ff0w", "time": 1575047465}}

The doctor told him if he didn\u2019t quit- He wouldn\u2019t see his daughters go to college.It seems that smokers don\u2019t really give a damn about their health because it\u2019s theirs to choose and feels so far awayBut when it comes to smoking and giving them a choice to see their loved ones- When they don\u2019t get to have the power to stay on earth and love them, it\u2019s one hell of a motivator.You can tell him he\u2019ll get cancer, heart attacks, even cough nonstop. But if you have a baby? A kid? A parent that might pass away? And they don\u2019t get to their friend or kids get married? They don\u2019t get to take them to Hawaii like they planned from the day they heard of it? They don\u2019t get to say goodbye to those who might pass away soon?They will be scared, angry, they don\u2019t have power over their own life- And that\u2019s what motivated my dad.There are other replacements for smoking- I had an aunt chew on cinnamon sticks, my dad would work out hella hard and get his dopamine that way, some people would go for adrenaline and sky dive or do... illegal racing \ud83d\ude2cBut if they try to get a replacement make sure it\u2019s beneficial and healthy- Keep them away from drinking, gambling, basically anything that can risk their well being.

If they ask why you chose an in-between say the truth- I was scared you would worry, that you might overreact, that I'd cry, that you'd cry, that it would be too emotional for me- Figure out how to word it honestly without hurting their feelings.

{"f5q23na": {"text": "A therapist/counselor could be provided by a school/university if you go to one. See if they even offer it to alumni. What I usually do is say what happened to a logical, calm, and third point of view. I prefer my therapist since they won't worry over me and instead help get through it. You may have a friend that helps you like this. I tend to be a friend that helps make a list of friends; I usually do lists for my best friend so that they can figure out what they need to get done, one step at a time, and I never judge them for what they do, even if I disagree with it. Because I want to give her the power to choose, and not treat her like she's a child. Find someone calm, respectful, logical, and empowering.  Another thing to  do is when you're with a therapist is make a script for an apology if you feel it will take a burden off your back and make things less awkward and calmer. I suggest finding a party as the one I mentioned above. I don't mind helping you if you would like- (I'm not that amazing, but I won't judge and I will respect you and listen- I do not like to judge people and think less of them- Especially behind their back.) The easiest thing is make a script- Or a bullet point list of what you want to go over:&amp;#x200B;I can give more advice on apologies if you want to DM me, I really hope the best for you- Find a calm voice that can be logical for you. When anxiety makes me spiral- I stop when someone picks me up tells me that I can fix it- And helps me figure it out. You can fix many things. You'll need to ask for help.

Told my sister, so she could tell mom when she got home. Went to a therapist. Was told I had depression, and PTSD. Put on medication, and my mom said she immediately noticed a difference. I didn't. But that was because I felt more like myself. And less like I was drowning. I didn't really realize how depressed I was until I was at the bottom of the barrel, and that seems to be the only real time I can tell. I've gotten better over the years, for sure.
