{"fcljasn": {"text": "I have bipolar 2 as well (and borderline personality disorder), and as anecdotal evidence I did an ayahuasca ceremony. As a caveat - my psychiatrist is aware of my use of psychedelics, and believes in their use to treat mental illness. The governing body he works under prevents him from recommending any plant based medicines (cannabis etc), but he does speak on the use of psychedelics in a number of conferences. Obviously, everyone is different. BUT, in my opinion only, something like ayahuasca should only be attempted by someone with bipolar if their condition is currently well managed. NOT in times of crisis. You should be in a stable and good frame of mind. If you are remotely hypomanic or bordering on severe depression than skip it. The potential to really mess with your head is there. Further, most organizations, shamans, whoever you decide to go to for this usually say that if you have bipolar (and other issues) you are not allowed to participate. It can be scary, a few people during my ceremony freaked out completely and had to be encouraged by the shaman and walked through their terrors. So in order to go you may need to lie about your diagnosis, and thus the medications your on (so make sure to do your research and some medications dont mix well at all with ayahuasca), and you may not get the help that you, as a bipolar person, needs during your experience because the facilitators wont know how to do it - which is again why you should only do it when you are in a stable place. The come down and reintegration into society was hard - I did a 2 day ceremony- I had support from my therapist and psychiatrist afterwards which was helpful, so make sure you have a support team after as well.

{"dnirc9j": {"text": "So high protocol is a style of kink usually closely related to leather, or old guard. It's based on military training, as that is kind of where kink got its start in Europe. With the Sir that was training me, He had a manual that He had put together from His training (as to be considered true leather or old guard Dom you also have to go through specific training), as well as books He had read on the topic throughout His years. There are some things that will vary from Dom to Dom, like how they like their coffee, or what not. But some things are general and apply to leather or old guard across the board. These general rules are:- the Dominant is always referred to as His title. Sir, Master..etc- the submissive always refers to herself in third person in writing and in speech (so instead of saying I am going to the store, it's the girl or this one is going to the store)- the submissive walks behind the Dom within arms reach, on his left side. This is from back in the day when shields were carried in the left hand. - the sub does not ask questions, she makes requests. So instead of can I go grab myself a coffee from Starbucks, it's the girl is requesting permission to go to Starbucks to get herself a coffee. - the sub must never be above the Dom. If He is sitting, she must kneel, curl, or otherwise lower herself. - the sub must never interrupt the Dom, if she needs to say something she is to put herself in eyesight of the Dom, and make eye contact, and wait for acknowledgement and permission to speak. - an owned submissive must never touch another Dominant other than her own without express permission. - there are many rules and specifications about how a sub is to serve a Dom food and drink as well. I'm sure there are a few others. Things like not being allowed to use furniture is common, and needing permission to sit. Taking away speech is also common, so needing permission to talk. There are a variety of things, and most of the training involves behaviour and manners as opposed to being able to take specific amounts of pain, or perform sexually. Pain tolerance has nothing to do with high protocol, and sexual preferences are partner specific. High protocol also places a very large symbolic value on collars, and their meaning. They are not a fashion accessory. Let me know if you have more questions :) I love to talk about this. DISCLAIMER: I use male Dom and female submissive because that is what I am used to.

{"dn3qm77": {"text": "It is better to show your children that they can follow their hearts, to pursue what makes them happy, that they are allowed to change things if their truth no longer applies to them. Staying in a marriage that causes unhappiness or misery, is not in the best interests of the child. Once the child is old enough and realizes that 'they' were the only reason their parents stayed together, and the reason they were unhappy at home - they will hate themselves, or be angry, or bitter. I'd rather teach my children to love and live authentically. I'd rather teach them that their parents can still be involved in every aspect of THEIR lives even if we aren't involved together romantically. ", "link_id": "t3_70i2jv", "time": 1505604594}}

{"dm9mfo2": {"text": "I have to disagree with the previous posters, in some regards. It really depends on the shaman that you were with and their comfort level. I am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and likely bipolar 2. I have been on medication during previous ceremonies (I worked very closely with my psychiatrist who knew what I was doing, supported it, we researched my medication together to ensure it wasn't contraindicated). The ceremony I am doing at the end of September I will be doing now being off medication, mostly thanks to my previous aya ceremonies. I have not lied or mislead the shamans I work with. They know my diagnosis, I must be in a stable place when I partake, and I must have a support system at home as well to help with the integration. The shaman that I am working with is very familiar with personality disorders specifically, and firmly believes that aya can help ease the symptoms and help people work through trauma. I don't recommend doing it, at all, if you do not have the support of your shaman, your doctor, or a support system - but for me, the ceremonies transformed my life completely, and have helped so so so much with my disorders.
