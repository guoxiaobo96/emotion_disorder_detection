Does this make sense? It's not only because these illnesses often don't have visible, physical symptoms which eating disorders are, well, LUCKY to have (but not always) until they are SEVERE,  but it's because of the way in which the world/society currently VIEWS mental illness, which is to say that mental illness DOES NOT EXIST or IS NOT VALID ENOUGH to warrant TREATMENT like physical illnesses and injuries do.", "link_id": "t3_a93mmz", "time": 1545654112}}

Your descriptions of having a lack of energy and motivation lead me to believe that you likely have major depressive disorder.  How long have you been dealing with this? Have you seen a mental health professional before?Honestly, college isn't for everyone.  School isn't for anyone, and if you never really enjoyed being a student, maybe you would prefer and do better going straight out into the workforce or learning a trade.  However, if your lack of enjoyment in being a student stems from your depression--which it could, because depression makes us lose interest in activities/life and even tells us that we're bad at things--I would seek professional help now.  Besides professional mental health care, there may be resources to help accommodate for your depression at your college.  At my college, there are very affordable counseling services that help me with my depression and anxiety as well as a disabilities center that helped me get extended deadlines for assignments and even excused me from class an extra amount of days when I was in a tough spot.Even if your college doesn't have these options because it is a smaller school, you can still search for mental health services in your area.  I would get your parents involved; maybe just show them these posts to start the conversation.  If they're good parents I'm sure they'll be supportive and helpful.Whatever you do, don't give up hope!
