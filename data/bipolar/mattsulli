Cold brew is extremely forgiving so finer or coarser wouldn\u2019t make or break the drink, just make it easier or harder to filter. If you want to improve your coffee game, the most important thing you can buy is a scale accurate to 1 gram at the minimum. For brewed American-style coffee, you want a 1:15-17 ratio (coffee to water in grams), for cold brew, 1:5-7, and for espresso 1:1-2 (there are names for the various ratios in espresso: ristretto, normale, and lungo). Yes, coffee degasses as it rests and as it brews. In making any coffee, it\u2019s important to account for it. Generally you want coffee meant for espresso to age/degas for about a week before brewing, and significantly less (around 3 days) for brewed coffee. With espresso, you compensate for the degassing additionally by preinfusing the puck, while with brewed coffee, you \u201cbloom\u201d the grounds with an equal weight of water to coffee for 30-60 seconds to let the gas run off. Cold brew is the most forgiving in terms of gas and age, and generally shops will use their stalest beans to make cold brew because it doesn\u2019t make a huge difference in flavor.", "link_id": "t3_dj79pi", "time": 1571374187}}

Dilute if you want, or drink as a concentrate. In terms of actual espresso, entry level is pretty expensive.

It lends itself to great fine grinding and little retention, and it was built that way because it was built for espresso. The virtuoso was built to be in a coarser range with fewer fines. The reason I bring up the EK43 is that it does both ends better than most grinders designed for each end.

{"dti1n5e": {"text": "That\u2019s really helpful, thanks.[It has long been considered that lithium therapy could be abruptly stopped because it was guessed that lithium salts did not induce withdrawal symptoms. However, several open and controlled studies have shown that lithium discontinuation was associated with a possible withdrawal syndromee and with an incontestable rebound effect. Lithium withdrawal symptoms have been described in some patients, but it is not easy to distinguish them from depressive or manic symptoms, because no specific somatic withdrawal symptoms have been observed. The most important risk related to lithium discontinuation is the early recurrence of bipolar illness. Especially, it has been shown that the risk of manic recurrences is increased in the first weeks after discontinuation of lithium therapy, and that this risk is higher than the one predicted by the natural history of the manic-depressive illness. Relapses can occur even when lithium is stopped only for a few days. Abrupt discontinuation of lithium seems to be associated with an increased risk of recurrence. The pathophysiology of this rebound effect is still unknown. In clinical practice, lithium discontinuation has to be gradual when possible. Further studies are needed to precise at what time the risk of lithium withdrawal syndromee develops after starting lithium therapy. It is also necessary to establish more precise clinical guidelines for lithium discontinuation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12404784)Wanna show me yours, now?", "link_id": "t3_7u5hpi", "time": 1517368546}}

Milk is hard to teach because different machines and pitchers have quirks. The main thing is learning to spin. You want to stretch the milk while trying to get it to swirl. The more you stretch (the chirping bit), the more loose foam you get, but when you spin it that air becomes incorporated into the texture. For latte art, I highly recommend spending some of your downtime searching for latte art tagged content on instagram. Sifting through those videos you get to see the myriad techniques baristas are using these days. Check your dial at least once an hour. Bare minimum. This means weighing your dose, timing your shot, weighing the output, and tasting.

{"dsjigad": {"text": "Good and bad. I am a grad student who has been with two separate physicians specifically for meds management. The first guy was fine, very clinical, nothing really worked though. My second year I was placed with another physician, and she was great. I was also struggling with an eating disorder at the time while being treated specifically for the underlying issue, bipolar 1. On one instance during an extended fast she walked me down to acute care and I was quickly moved to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where I waited in the ER for about six hours and was transferred to another hospital that had a bed open, and I stayed there for about four days receiving medical treatment but not really any psychological treatment. I eventually ended up taking a medical leave of absence and was assured that I could come back after one semester. I checked back in after that semester and was told that they only allow two semester leaves. I\u2019m starting my final semester next week and I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve been happy with how the situation was handled, but at least I got some help. And by help, I mean that I lost my Yale Health coverage which forced me to find a psychiatrist not affiliated with the school. My new doc is great and I\u2019m sticking with her. Edit to address stigma and support issues: something I\u2019ve learned repeatedly as an open and honest person with a mood disorder is that people in your life will genuinely want you to get better, but they will treat you differently. They will show concern for your mental health, and they will treat you with kid gloves. Any time they think you\u2019re \u201coff\u201d, they\u2019ll make sure you know, and you\u2019ll feel like it\u2019s your fault. I\u2019ve always thought it was important to let people know what was going on with me. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s better to keep a tight circle. ", "link_id": "t3_7pr7wt", "time": 1515708726}}
