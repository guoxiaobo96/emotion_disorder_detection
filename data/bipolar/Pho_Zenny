As a child, I too endured mental/verbal abuse.I agree with Jay Harn that it takes work. Being bipolar is a lifelong illness, but if you learn more about it, you will learn to live with it. Don't fear or dread it, instead try to understand it and it will get better. Find alternatives to a therapist if you can't afford one. Meds alone are not enough. I'd tell you what alternatives are available but I don't know which part of the world you are from. Different countries have different healthcare systems.Mental/verbal abuse, or any other form of abuse, definitely requires a therapist. It's OK if you can't afford a therapist now. Deal with your bipolar first. One thing at a time! Besides, it's easier to deal with abuse when your bipolar is in check.For the record, I am doing well now in terms of mental health. There still is room for improvement, but my point is that it can be done. Being bipolar or experiencing abuse doesn't seal your fate in any way.
