{"fpd0dg0": {"text": "I am an alcoholic and a drug addict. I have been clean and sober for 39 years. Recently, I was talking to a friend.  My State was legalizing weed and I was thinking about trying it again. I told him about that. I started telling him of bad experiences I had with drugs. He said he never had a problem with weed.I thought about this and why this occurred. The answer is this. A mental illness is a brain problem. The illness destabilizes you. It is poorly understood. When you do drugs or drink, here is some comments.Yes weed will refocus your attention away from the illness. I did it for three days straight.  right before I was hospitalized for 11 weeks. It took me 4 years of intense effort to stabilize.Drugs and alcohol are depressants. When I was drinking, I was trying to kill myself or just die.These things keep medicine from  stabilizing. Medicines are difficult to manage always.  So you will not ever stabilize. The Dr will not have the ability to diagnose.If you are in therapy, you are there to treat an illness. Drug use and alcohol are different illnesses and require different treatments. It is difficult to stabilize  an illness on its own.I doubt if many therapists will treat you if you us e these things. If you are suicidal, it will be very difficult to find someone to treat you.Drugs and alcohol are risky. I used to drive drunk all the time. I am still ashamed of that. I could have killed someone. I could have wound up in jail. I was lucky. As for drugs you will go to jail for possession.I do not tell people what to do. That is up to you. You are the one that benefits or suffers from your decisions..I always say if you want to do drugs or drink, you should stop therapy for an illness. You need therapy for drug use or alcoholism. These ares symptoms  of an illness. In therapy you can deal with those symptoms.Full disclosure - I have had numerous suicide attempts  I had one 3 months ago for three days. No one knows about it - I managed it on my own. I do not recommend that.  So I can tell you what drugs and  alcohol do to people. You may look at me as a success story.

I was stabilized and my drug routine was monitored. Once I got out of the hospital I started on recovery which took 4 years.I go on the mental health sites because I am bipolar. It helps me to share my stories. I realize how people that have a illness share things in common. As far as the illness goes, rather than look at a long term solution, focus on that day. Do what you can that day. When I was stuck I said to my doctor, I could do better at work and have a relationship, etc. he said a profound thing. He said how do you know you could do better. Whatever you do today is the best you could do for that day. I have severe prolonged depressions. Many times the best I could that day was to just sit in a chair and not self harm. I am 70 years old and some of the things I write about presently I realized in the past year. So I did not have answers despite 50 years of treatment.  There are no answers definitive.Last night - last night - I understood something. Mental illness is not like other illnesses. It does not go away in most cases. The best strategy is to live day by day. You will have good days and bad days. When you stabilize it is a great experience.Two things I always say. If you are suicidal seek help.

You also are assuming responsibility for it. In 50 plus years, I know of few people that could do this without the supervision of a Dr. this skill takes time in therapy. Many people including myself refuse to accept responsibity for their actions.Rather than diagnose yourself, look at the behaviors. Are they common? Do they reflect on your situation or are they aggravated by life circumstances. Are your thoughts and feelings common? Are they episodic or chronic?I have a bipolar illness. This is an illness. Sometimes it controls me. Sometimes I make bad decisions because of my illness and sometimes I just made a mistake.You mentioned that others in your family have been diagnosed as bipolar. There is a genetic link to it. But that should not necessarily be true about you,I post in this and other Reddit\u2019s. My advice never changes. If one has symptoms of an illness and it is interfering with your life, seek help from a Dr.  they are qualified to counsel you and prescribe medicine. In my experience medicine is the way to overcome the symptoms. Do not diagnose yourself or let anyone diagnose you. To me it means offering help, suggestions, ideas, anything like that. This is an illness. Treat it like that. Do not be ashamed. Do not judge yourself.Never give up. Suicidal thoughts can be mitigated and treated. There is hope.

{"forn25l": {"text": "Lol. Thank you for the response  I find these Reddit\u2019s to be helpful to me to understand my life.I am bipolar 2. I have excellent care all my life because I was able to afford it. I am lucky to have had it.  Yet, I have had numerous suicide attempts and hospitalizations. My 2 Drs both expressed amazement that I was alive. I am over 65 manage my illness well and yet frequently have prolonged severe life threatening episodes. I can just deal with them.Depression is an illness that can be controlled by medicine. Note that I said controlled not cured. My experiences with depression are more severe than most sufferers but they are typical. It is to me more common that people do not recover. In my opinion, the best outcome available is that one can stabilize and at least have times when they can tolerate their life.I reread the OPs comments. All of the symptoms may or may not be associated with depression. There are many more associated with depression and those symptoms may be caused by something else.I do not want this to be critical of the comments.i respect your opinion. I am very sensitive to comments like this. Depressed people are unstable and despondent generally. Even with my history and experience I would never offer advice. Maybe some time to listen but not much. People that are depressed can do therapy on people that will listen to it. I accept that. But it is hard to deal with very long.Please understand these comments are only my opinions and may be wrong.

Is she acting in friendship? I would agree  - it appears as they are. When people are depressed they can drive people away. People that overcome that issue are to be commended.I have had breakdowns and I extended recoveries. The only person I worked with was my Dr.  I did not involve my family. Issues that develop when non-professionals give advice:They are interested in telling you what they think.If you do not listen and act like they want, they get angry. Then the personal criticisms start.They only hear what they want to hear.They will not be objective and patient They do not understand the nature of your illness. How much time does a therapist take to analyze a problem? How do they communicate their issues to the patient to get them to understand the context and get them to change behavior.How long would a friend continue to be a friend when you call them everyday and harangue them for an hour? When you piss them off, they can turn against you and start sharing details and criticizing you further isolating you. It can also turn people against you.What if your friend is the source of the problem and aggravates your depression?What if your friend starts managing your Life?What happens when your friend walks out of your life?Does your friend understand drug protocols? Can they prescribe? Do they understand drug interactions? Even if they did and were a Dr, they could not diagnose and prescribe?Depression can be episodic and chronic. There are limits to what a Dr can do.Does your friend drink and / or do drugs? On that basis alone I would avoid them. Does their interaction come on their terms and their availability?Depression is not like cancer in the sense that the physical symptoms are not apparent? For comparison, if someone had cancer and tried to treat them make suggestions instead of going to the Dr what would you think? Cancer is easier to treat than depression.What happens to your friend when you end your life? How would your friend feel if you followed their advice and your illness collapsed? Look at the remorse people express when someone commits suicide?I have been depressed most of my life. I have worked hard to stabilize. Other than an occasional comment to 3 or 4 people, I never talk details about my illness. And I NEVER diagnose, make recommendations, or offer much support. I am not qualified and I am mentally unstable.You do not have assurances of confidentiality. You lose the right to privacy.I am not trolling people or criticizing their decisions / actions. Depression is a serious illness. I recognize that some support is better than nothing. As you may guess from my comments, I take this issue seriously.Finally all of the above have happened to me. The consequences to me were severe and life threatening as when people get angry and tell you that you should kill yourself. Or solicit the support of others against you? Or continue to follow their lifestyle of drinking and doing drugs?", "link_id": "t3_g8pogb", "time": 1588008661}}

{"fonz5x5": {"text": "This is insightful. I have suffered from a bipolar illness to an extreme degree. I learned an answer to one of your questions recently. The lack of bearings and a strong voice was explained by the awareness that bipolar sufferers continuously analyze things. Applying it to my life and assuming it was true, I asked why. My response was that this illness destroys the basis for reality. It is ongoing unpredictable chaos. I joke about never doing the same thing once. What that means is that I have trouble forming habits. I have trouble organizing things. If I need to do something on an ongoing basis - I did a quarter triathlon once - it uses a lot of my mental resources. Usually there is a disruption of some sort and I stop.Because there is no fixed reality, bipolar people have to continuously ask questions about what they perceive. What is happening? Do I feel good because I am manic, because I just feel good, because because because. There is never an answer. You are driven by doubt fear anxiety depression whatever. At some point people can give up. Everything is arbitrary there is no reason to do one thing or another. Nothing stops the noise. This is one reason why people stop taking their meds. They have no routine.I am rapid cycling. The term refers to people whose moods change quickly within a year. In my case, I would go from full blown manic to deep depression in 5 minutes. Sometimes it reversed back. I have had days where it would  do this a few times. Numerous people experience these shifts in small increments and not as dramatic as me.To your second point, people with bipolar hav3 chaotic lives. They do not hold a job because their behavior is erratic, their moods change, they get paranoid, there are many many reasons. They have no friends because they are confrontation, do stupid things. My opinion is that they lack boundaries. There is no connection to anything - they do not see the danger.Some friends of mine married and divorced manic depressives. One reason would be they made bad financial decisions. They would do \u201ccrazy\u201d things. My mom and I were great friends. There were times that she was manic where I could be around her. It made me manic too.Yes it is many things happening under different circumstances at different times under different mental states. There is no end point in the sense you learn and develop routines. In relationships, I lacked empathy. I missed many cues. I got angry. I was afraid of losing my girl friend. I wanted to lose my girl friend. It is many things including genetics lifestyle habits income.  One of the major disrupters is the use of drugs and alcohol. You take the illness and then add those things and pretty soon you cannot stabilize20% of sufferers kill themselves. I have tried numerous times. I was 27 before I realized that people do not think about it.I consider manic depression to be equal in severity to schizophrenia, psychosis. It is in the top category for sure.My attitude towards sufferers is that I avoid them I also avoid people. There is no way to break through to manic depressives. There is nothing including medicines that alleviates the symptoms. Even though I have some understanding of the illness sometimes I am unable to be around people like me.Hope this explains som3 5hings.", "link_id": "t3_g801bd", "time": 1587929350}}

Then you add in life circumstances and relationships and it is complicated.If you want to learn about symptoms read through posts in the sub Reddit. Go on depression and other mental health sites. Do a google search. see what others say. It is true. One problem you can have is that everyone exhibits bipolar behavior. People that are bipolar suffer to a greater degree.It sounds like your boyfriend is a good person. Many people cannot interact with people that are bipolar because their behavior is frustrating.I cannot project your future nor can anyone else. If I ou want to be diagnosed see a therapist, commit to the relationship, take medication if prescribed.Bipolar people can be alcoholics and drug users. I was both.manic depression is a destabilizing illness and people use drugs to distract them from their pain. I delayed my recovery because I was drinking and doing drugs for the first five years of therapy. The dr could not treat me well because my behaviors were impacted by the drugs and alcohol. I also could not stabilize the medicines.So before you go into therapy if you do, you need to stop taking drugs. If you do not want to stop and I would understand if you did not then I do not think therapy would be a good idea. They would tell you what I just said.You are dealing with some serious drugs. You expose yourself to criminal things. You put your life in jeopardy. I use to drunk drive all the time. Luckily I never killed anyone. If you do have a mental issue, drugs are very dangerous. You could overdose. You could be a drug addict, you could be self medicating because of your illness. There are many possibilities.getting better is a matter of isolating behaviors and changing them. It is a long process.Do not listen to people that start telling you how to manage your illness. No one knows and no one has the ability to guide you through this.You also may have trouble finding a therapist if they know about your illness. They may recommend hospitalization. Your last paragraph answers your questions. You are not going to stop using. and that is your decision. You are the one that benefits or suffers from your decisions. I also hope that that there will be no consequences.  Honestly though, there is an amazing amount of different drugs you are using. That is risky behavior. I have good feelings about you.

It is important to separate your character from the illness. FYI I recently achieved this. It is difficult to do so do not get frustrated. I have had suicidal thoughts frequently. I learned that these thoughts were the illness talking. They are common in depression. One affect is that is that it can single out a feeling - anger at a parent - into no one loves me, etc.  people get stuck and dwell on the pain.Sometimes you can mitigate the pain through distraction. Neurolinguistic Programming taught me to add choices. It can confuse the brain and let you focus on something else. Feeling Good by David Burns helped me. I am not recommending these they were relevant 25 years ago. CBT is another technique. Let your therapist guide you.No one can predict the outcome of therapy. As I read your comments, I had a good feeling about your success. You have taken responsibility. You seem to have separated the illness from yourself and viewed it objectively.

Do not drink or take drugs. Seek help when suicidal.learn how to manage the illness.  Avoid sharing with most people. Learn how to take care of myself. Listen to the doctor. Avoid social situations that cause stress..most important - do not apologize or criticize yourself or demean yourself. You can apologize for your behavior but do not use the illness as an excuse.

{"fm91c7s": {"text": "Ignore that piece of shit. I watched your video and was amazed. For the benefit of that person I am also bi polar and have experienced manic episodes like that. You had so much positive energy with your you tube efforts. That you could focus on anything or get anything done is incredible. Like many of my manic episodes it took a down turn with your attacks and that is regrettable. I have done similar things myself that ended relationships, got me in trouble, and damaged my health. I recognize that the illness controlled my behavior.One thing I would suggest is that you avoid overstimulating yourself generally but more importantly when you are manic. If you can get rid of some of that energy it would be good. Also, if this is a frequent problem talk to your doctor about a medicine change. It could take time and the outcome is unpredictable. I have gone through. 4 or 5 of them. They fixed specific problems and the last one stabilized me. Unfortunately, the illness will continue to disrupt your life randomly and there is nothing you can do about it.I cannot believe that you would so openly tell people about your illness. That takes courage and character. I never told many people ever because the stigma is too great. One of the issues openness creates is that people will reject you, attack you, and maybe ridicule you. They could do it because of your behavior without knowing about the illness anyways.I cannot believe that you acknowledged responsibility. Many bi polar people cannot separate the illness from their personality. As far as I am concerned, you are doing an excellent job managing the illness. It is unlikely that you would be able to stop these episodes. At best you can change their severity and frequency. Find someone you can rely on in times of crisis.iNo you are not retarded. To the nut job who wrote that it is a medical diagnosis and from your text I doubt if you are a doctor.One way that helped me was to isolate myself as much as possible to control manic episodes. I quit drinking and drugs and avoided behaviors that triggered manic episodes. One thing to be aware of is that your attacks on people and corporations show a lot of anger. Anger is the worst neuroses to suffer from. It is hard to fix because it keeps one from accepting responsibility. Anger will get you into dangerous situations.I am glad I found your post.

Alcohol kept the medicine dosage from being stable so it was ineffective. I was literally trying to drink myself to death.I also smoked marijuana regularly too - an attempt to self medicate. It is a depressant. Even though it made me feel different / better at the time, it was also making me more depressed. I was smoking it for 4 days straight right before my first hospitalization. By that time I was really messed up. Recovery was difficult.Looking back I realized that drugs are very dangerous for a bi polar illness. My illness destabilizes reality for me. Doing drugs made it worse. I could not see it at the time but it was making me more paranoid, anxious, manic, and depressed.
