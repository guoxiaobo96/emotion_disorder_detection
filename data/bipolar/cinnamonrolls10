Mona was the instigator of the Game but Ali was not innocent in the events that led to them suffering as well. She even asked them to free their abuser (Charlotte), which was such a shitty thing to do. But they easily let Ali in again, even though she has proven herself time and time again to be sketchy (fake kidnapping story to the police, Cyrus, etc). While Mona was being treated like trash by them, even when she\u2019s tried to prove herself again and again.Again, it\u2019s understandable to not being able to forgive Mona or any of their abusers. What I always wonder though is, many people say they forgave Ali and the guys easier because they were friends/lovers beforehand.
