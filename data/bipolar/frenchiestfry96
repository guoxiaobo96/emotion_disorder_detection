I mentioned that this fish was living in a sorority tank, and I immediately got harrassed and insulted. The one redditor I mentioned before insulted me on my \"research skills\"; even though I double majored in psych and bio on top of working towards a medical degree and I'm usually knee deep in research. I proceeded to ask her for her research, so I can see the other side of things - she shared one opinionated blog article that wasnt peer-reviewed. So not only was I getting nasty attitude from this person, but she wasnt even backed up. So I went through their post history and saw them insulting plenty of people that are new to the hobby. People that were probably misinformed and just needed a little kindness and guidance. The funny thing was that This redditor was a mod and probably set a precedent that it was okay to act like this towards newbie people. After my post and seeing the behavior, it left a bad taste in my mouth and had to leave. I really havent had too much aggression towards me on reddit, but the stuff I see on fish communities is really disheartening and gate-keeping.

{"fji9htj": {"text": "(I may be late to this I'm sorry) Although I like the natural cuttlebone and shell options of increasing KH and GH, it's hard to use them to get the specific amounts you want. I originally bought shrimp not realizing KH and GH was an issue. Well a ton of dead shrimp I learned that I need to keep these numbers pretty much exact.Being a bio major I researched the best way to do this and to measure these systems to keep them as steady as possible.I decided to buy the seachem neutral regulator and seachem equilibrium. The first fixes your KH and PH to a neutral range, while the latter raises your GH. There are products out there that raise both together but since my tap has differing values for these, it's best to raise them separately.Now cherry shrimp are best around GH 6-8 and a KH OF 3-15 . I have a ten gallon, so I only add about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon and then test with my drip kit until I get to my optimal levels. The total amount of teaspoons should be written down (for example, 2 teaspons for KH) so know the number to add to my water change next time. These levels may drop a little until the next water change but it's more stable than adding shells or cuttlefish. Important note, if your shrimps are living okay in your current parameters, THEN SLOWLY DECREASE per water change. You'll put them into shock if you lower the KH all of  a sudden.", "link_id": "t3_fd3jfh", "time": 1583362925}}

I would probably estimate they were in about 1-2 ppm, since after 2 days of ammo lock, they would come to level. However, after adding the ammo lock the test would jump to a shock 8 ppm. That's why I bought the safe chem test that sits in the tank 24/7 which was more accurately depicting what was going on when I added the ammo lock. I was told by some fish people that I may want to remove the almond leaf until my ph steadies as its prone to lower ph. I just grouped the almond leaf in with the dead plant litter just to save some explaining while writing. I'm  not too worried about the algae since the shrimp love to eat it right now, and its helped me under fed them through out this week. Ph is 7 since adding the carbonate buffer solution. However, it will drop slightly to 6.0-6.6 and before adding the buffer was well around 6.0 the whole timeI get an ammonia reading with the drip kit as 4 ppm but the seachem tester says 0.05 ppm; definitely not perfect but not as alarming as the drip kit. I added ammo lock about 2 days ago. GH: 6Kh: 7I originally thought that the tank didnt fully cycle because of the alarming spike, but I never saw a rise in nitrite or nitrate. My log says nitrates rose to 0.25 ppm for two days while nitrite stayed 0 the whole week. For today both are testing as 0. Temp has been around 70-78 \u00b0F this whole time.

I wouldn't really know how my KH would reach 0-1 but the minute I put a drop of KH testing solution in, the water quickly turned the indicators color.My tap water:GH: 1 KH: 3 Ammonia:  0.50 ppmMy tank is a 10 gallon and was cycled, with plants, for a month. I then purchased 4 cherries to start off with. They seemed happy and content and everything was going well. I then purchased two amanos and two sakura orange. All of them seemed healthy and were going along fine, though a bit lethargic. I put the leaf in and a couple days later one of the orange sakura died. I stupidly had bought some more  shrimp (which I forgot to mention) a couple days later thinking it was an old shrimp and kept the leaf litter in. The next day all three newly purchased neos died, plus the other orange sakura. The rest of the living shrimp and snails were huddled at the top of the tank near my filter inlet. On top of this, the water was cloudy and there was noticeable stench to it. That day I bought the KH and GH kit, got those numbers, and immediately bought some buffering carbonate, ammo lock, a bottle of tetra safe start, and the seachem testers. Did a 50% water change, took out any dying plant matter (including the leaf) and hoped for the best. One of the cherries died, but the rest seemed to be okay.When I had the 8 shrimp, I was using ammo lock about once a week since the water parameters were coming back with a small amount of ammonia. When all of this started to occur I wouldn't go off the ammonia levels in my tank with the drip tester because it would come back extremely high. Nitrites and nitrates seemed to be 0, even to this day, which is strange to me. Now I've been checking the water parameters daily, doing a 30 % water change with my tap water which has a mixture of shrimp minerals, water conditioner, and buffer and is left to sit for a day. The remaining shrimp are doing okay,but are still kind of lethargic.

I'll try to explain it the best way I can: sometimes it feels like I need to talk out loud to release some sort of pressure, if that makes sense; other times it just helps to get the thought out of the \"clutter\" that's in my mind. I thinks it's attributed to the \"racing mind\" symptom, because that's usually when I start talking to myself. I don't acknowledge the voice I hear by talking out loud, though, but I'll hold conversations with \"him\" in my head. I might be seen muttering to it under my breath but I try to catch myself so I don't look insane to outside eyes. Even when I know the voice is false, it seems to not shut up unless I feed into it, but even then it usually persists. I originally thought it was just me and my thoughts but when my therapist helped me figure out the difference between the two, I was able to sense that it wasn't me. It's strange because it doesn't sound like it's  a speaker in my head or like I'm wearing headphones, but it's  just like how you described it. It's like a really loud thought process, but the voice is different from my own. I can't control it and I can interact with it. In my opinion, I can't  say 100% it's  a hallucination.

{"f96ux2h": {"text": "It sounds like you may have two different things going on: racing thoughts and auditory hallucinations, depending on when they're occurring. If you feel it's  near an episode then both of those are strong symptoms. The constantly thinking of numerous thoughts at a rapid rate and overanalyzing (like past conversations) is textbook racing thoughts. People often believe that auditory hallucinations have to come \"outside\" your head to constitute as a hallucination. However, this isn't  correct; auditory hallucinations are unintentional and unwanted production of sound, whether coming from inside or outside the mind. I, personally, believed that I wasn't hallucinating when I told the doc I heard voices inside my head - the biggest one was always male voice that would be really aggressive, negative, and abusive, but I would also hear family members telling me things too sometimes. I figured that this was me producing these thoughts and it was my will that they were produced; but when I started antipsychotics the seemed to have gone away. I told the doc this, and he described the true definition of auditory hallucinations, and believed I was having them. This sounds almost similar to my case, where you're not intentionally remembering these songs but they're just playing inside all the time. It's a common hallucination, and you should address this with your doc to make sure. It's  also important to note that psychotic features, like hallucinations, can occur in both mania and depression, which isn't often addressed in media portrayals. Don't  think that just because you aren't manic that you can't hallucinate.Here's  some links that may help you, if it is in fact hallucinations: https://www.healthline.com/health/bipolar-disorde", "link_id": "t3_e3w3ue", "time": 1575152631}}

None had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, even my uncle who had ECT and spent plenty of time in mental hospitals ( he was just diagnosed with severe depression). Just last year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I shook my head saying it wasn't possible because there wasn't an official genetic correlation;  that I was just a dramatic mess with depression. Now living with the diagnosis for nearly a year, I kind of understand now. Almost all my symptoms add up to being bipolar, and it explains all this weird stuff I did as a kid. I'm finally feeling good and happy (not to mention \"sane\"), which hasn't happened in a long time, if ever. I'm sharing this with you because I was in the same boat. I wrote my symptoms off as just anxiety, depression, and being a moody person. It's a frustrating disorder but when you find the help you need and you work hard at it, you can succeed. A lot of the times you'll build yourself up, only to fall down again and again. But don't worry, now that you have a diagnosis you can find people to help you conquer the disorder. Finding the right meds and therapy was a godsend to me; if I didn't do that, I would've ended up severely injured or possibly dead.

There's nothing wrong with you for wanting sex, but keep in mind that you may hurt people you're close with because your desires are different from there's.

I've nicknamed my episodes \"pessimisim on crack\" as I'm very angry but full of energy and angst. Sometimes I'll start a day like normal mania, happy and full of life, but then anything will set me off; and It's not like I'm a little irritated. I explode. I break things, I'll self harm, I'll become extremely mean and nasty. And this could be over something like a customer being rude or a bug flying into my drink. I've also explained this to all my close friends and family (and I want you to know this too). What he says in an episode and what he does isn't always what he means. I get very paranoid and delusional and I'll think the people closest to me are trying to hurt me. Because of this, I get very mean to them and accuse them of things that may not be true. Please be patient with him. I wouldn't start a conversation with him until he's out of an episode and sit down and ask if that's what he really meant.

{"eifj0aj": {"text": "I'm also a uni student and I have very similar symptoms as you. Nights were the worst where I couldn't even fall asleep because I thought people were watching me through the windows and judging me. I couldn't focus in class without believing that the students around me were saying/judging things about me. The thing is, I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in middle school, so I just wrote this off as some comorbid anxiety disorder and went on my way. However, I had a terrible week a couple months ago that dismantles that theory quite a bit. I had my typical paranoia with Windows and strangers, but now I had it with my close friends too. I BELIEVED that all my friends around me we're conspiring against me and hated me; this made me lash out and be mean to them and essentially bully them. They were hurt and confused as was I - I tried to justify my meanness but didn't fully understand why I was acting like this. The diagnosis of bp II came quickly after. Now I haven't had a hypo episode for a little bit but I actually trained with my therapist to notice when I'm falling into this \"paranoia trap\" and reminding myself that these are just thoughts and are most likely not reality. It helps to communicate to your loved ones what hypo/mania is so that when you do fall into it, you can tell them your thoughts instead of believing them (for example, \"hey, I'm having the recurring thoughts that you hate me. Can you help me talk myself out of this?\" Or, \"I'm having these thoughts that people are watching me as I sleep. Can you help me make sure this isn't real?\") Putting an objective look on paranoia helps lessen the blow and keeps relationships stable.Besides that, and I'm going to be honest with you, MEDICATION helps a butt load. When I got on the right meds, I felt infinitly better. I hope this helps. I understand it's long, and since English isn't your first language, if you need any help understanding this please let me know. I can definitely try to explain myself clearer!

However, I do graze these forums since I'm a medical student and like to put my input in the more scientific questions (like yours). The thing with meth is that it's often mixed with corrosive chemicals to strengthen its  potency. Drain cleaner, forms of strong acid (i.e. battery acid), or antifreeze  are the most common. Adding any of these with ephedrine will create meth as a product. I don't want to bore you with chemistry jargon, unless you ask for it (this post would become A LOT longer), but essentially what the issue is is that, even though you have a different product from the reactants, the extreme nature of the chemicals don't disappear.  These chemicals are extremely volatile towards skin cells, hence the destroying of the veins and skin.With heroin, on the other hand, you don't have these chemicals; this equates to decreasing the chances of destroying the areas of contact. You still see some destruction due to not shooting up in 100% sanitized areas with a perfect needle every time, but it isn't  nearly as severe as meth.

Now, I've been getting them with visual hallucinations (light flashing) and it's always a loud explosion, a menacing yell, or constant whispering. It's almost always male and can be really scary until I fully awake and reassure myself it was only imaginary. I used to always listen to music before bed well until just recently.

{"e9ijsi0": {"text": "I had a relationship for four years in high school. When he broke up with me I thought it was the end of the world. Looking back now, I realized I fell out of love with him a large time before he broke up with me. However, due to some mental issues I kept telling myself I was in love with him. When the depression hit after he broke up with me the only thing that kept my mind off of it was video games. There was also my mom, who knew I had serious depression so when she realized I wasnt getting out of bed for days she came to me and helped me talk through it. So, for my advice, look for something that's mentally and physically challanging. Video games keep your hands active while your mind is figuring out the puzzles. Obviously if you're not into video games there's a ton out there: learn a new skill, go to a workout class, get into a craft. As long as you keep your mind active physically and mentally, your body wont have enough energy to focus on the \"old stuff\". Another, is to find someone to talk to. You dont have to discuss the relationship with said person (my mom never pressured me to do so), but instead find someone that makes you happy just hanging out with them. A best friend or a family member is always great! ", "link_id": "t3_9w6hkn", "time": 1541975536}}
