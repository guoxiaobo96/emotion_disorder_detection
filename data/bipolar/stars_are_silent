{"eiigbns": {"text": "I just came across this post and I wanted to offer you a little feedback based on my experience dealing with bookkeeping clients.  Quickbooks is great if you know what you're doing.  Unfortunately, most of the clients you will work with to help with their bookkeeping do not know what they are doing.  And it's very easy to make a mess of things in Quickbooks.  So, you will have to do some training and work with the clients to make sure they are doing things right on their end, and be prepared to set up processes for them to follow.A lot of bookkeeping for clients is cleaning up their mess.  Going behind them and trying to straighten out what they've messed up.  This is not true in every instance, but generally speaking, if the clients knew how to keep their own books, they wouldn't need to hire you.  I find that you need to be knowledgeable in HR matters - you need to understand a lot about payroll to make sure you're able to advise the clients and make sure they're doing things right.  For example, overtime pay, when is it ok to dock an employee's pay, payroll taxes, withholding tables.  Most clients seem to expect you to know those things and would expect you to alert them if something's not right.  You will also need to familiarize yourself with the different industries of your clients.  Keeping the books for an auto shop is very different than keeping the books for a painting business.  Bookkeeping in an of itself is not complicated, but figuring out, for example, how a certain client should be accounting for a unique, specific situation - lots of judgement calls.  Also lots of dealing with incomplete/incorrect paperwork - clients who insist on doing things their way because it's the way they've always done it and why change now.Also be prepared for a lot of pushback on what people want to pay.  Most people don't see the value in bookkeeping, in my opinion.  They don't understand that you get what you pay for, and how important it is for their books to be straight.  Most of them certainly won't see any reason to pay more just because you're a CPA vs. a staff accountant.  Offering services to clients on your own can be fun - I enjoy bookkeeping myself, and you do get to know your clients pretty well, which is nice.  There's just a lot more to it than knowing your t-accounts.  ", "link_id": "t3_az9u4u", "time": 1552574394}}
{"eigv9za": {"text": "Look into methadone for your brother.  My SO was on heroin from 16 to 28.  He has been on methadone for almost 2 years.  It's saved his life.  There's no \"detox\" involved - you can usually get into a clinic to get started almost immediately, and then jump straight from heroin to methadone.  It sounds like your brother has some good opportunities/support in FL - see if your dad or someone can front him a plane ticket.  In the meantime, you can research clinics/contact social services to see if he qualifies for any type of assistance.  As for your mother, I would also suggest you contact social services on her behalf and see what advice they can offer you.  That would be the extent of what I would suggest you do for them.  I think it's awesome that you care and want to help.  But keep in mind, they are adults.  They keep saying they want to change, and I am sure they mean it.  No one wants to be a heroin addict living on the streets.  But wanting to change, and making a change are two different things.  I'm sure there are resources nearby for them that they could have taken advantage of before now if they chose to. They are ultimately responsible for themselves.  I watched my mother let my father drag us all down because she wanted to help him get over his alcoholism.  I lost pretty much everything I had and ended up in a mountain of debt trying to save my SO.  I love him and I'm glad he's ok, but I regret letting him trainwreck my life.  He's on methadone and it's worked well for him.  I pleaded with him so many times to try it.  But he had no interest until his moron dealer suggested it. I'm telling you this to emphasize that you absolutely can't help someone until they want to help themselves.  And they absolutely will drag you down with them if you let them.  Their addiction is the most important thing to them - they have chosen heroin over shelter.   I don't mean to discourage you from trying to help them.  They are your family and you love them.

They are a high-level summary of all the topics, but are much more manageable than the Becker lessons.
