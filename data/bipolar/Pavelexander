Or so I thought. I landed a job as a chef for the Russian Olympic team and moved to Japan for it one week before the Russian team got banned. I was stranded in Tokyo without a job, with a beginner level of Japanese and didn't know what to do. But I tried it by relying on what I usually do and got myself a job at a mountain resort which included housing and all that.Then with corona the resort had to close. I contacted the embassy because I lost my residence and there weren't many places where you could stay as a foreigner with all the hotels and hostels shut down.

In many countries you already got equal rights and the thing is, you can't force everyone to agree with you. At least in the US, on paper, you have the same rights as anyone else. If people disagree with that it's just how it is and you can't convince someone who feels offended or disgusted by different sexualities by shoving dildos and rainbows in their faces.Pride parades are more or less illegal in my country (Russia) but I've been to one in Berlin and even as a progressive and tolerant person, I felt uncomfortable with the things that were said, done and shown in public during that event. In many of these countries, people have been made equal and took their platform to make themselves outcasts again. It's almost as if they don't want to leave their position as a victim of oppression. I can understand that you want to feel accepted for who you are, that you want to have the freedom to love who you love, and the freedom to show your love. But, as they say, pride in itself leads to downfall. We shouldn't strive for pride because that means putting yourself or your kind over others. We should seek out for things that unite us not that divide us. We should showcase how we love people the same as anyone else and not turn our parades that were meant to celebrate equality of love into a showcase of perversion, fetishism and all that.I think the whole movement has been hijacked by people who want to normalise and expose their perversions and they get off to that and that's why the movement and acceptance is going backwards. Because the original cause got lost and it's kind of their fault. Because the people who you want to convince that you are no different to them and they don't have to fear you or feel disgusted by you are proven right with their doubts towards LGBT when the parades are showing inappropriate things in public. They don't look at two men in thongs on the street biting each other's nipples and think \"Yeah, I want to see more of that, this is a good thing I want to support\". No, they think \"I was right, these are perverts that can't keep to themselves and I am lucky I don't have my children with me right now because they should not see that.\" LGBT Parades are showing homophobics what they want to see to justify their disgust towards LGBT people and that's the problem.

However, I think such comments can be hurtful for people and if he did become too obsessed with his dieting, it's not a good way to address it at all. If you do have serious concerns about him developing an eating disorder please do some research on the topic first before making comments that make things more complicated. Especially with males, that can be a very hard thing to admit to and whether it's the truth or not, it will always be seen as an insult.Also, it is normal for people to overshoot a bit, when you change your habits and continue them for long enough they become more and more instinctive and it takes a bit of time to figure out what works for your new body. Weight-loss (depending on how it's done) affects your metabolism and your body in many different ways so you have to figure out again how to maintain weight and that's totally normal. If he's still strict then it could also be that he found satisfaction in that. Often, once people realise the benefits, they get very euphoric about it and if something makes you feel good you obviously want to keep doing it. You can have a strict regime and not lose weight btw. I think it's just a thing that needs time to adjust but if he does have an eating disorder now, such comments won't help. I know this because my sister has had an eating disorder and I had to learn a lot about how to handle her and approach the topic because often such comments can sadly encourage their behavior because it's some kind of acknowledgement that their change in appearance didn't go unnoticed.

{"fpw5q7j": {"text": "Been living in Russia for 23 years:- people in the provinces are genuinely helpful and generous and always happy about visitors. If you get lost in the provinces or your car breaks down, don't worry, you'll always find someone who'd let's you stay over, shares their food and gives you a lift. Even if they are poor, they'll show you all they have and share it with you and are genuinely proud people.- free Healthcare. I know it's not the best but if you want more luxury treatment you can always pay extra but it's good that they take care of you whether you're a bum or not.- education. It's very affordable to go to university in Russia and a lot of people have university degrees. I don't think that it's a bad thing to have an over qualified population because many people don't study because they want to have great careers but because they are curious and want to learn new things or are genuinly passionate about the subject they are studying.- despite all that we don't have high taxes and not a high national debt. Of course there are many people who struggle financially but they say struggle builds the spirit and I agree to that somewhat.- Russian people are direct and honest. I like being able to speak my mind and also hear others speak their mind. There's a stereotype that in Russia people avoid controversial topics but I think in my generation at least people are involved in politics and you can have good conversations about politics or other things and it's not at all that police will shut you down immediately when you say a bad thing about Putin. I once sat in a lecture from Moscow University, a couple of kilometers from the Kremlin and the professor harshly criticized Putin and our government. In a state owned institution. Also you hardly get issues with people talking behind your back and I never felt like I had fake friends in Russia who pretend to like me to avoid conflict. When I don't like someone I avoid THEM not lie to them cause I think respecting someone's time is more important than making them feel liked by everyone. In reality there just are people who disagree with you and people need to learn that it's fine. - the diversity. A lot of people don't know this but Russia is home to loads of cultures who have different languages and different believes and traditions. What most people don't know about Russia is that we have Muslim republics, Jewish republics and even Buddhist republics. Russia has the only Buddhist republic in Europe for example. But even Shamanism among the different Siberian tribes is interesting and I love how their culture is preserved and mostly well respected. I am happy that we can coexist mostly peacefully.- The nature. There are truly unique and beautiful landscapes in Russia that people also wouldn't expect. Be it the nice beaches by the black sea, the icy wasteland up north, the Altai mountains or the steppes in Tuva, they are all beautiful and I'd love to see it all one day.- children have a lot of opportunities to develop their interests and master them. We have loads of big camps and organisations that allow children from poor families to get support for their talents and passions. It's a great experience and also helps them for building their future and making new connections.", "link_id": "t3_gfwhp4", "time": 1588957719}}

It's normal that you have to do chores and watch over younger siblings and all that but putting you in a situation where you can only do the wrong thing isn't really good parenting in my opinion. Rather than telling you that you'll get in trouble either way, I'd tell a kid the priorities or acknowledge that they know to pick the right priorities (in this case probably keeping your sister safe and not have her run away).

I believe it can be very painful to see the person you love go through episodes. And I also experience that the uncertainty and instability of the situation right now definetly affects my own mental stability as well. It's not you triggering her, but you're probably the only thing she can grasp right now. If she's been a likeable person before and you love her, maybe you can look for a conversation with her and try to communicate your concerns regarding your relationship and if she wants to put effort into it.

He was married to my mother's older sister and she couldn't keep him from being part of our family cause he kept making threats to what would happen if she told anyone. I grew up thinking he was my cool uncle who built treehouses with my cousins and me and who taught me many things. If anyone had asked me back then I'd have told him he's like a father to me, not knowing he actually IS my father. My mother then moved to Russia with me and even then she didn't tell me. I understand why she didn't. She committed suicide at 39 and I found her diaries and asked my father if it was true. He admitted it to me and said he had always felt guilty about it and that he was just crazy for my mother and never did anything like that again. He said he's happy with my aunt and loves his family (he had 8 more children with my aunt) and asked me not to tell my family about it either because his family financially depends on him and it would cause my (now) half siblings to have lost their home and so on. As someone who grew up poor and without a stable home I didn't want this to happen to my half siblings and I believed him because of how much care he had taken of me when I was little. It made me feel like he did regret it and he said he did it so my mother wouldn't be alone with this and to support her as much as he could. With all he did for us back then I believed this to be true.Two years later his oldest daughter moved out and told my grandma that he had been sexually abusing her and her sisters as well. Not only felt I so betrayed and angry at my father but also at myself for being so naive and falling for his manipulation. I don't think I will ever trust anything he says ever again.My family has been going against him in court for over a year but he has money on his side and my grandma and my mother had passed by that time. His daughters and wife need a lot of psychological support to be able to speak out but since my country (Kazakhstan) isn't always that fair to women and a developing country it's hard for them to hold up.

As a child I got misdiagnosed with a mental disability so I went to a special school for disabled children where I didn't learn anything cause everyone, including myself, thought we were all too stupid to ever learn anything anyway. Then it turned out it was a wrong diagnosis and I got to go to a regular school but because I've not learned anything before I was really behind. Couldn't really read or write and was known to be the school's idiot. Many of my teachers would try to humiliate me and highlight my lack of education in their classes. I skipped school a lot and only was interested in the school's swimming team as that was something I was really good at.Years later I came back to the school but as a teacher. There was a new director who appreciated my language skills and hired me as a language teacher eventually after I've been working as an assistant. Many of my old teachers who used to bully me back then were still teaching at that school and despised the fact that I was now on the same level as them. In the end I got fired last summer and even though I loved being a teacher, I certainly don't miss my coworkers. They often made fun of my lack of knowledge in maths or other sciences and humiliated me during school celebrations by pairing me up against children for math quizzes and so on. One of them, a biology teacher, would put up prints of one-celled beings with my name on it that had a speech bubble that said \"I am Mr. V. and I am anorexic\" and childish things like that.It never bothered me that much until I lost my job cause of this drama.

But I am happy to be alive and my mother and I ended up being very close. Most of my life I grew up in a children's home because my mother couldn't take care of me and I had an amazing childhood. People who are concerned about the well-being of the children once they are born forget that both children homes and adoption are a thing. Growing up in a children home isn't as bad as people might think, it was basically like a never ending sleepover party with your best friends. I think that also some of my best qualities stem from the fact that I grew up like that, I find it easy to compromise with people without giving myself up for it, I can always make friends without having to rely on them really. And most of the people I knew from there are the same. Of course I had hard times and made many bad choices but in the end, every life has potential and it's unfair to determine if someone's life will be a victory or a failure before giving them the chance to live it.For people who are concerned about the well-being of the parents: again, even when you give birth to a child it doesn't mean you have to care for it forever. There are many people who would love to have children but can't. Apart from me, my mother had other unplanned children as well which she all cared for until someone has adopted them but I know she loved everyone of her children and was still invested in their lives and loved seeing them grow up into amazing people from afar. I love having siblings all across the country and even in different countries and they grew up to be functional, wonderful adults. And my mother was happy that she gave them a chance to live.

Especially when it's busy and you're at the end of a long busy shift and lose focus.So just be honest, say what's wrong right away and we can try to fix it or improve our recipe if that's the issue.", "link_id": "t3_ez2bzo", "time": 1580871433}}

Yes, in WW2 it was an honorable thing to do but in all the modern conflicts, I don't see how inserting yourself in other countries conflicts have made it any better. Meddling with civil wars is not a thing I agree with as very often, an outsider wouldn't understand the depth of the conflicts. I have talked to many people who have served the army, both on American and Russian sides. And sadly a lot of then have no knowledge of the history and reasons of the conflicts they take part in and just follow orders. The ignorance in saying \"I'm a soldier and not a historian, I just follow my call\" is not allowing me to respect or celebrate a soldier.Especially with Russia now, there is no need to hijack the protests in Ukraine and turn them into a war. This is not even efficient to influence them that way and there would be more diplomatic ways to lead to better success at winning Ukraine over again. I can't respect anyone who would be willing to point a gun at a brother.

With all my expenses deducted and some money set aside for accidents or something like that (broken sink or whatever) I have about 10-15 dollars on average but it works out fine cause things are rather cheap in Russia.Corn is great though it's hard to get fresh corn, most of it is canned. In summer you can get fresh corn easily though.I eat potatoes a lot too, just forgot to mention it.They do have a rice cooker where I live. I've never used one before so I didn't know what you can do with it. I'll try that for sure, thank you. Generally I never add any sauces and eat things plain since I'm in Japan right now and most of the sauces contain Soy sauce or Mayonnaise. At home I usually just add herbs and spices to things I eat to make it more interesting.Ramen in Japan is almost always made with fish stock or soy sauce but they made me vegan ramen once which was really nice.And my issue is mostly that I am missing an enzyme that breaks down hormones that are found or develop in some foods and they give your body an over reaction. It's technically not an allergy but I don't know how else to explain it in English to be honest. It is also a bit random if the food will actually give me a reaction or not cause you can't tell the levels of the hormone by looking at it so sometimes I can eat some of those things and be fine but other times it could even cause me to pass out.If I don't have them in large quantities or too often it's not that much of a problem.Anyway, thank you very much for taking the time to help me out, I really appreciate it.", "link_id": "t3_eyazso", "time": 1580773056}}

I get that she's busy as well but I feel like she takes it for granted that I help her clean so I stopped doing it because I feel like it's her own responsibility and she can't abuse my urge to have a clean surrounding to have me clean for her.

The city used to be blocked from the general public as a lot of nuclear physics were researched there. The infrastructure which connected the city of Dubna to Moscow was built by Gulag prisoners. A lot of them died during the building process which is why the route is often called \"Path of bones\" cause there are myths that the skeletons of the people who died were just incorporated in the constructions cause people wouldn't bother to get them away. Also, Nihonium was discovered in a collaboration between Japanese scientists and a research team from Dubna and the elements 117 and 118 were discovered in a team of Russian and American scientists in Dubna. The Element Dubnium is named after the city of Dubna and the element Moscovium was also discovered in Dubna. Since Dubna is in Moscow oblast the name is still location based though.  Also, another fun fact about Dubna, nowadays it's an academic city for universe students and also the city has the biggest statue of Lenin in Russia.", "link_id": "t3_bpbeho", "time": 1558008113}}

My first girlfriend V. was my best friend before and when we were 12 she had a big crush on me. Since we were very good friends and I didn't really have a crush on anyone at the time I agreed to being in a relationship because back then I thought she'd get bored of me in a few weeks cause at that age relationships are just an imitation of what you think adults would do. I never had feelings for her other than friendship but I wanted to keep our friendship no matter what. Turned out I was wrong. Age 19 she was still with me. I've never had sex with her and she knew that I wasn't up for it but we kissed and did other things couples would do. Then I met my current wife L.. I for the first time actually fell in love with someone and she was into me as well.  But I wasn't sure if she'd actually stay with me cause we were from two different worlds basically. L. is from a family of academics who are upper middle class, she is super smart and studies dentistry at university. Meanwhile I was some drug addicted bum who dropped out of school and has been to juvenile. V. was from my world, we grew up together, lived together, knew eachother down to the smallest detail. I thought L. would never stay with me in the future and I also didn't want to lose my best friend over something that has no perspective to last. But I also wanted to get to know L. and at least try to have a relationship with her. So I cheated. I didn't break up with V. While starting a new relationship with L. I never loved V.  and I should have never agreed to having a relationship with her just to make her happy and so that I don't loose her cause in the end when she found out it was worse for her than if I had told her I wasn't into her like that when we were 12. I really regret it but I am glad that I did get to know L. because we got married 1 1/2 years ago, she helped me quit drugs and we both lead a somewhat decent life now. I also learned from her that people aren't always how they seem and that problems aren't always related to money. Despite all the differences we managed to help eachother grow.  V. Eventually forgave me and she found a man who actually loves her and recently managed to quit drugs too and went on a trip to Chicago which used to be her biggest dream in life.

For my Mama my favourite memory was when I came home on my birthday and she had already cooked my favourite tea and when I opened the door she sat on the floor painting her nails and when she saw me she jumped up to hug me but spilled the nailpolish. For my best friend, when we were children we had invented a game which we called human rodeo where we'd jump on the backs of random people and see who could hold on the longest. Once I jumped on a guy and he didn't try to shake me off but instead invited us to his mansion to try his \"flying carpet\" basically he put a rug on a skateboard and pushed us around his mansion while telling crazy stories. Another good memory of him: Since my best friend and I both grew up in an orphanage we were already surrounded by new children in sometimes critical conditions. One day a baby came to our orphanage which had been neglected and therefore was very malnourished. My friend and I didn't understand that babies eat less than older children so we didn't get why the keepers wouldn't give it more food. So we secretly sneaked out parts of our own food and gave it to the baby. Then suddenly the baby was super fat and no one knew why. But we both thought we saved this baby and we were so proud of it and liked this baby so much, we always took it along with us. But since it was so heavy we put it in a plastic washing bowl with pillows and then added a rope and pulled it along over the lawn when we were playing outside.", "link_id": "t3_bkeiev", "time": 1556927548}}

You have to replace it with something that satisfies you enough to not go back to your addiction. It's best if it's something that occupies your mind enough to not think about it too much. I'd say it's kind of like getting over an ex, if you go out and meet new people and do fun things in the time-frames that you would have spend with her it's easier getting over it than if you sit at home looking at old photos and remembering the good times you've had together. For me it was kind of luck. The rehab center I went to was run by Canadian missionaries and they had children my age who became friends with me sort of. I asked them to teach me English because I was often bored and thinking about going back to old habits. They did teach me English and gave me books etc that I could use to study and everytime I craved drugs I'd study languages. It helped me a lot, because not only does learning a language take all the focus of your mind, but it also gives you new chances and opens up a whole new world. For example today I'm an English and German teacher and I'm really happy about how things turned out this way. But really, this isn't a solution that fits everyone. Maybe try and reconnect to a younger you and find out what you were interested in before you started using a phone (if that's possible)  or just go out and try new things and make new experiences.

One day I used together with my best friend and since he was very tiny he overdosed and passed away. I was still somewhat gone when I slowly realised what happened rats had already started to chew off parts of his face and I thought that I don't want to die like that and that I want to see the ocean before I die. Then I went to teen challenge rehab center and shortly before I had met my now wife for the first time. She was very supportive even though we weren't in a relationship at the time. Another aspect was that my Mama got pregnant again and she was always very weak and depressed and asked me to help her out and then for the first time I felt like I need to take responsibility and stop thinking that some miracle will change everything. Now thanks to all of that I get to have a wonderful wife and wonderful little sister who my wife and I have adopted two years ago.
