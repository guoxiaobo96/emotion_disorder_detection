{"feevz4u": {"text": "I think most of us with Bipolar Disorder have been diagnosed with GAD and Depression prior to official diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. So it wouldn\u2019t be surprising that it\u2019s something they might want to keep an eye on. Normal people go through splurges too. But are you wasting money on things you don\u2019t need and neglecting to pay your rent, for example? Usually the Bipolar spending habit is so compulsive and you end up frivolously spending money you had for rent and bills and end up with shit you don\u2019t need. And you keep doing it even when you know you\u2019re in a bind because you\u2019re continually feeding a high to keep yourself manic or hypomanic. To me, that\u2019s one of the differentiating things between splurges and Bipolar sprees. If you can afford it and it\u2019s not interfering with your other expenses you\u2019re probably okay. I mean, I\u2019m no doctor but that\u2019s my understanding when I got my BP diagnosis. I had gone from periods of near perfect credit to complete debt and finally dig myself out to have perfect credit again and abused it and I\u2019m back where I started. It\u2019s an unhealthy compulsion that interferes with my daily living and my overall wellbeing. I think if you haven\u2019t crossed that boundary and still know you\u2019re limits it\u2019s nothing to worry about. But keep an eye on it. Track it with the Mint app if you can. It links to your bank account and you can see where money is going and it can help you identify a problem. Good luck either way. I say as you dose up you will either notice the drugs your on are helping or they\u2019re making it worse. Antidepressants for people with BP is like a nightmare. It causes suicidal ideation and can trigger mania. So just be really aware of your moods and if you can make sure other people can help you monitor it so you can see any patterns developing that you might need to speak to a psychiatrist about. :)", "link_id": "t3_eorx3c", "time": 1579042396}}

And I got the top incentive bracket, which netted me a bonus for the month that doubles my pay. They even asked me for feedback and are using it to remap the way we do our customer management process both digitally and interpersonally. I did all that while being high pretty much all the time. I decided instead of feeling bad about doing weed regularly, as I tend to guilt myself into thinking I\u2019m too reliant, I am instead going to embrace cannabis culture in all avenues and enjoy the natural benefits that microdosing regularly provides. Also, I have bipolar 2 disorder and I find my symptoms so much more manageable now that I microdose that my doctor and I have agreed to lower my dosage.", "link_id": "t3_ek50vq", "time": 1578190040}}

But here are some random jot notes.&amp;#x200B;* The show simply underserves every character in this series, with perhaps the exception of Morgan and Al. * Established characters prior to Season 4 act out of character and are reduced to background characters in their own stories* New characters introduced after Season 4 are given a backstory that supposedly define them, but as the story moves forward it\u2019s all ignored and has no relevance in the plot or their character motivations * Every character is one note. They are defined by a single motivation - to help people. Or in Al\u2019s case - to get her story. * Character arcs are superficial and inorganic, especially for Alicia. But it can be said of pretty much any character, particular the OG\u2019s. * Characters make dumb decisions simply to drive a desired plot forward even when it\u2019s against character or character history* The story lacks character intimacy in terms of dialogue. Dialogue is given as either a prolonged monologue of nonsense or people talk to each other in ways that humans simply don\u2019t talk. * The show focuses on characters that aren\u2019t interesting and are annoying. Instead of focusing on Morgan and Al, the show should focus more on Alicia and Strand, or Daniel. Or pretty much anyone else other than Morgan and Al.* The narrative lacks any originality and is uninspired. As a result it produces little to no tension or conflict. * Any tension or conflict that is introduced feels incredibly forced and contrived and serves only to reinforce Morgan as the shows misplaced lead.* No true, overarching plot structure to drive individual characterizations.* Too much gimmickry. The plot resolves around gimmicks and tricks that are supposed to seem exciting but are flat. The biggest one being the use of Al\u2019s camera. It\u2019s just too overwrought and painful to watch. * The stakes never seem high. The series makes no effort to put its characters in any real danger where the outcome might surprise us. * No forward momentum. The show has become so boring because nothing ever really happens that changes the group dynamic or pushes them forward in any meaningful way. * The show doesn\u2019t have anything to say about the state of humanity and the post-apocalyptic world they live in. * Character arcs are repetitive.

{"ew0yfwr": {"text": "My obsessive thoughts tend to be inappropriate sexual thoughts or images or thoughts/images of hurting or killing people or animals I love. For example, I have two bunnies which I love so much. Yet sometimes I'll randomly get an intrusive thought about hurting them or killing them such as breaking their neck. It's very upsetting because I hate animal cruelty and I would probably put myself in harm's way before I let anything happen to them.

And it gets louder as if I'm trying to drown out the thought and return to normal thinking. It has also been so minor as to hear words or phrases spoken that don't correspond with what I feel is \"right\" and having to repeat the right phrase in my head. For example, I always order coffee with milk and sugar in that order because it's in alphabetical order and the more common order to say it in. I overheard a guy at a coffee shop order it in the order of sugar and milk. It was like hearing it got trapped in my head so I had to repeat in my head the proper order of milk and sugar until I drowned it out and could only hear it in the proper order.

The fact that everything is also from Morgan's point of view as a lead character when he's really not a good leader is also insulting to Alicia who was developing into a very strong leader towards the end of S3. Her character development was stunted so she could become a Morganite. The characters of Alicia, Strand, Luciana and Daniel used to be very layered and complex and interesting. Now they're reduced to characters whose dialogue could literally be given to any other character and no one would notice. It's become the same monotonous speech over and over again. And they no longer have human moments together and instead talk in monologues over walkie talkies. Basically everything that made the show a layered, compielling and complex story has been abandoned in favour of one dimensional story telling that lacks any distinguishable character or plot points to form a cohesive and interesting story.", "link_id": "t3_ckjieq", "time": 1564641158}}

From my understanding it's actually known to cause depressive episodes in people with bipolar disorder. I had a really bad time on it and I was switched to a few other drugs before finally landing on Zoloft, which I now take 200mg of. Zoloft has been a lifesaver for me. At the start the side effects were a little more prevalent but I've found that over time (less than a year) it has subsided to a manageable level. I think every med we take is going to have some amount of side effect that we won't like, but once you get settled on the right drug combo and the right dosage it is worth the trade off. I wouldn't worry too much about coming off fluoxetine. You're on a smaller dose and if you are indeed bipolar 2 than it may actually be doing more harm than good.

Granted, I'm on 3 types of drugs to manage both bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder that each hinder sexual desire, but I find it hard to get invested in sex. It sucks because I was always someone who really enjoyed it and we used to have sex 3-4 times a week. I feel guilty for it and have tried my best to put myself in the mood. Here's how it usually works out for me:First, we put aside time before sleep to just lay together with the tv off and just enjoy each other's company and cuddling to keep ourselves feeling intimate. Second, I try to read erotic stories to help my mind get stimulated about sex and when my body starts to react I don't indulge it. It's mostly for my mind to focus and give me the time to become aroused without pressure. Third, my partner puts his hands down my pants and just cups my balls and fondles them a bit. There's no pressure but he does a certain thing that really relaxes me and when that happens I attain an erection and we go from there. I've had times off my meds and we return to multiple sexual acts a week again so I think it helps him to know it's not that I don't find him sexually attractive. It's just side affects of medications. But we both work on it as best we can to make a connection to keep our intimacy. But it's really difficult for me because genuinely I feel like I'm neutered. I don't get excited for sex without the work put in. But once I can get in the mood it's wonderful. Another thing that has helped is that I have become a lot more versatile. I used to be a Vers top but now I'm enjoying bottoming more as the stimulation allows me to have an orgasm better and I don't have to worry that I'm not keeping my arousal physically.

I\u2019ve had several iPhones and several android phones over the years and I have to say that there\u2019s pros and cons for each but ultimately I settled on iPhone because I can keep myself within an ecosystem of already installed apps. I delete or limit the ones I can\u2019t delete, but I make good use of the stock apps so I download less third party apps. I use iCloud Drive as my file storage, I use all of Apple\u2019s iWork apps for productivity. And I use Apple Music. I feel like once you get it setup it\u2019s good to go and you don\u2019t need to make many changes because you\u2019re locked into apps your phone has by default. Plus, it gives a nice clean aesthetic and it is well integrated that I find myself more productive. And the urge to customize is lessened for sure. My last android phone I found myself customizing the launcher and all that Jazz once a week at least. The most I change about my iPhone now is the wallpaper every now and then. One thing I think that works in the iPhone\u2019s favour too is that the latest OS can still be run on a phone that\u2019s six years old. So getting an iPhone and working within that ecosystem would be beneficial in the long term and your workflow can become a fixed routine for a longer time than with most android phones where you have to upgrade more often to get the latest OS. Just my thinking anyway. I think I rambled on enough but I do think it could be a way of simplifying your phone for sure. Hope it helps.", "link_id": "t3_bbsli4", "time": 1554953309}}
{"ekl1r6c": {"text": "It\u2019s a bit of a toss up for me. I love different franchises for different reasons. My first love was Halloween. The first movie was just so classic. And I enjoy several of the sequels, though the quality of said sequels is certainly not evenly distributed. I love Friday the 13th as a franchise because it\u2019s one I can easily rewatch over and over. At least the first 6-8 films. But my love of A Nightmare on Elm Street comes from it genuinely terrifying me as a child and for the inventiveness of the sequels. I prefer 1-4, but 5 has some qualities in its favour. But the first 4 to me are very classic and a good quadrilogy. Or you can omit 2 and the other 3 form a great trilogy. So one love is nostalgia (Halloween), one love is the rewatchability and the fun of it (F13th) but I think ANOES is perhaps the best of the three and can still give me a genuine creepiness even after all these years.", "link_id": "t3_bbrj7j", "time": 1554935161}}

Its kind of like brain training yourself to build up some interest and stamina. It doesn\u2019t serve as a long term solution but it does help out.

I've been down that road before and the last time I almost didn't make it. And how I'm grateful someone stepped in to help me out. One day one little thing will change and steer you down a new direction where there will be so many more possibilities for you yo move beyond the homophobia you are surrounded with. So take a breath and realize that what you're experiencing now isn't what you'll always experience. You need to make sure you take care of yourself first and foremost. It's hard boy yo measure ourselves against others but no one can live your life but you. Your journey is unique to you and how it will shape you. There's no need to rush to feel like you're living independently as you perceive others you age are. Take the time to recognize that measuring your success to your own internal goals that will make you happy is all you need yo worry about. You are the only person in the drivers seat of your life. You need to steer yourself towards what you want up attain. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to happiness. And for what its worth I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I don't think you need to worry that you might be bipolar. I think its a lot of stress and anxiety coupled with depression that is getting you down. Anyone in that situation would dwell on the negative. May I suggest you see your doctor to see if he can prescribe a short term anti-anxiety medication and maybe even a mild antidepressant. It could help curb some of the strong emotions and thoughts your having to gave you a chance to help yourself up from where you are now. And you don't even have to say anything about your sexuality in asking about this. One thing I've learned over years of struggling through mental illness and adversity is that even when things feel like they are out of control we can still take the reigns and make small changes everyday that add up to positive bigger changes. Just breath and take it one thing at a time. Trust me, you'll realize you're much stronger than you're giving yourself credit for. You got this! Good luck. And make sure you reach out to whatever resources you can make use of. This pain you feel is temporary. Don't let it take your life and future happiness away from you.

Then seeing Daniel delighted me. 2. I think they're still leaning to heavily on filters. What's with the propensity of stripping the colour from a scene to try and illustrate the mood is dire when it's generally boring. 3. Still too much Morgan. I just don't need his rinse and repeat dialogue driving a non-existent plot in circles. 4. Alicia can be her own person and is quite capable of being the lead. She doesn't need Mo-Mo's advice. 5. There were some interesting shots with the plane crash and I think someone was wearing a hazmat suit of sorts? I only watched the trailer once as I wanted to let it sink in and see if anything makes me more curious. 6. Looks like John will be involved more which is a major plus! His character - and to some extent Al's character - was the only thing they got right last season. 7. If Luciana's plot this season is to try and recover to play an acordian then it's a shame they're not utilizing the actresses true talent. Also, I don't want gee befriending June unless it means she will be the one who has to put June down this season! Overall I'm still worried it looks too aimless. And boring.
