However, if you are like me that is probably not an option.  My family is middle class but not rich, so if I do not work I will end up inconveniencing others a lot.  I feel compelled to work or die.  I am not an optimist.

I've left the house but only to talk to a psychiatrist, I haven't looked for work yet.  The Matthew effect is brutal.  Society is more credentialist than meritocratic and it does not forgive or forget.  This era seems way worse for trying to catch up if you fell behind than most of the previous ones.

Some hypothetical self who is more rational or motivated or resilient or extroverted or intelligent might be able to easily thrive from our situations but unfortunately it's not so easy to get such a self-upgrade; we are who we are and many of our maladies are intractable.  We have to move forward as our broken selves in our wretched situations, and that's what makes it impossible.  Nonetheless, we have to move forward.  Or rather, if we don't move forward, things will just get worse.  Death is always an open door if it becomes unbearable.

{"ecgiv2d": {"text": "The therapist diagnosed me with bipolar type 1.  I think that is unlikely.  When I have a psychiatric evaluation I'm thinking it will either be changed to depression or bipolar type 2 or something else.  This is why I wonder about the whole \"was that a manic episode?\" and \"was that a hypomanic episode?\" questions; precisely because it will change the diagnosis and medications, and I don't want to take strong medications if I don't need them.  However, I have had major depressive episodes in the double digits by now, so I'd probably be foolish or in denial to think my condition is not severe or that I could get by without any medical treatment.I will say I have a lot of trouble relating to people's stories on bipolar forums.  I see a lot of people around with more like 'cluster b' traits but I am mostly 'cluster a'; I am eccentric, reclusive, and avoidant.  Also, I am paradoxically 'unemotional' despite having severe mood disturbances.  I can't really relate at all to common descriptions of bipolar like 'we just feel more' that people often tout, and struggle to relate to people with high emotionality / emotional reactivity.  Although I am not emotionless or something like that; I just rarely have issues with things like anger and sadness (for me depression is a state of severe fatigue without feelings of sadness).  Even my therapist is struggling to make sense of how I can have such severe mood disturbances without high emotionality; he seems to think those two things must go together.As for knowing if I was manic or not...well it's hard because of how eccentric my behavior is to know what to say.  For instance, on one occasion I became euphoric for about a week with a very high libido and wrote a close female friend about 100 pages of hand written letters, many with explicit sexual content.  Was that a manic episode?  I don't know.  On a different occasion, I became convinced that if I studied the right topics and acquired the right knowledge I would 'attain equanimity'; then I made a list of about 200 topics I needed to study.  I took a few thousand pages of notes from a few dozen books and a few hundred journal articles until my mood converted into a depression.  Was that a 'manic episode' or a 'delusion'? I don't know.  I wish I was less eccentric then everything would be clearer.  Then it would be easier to tell.  My mother thinks it's \"OCD\" rather than \"mania\" but I don't know if there is a component of euphoria or high libido in OCD.  I just don't know what to think.

I think I'm more open to the idea that I actually have an illness and could benefit from medication, regardless of what diagnosis I am given.However, I am teetering between two extremes of concern about the whole process. On the one hand, I worry I will get a bipolar diagnosis and be given medication which is too potent for me and unnecessary. On the other hand, I worry I will be given a diagnosis of depression, take anti-depressents, and have an induced psychotic manic episode or paranoid mixed episode. I've never been psychotic before so this is probably irrational fear.Anyways I think I just need to be in contact with doctors when I stop living a life of seclusion, which I plan to in upcoming months. I've become convinced if I live with no stimulation whatsoever I can avoid extreme highs or lows, but I'm not really interested in becoming a Buddhist monk in an isolated mountain temple (although there were many times I did seriously consider it).

{"e7xpak0": {"text": "I have a lot of symptoms that look like bipolar disorder but they manifest themselves in the world in ways which may be atypical (or maybe not, I'm not even sure).  I don't really know how to talk about them.  If they are not bipolar disorder I'm not sure what to call it (maybe cyclothymic temperament?)  Here are some examples:* At the beginning of every school semester I would have a week or so high and then crash into depression and then cycle between highs and lows for the rest of the semester.  Because of this consistent mood cycling pattern I generally passed classes which had exams or presentations and failed classes which had final papers or projects; the reason I failed classes with final papers or projects is not only because I couldn't finish them when I was depressed, but also because I made extremely ambitious and numerous plans during the high parts of the cycle which could not possibly be finished during the low parts of the cycle.* Sometimes I have sudden 'flips' of moods in the presence of social or goal-related triggers.  I understand there is something called 'ultrarapid cycling' but it doesn't seem to be very well understood.  A pattern that has happened to me many times is I had a presentation at school and was extremely depressed the week before, but suddenly, the day of the presentation I would flip into a state of extreme high energy and motivation.  This allowed me to pass some classes which required presentations, because in those high moods I could still do well even with little preparation.* When I did a study abroad I had even more extreme versions of the cycles I usually have.  I had several multi-week cycles from a ball of energy where I studied and socialized 14-16 hours a day to a vegetative depressive state where I slept 14-16 hours a day.  The cycles continued like that for the entire year long study abroad.  Also, similar to the problem I had with being too ambitious on plans for final papers and final projects, I made the mistake of signing up for all the hardest classes since I was high the first 2 weeks, which ended up being way too hard once I became depressed.Anyways I don't know.  I'm almost certain what I have is not Bipolar Type 1, where people have full-blown Mania with psychotic symptoms.  If my highs are considered a type of Mania, it would be the lesser form of hypomania.  I guess I need to go talk about all this stuff with a professional but I want to get my story straight.  Last time I saw a psychotherapist I was very depressed and I was diagnosed with depression, but I want a professional to seriously evaluate the weird highs I have and tell me if they are abnormal or normal.  And honestly even if they are considered normal, I still kind of want an explanation of what's up with the the flips and the cycling, e.g. it if they told me \"you're depressed but also have a cyclothymic temperament but don't meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar\" I would be perfectly okay I just want someone to acknowledge this shit.", "link_id": "t3_9owlah", "time": 1539785863}}
