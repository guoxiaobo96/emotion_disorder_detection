My mother always tried to support him and protect him, even if she found him playing the victim, blaming and beating her because of his delusions. The only reason she left him, after twelve years of horrible abuse, was me: I didn't want my little brother to grow up into an abusive environment as I did myself; so me and her talked it out and we left him.He still hates us. He doesn't even speak to me anymore. We are fine without him and everything should be perfect now, right?Nope, life is never perfect. And because of that - and because of my dad, because of my genes, because of my childhood - I have been diagnosed: I am bipolar too. But I can tell you one thing: I am not like him.Maybe this is why I find myself in a subreddit not made for me - sorry for this!I don't want to be that person for my husband. If we decide to have kids, I don't want to be that person for them.So, what I think/hope is:there might be a little spark of responsability in the hurt a bipolar may cause. I can't decide to stop my delusions and my mood swings, but I can decide how to (not!) react. I can decide to take medication. I can decide to commit to a lifetime of therapy. I can decide to avoid alcool forever, because I know how it makes me behave. And so on.I am not saying it will be easy. I am not saying it works like it's nothing. Indeed I will say it is hell. Because we not cause only hurt to you: we cause terrible pain to ourselves too. But I am not doing it for me, I am doing it for him. This is not the truth, I know. This is what I want to believe.
