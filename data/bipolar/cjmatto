I think the max was 15min, but this would knock your entire route offline leaving you with no internet until it was done. Back then you could not differentiate who's IP you were pulling unless they joined your lobby if you invited them. If you pulled the IP's of the games public match lobby everyone's IP pulls up the only thing you could tell is the IP at the top was the host and if you hit them offline the whole server crashed and kicked everyone. This was very common in competitive gamebattles matches. You would get your teammates IP's then invite the other team in and you knew theirs just didn't know which exact person it was. I'm pretty sure you and your friend would needed to have joined his lobby if he invited you to get your IP. Not sure how it may work now a days but maybe it could be possible with the right software.

{"erms1lz": {"text": "I have the same build except with a 1080 before they released these that I bought at best buy, the computer is an absolute beast. The RAM is pretty generic so I ended up swapping it for 32gb DDR4 G skill trident z rgb @ 3200MHz, I also ended up swapping the cooler to a corsair h100i pro for a more aesthetic look and a cooler temps even though the stock cooler was fine. You will really enjoy the build. Make sure all your drivers are up to date as well as your windows. The 8700k is an absolute beast of a CPU. Like /u/weirdohappy said, if you have a 144hz monitor make sure you plug the display port into the back of the gpu and monitor. Once you do that make sure you go into the monitor settings on windows and set the refresh rate to 144hz as it will not do it on its own. You will not get 144hz using and HDMI cable but should be able to over clock the monitor a little, I believe 74hz. Just make sure you plug the cable into the GPU and not the motherboard. Hope this helps and gives you some peace of mind.", "link_id": "t3_c2n3wf", "time": 1561035426}}
