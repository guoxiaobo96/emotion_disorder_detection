Spent lots of money, stayed up all hours of the night, was super productive, and an asshole to pretty much everyone. While my family never said anything to me, my coworkers did. Was never bad enough to cause MAJOR problems, but, what I can remember from then, it was simultaneously amazing and very very unpleasant.Getting off of Effexor was the worst... Had brain zaps for months and I was only on the lowest dose. I had to open the capsules and slowly pour out the little beads as I tapered down. And my neuro wouldn't listen when I told him this was an issue. He said he didn't know what I was talking about and that because I was on the lowest dose, I should be able to just stop. I swore off doctors and medicine for a while after that. Fast forward a few years, throw in some heart problems and needing meds for that. And my husband would come home to me crying in the tub several nights a week. Because I just couldn't. He insisted I tell my gp, who referred me to a psychiatrist. Told her the things and the stuff and that I suspected I was bipolar and the first thing she suggested was an antidepressant and I said noooope. Told her about Effexor and she suggested Lamictal instead. Have been on it since November last year and it has been a godsend. Was also given Quetiapine to use as a sleep aid and it zonked me out.

I don't know you and I don't really know your situation, but I think in that moment, you probably needed someone to push you to get that help. Everyone needs help with something at some point. While it may make you feel pathetic (God knows it makes me feel worthless sometimes), it does NOT make you pathetic or worthless. Realizing you have a problem and admitting it to the world takes a hell of a lot of strength. Actively seeking help for those issues is commendable. Don't backtrack from what progress you have made.

If the smells help you, you could potentially get a diffuser as well, I don't have one yet, but I'm planning to get one soon.Also, telling someone is a good idea. Someone physically present to help you through tough times. And even if you don't tell anyone, put yourself in situations where you are around other people (go to a coffee shop or invite friends over or hang out with family).
