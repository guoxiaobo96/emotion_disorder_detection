Then, when he read the article about the Jane Doe found near Asheville, he put two and two together and alerted Philadelphia police. It's possible that if he hadn't done that, it may have taken longer to identify the Jane Doe or it may never have been identified at all. -- I don't find it weird, necessarily, but it's definitely lucky.Also, Judy apparently had two very vague connections to NC that may actually have nothing to do with the case. According to Wikipedia:&gt;Judy's family could not imagine why she might have gone to the Asheville area. According to them, she never expressed any desire to go there, and had only twice been to that general region of the country. Once she had visited Jeffrey for a week when he was at a weight loss clinic in Raleigh\u2013Durham; on another occasion she had accompanied a patient on a drive south as he visited family that either lived closer in North Carolina to Asheville or in a neighboring area of Virginia or Tennessee (the family's memories differ).", "link_id": "t3_g3fq3c", "time": 1587229541}}

It definitely seems a bit toned-down and muted. I appreciated Louis pointing this out a few times. I guess the change in tone is at least partially because of the passing of Fred Phelps (?).* Shirley and Steve's refusal to directly address Fred Phelps' status in the church and salvation was VERY telling. I'm glad Louis pressed them on that.* I see some chatter on here about Steve Drain. I read Lauren Drain's book (Steve's daughter who was banished from the church and is now killing it as a nurse/bodybuilde and she says her father is a narcissist who loves power and being in control. It's Lauren's opinion, and I agree with her, that Steve was attracted to the church because it gave him a place to be in control. He controls his family and now he's one of the elders who controls the church. Imagine the rush in power he must have gotten when he helped kick Fred out, and then made Shirley quiet down.

Going up for the first time is the hardest part, in my opinion. Pull the trigger and you'll be so glad you did! I've been doing mics for a while now, and I've noticed I tend to think of possible jokes more ... immersing yourself in comedy can help get the ball rolling on coming up with jokes.* You mentioned the \"two list joke system.\" There is no specific way that a standup set has to go. Start with what you're comfortable with, then make changes based on audience reaction/constructive criticism you get/etc. If you don't want to do the two list joke system, then don't do it.* You will bomb. There's no way around it. The first time I bombed I was really embarrassed. Now, if I bomb I'm eager to get back on stage and do better.  Sometimes, the reason you bomb isn't even you. I was at a booked show once, and a comic went up and got a lackluster response. Simply put, the crowd sucked (except for me, of course \ud83d\ude1c).
