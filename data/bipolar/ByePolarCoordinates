There are hallmark stages of grief that can help to identify it. Depression tends to be more persistent and pervasive. There can be a morbid preoccupation with worthlessness or feelings of guilt that do not have to do with the grief. Complicated grief, particularly if there is a lot of associated stress or trauma surrounding the loss, can potentially lead to depressive symptoms. I lost my mom 10 weeks ago and have been diagnosed with complicated grief and depression. Most of this was based on heightened CPTSD symptoms (I had a complicated history with my mother) along with symptoms of atypical depression.

I\u2019m dress rehearsing tragedy in an effort to find emotional release. Or perhaps It trying to sabotage the emotional release because I am depressed and don\u2019t believe that I am deserving of relief and joy. *  I am feeling vulnerable and lonely and feel misunderstood. Giving up my rights and privileges in this way and being under the care of others is not something I enjoy but it has provided a source of safety, connection and healed some of my loneliness. Maybe I need to address the underlying needs that are causing me to dress rehearse this situation. * This sense of urgency and finality might be misdirected. It may indeed be a call to action or change, but not necessarily as literally as our minds can graphically conjure. It fits the theme of the depression, but the urgency really speaks to something simpler: a desire to take action and change our suffering. This can be done in healthy ways but depression can blind us to those possibilities, unless we learn to be vulnerable with ourselves. Brene Brown talks about this - \u201cdress rehearsing tragedy\u201d - as something that we do when we are afraid to feel vulnerable - to get to the core truth. It may be worth doing some introspection next time your mind goes there, and wonder what emotions you may be protecting yourself from. I highly recommend her books and Ted Talks. I think this \u201cprotection by catastrophizing\u201d is common for everyone and is not limited to the experience of suicidal ideation.

I think it made a remarkable difference for me to find someone that was compatible with my love languages. My advice?1) Sometimes people grow apart. This was an aspect in my marriage. We became different people, as we all do over time, and instead of taking that journey together - we became disconnected. It was too hard to force a connection that was no longer there. For us, divorce was the right move. 2) Your wife is communicating to you that she doesn\u2019t want sex. You offer to put in extra effort into pleasing her sexually (oral, toys, porn, etc) but in the end she tells you she just doesn\u2019t enjoy it. I received similar pleas from my ex-husband. I was under a lot of stress, I knew I was not going to get any sexual release despite his efforts, and ultimately allowing him to do this \u201cfor my sexual pleasure\u201d felt disingenuous. It was ultimately all for *his* sexual pleasure. Which is fine. I understood this was important. But I could feel it creating a problem and a distance between us.

{"een1yas": {"text": "I\u2019m sorry you are going through this. It\u2019s not an easy journey. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder several years into my marriage. I had been with my partner for about ten years at that point when things started to manifest as severe, recurrent depressions. Depression excels at feeding those afflicted terrible, soul-crushing lies about their environment and self-worth. When I was in this state and was approached by my husband for physical intimacy, it was terrifying. I cared for my husband, but I was incapable of feeling any love for myself. The whole idea of sharing myself with someone felt threatening and foreign. Over time, frustrations and resentments grew, and I felt so pressured any time the subject came up. I needed better communication and I would have hugely benefited from strengthening emotional intimacy during this precarious time without any expectation of sex. I needed validation and we needed open honesty. I needed to feel safe. But over time his resentment grew because his needs were not being met. Because I was constantly being pressured, any time he became affectionate this would often trigger me and make me fear it would lead to sex. I hated this feeling - it felt like almost a loss of trust on my end. I was afraid to be touched, and physical touch has always been one of my top love languages. It did not help my sense of alienation or my depression. During an episode, my husband talked me into a night where I would submit and let him seduce me. I wanted to feel good and please him despite all the lies my mind was feeding me. It ended up being emotionally overwhelming and I spent a couple of hours crying in the bathroom afterwards. He had nothing to say to me and seemed irritated which made things worse. Some of his behavior was certainly selfish. But I know for the most part he felt personally rejected or perhaps inadequate with each disappointing exchange, and I wish I had had the capacity to communicate that I still wanted and needed him. Depression doesn\u2019t just hurt its sufferers. It affects us all. It\u2019s not an easy road to travel. Is your partner in treatment? This makes a big difference. I would prioritize emotional intimacy right now. Physical intimacy may follow naturally once she feels safe and supported.

My mental health struggles certainly did not make things easy in that relationship but they were by no means the sole reason for its dissolution. We were married for 8 years and together for 15 and enjoyed plenty of happy times. However, things were no longer working and it was apparent we had grown apart. I found myself mourning the loss of my family more than the loss of my husband, which I came to view as very telling and reassuring. It was a traumatic process mostly because of the timing - we separated while I was inpatient for 6 weeks. All of my belongings were put in storage because our lease was up during this time. When I discharged - I moved back in with my parents. I did not know we were moving towards divorce yet at this time, though I knew that discussion would be on the table. I did not fault him for wanting some separation, it had been a wild year of instability and constant hospitalizations for me. I could not fault anyone for wanting a break from me. I focused on myself and my treatments and getting better. I wondered how anyone could ever love me. I felt so broken. But I moved on and worked on healing and I simply lived my life. I had a friend that knew my backstory and we became close. After my divorce was finalized, when I was feeling really healthy, we started dating. I wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship. It just happened naturally, and happened to happen with someone that I didn\u2019t have to spend a lot of time explaining myself to or hiding myself from. It didn\u2019t last and there were some elements of heartbreak.  For me personally, I don\u2019t think a situational depression can ever compare to an unrelenting deep organic one, and this knowledge comforts me. I know the difference.

At that point I was ready to try it, traumatized by how bad things had gotten, that any fears didn\u2019t really get in the way. I was concerned about memory problems but was assured we would try an alternative electrode placement first that would minimize stress on my hippocampus and should translate into fewer side effects. I\u2019m a big wuss when it comes to IVs and am a hard stick which it worse, so we came up with a pre-sedation plan for my comfort. They also offered to set me up with a PICC line but that honestly seemed more terrible to me. 2. Positive - It finally put an end to a year of hell and misery. I am stable and healthy and in control. I am responsive to medication again. Negative - It required a few tweaks to get right. I ended up needing to do bitemporal treatments with ketamine anesthesia to enhance the quality of the seizures. I needed a longer acute series with maintenance treatments thereafter. Overall, I had 29 treatments last year. My memory absolutely suffered and it was not immediately obvious to me. It\u2019s a concern as I struggle to retrieve autobiographical material for use with prospective employers. Or hell, dates for that matter.

I am diagnosed with c-PTSD and consider myself in remission. My symptoms seem to have gone away since my second set of ECTs last July. However, I was also in a PHP for much of last year and was working closely with a trauma therapist - so it may be that the work we did just finally clicked.

{"e6v0k1n": {"text": "The drugs that cause the bulk of the issues are going to be the serotonergic antidepressants. Serotonergic upregulation works against the pathways that control healthy sexual function. These agents are best avoided in the treatment of bipolar disorder anyway. If they cannot be avoided, opting for less serotonergic options tends to minimize symptoms. Trazodone or mirtazapine are good alternative options. They are often used to regulate sleep / treat insomnia and provide some antidepressant therapy. They do not cause sexual dysfunction and can in fact be used to treat it. There are studies on [mirtazapine augmentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3079186/) of SSRI treatment to target sexual dysfunction. Buproprion is an NDRI. Its dopaminergic qualities can enhance desire, arousal, and orgasm. But sometimes bupropion is too activating for bipolar folks. Regarding antipsychotic mood stabilizers, they can cause some sexual dysfunction, too, due to their dopamine antagonism. The biggest culprits here are going to be the compounds that are capable of raising prolactin levels as this has a downstream impact on sex hormone levels in the body. Risperidone and olanzapine are two major offenders in this category. Possible options include to reduce dose, treat with cabergoline, or switch to an alternative, prolactin-sparing antipsychotic. There is less info on the traditional mood stabilizers. They seem to make less of an impact. The only suggestion was to possibly avoid enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants which would include carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate.

I did not have one and it was confirmed to be due to the medication. I ended up having to take cabergoline for a few weeks which is the medication they use to shrink prolactinomas. This corrects your prolactin elevation and symptoms and brings things back to normal. The endocrinologist will likely guide you through this process. Perhaps your prolactin elevation is not giving you noticeable symptoms yet - but it was really uncomfortable to deal with for me personally and it can lead to other hormonal problems and issues such as rapid weight gain. I felt it was in my best interest to correct the problem immediately as directed. D2 receptor blockade by antipsychotics is the mechanism through which prolactin elevation can be triggered and all antipsychotics have this mechanism to some extent. However, typical and atypical antipsychotics have different affinities for the D2 receptor. As a result, they all pose different levels of risk for causing this side effect. The medication risperidone is notorious for causing hyperprolactinemia because it is so potent, whereas aripiprazole hardly ever causes it because it is actually a partial agonist at the D2 receptor. Quetiapine is another one with low rates of occurrence.  If you are uncomfortable about discontinuing your medication you may want to ask your pdoc about switching you to one of the partial agonist atypical antipsychotics like aripiprazole (Abilify) as it has been shown that switching patients over to this medication from the offending one could correct the prolactin elevation.

{"e5ios8x": {"text": "I am no stranger to depressive birthdays. Last year I was in the throes of psychotic depression getting titrated on Clozaril and doing ECT for the third time. I spent my birthday in the hospital. I was hospitalized for 6 weeks and saw my marriage crumble. How did I get there? I thought they had \u201cfixed\u201d me before? They had repaired my brain enough to allow me to finish my PhD and eventually find a great job in my field. I was about to turn 30 years old and I was stable and happy. My husband had planned a big celebratory birthday bash for me - an archery tag outing with all of our closest family and friends. It was a blast. But then it all came crumbling apart despite my best efforts anyway. I lost the job. I lost the husband. I lost the social life I once knew. But I didn\u2019t lose my sanity. And my spirit found its way back home. I\u2019ve learned to be more pragmatic as I\u2019ve gotten older. There\u2019s no use in beating yourself up over what you do or don\u2019t have. It does help to learn to enjoy what is available to you. It does help to learn how to make changes that spark joy - however small or large they may be. It\u2019s good to remember that progress and change takes time and is rarely immediate. It\u2019s important to consider your circumstances and reality and have compassion. It\u2019s helped me to have a timeline. I had to move in with my parents after I got out of the hospital and continued treatment and dealt with my pending divorce. I decided after some time that my days needed more structure and I needed to think ahead and consider needs like health insurance. I needed a job but acknowledged to myself that I was probably not mentally ready to get a \u201creal\u201d career job in my field yet. I have been a star (over)achiever my entire life and while this is certainly not where I saw myself at this stage in my life, I encouraged myself to feel proud of my decision. I was taking care of myself and ultimately that\u2019s what matters most. After a few months, I felt like I was ready to move on my own. I took the job with the understanding that I\u2019d do it for about a year until I felt I had been stable enough and felt ready to look for alternate work. I\u2019ve been at the current job about 9 months and lately have been having more stress about life and finances. It would be easy to sink into despair over how I have done irreparable damage to my life and career, but the truth is, I don\u2019t know that until I try to make a change. And in interacting with people out in the \u201creal\u201d world, people seem to respond and respect small doses of honesty when encountering people who are out there reclaiming themselves. So I worry less lately. When I notice myself feeling distressed and upset, I consider that my body\u2019s way of telling me to pay attention. It may be time to take a deep breath and try something new. This birthday I had some time to take off work last-minute but I didn\u2019t want to stay in town and be boring.

It's thought that small doses of lithium may be protective for at-risk populations, but more research is needed. It is not known if these small doses of lithium orotate are going to be sufficient to have any mood benefits. A 120 mg dose of lithium orotate has only 5 mg of elemental lithium, which is about 5 times less than the smallest dose of lithium available - the 150 mg lithium carbonate capsule which has 28 mg of elemental lithium. &amp;#x200B;Interestingly, this article mentions that there was a study done with lithium orotate that was looking at using it at full bipolar doses and found that the orotate form is actually more damaging to the kidneys. This seems to suggest that the carbonate form, which we have been using for over 50 years, may be safer and the preferred delivery method. Although you may be planning to take a smaller dose, you don't know how the orotate form is going to affect your body because it has not been studied much.

Going for a walk somewhere is great. Make sure you\u2019re sleeping. If you\u2019re having trouble sleeping, make a solid effort to practice good sleep hygiene for a while and consider whether you need a sleep study to be evaluated for sleep apnea or a sleep disorder. There\u2019s apps that can help you track your sleep and work with devices like smart watches and FitBits. If you\u2019re still having trouble, aberrant circadian rhythms are pretty typical for bipolar patients. Finding a medication that can help you manage your sleep could be warranted. Talk to your doctor. I was using a combination of Ativan and hydroxyzine at bedtime but recently switched to Seroquel and baclofen. Sleep is precious. 2. I have had success with antidepressants that are known to work better on low energy, atypical depressions marked by hypersomnia. The best for me was an MAOI, Emsam (selegiline).

I just had had to discontinue Clozaril due to side effects so my doctors treated the akathisia with extra Ativan and that made it tolerable. Over time, the akathisia eventually went away. There was also some intermittent startup nausea. Taking the medication with a fuller meal vs. the minimum calorie requirement helps soften this symptom. I found that most of the issues I experienced eased up with time. It would help to emphasize this to a new patient. It would help to be ready to deal with akathisia or to counsel a patient on OTC remedies they can take advantage of until they can talk to you (e.g. diphenhydramine). I do find Latuda works surprisingly well at raising the floor for my depressions. Even when I go through shaky periods with some cycling, it has kept me from bottoming out. For periods of emergent mania, my doctor has me increase my dose from 80 to 120 mg for a few days until I\u2019m sleeping normally again and the disturbance passes. This strategy has helped keep me stable and out of trouble remarkably well. I really appreciate that Latuda is weight neutral and isn\u2019t causing any metabolic issues.

I felt a notable improvement in my depressive episodes as a result. My endocrinologist would tinker as needed and treated me with a combination of T4 and T3. Years later, my manic episodes peaked and I finally saw a psychiatrist. I experienced a particularly unstable year recently marked by rapid cycling necessitating some time on Clozaril and ECT treatments. During this time my psychiatrist decided to further increase the amount of T3 I was receiving. My TSH would suggest I should be a jittery, hyperthyroid mess, but I feel completely normal (TSH ~ 0.1). It has allowed us to avoid using traditional antidepressants to treat the lows which always came with the eventual risk of inciting mania. I was told that my thyroid history may be contributing to my rapid cycling course. Thankfully, things seem to have finally quieted down.  My psychiatrist and the other inpatient psychiatrists at the hospital I have been treated at seem pretty familiar with this approach. The extent to which they will push the TSH may vary based on whether the patient already has underlying thyroid disease and the severity of their (mental) illness. I think they are less hesitant to push the treatment further for patients that already have something going on with their thyroid. ", "link_id": "t3_96v57m", "time": 1534303228}}

{"e45pku5": {"text": "I had 29 treatments done last year. The first 6 were done during a hospitalization following a suicide attempt. That was my third hospitalization within a two month span. After that I was stable for about four months. I was hospitalized for a manic episode and then the following month had to be hospitalized for a depressive episode. I was treated with another series of 6 treatments. They were LART or left anterior - right temporal electrode placements. Allegedly they are supposed to cause fewer memory problems than a bilateral placement but have slightly greater efficacy than a unilateral placement. Unfortunately about two weeks later I was back in the hospital. This time I was put on Clozaril and we decided to switch to bilateral ECTs. I did 8 acute treatments while inpatient for 6 weeks and continued weekly maintenance treatments for 9 weeks. It turned my life around and finally helped me get out of that horrid rapid cycling nightmare. Yes, my memory was fried, but I honestly see that as a gift in a way - being spared the memory of all the pain and agony of my lowest moments. The ECTs themselves didn't scare me but I am a total wuss when it comes to IVs. I don't mind blood draw or blood or needles - but there's something about needles and tubes that just makes my skin crawl. Plus it really, REALLY doesn't help that it's impossible to find a good vein on me. I don't know why nurses think it's a good idea to ask an anxious patient, \"Has anybody ever asked you if you're a hard stick?\" YOUR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IS NOT HELPING, LADY. Ugh. It was so bad this one time. They tried FOUR TIMES to get an IV going for ECT. I was beside myself. The anesthesiologist came over eventually while I was sobbing and asked me if he could look at my foot... NO!!!! The psychiatrist felt really bad for all the torture and said okay, that was enough, we weren't going to do the treatment. But this upset me more. So the anesthesiologist asked if he could look at my hand and he said he found a vein by my knuckle that would work. I asked him if he was positive it would work. He said yes. So I hesitantly agreed. They did not hesitate because they didn't want me to change my mind. I didn't realize just how terribly painful inserting an IV against a vein on a bone was going to be.... it was some of the worst pain I've ever experienced. As soon as the IV was functional enough they started pushing the ketamine to knock me out because I was WAILING. Awful. After that incident they put a note in my chart to make sure to use the smaller IV kit they use on kids because my veins twitch so much. I told my pdoc upfront that if I was going to do ECT regularly we were going to have to figure out a way to manage my anxiety. The solution - 25 mg of Thorazine before each treatment. Couldn't have done it without something to take the edge off, haha. And a tip for the uninitiated... ask for a pair of disposable underwear (or don't wear any).

At these doses I don't get too bad of a hangover / my stimulants manage to deal with it. Temazepam 30 mg was also pretty decent for keeping me from constantly waking all night.

Are you looking for it to sedate you? If so, it takes closer to 1.5 hrs for it to reach peak concentration at which point it should be pretty sedating. This is probably why waiting a little longer, like one hour after dosing, made it feel more sedating. After 6 hours, ~50% of the medication will still be in your system. After ~12 hours, 25% of the medication will still be in your system. Taking a lower dose and waiting more time for it to make you sleepy can be one way to minimize the morning hangover. That feeling will also get better over time as you get used to the medicine. Another option is to give yourself an earlier bedtime and a little bit more more time to sleep initially as you get adjusted. A third option is to switch to the XR version of the drug.

If my insomnia is being caused by agitation, anxiety, or mania - I will take a higher dose of Ativan at bedtime to get me to sleep. If that\u2019s not cutting it - I will take it with Vistaril - an antihistamine agent that can enhance drowsiness and also help with anxiety. Either of these medications can also be used as needed alone at normal, smaller doses for breakthrough anxiety during the day which won\u2019t cause sedation. I also try to use the meds on an as needed basis so I don\u2019t build a tolerance.

I need something that is more reliably sedating that is just going to knock me out and doesn\u2019t need to relax me to promote sleep. Medications that have been helpful in this category for me are Seroquel, Saphris, and temazepam. Seroquel has made me black out before in the bathroom shortly after taking it and it can be hard to wake up and get going in the morning - it can be great for anxiety. Saphris gives me great reliable sleep and was a wonderful mood stabilizer but gave me prolactin elevation and rapid weight gain.

The extent to which it does varies by individual and can also depend on the type of ECT treatment being given, the frequency, the quantity, and other compounding factors (like the sleep quality issues you have mentioned and the nature of the mood episode itself). There are types of ECT electrode placements that can somewhat minimize the memory disturbances that are created. Some of the treatments I have received in the past were done this way with the LART (left anterior - right temporal) placement. It creates a different path for the current in your brain that minimizes its path through the hippocampus but still allows it to produce a robust seizure. Downsides are that its efficacy on mood are sometimes not as good and it can also cause a shifting motion of your jaw during the seizure that can leave you really sore since it's a little unbalanced. It didn't work as well for me as bitemporal and it still created memory problems. The upside about studying for something like the GRE is that you're not learning anything new per se - you're learning how to use skills you already know in a specific way for a specific style of test. With that said - there is still learning involved - because it helps to be able to learn, identify, recognize, and apply skills quickly in a controlled, timed setting. How many more treatments are you having? What type of treatments are they (electrode placement)? How often are you having them? With the test being a month away and you reporting that you haven't had much time to practice familiarizing yourself with the format - maybe you should consider postponing and focusing on your health and recovery.

The fact is - everything I take serves a function and helps me to function.  Other approaches have been tried and failed. It is what is, especially with the comorbid conditions. I'd love to see us share tips for good medication compliance. One tip I'll offer is that the coating on certain brands of medication capsules sometimes give off a different flavor and odor. I had this experience with Zonegran and it was awful, because my dosage requires me to take four large capsules at a time. Getting a single one down without gagging and potentially throwing it up was a challenge - the off-gassing was so intense! I asked my pharmacist to fill my next batch from a different manufacturer.

I was very hyperverbal and am normally much more reserved and was generally starting to look like I might be on drugs. At home, I was difficult to manage. My anxiety was unmanageable and easily triggered. I went four days without sleeping and would spend all night thinking there were bugs on my skin or that it was rotting and would pick at it. I was extremely agitated - in constant motion.  I had previously been severely depressed and was still on a potent MAOI antidepressant. It had never outright triggered cycling before but my husband scheduled an emergency appointment with my pdoc. My pdoc at first decided to halve the dosage but as I kept talking, it became apparent to him that the situation was more dire. He stopped it completely and had me suspend taking my stimulant (oddly for narcolepsy; apparently mania &gt;&gt;&gt; sleep disorder...).  I was beside myself and screamed at my pdoc and perhaps in a fleeting moment of self awareness asked him how this was not going to end in a catastrophic crash? Husband was instructed to keep watching me. I was on leave from work for the holidays. Things got worse and I got suicidal and was vocalizing it in a way that made it clear I was planning to hurt myself. Husband packed a pack for me told me to get in the car and took me to the ER and got me hospitalized. This would happen again in a similar fashion - husband would get concerned because I was either vocalizing things that made him worried or was severely non functional (not eating, an extreme of sleep or no sleep, etc). Other times I would be sitting in my pdocs office with a family member and would usually be nonverbal and void of emotion. This made my pdoc most nervous and he had me hospitalized immediately after a visit, mostly because he knew me well and he knew that that was when I was at my most dangerous in terms of my suicidal urges. I did have a suicide attempt last year and he did get to know me very well. I think mania is a bit easier to spot and know when that gets out of hand. Then finally, there was the one time that I was the one that decided I needed to be in the hospital. This was a huge hurdle to cross in terms of self awareness and shame and all things self denial and self loathing. I basically realized I was out of control and was in serious danger of hurting myself. I was not functioning and needed a serious medication review. I was hospitalized 8 times last year.

The ER handled this emergency very poorly and spent most of it covering their asses for liability for a potential subarachnoid hemorrhage after I spent a few hours writhing in pain wondering if my skull was going to pop open. Pity because the med was great and I was always VERY careful with my diet. 2) Constipation from Clozaril. I was hospitalized for an episode and happened to mention to the nurse that I couldn't remember my last bowel movement. I let it slip that it *may have been over a week or so...* So they took an X-ray of my abdomen and were horrified by what they saw. I was all but impacted.

I don't think Seroquel is particularly known for raising prolactin levels, but it can cause high prolactin levels directly or unmask them due to a pre-existing benign pituitary tumor. High prolactin levels can cause hormonal problems (they can make you lactate!) and they can also lead to weight gain. I had issues with this when I was on Zyprexa. An MRI ruled out a prolactinoma, but I was successfully treated for the high prolactin levels with the same medication they use to treat the tumor anyway - cabergoline.

I\u2019m treated with a combination of T4 and T3 thyroid hormones. A high dose of the latter is used for a sort of energizing antidepressant effect. During my last hospitalization my docs tinkered with my thyroid meds as much as they did with my psych meds. If I wind up seeming manic, it can be hard to definitely say if I\u2019m manic or if my hyperthyroid status is affecting my behavior. PCOS is another endocrine disorder that abnormally elevates androgenic activity. It can lead to hormonal acne, metabolic problems, infertility, and can influence mood - strongly predisposing one towards depression. I certainly feel like my depressions far outnumber my manias, and while this is normal, the rapid cycling course - the number of severe episodes per year - is not. PCOS has also influenced my treatment decisions for my bipolar disorder. Birth control - especially combination, estrogen-containing varieties - can greatly help with symptoms. Therefore, I am not comfortable taking medications that are known to interfere with birth control levels (e.g. Lamictal) or are known to make PCOS symptoms worse (e.g. Depakote). This somewhat limits the pool I\u2019m willing to work with. I am also diagnosed with narcolepsy. While I can have a tendency to fall asleep suddenly during the day and rather quickly at night - my nighttime sleep can be rather broken and fragmented and frustrating. Narcoleptics tend not to get enough restorative slow wave sleep which is theorized to fuel the sleep attacks. So you would think I would categorically avoid all sedating bipolar medications but this really is not that accurate. Nighttime sedation is highly desirable as long as it wears off by morning. I am prescribed stimulants for daytime use. We do have to be careful as they do not mix well with mania. I do have a tendency to go days without sleep when I am severely manic. I can\u2019t imagine the toll that takes on my body. If I can manage to hold onto a shred of insight as I\u2019m cycling up - I will stop taking the stimulants for a few days and double up on my antipsychotic per my pdoc\u2019s orders. The stimulants have helped me with some focus and attention issues as well. Finally, I suffer from terrible migraines. It feels like something is drilling its way out of my brain through my retinas. Popping my eyeballs and scooping them out of my head sounds like it\u2019d bring me some *relief* during these attacks. I suppose this history has somewhat influenced the meds my pdoc has chosen to treat me with. One of the anticonvulsant mood stabilizers he uses is Zonegran (zonisamide). It\u2019s pretty similar to Topamax (topiramate) in terms of its use for migraine prophylaxis but supposed to cause fewer cognitive side effects. It doesn\u2019t give me issues. It\u2019s been a staple drug in my cocktail for a while now and seems to work well for the depressive side - I guess it\u2019s kind of like \u2018my Lamictal\u2019. I was also recently put on a different antidepressant, amitriptyline, partially because it can help prevent migraines (and help promote sleep).  ", "link_id": "t3_8rzv0p", "time": 1529336051}}
{"e0v0sf2": {"text": "The best way out is always through. I have had a dreadfully unstable couple of years and I can relate - I felt completely stalled and stuck. What I didn\u2019t realize was the degree to which I was making things more difficult for myself. I was filled with self-loathing, dread, anger, and denial. During a crisis admission I eventually realized there were edges to my pain that were being unexplored. It was my 8th hospitalization that year. What was I doing wrong? What was I doing with my life?A few big things stood out:* **Self-compassion:** I really, really struggle with this. I suck at self-soothing. I find it helps me to imagine I am giving advice to a friend rather than to myself as a way to generate and then redirect that kindness toward myself. I think this skill is important to hone because it helps you deal with the reality of a situation that may be difficult to accept. I think this also extends to the ability to forgive yourself for the mistakes you make - particularly if you can commit to learning from them. *  **Acceptance:** You don\u2019t have to like the reality you are faced with - but in order to do something about it you do have to acknowledge that it is there. I think this was my fundamental flaw that was keeping me stuck - some form of denial. Accepting the severity of my illness allowed me to move forward and make big treatment decisions that ultimately enabled me to recover. I like some of the skills that ACT (Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy) teaches. * **Socialize:** Withdrawal and isolation are hugely taxing on a person. Depression convinces you that you are a burden but don\u2019t listen to its nonsense. Reach out to friend(s) as desired or needed. They want to be there for you. If that becomes too difficult even occasionally being in the company of strangers in a public place can be helpful. It\u2019s easy to get lost in our internal monologues - particularly when we are depressed. Interacting with others - while challenging at first - can ultimately bring our brains a much needed break as our focus gets redirected. * **Stoicism:** I really like this philosophy as it is a very practical view on life that is very much geared toward keeping one moving forward and unstuck. I highly recommend watching some of the YouTube videos out there with cartoons that explain some of its principles. If this is the life I\u2019ve been dealt, what can I do to make it as pleasant as possible? What is in my control? What is not? Who can assist me on this journey? Some things I asked myself that helped guide the way. And by no means were things easy. The road to wellness was rough. But between then and now... I had recently finished my 29th ECT treatment of that year. I was about to be hospitalized for another 9 days and have my medications completely overhauled. My husband of 8 years filed for divorce and I was still living with my parents. Six months later I\u2019m working and living on my own. There are definitely still bad days, however, I don\u2019t compound their unpleasantness by equating their presence with low self-worth. It is what it is. Instead, I have a plan in place to deal with the situation. It\u2019s definitely possible to change your perspective. ", "link_id": "t3_8rwg85", "time": 1529310831}}
{"e0uyyw2": {"text": "Not everyone is equally sensitive to the mechanism through which Seroquel exerts its sedative effect. This is done through antagonism of the H1 histamine receptor; Seroquel can act like an antihistamine - and not everyone reacts the same way to a dose of Benadryl. It\u2019s also possible you metabolize the drug faster, preventing it from building up to a concentration needed to maintain H1 antagonism. If you were to take a look at the numbers and break down the binding affinities of each of the antipsychotics for the H1 receptor, interestingly Seroquel wouldn\u2019t come first. Clozaril and Zyprexa would technically be way ahead. But there\u2019s more to the story. You also have to consider the drug\u2019s potency. Zyprexa is more potent than Seroquel because typically it only requires a dose of 15-30 mg to exert an antipsychotic effect vs. 300-800 mg of the latter. This will also influence the degree to which the H1 receptor is occupied with drug. A high potency drug that has high affinity for the H1 receptor can possibly be dosed such that the sedation experienced by the treated population winds up being reported lower than a low potency, medium affinity drug (like Seroquel) that winds up needing to be dosed higher to exert an antipsychotic effect. So what can you do? Talk to your doctor. See if increasing your current dose is warranted. If it\u2019s working for you therapeutically, there\u2019s probably no point in switching - but trying a high dose of a high potency antipsychotic like Zyprexa could be worth a shot. A third option would be to exploit an entirely different mechanism to address your sleep concerns with an add-on med. Finally, and others have brought this up as well,  you may need to ask yourself if it\u2019s possible you may currently still be cycling. The insomnia may be a reflection of your current mood state. You may need to give it some more time. Follow up with your doctor. ", "link_id": "t3_8rwbdx", "time": 1529306706}}

I was always putting a lot of high expectations on myself and was a high achiever. I thought I knew who I was when I faced a cancer diagnosis at 19. I thought I knew who I was when I had to deal with the secret reality of being an undocumented immigrant through no choice of my own and what that meant for my goals and dreams. Things started to get shaky with my self-identity in grad school. Working on my PhD gave me a terrible case of imposter syndrome and I became increasingly more symptomatic in regards to my bipolar.

I spent 1/3rd of the year that followed hospitalized. I think the trials of recent years made me forget a character trait that I never liked to be associated with: resilience. I always felt there was this implication that there was always going to be a great struggle for the resilient individual, and I was so incredibly tired of having to deal with so much. I\u2019ve been trying to read more about the philosophy of stoicism to kind of change my perspective on the matter, so that I can use my natural resilience as a practical strength and apply it as needed as opposed to feeling like it\u2019s going to allow the floodgates to open.

I'd give it some more time but if it continues go ahead and ask your pdoc to switch you back over to the capsules. Usually when people are being titrated on lithium they are titrated with the IR capsules and then switched over to the CR tablets once they find a stable dose. This is not a hard and fast rule. It might be slightly more useful to titrate with the capsules simply because there's more control over the dose as each capsule is only 300 mg. However, usually you can titrate more *quickly* with the capsules which might translate to more side effects. Everyone reacts a little differently. I'm glad you're feeling better. Keep in mind that Litho**bid** is designed to be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible.", "link_id": "t3_8nxvx3", "time": 1527918111}}
{"dzzc3na": {"text": "This is the first I'm hearing about this all or nothing Latuda statistic. I have had a difficult course of illness and have been on well over 20 different medications. I'm been on clozapine and have had 29 ECT treatments last year. I've given up hope plenty of times. But I've kind of changed my perspective on what it means to be stable and what it looks like. I no longer expect to find that magic cocktail of drugs and to be symptom free for years at a time. My illness is simply too fluid for that. Over time my doctors and I have learned which strategies work better than others. I've learned to communicate better, to be more honest with myself, and to notify my treatment team at the first sign of possible cycling so that we can stay ahead of any catastrophes. This strategy has finally seemed to put an end to a long period of instability - I was in and out of inpatient 8 times last year. I've finally reached a new milestone - 6 months with no hospitalizations. I feel like the nightmare is finally ending. And yet. I've been depressed since. I've been manic since. But it's all been immediately and aggressively managed with emergency medications and tweaks to my current medications as needs arise. Could I dwell on always being unstable? Absolutely - and I have in the past, wondering why my bed wasn't a coffin, crying myself to sleep, looking for an end to my pain, and almost succeeding in this endeavor... Consider the fact that you've been here before and you know that your brain is probably lying to you to make you think and feel this way. Consider the fact that nothing in life is fair - no one asks for the challenges they are given. I found that once I was willing to embrace the truth and my reality - I was less paralyzed to take action. Yes, there is no cure. This is a chronic illness that is managed, like so many others out there. Proper treatment might mean letting go off expectations for a static medication list - and treating symptoms as they wax and wane over time to get the best results. Proper treatment might mean not giving much weight to the opinions of a therapist when it comes to patients' medication management and response and making it a priority to build a medical team you can literally trust with your life.    For the record, I currently take Latuda. It's about the only antipsychotic I hadn't thoroughly trialed yet. And I take lithium. And Zonegran. And Zoloft. And PRN Ativan &amp; hydroxyzine. Latuda gets doubled from 60 mg to 120 mg if I'm manic and/or not sleeping and trending manic. I also have narcolepsy, PCOS, and post-surgical hypothyroidism due to thyroid cancer for which I take Adderall XR, spironolactone, metformin, levothyroxine, and liothyronine, respectively. I highly recommend watching some Youtube videos on the philosophy of stoicism. It can be a very helping coping perspective for all the crap that life throws our way. You can do this.

{"dzzakc4": {"text": "Hi there - I'm currently working as a pharmacy technician. Both Lithobid or the ER/CR lithium and immediate release versions contain the same amount of lithium per pill, they just will cause different peak serum lithium concentrations - with the controlled release versions resulting in lower peak levels and perhaps translating to fewer associated symptoms such as tremors or shakes. Crushing or splitting ER/CR pills prevents them from dissolving in the controlled manner they were designed for - and these lower peak serum concentrations they generally provide can no longer be guaranteed. This may be why you're feeling a little off - you may be experiencing a transient concentration spike. The good news is you're not getting more lithium, you're just getting it more quickly. It's highly unlikely this dose would bring you into toxic territory. I would try to leave a message for someone at your doctor's office for peace of mind. One of the staff or nurses should get back to you if your doctor cannot. If I were you I'd just start over with the titration schedule my doctor originally recommended. Taking the tablets whole should help you feel better by not causing those concentration spikes.  ", "link_id": "t3_8nxvx3", "time": 1527914456}}

{"dzk6dpa": {"text": "Thanks for sharing your story. I was diagnosed with metastatic thyroid cancer a few years before my bipolar disorder diagnosis became official when I was 19 and in my first year of college. I had a total thyroidectomy and an aggressive radiation treatment to ablate residual cells. I had to ingest radioactive iodine and sleep isolated in a plastic covered room then remain isolated from people for another two weeks at home as I was now giving off radiation that could make others sick. It was a very strange and lonely time, but I was lucky in that I had a great surgeon. My illness was complicated by the fact that I had Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis upon diagnosis and carried antibodies that makes it hard to rely upon the tumor marker typically used for monitoring. I was put on thyroid replacement hormone which affects so many systems in the body - and is highly influential upon emotional and anxiety states - complicating my bipolar. I take a combination of T4 and T3 hormones and have had better results with that. I recently have had a dose increase of my T3 into kind of a hypermetabolic territory as it was an approach used by my psychiatric team to see if it would help contribute to stabilizing me when I was hospitalized for an episode.

{"dz6c32p": {"text": "I\u2019m 31 and have dealt with acne, at times severe, cystic, impacting both face and body, on and off since my early teens. I can certainly relate to the frustration of *still* having to deal with flares as I got older. I would also highly recommend  if you are looking for a good resource for product and routine suggestions. Since it sounds like your skin is probably somewhat dehydrated, I would stay away from harsh, stripping products. Interestingly, this would probably include any drugstore face washes marketed towards acne. The objective of your face wash should be to cleanse your face of excess oil, dirt, and ideally makeup. I\u2019ve always really enjoyed using:[Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel](https://www.mariobadescu.com/product/enzyme-cleansing-gel)It didn\u2019t dry me out and I liked that it had AHA - it seemed like just the right amount of an exfoliating ingredient to help unclog pores without being irritating. I liked it much better than standard recommendations for Cetaphil or Cerave. The former felt too drying and I seem to be sensitive to some ingredient in Cerave products because they invariably seem to make me break out *more*. However, my face wash was not very good at removing makeup and it seems that most face washes suck at this task. I thought this might be causing problems for me so I started trying out the double cleanse method - first experimenting with micellar waters, cleansing oils, or cleansing balms and following up with my chosen cleanser in the second step to remove the oily residue. I admit I was scared to actively be applying oils to my face even if I was going to be removing them. But you know what? My face never felt so clean and happy! It dawned on me that my poor skin was probably screaming for hydration. So I read up on Korean beauty products and regimens and researched posts on  (which I would also highly recommend). At this point I\u2019ve tried out a few different serums, hydrating toners, and sleeping packs. I layer these products in lieu of a typical lotion or cream moisturizer (I do top off with sunscreen in the morning). When I\u2019m feeling lazy I just use this hydrating toner which feels like a runny serum:[KLAIRS Supple Preparation Facial Toner](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PGOFYG0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_twN.AbEZCEZS5)This is my holy grail skin care product. I cherish it more than my scattered tubes of clindamycin, Differin, and tretinoin which have all been collecting dust. I apply after I wash to replenish moisture. It\u2019s very high in sodium hyaluronate and beta-glucan which are great hydrating ingredients to look out for. Since incorporating this routine my skin has been transformed. It gradually stopped producing as much oil as it normally used to to the extent that I think I can\u2019t even classify my skin as combination/oily anymore. It\u2019s just... normal. I don\u2019t soak through 5 sheets of blotting paper several times a day. *I don\u2019t even own blotting paper anymore.*  So there you go. That\u2019s my big shout out to the power of hydration, fixing your moisture barrier, and Korean skincare \ud83e\udd23I know this has already been a novel, but this issue is dear to my heart so I thought I\u2019d share a few more parting thoughts and suggestions:* Lithium induces the production of neutrophils in the body which can trigger inflammation in the skin. This is why a variety of inflammatory skin conditions like acne, psoriasis, and follicultis can be lithium-induced. One strategy is to switch from lithium if you can. If lithium has been highly effective a dose reduction might be considered. I was maintained on a higher dose during a manic episode (1.2 mEq/L) and this triggered a cystic nightmare on my face, chest, back, and shoulders. My skin improved with the help of a derm but it did not return to its typical state until I got off lithium. Lithium was later reintroduced after my skin went through its apparent \u201ctransformation\u201d when I switched to a more hydrating skin regimen. It was also reintroduced at a much lower dose than before as an add-on to my cocktail of meds as a precaution. * I was on a course of doxycycline for a few months alongside tretinoin and topical clindamycin to no avail. Derm switched me to a high dose course of Bactrim DS which proved to be impressively helpful. I don\u2019t often hear this antibiotic mentioned with respect to acne but it *worked*. I wasn\u2019t completely clear by any stretch of the imagination but the cystic breakouts were finally under control. I was thankful given that one of the cysts on my back ended up having to be surgically removed and I couldn\u2019t deal with this nonsense anymore. Typically my standard skin treatments had always been Differin and clindamycin gel for maintenance.  If I needed something stronger I would swap in tretinoin/Retin-A. Since my skin has stopped being problematic, I\u2019ve stopped using the retinoids and just use clindamycin as a spot treatment as needed. This has been good as it has been exposing my skin to much less irritation (at the expense of missing out on the anti-aging benefits... I may rotate it in occasionally).* Lithium tends to exacerbate underlying conditions. *This is really important. *Were you dealing with any (maybe milder?) facial acne before you started the lithium? Was it sporadic? Did it maybe seem more hormonal? The answer may help to reveal which treatment approach may work best. If you already had an underlying case of common acne vulgaris that got worse, the derm will be a great resource and some of the meds I\u2019ve already mentioned are likely to help. If your breakouts seem more hormonal, make sure to bring this up at your appointment. Throughout my years of suffering, I finally came to learn that my issues were exacerbated by PCOS thanks to my endocrinologist and gynecologist. I was prescribed spironolactone and also use hormonal birth control. Spiro reduces levels of androgenic hormones in the body that trigger symptoms such as acne. Lower doses can be very helpful to women with acne who don\u2019t necessarily present with PCOS as well, as it acts to reduce sebaceous gland activity. Spiro has helped me (and a few of my friends) a lot and I\u2019d discuss it with the derm. It can slightly increase lithium levels but I take a high dose and it hasn\u2019t caused an issue. * You mentioned you\u2019re seeing a derm but if you\u2019re not a fan or if it\u2019s not cost effective - another option might be to look into a telemedicine service like [Curology](https://curology.com). I\u2019ve used it before and it\u2019s actually a really nice service. I\u2019d recommend it more for when you know what your skin likes to streamline your routine.

{"dy3sdxu": {"text": "I have gained weight from two different antipsychotics - Saphris and Clozaril. Each time I gained around 30-40 lbs very rapidly. Certain antipsychotics can cause a metabolic syndrome to occur during which the weight gain increases out of proportion with any perceived increase with food intake. Some of this is caused by changes in glucose metabolism. Clozaril basically made me prediabetic - my fasting glucose levels became extremely elevated.  However, both of these medications did also increase my appetite - it was just not apparent to me at the time that it was happening - I was oblivious. Once I was taken off the medications, the weight did gradually start to come off - but that was mainly because of the impact discontinuing the medication had on my caloric intake. At that point, I had also snapped out of my episode and become more self-aware and to speed up the weight loss decided to follow a more calorie restrictive meal plan. I was not very strict about it the second time around, but I had less weight to lose. The second time around I didn't track all of my calories for the day with MyFitnessPal - I simply practiced better portion control. However, MyFitnessPal and calorie counting was a great tool and it helped me lose close to 50 lbs. The other thing that helped with the weight management was that my pdoc prescribed metformin - a medication typically used in type 2 diabetes to manage glucose production and insulin sensitivity. I really think it made a big difference - the weight seemed to start coming off without too much extra effort on my end. You may want to talk to your pdoc about your concerns and maybe express a desire to get some bloodwork done.

My migraines have also been more frequent which has been annoying since my Zonegran is supposed to be both a mood stabilizer and a prophylactic. Saw my pdoc Saturday and we had a good long chat. I told him I felt that the Zonegran - which has always helped me in the past - was maybe not a robust enough mood stabilizer alone for my needs.

I got stable on new meds and continued relying on my best friends for support, trying my best to not isolate and withdraw.   My divorce was finalized last week. It was not an easy journey but it is a survivable one. A male friend of mine visited me in the hospital this last time I was there. I was struck by his... courage?... to enter such a strange environment. He had seen me in pretty vulnerable states before so I figured why not. I always suspected there were feelings there but he was a gentleman and I always denied any possibility that I could ever find love \u201cagain\u201d due to my deeply planted and confused shame and self-loathing. Well... turns out my instincts were correct. We had an amazing date a few days ago. I didn\u2019t think I really believed passionate love existed or could be communicated but I was very very very much disproven. One thing\u2019s certain - I may have indeed been wrong about the kind of man I needed in my life. It is so refreshing to be with someone who isn\u2019t afraid to ask me how I feel and can be vulnerable themselves. I didn\u2019t think something like this would happen so soon - or - ever...Don\u2019t deny yourselves positive change and hope. It\u2019s there and you\u2019re worth it.

We\u2019ve found that sometimes turning back to something that used to work will work again until it doesn\u2019t, so at least there is an identified pool of candidates to choose from. I think moving forward we are discovering that preventing these breakdowns requires regular monitoring and acting quickly with emergency/temporary/extra medication(s) to halt an episode from spiraling before I reach that nonfunctional unresponsive point. It\u2019s required some time to form a solid and trusting therapeutic alliance with my pdoc to finally be able to identify and speak up and let them know things are escalating before that tipping point or believe them and self monitor and report when they say they are worried with regard to possible brewing mania. It\u2019s also required a bit of a psychological attitude adjustment. You have to know there are things that are out there that will work as needed to get things under control even if they come with unsavory side effects for a brief period.

The dextroamphetamine helps with fatigue from bipolar and sedation from bipolar meds but is mainly there because I am also diagnosed with narcolepsy. The hydroxyzine and Ativan help with anxiety or agitation associated with bipolar episodes, generalized anxiety, insomnia, etc. I use the hydroxyzine if I just need to cool down a little with little risk of sedation and use the Ativan if I need some sedation or if I am hypo/manic and I\u2019m unlikely to get sedated anyway. The levothyroxine and liothyronine are there for post surgical hypothyroidism due to thyroid cancer.

{"dtfbbz9": {"text": "ECT can be life changing. I would encourage you to talk to a physician who offers it. It sounds like you\u2019ve tried many pharmacological offerings, and some opt for ECT not merely out of med failures but for other reasons that make it difficult to tolerate a med regimen. It\u2019s safe to use in pregnancy. I suffer from Bipolar I and have had 29 treatments over the course of the last year. My illness was quite severe and I was extremely unstable and wasn\u2019t having much sustained success with various med regimens. At one point I was on Clozaril (clozapine) and even ended up combining that with ECT for optimal results. ECT works best for crippling, life threatening depressions. Usually you will see results after 4-5 treatments, and an initial series of 6-12 treatments is typical and can get you back on your feet. With that said, it\u2019s clear you suffer from a chronic illness. It\u2019s possible to do maintenance ECT treatments. I did this on a weekly basis for a few months after an initially acute series of 8 treatments that had been done 3x a week. The weekly treatments kept me going and kept me functional and kept the depression and chaotic cycling at bay. With that said, I could tell that the effects of the treatments were dramatically fading toward the end of each week. This varies for everyone, but in speaking with others on the unit undergoing treatment during hospitalizations, I have found that I am not alone in this sentiment which is unfortunate and frustrating. However, some have luck with stretching maintenance sessions to once a month or even less frequently. I envy those people. I would encourage you to do your homework on the different techniques that can be used. Electrodes can be applied unilaterally or bilaterally, bifrontally or bitemporally, each with different efficacies and side effects. Bilateral methods are more effective but affect the hippocampus more and can cause more cognitive and especially memory problems, but they typically produce the best results. Some docs like to start with unilateral techniques and gauge response before moving onto bilateral treatments. My doc started with an even different variation called LART (left anterior right temporal) that\u2019s sort of in between that causes less side effects because it doesn\u2019t allow a straight path through the hippocampus. It didn\u2019t work for long and hurt my jaw during one treatment so we ended up switching to bitemporal. I went from a year of constant mania and depression, job loss, a suicide attempt that had me on a ventilator in the ICU, separation and divorce of a 9 yr marriage, moving back in with my parents, 8 inpatient hospitalizations, to finally being able to start turning my life around. In Aug/Sept I spent 6 weeks inpatient then continued weekly maintenance ECT. Three weeks in, I decided to look for a job because I wanted something to do besides just therapy. Five weeks in, I was hired. Six weeks in, I bought a car. I continued treatments for 9 weeks and was doing well, at which point I started my new job. I had to stop ECT at that point because the treatments were on weekdays and my work schedule didn\u2019t accommodate it. Plus, I felt fine. My pdoc was a tad concerned, but went along with it because things really did seem great and he was happy for me. He just was keenly aware how quickly things can turn for me. When will I learn to finally listen to his intuition? I started cycling within about two weeks. I became very unstable. But I had good social supports and refused to withdraw and isolate which usually were the final requirements to throw me over the edge into dangerous insanity. I tried. I tried so hard. I had told myself at some point that I was never going back to the hospital. At an appointment in December my pdoc was concerned and urged me to go to an ER if I got any worse. \u201cNo suicide attempts,\u201d he commanded. I couldn\u2019t get his words to stop repeating in my head so I gave in and stopped myself and did the right thing. I admitted myself just after Christmas. I stayed for a little over a week. In retrospect I was so proud of myself. Meds got switched around which was going to be medically necessary at some point, anyway. Clozapine is hard on the body. I share that last part with you for a few reasons. ECT is rarely a cure all. Very few people manage to use it without any type of medication regimen once they are done since most people who are candidates for ECT are not dealing with single episodes but recurrent ones. It\u2019s best as an acute treatment. I found ECT helped me respond to medications *better*, and I was so grateful for this effect. ECT may not work well initially and may need tweaking. Electrode placement is one thing. We even switched anesthetics to ketamine to see if that would help me get a better response. What I\u2019m hoping to convey is that even ECT, like medication, may take some trial and error. But in the end I\u2019m grateful that psychiatry has such an effective and reliable tool. It can be difficult to notice/appreciate a change or the drama of the change in yourself. I\u2019ve seen others undergo ECT and seeing the change in others firsthand has been remarkable. The memory issues stemming from ECT are significant, especially if you are undergoing a higher number of treatments over a prolonged time. Initially, one may not notice this effect. In fact, it is a hidden blessing. At times I have felt that ECTs initially efficacy stems from the fact that it helps you forget the horror of your pain and suffering and offers you some relief as it enables you to thrust yourself and your mind more easily into the present and your surroundings. I find that rumination goes down and I\u2019m more interested in people and gradually become more social after weeks or months of withdrawal and isolation. It\u2019s only during these interactions with friends or family that I came to realize that I either don\u2019t remember something that they are talking about or am retelling a story that I don\u2019t remember telling. It\u2019s confusing at first. Sometimes, talking through the memory can help bring it back, but other times, it\u2019s really, really hard to retrieve. I have found that random things in the last 2 years especially are hard to remember. I can\u2019t recreate the month before I started the bitemporal ECT (8 acute + 9 maintenance) at all. I know I was hospitalized during that month and has also had some ECT during it (6 acute LART). Don\u2019t remember that month at all. This scares a lot of people away from ECT.  But I have to counter and ask: Is this really such a bad thing? Do I want to remember that month? Not really. I was miserable and in total mental anguish. I was hospitalized and bored. As I recovered maybe there were some good interactions. Visits from friends. My best friend gifted me a hilarious book of cartoons about life and depression when she came to visit. I recently found it on my bookshelf and started thumbing through it. I totally forgot I had it  and forgot where it came from and reading it a second time was like reading it for the first. Is that just an awful thing? It was great! And movies? I\u2019ve never been able to remember movie plots anyway... hahaha! Longer term memories have been kind of jumbled and difficult to retrieve and order in my brain which is more frustrating. I have traveled a lot over the years and recently recall asking my soon to be ex-husband if I\u2019ve ever been in Germany. I had a feeling we were but I wasn\u2019t sure. It was a very, very odd feeling. He reminded me about the trip we took like 5-6 years ago. It\u2019s very hard to remember. I didn\u2019t think ECT was supposed to affect memories that far back, but who knows. Things do come back with time, some prompting and reminding and cues, especially photos - but it\u2019s definitely a weird feeling. It may just partially be me. I never had a great memory for events, autobiographical or not. In terms of memory for things like short term memory, I haven\u2019t found that to be so bad. It\u2019s more so memory retrieval for more distant storage that seems a bit challenging. And mental math has suffered which is the main cognitive effect I have experienced, followed by some word finding difficulties, but some of the later could be due to a medication I take. Finally, I would also encourage you to reconsider your stance on antipsychotics. They can be very powerful and helpful when coupled with antidepressants. I especially would encourage you to look into the dopamine partial agonists like aripiprazole (Abilify) or the newer additions Rexulti and Vraylar. Not known for weight gain at the low doses needed for augmentation in unipolar depression. The latter two have lower rates of akathisia. Lithium is known to be a good augmentation strategy in unipolar depression. You may need to pause it for ECT. I saw a study recently showing that it [dramatically reduces rates of re-hospitalization](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/881537).Sorry for the extremely lengthy reply! I just feel very strongly for those who are in a place to consider ECT and had to share. Please PM me if you ever want to chat. **TLDR**; Worth it? Absolutely.

Have you ever been inpatient? Have you ever done an IOP or PHP? It's unclear to me from your post. But my advice would be to start with something more acute and shorter term than jumping straight into a residential program. Inpatient could be useful if you need a (relatively) quick medication overhaul. My typical stays were about two weeks, whether or not that also included doing ECT. This would minimize the amount of time you are away from work, and most importantly, offer you immediate safety and change.  An intensive outpatient program (IOP) or partial hospitalization program (PHP) offer basically the same kind of programming as the residential programs you have looked into but have different daytime durations (IOPs are ~3hrs, PHPs are ~6hrs) and you sleep at home. An IOP could potentially allow you to still continue to work certain days or times, making things a little easier financially. The intake counselors at any of these places can help you determine the best level of care for you and answer any insurance concerns. In my experience, the intake therapists at these places have been surprisingly kind and resourceful. Don't be afraid to ask them exactly what you are thinking. IOPs/PHPs have been very helpful for me. They allowed me to finish my PhD and kept me safe and made me more capable of initiating change and not succumbing to the depths of hopelessness. I believe their main advantage was giving me the opportunity to practice the skills I learned in a natural environment during the latter half of the day.

Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months oftherapy and LATUDA should be discontinued at the first sign of decline in WBC, in the absence of other causative factors.Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur.

{"dr6rtoy": {"text": "It took me 7 years to finish my PhD. I probably spent a good year writing at the end. My advice is to write during the time of day when your brain is most alert and interested. Creating a writing schedule can help make it more manageable and less daunting and all encompassing. Picking a writing environment that helps you achieve a state of flow can be a game changer. I spent a lot of time at coffee shops and at least a day a week at a fancy shared office space where you can rent a desk. I took advantage of the free day they had. It put me in a \u201cworking\u201d state of mind. Decide if music or ambient noise is more helpful. If you\u2019re feeling down or having some writer\u2019s block, I recommend just jotting down outlines of your thoughts. If that is even too much, try a bullet list. Flesh those sections out later. Take breaks. If writing isn\u2019t working on a day, dedicate it to organizing/reading/searching for references. Take notes. Use them later. I was also greatly helped by caffeine and was on stimulants as well, but I take them for comorbid narcolepsy. Other advice: get some sleep! avoid all nighters! Your brain won\u2019t work without it and it may sabotage your mood. Talk to others about your research. Educating others will give you a sense of mastery and accomplishment that will fuel your work. This can be a very stressful time so make sure your pdoc is in the loop. Best wishes! Feel free to pm me if you ever want to chat/vent. ", "link_id": "t3_7jj5t4", "time": 1513174426}}

They are using **ketamine** as the anesthetic which apparently can also help generate a better seizure and antidepressant response. The recent increase in **Vraylar** does not seem to have helped with my mood stability. I'm not sure how I stay somewhat functional with the current AM/PM breakdown of the APs I am taking. I was recently put on **zonisamide** to help with the weight gain/appetite issues (and maybe help with the moods as a bonus as it has helped in the past before, though at higher dosages) and I guess it has subtly helped. But I'm kind of regretting not asking to be put back on Metformin instead. I haven't weighed myself in a while and am kind of afraid to step on the scale. Lately I have been wondering whether my **Mirena IUD** has possibly been contributing to the chaotic year I've had and inability to get any lasting stability. I've found some concerning posts online. I had it placed about a year ago. A month later the rapid cycling started. In the time I've had it in, I've been hospitalized 6 times - 7 times if you include the ICU stay after my attempt earlier this year. What if it isn't all me? I wish my doctors knew more about its possible role in everything. Nobody has really been able to advise me one way or another. I also have PCOS, which complicates matters. I may be considering going back on Nuvaring. I had stopped it only because I was afraid to be on it and Lamictal back when Lamictal was prescribed. I forget if Nuvigil interacts with the BC. That may be another reason that I switched methods. Perhaps that can be corrected by switching back over to Vyvanse.

{"dp4p0zo": {"text": "I had been rapid cycling and had tried MAOIs and just couldn't get stable. Things got really crazy, there were several hospitalizations, and a serious attempt earlier this year. That was when ECT was suggested to me. I had 6 treatments and I would say I started feeling bette suicidal after the 4th one. They did 3 treatments a week on MWF. I was feeling substantially better / more normal by the 6th. They did a LART placement for the electrodes, where one goes on your right temple and the other goes on the left side of the forehead. This is thought to cause less cognitive and memory impairment. I experienced some but it was nothing major. The ECT seemed to make me more responsive to medication. After discharge, I managed to stay out of the hospital for only 3 months or so. After 4 months, I was experiencing a psychotic, suicidal depression and was hospitalized again and had 6 sessions of ECT. This time at some point early on they switched to bitemporal from LART (it's thought to be more effective). Unfortunately, I was hospitalized again two weeks later. That time I was taken off all of my meds and started on clozapine. This helped but it wasn't enough, so they recommended ECT again. This time we switched the anesthetic agent used from the typical methohexital to ketamine. The use of ketamine seems to have given me a more robust antidepressant effect. This time I was hospitalized for much longer and did 10 ECTs while IP. We also decided that since I have a tendency to relapse so quickly, that I would seriously benefit from a trial of maintenance ECT treatments. So that is what I have been doing for the past month - ECT 1x weekly. ECT #13 is tomorrow. And so I've done #12 treatments so far for this cycle. That makes #24 ECTs this year so far....  The worst part about ECT for me is getting stuck with the damn IV. I have very superficial veins that are hard to get, so I often find myself getting poked several times before they get something that will work. It's awful - mostly because I've been phobic about needles + tubes all my life. To address this intense anxiety, my pdoc lets me take 25 mg of Thorazine to ease my apprehension. It's helped a lot! (You can't take a benzo because it will interfere with the treatment due to its anticonvulsant properties.)Some other things I don't like...* The effect wears off quickly for me. I'm not sure how to space treatments out more than a week. I don't know how I can stop treatments and not relapse. * They do the treatments really early in the morning on specific days for IP vs. OP. I need to be at the hospital at 6:30 AM on treatment days! * Did I mention I hate IVs?* The anesthetic that they usually use for the treatment hurts a little / feels funny as they inject it. It's strange and startling.  * Sometimes the seizure is so intense that you lose control of you bladder during the treatment... whoops. They tell me this is common. I hate that sometimes this has happened to me despite me remembering to empty my bladder beforehand. Boo. * The memory/cognition problems I experience are pretty mino but they are still shitty / make me feel dumb. I have a tendency toward nausea/vomiting and headaches with anesthesia. I mentioned this to my treatment team so they address this issue by giving me some Zofran ahead of time. They also run an IV bag of fluids to help prevent migraine. I would highly recommend someone consider trying ECT if nothing else has worked or if antidepressants were too troublesome. I sort of feel like Emsam is worth trying before ECT, but I think I would put ECT ahead of Parnate. I tried Parnate, and while it did work for a while, it did generate some mania *and* a hypertensive crisis despite my being extremely careful with the dietary restrictions! I wouldn't wish a hypertensive crisis on my worst enemy. It was extremely painful. Ugh. But at the time I was definitely of the opinion that all of the major antidepressant treatment options should be exhausted before considering ECT. It made me feel more comfortable with going for it. I am lucky in that my seizure threshold is apparently naturally very low. This means they don't need to use much power at all to generate the seizure. This probably translates to fewer side effects. Everyone is different. But overall - I am so glad this option exists. It has helped me immensely. I probably wouldn't be on this Earth without it. ", "link_id": "t3_79pjzw", "time": 1509424666}}

Previously when I had massive weight gain from a med (Saphris) the addition of **Zonegran (zonisamide)** really seemed to help me start loosing weight. So my pdoc added a small amount back into my cocktail; he doesn't think it will interfere at all with the ECT because my seizure threshold is so low to begin with *shrug*. On my own I did a little research and read that **melatonin** can help with the metabolic effects of psychotropic medications, so I decided to add some on at night.

Going into this hospitalization, my SO (husband) told me he was not going to be visiting me as much as he did before (prior hospitalizations), because he just couldn't deal with my mess anymore and the stress that it caused him. He kept his word, and I only saw him once or twice in those 42 days. He actually went on a euro vacation with his buddies during that time for a week or two, I don't remember. Towards the last weeks of my hospitalization, while I was getting ECTs, we talked about what to do about our living situation. Our apartment lease was coming to an end at the end of that month, so we needed to figure out new housing. So what does my dear SO do? He finds a new apartment.... *for himself*. All my stuff is put into a rental storage unit. When I get discharged, I am to live with my parents. He says some bullshit about how he's too scared that I am going to hurt myself under his roof and he simply can't deal with this stress anymore. He claims he has been thinking about divorce for the last year, and that *it's not* just because of the severity of my illness.   I don't know how I dealt with this as well as I did. I suppose it's because there was residual depression and I felt like a burden and could understand why someone wouldn't want me in their lives. But all of my friends and family were horrified by this behavior. And gradually, my anger has surfaced...  I think it's despicable and incredibly selfish to have an SO leave during an episode. I am glad he was there to take me into the hospital when it was needed, but then to bail? To give that disclaimer that they wouldn't be anywhere near as supportive as they were previously? I think that's awful. Especially to a person who is in a terribly fragile state. My SO and I are going to go through counseling to decide whether to divorce (likely) and how to settle it. He has *not* in the time since we've been separated been with anyone else. I pointedly asked. I think if he had, I would have been devastated and I don't think I would have been interested in fixing the relationship. But to be fair, this is plenty devastating anyway.

It continues to work pretty well for me, although this last week I noticed my mood tanking pretty dramatically 5-6 days after the last treatment which has me very frustrated and a little scared. I don't like the dark turn my thought content takes when that happens. It really frustrates me that the anti-depressant effects of this treatment are often so transient and short-lived. When I saw my pdoc last week I was doing really well and feeling very strong. He mentioned potentially stopping ECT soon and I kind of had a mini freak out. So he obliged, but stressed that these will not be going on forever. O_o He did not change anything with my **clozapine** or the **Vraylar** that he had added the previous week. I'm wondering now if the adjunctive Vraylar could now be causing some weirdness that is hurting my mood stability. There was also a very brief discussion of metabolic concerns at my office visit. I'm still bummed about the rapid weight gain on clozapine. There was a brief mention of using Metformin to help the situation (20 lbs in 6 weeks...) but it was ultimately not prescribed. I am considering asking the ECT pdoc tomorrow if he would consider prescribing something that he thinks could help (either the Metformin or something that's helped me previously, like zonisamide as long as it wouldn't interfere with the ECT treatments). I may ask them to tweak the weekly blood test to include some other labs; I have this sinking suspicion that something is possibly off with my thyroid, vit D, iron, and/or glucose. Still waiting to hear about arrangements for residential treatment. I am concerned about res because some of the places I have talked to have policies in place where they will not prescribe any controlled substances, stimulants, or benzos. I take Nuvigil for my narcolepsy. I *need* to take something if I'm to stay awake in the daytime, especially in combination with the other medications I take that can promote sedation. Knowing that I would not have access to an occasional benzo for extreme anxiety, fear, or agitation is enough to start triggering a panic attack for no reason. Some of the other places won't accept me until 30 d have elapsed since my last ECT treatment.

{"doczjxc": {"text": "I have had 22 ECTs this year. It has been a game changer for me. I\u2019ve been hospitalized 6-7x this year for everything: severe depressions, mania, mixed episodes, and a suicide attempt which landed me in the ICU. I initially received ECT 6x during two separate hospitalizations - I consented to the first series after my attempt. It got me out of a deep pit of suicidal despair each time. The only problems I had with it are the memory impairment (which is temporary) and the fact that it seems to be beneficial only for a short time. I would relapse pretty quickly each of those treatment cycles, weeks to months after stopping treatments. I was recently hospitalized again. We were focusing on tweaking the meds initially but it wasn\u2019t enough. We started ECT again - this time 8x while IP. We used ketamine as the anesthetic to see if it would boost the efficacy of the treatments. It\u2019s supposed to help generate high quality seizures and be a good adjunct for treating depression alone. I\u2019ve since continued treatments as an outpatient - 1x week. I\u2019ve had 2 outpatient maintenance treatments so far and my mood seems to be solidly stable; I am incredibly grateful for this. Treatments were given 3x week while IP on M W F and are bumped down for outpatient to 1-2x week on Tu and Th. You decide on a schedule with your pdoc. You need someone to drive you the day of your treatment because of the general anesthesia. You\u2019re not allowed to drive the rest of the day. The procedure itself is not scary. I\u2019m a bigger baby about getting the IV and have some apprehension initially about going under. They give me some Thorazine before the procedure which helps to relax me and make me comfortable. I think doing the maintenance treatments this time is really helping to keep me stable. I recall noticing an improvement in mood after the 4th ECT. I\u2019m not sure how much the ECT helps with mood stability vs depression, as I was put on a different, more potent antipsychotic to stabilize my mood cycling (***Clozaril***/clozapine). I do feel that ECT helps to temper some mood cycling for me in that it breaks through the present cycle very effectively. A \u201creset\u201d of sorts. But truly, this is the best I\u2019ve felt this entire year.  I am dealing with some crappy things in my family life (I\u2019ve had to move back in with my parents, I may be getting divorced) and somehow I am able to face them head on instead of crumbling in defeat or being triggered in other destructive ways. It\u2019s really a remarkable thing.I couldn\u2019t recommend ECT more to those who have tried everything and are still struggling to find stability. It really seems to reliably work for me and make me more responsive to medication. It has helped to keep me out of the hospital- but the treatment schedule / types need to be tweaked to optimize this result. Initially used bilateral LART with the regular anesthetic. It places the electrodes on one side of the forehead (left anterior) and one temple (right temporal). This method is thought to minimize memory issues while preserving efficacy. I was switched to the traditional bitemporal placement to boost the therapeutic effect. The side effects were transient in my experience and totally worth it.  Who would have guessed that all of this ECT would make me feel so... normal!? I\u2019ve caught myself really identifying with this one tattoo idea I saw posted somewhere:** I &gt; ^ v** .\u201cI am greater than my ups and downs. \u201c For once - I have caught myself able to think about my life and the future without being strangled by my brain.

I'm thinking more linearly, rationally, and compassionately. I was looking at LinkedIn. My brain feels less afraid to be forward- and future-thinking. I still have a long way to go, but the clozapine and ECT are definitely making a big difference. I think everyone is surprised I seem to be continuously improving / stabilizing despite the shitty life things my disorder kindled. I was recently hospitalized for 6 weeks. Eventually we decided to start ECT again because I was not responding as robustly as hoped. I've had 10 treatments for this cycle. I'm continuing to get them 1x week. I am having some pretty noticeable memory problems. I find myself repeating myself a lot and feel ashamed / embarrassed when I have to request somebody repeat themselves.

He is too afraid to live with me because he's constantly worrying that I'm going to hurt myself and he doesn't want to be responsible for taking care of me.

I recently got discharged from this stay, six weeks later...  I spent my birthday in the hospital. I have been having a hard time having lasting results from various medication trials. I believe this was my sixth inpatient stay in the past year. More psychotic symptoms have been popping up recently, too. So during this past stay they wanted to titrate me onto clozapine (Clozaril), stressing that a lower dose usually does the trick for patients with treatment-resistant bipolar disorder. So that's what we did the first few weeks. I was pulled off everything else - lithium, Depakote, I forget what else. I wasn't responding as robustly as hoped, so after a few weeks they talked me into doing ECT again. So I did bilateral ECT treatments with ketamine anesthesia to hopefully promote/expedite an antidepressant response. I did 8 in the hospital (3X/week) and have done 2 maintenance treatments as an outpatient. I will likely be continuing them 1X/week for a bit longer. ECT is annoying but it seems to be the only thing that reliably works for me. I did a series of 6 during two previous IP stays but this is my first time doing maintenance ECT. I am seeing my pdoc 1X/week so we are assessing the need for continued ECT on an ongoing basis. I get blood tests every week for the clozapine - and dislike the rapid weight gain it has caused - but cannot deny that the impact has been remarkable. They conveniently have been testing my blood when I go in for outpatient ECT. Last week cariprazine (Vraylar) 1.5 mg was added to augment the clozapine. My pdoc thinks it can especially help with the depressive symptoms since it has a somewhat novel/unique method of action (D2/D3 partial agonist).

I believe they also had me on a tiny amount of Wellbutrin at the time. I was suicidal and it did stabilize me enough over the course of my two week stay. But I was starting to cycle a bit I think after discharge because I crashed again but had the energy/impulsivity to do something about it. I woke up in the ICU on a ventilator where I spent the nect few days. I did ECT during the IP stay that followed. Have been tinkering with meds since but lithium has been pretty good for the highs with some anticonvulsants on the side. Was taken off Zyprexa because it elevated my prolactin levels. I might still be on it if I could tolerate it metabolically in addition to those effects. So the only antipsychotics I seem to tolerate well prolactin-wise are the partial agonists that don't completely block dopamine. But this is an idiosyncratic reaction and isn't necessarily that common for this med like it is for others (Risperdal). Lamictal I stopped the first time because of a highly elevated liver function panel. This particular time because it didn't seem to be a good stabilizer since I was still cycling nor did it seem to help with my depression.

My memory is still recovering a little bit but it's not too bad. In the days since I've been discharged, I've really been struggling. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to constantly have people around me in my program, in my family, in my healthcare program asking me \"if I'm safe.\" Yes, I'm fucking safe. Just fucking sad and frustrated. My pdoc spent a lot of time reviewing my chart with me the other day to try to figure out what has and hasn't worked for me. He suggested maintenance ECT. I told him I wasn't really interested in doing that. I feel like it's starting to affect me too poorly cognitively. So we reviewed all the various antidepressants in search of ones that have not made me invariably manic. Sigh. So we eventually found one. Emsam. It definitely works for me. Sometimes too well. So he only wants me to use half a 6 mg patch. I'm not sure if this approach is going to be effective. I sometimes wonder if wearing the full patch for half a day would be better and somehow preserve the \"integrity\" of the patch better. I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to cut them. I also feel like 3 mg would be such a tiny effective dose. I almost feel like prescribing the 9 mg patch and having me cut that in half to get 4.5 mg would be better. *shrug* I'm having trouble sleeping which is frustrating because this wasn't an issue in the hospital. I have to keep telling people that I was in the hospital because I haven't delivered on various manuscripts and deliverables. And I just generally look irresponsible. And I just feel terrible and ridiculous because in the case of the one person and the manuscript they are going to know pretty easily that the hospitalization was a mental health related one. My DH wants me to consider going to a residential treatment program. I'm not really sure what that would accomplish. It seems super restrictive. I suppose I'm willing to discuss it in our family session today. He brought up the point that this whole situation is tough on him too so my going would in effect bring him some peace of mind and relief. Sure... What about me? What about my peace? In other news, I am going on a mini vacation in a couple of weeks to Yellowstone. I suppose I'll get ready for some hiking and geysers and nature, sure. I haven't been on a trip in I don't even remember how long. Actually. I used to be an avid traveler. The last trip I went on was in last April to St. Lucia. Fucked up. LAST April. Not even this April. FUCKED UP.  This March/April I was a month post suicide attempt and ECT. What a difference a year makes... ", "link_id": "t3_6q1oeq", "time": 1501244809}}

{"dkssz0f": {"text": "Emsam was great it just contributed to mania for me potentially so I was taken off of it. Latuda wasn't great for me. I was taken off of it pretty quickly and I forget exactly why but it wasn't stabilizing me. I have noticed a difference between different AAPs for sure, some have been far more efficacious than others.  Some of the SSRIs have given me more problems than others like Lexapro made me manic much more rapidly than Zoloft. I was able to be on Parnate for some time without getting manic. The anticonvulsants do seem to affect me differently. Lamictal didn't seem to do much for me. Trileptal helped a little but it made me lose my hair which was very traumatic. A combo of lithium, Zonegran, Vraylar, and Neurontin with some other stuff (ergocalciferol, Cabergoline, levothyroxine, liothyronine) is working mostly okay aside from some depression. I just finished 6 rounds of ECT and might do maintenance unless we discuss going on an antidepressant. I'm not sure my pdoc would want to do that though because I was also just hospitalized for mania last month. I can't catch a break.... :( I was on Saphris before this but got switched to Vraylar because my prolactin level was elevated. ", "link_id": "t3_6pu7gj", "time": 1501172628}}
