You can break apart the bulbae as long as there are at least three left in every new plant. It will grow new bulbs twice as fast now. What I'm trying to say by all this is: you probably need not worry too much about the roots. It will grow new, single roots when it gets more bulbs and Oncidiae grow new bulbs easily.
