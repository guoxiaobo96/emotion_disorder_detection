The doctor who saw me in the hospital did not realise I was bipolar, I was diagnosed with Major Depression, Psychotic Disorder NOS, and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. I was given more antidepressants with antipsychotics added on. I think the antipsychotics and antidepressant combination actually inadvertently treated my bipolar but I could not function at all on them. After about 6 months the psychiatrist decided I could come off the antipsychotic to see if I would remain free of psychosis but left the antidepressant.

You can only see doctors that are in your zone, unless they're a specialist such as a surgeon. There are no psychiatrists in my zone, so I can't be referred to one. My general doctor can refer me for a psych consult, which is essentially an hour appointment with a psychiatrist from the city where they will then recommend treatment to the referring doctor for them to prescribe. The problem then becomes finding a general doctor who actually understands psychiatric medication and illness enough to treat them. This also doesn't seem to exist in my zone, pretty much every doctor I've tried is much more interested in my immune disorder than I already have under control and just ignores the bipolar. So I'm unmedicated, the only way I can actually get in to see a doctor is if I'm referred to one by a doctor in another zone, which can only happen next time I go inpatient at the hospital in the city.I used to have a psychiatrist, and she was great. She was in the city and I started seeing her when I lived there. I saw her for 6 years, from when I was diagnosed and through quite a few inpatient stays when I was younger. She was the one who figured out I was bipolar instead of my previous diagnosis and got me on the right kinds of medication. Unfourtunately when I moved away I got kicked out of the clinic because my address moved out of the zone. They referred me to a clinic in my zone, and when I showed up they informed me that they didn't actually have any psychiatrists and were confused about why I had been referred there in the first place. So yeah, really don't like our system. 0/10 would not recommend. When Americans refer to our healthcare system as being great it just makes me embarrassed. It's so unorganised and faulty. Even if you did live in the city where there are psychiatrists, or one of the rural zones that does, the wait lists to see a psych are months to a year long. If you're in a mental health crisis do you really think you can wait that long to see someone about it?

{"eyv7bok": {"text": "Well, psychosis is generally a symptom of another disorder not something in and of itself. Psychosis can present as part of depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, and likely other illnesses I'm not familiar with.Psychosis is described as a break with reality. This is a really loose description, and rightfully so as there's likely countless different ways one could experience psychosis. Generally it can be divided into 3 individual symptoms that often overlap. Hallucinations, which is experiencing something that isn't there with any sense. This is commonly experienced as auditory or visual, but it could be tactile, tastes, perceptions in temperature or pressure, anything really. Delusions are where you have a belief that no matter how much evidence is provided to prove otherwise, you can't shake. Commonly this would be the belief that you're being persecuted, followed, watched, super intelligent, a deity, that something happened that didn't or vice versa, etc. Paranoia, which is really self explanatory.Part of the struggle with psychosis is that the vast majority of people experiencing it think they aren't. It feels that real, it is your reality. You walking up to someone experiencing psychosis and telling them that it's not real would be the equivalent of me approaching you and telling you that your whole life is a lie. You're not going to believe me. I could compile textbooks of concrete evidence, you still won't believe me. In that sense, I don't think anyone can really tell they're psychotic without medical intervention.I'm diagnosed as bipolar, I experience psychosis from time to time, maybe once every couple of years I'll have an episode that features psychosis. However, my original *mis*diagnosis was psychotic disorder not otherwise specified with major depressive disorder. I originally presented with psychosis, but I went to the doctor because of my depression. I didn't know I was psychotic but it was blatantly obvious to any psychiatrist who spoke with me. I felt like I was being watched, followed, I felt like I was in immediate danger. I felt like my thoughts were being stolen from me, I could hear terrible voices in the walls, I kept seeing bloody disfigured figures in my home. I attempted suicide, not because of my depressive episode (good luck convincing a hospital psychiatrist that your suicide attempts are unrelated to depression though), because I couldn't live with the psychosis anymore, I couldn't deal with my reality, I can't describe it... I felt like it was the only cure.Anyways, now that I'm properly diagnosed and I'm in proper medication it's not really an issue anymore. It can still happen, but for it to get as bad as that time I described it'd need to remain unchecked for a long time which can't really happen for me anymore. When I do get psychosis lately it's more associated with my manias so it's more grandiose, like I believe I'm super important and super intelligent, or that I'm a higher power. It gets caught early and meds tweaked and it's not an issue.I'm not sure I really answered your questions, I kind of went on a tangent.", "link_id": "t3_cyyn9t", "time": 1567482952}}

Everything feels connected. I get lots of deja vu feelings. As I get more manic I tend to get psychotic. Hearing things, music, talking, footsteps, just stuff. Seeing flashes or things moving in my field of vision, feeling bugs on me, I get hypersensitive to things like my clothes touching me, colours get super clear like life is suddenly in HD. I get delusional, like I'm super important or invulnerable to harm, like I'll become rich or I'm super intelligent. Then I get paranoid, which leads to a mixed episode but that's something else.So...bouncy, talkative, can't think straight, feel great, pulsate, animate.Reading back through this I kind of seem manic.

{"esjwahi": {"text": "I have bipolar 1 with psychotic features, my early adulthood was plagued by frequent extended inpatient stays in the psych ward, countless different combinations of medicine to try and keep me stable enough to just live, suicide attempts that came painfully close to being successful. When I turned 23 I had moved out of town in an effort to lower my stress as I'd identified it as the main trigger for my episodes. I kept seeing my doctor in the city because I really liked her and I didn't mind driving 45 minutes to see her. The psych nurse I also saw there really didn't like me, and I feel it's because I didn't want to do therapy with her but they had made it a requirement for all patients seeing a psychiatrist in the office. I had spent so long inpatient that I'd done the entirety of CBT and DBT and felt I had a really good handle on it.Anyways, one day she figured out I had moved, and technically I should be seeing a doctor in my own health zone (there's no psychiatrists in my zone as I soon found out) and I got terminated from the office. So I was suddenly left with no doctor, no medication (I was on Latuda at the time and the office was just letting me have all the free samples), nothing. It took 3 years before I had an episode. So my point is, in a long convoluted way, that just because you've been fine for a bit over a year I wouldn't let your guard down.", "link_id": "t3_c7tgbj", "time": 1562043708}}

I had already been diagnosed as bipolar for about 9 years when it happened, but I'd been off my medication for a couple years at that point because I didn't have a doctor anymore. It started with me hearing talking through my walls, I just kind of wrote it off though. I'd had psychosis before while mixed or depressed so I learned to not look too much into things because in my experience it usually made things worse if I dwelled on it. Over time the talking got clearer and louder, until it sounded like someone was standing right behind me talking. It wasn't talking to me, or even about me, it was just random phrases. But then I started noticing patterns and signs around me in life. Things started to feel very connected, and I had a spiritual epiphany regarding the universe and how I was such a vital part of it. I was going to change the course of humanity and the universe was going to guide me, because I was so important I couldn't possibly be hurt, because the universe was guiding me no matter what I did everything would be provided for me. I started spending all my money, I played the lottery and genuinely expected the universe would cause me to win as part of *the plan*. This went on for over a month, possibly two. By the end my SO was making plans to have me placed inpatient and I was going along with it because *the plan*, duh. On top of the psychosis I was experiencing full mania for the first time, I was talking everyone's ears off, bouncing around 24/7, my thoughts were going painfully fast and everyone else was painfully slow. I could barely string a coherent sentence together because I couldn't think about an idea long enough to get it out of my mouth. I was soooo happy, everything was perfect, I was also sooo horny but I'm not going to get into that.One day I just suddenly crashed. I was just sitting and suddenly everything was awful. Everything got dark. It was different than my other depressions, usually I can fake my way through it but this time I couldn't even talk. I could barely muster breathing. I wasn't at all suicidal, I was just checked out for a couple weeks. It's almost like my brain shut down to recoup.I've had a couple manic episodes since then but not with the psychosis.

I ended up not having another major episode for about 3 years off of medication.I ended up having my first full manic episode though, which included psychosis, I found a doctor but I didn't tell them about the psychosis just the mania. Mostly because I really didn't want to be prescribed another antipsychotic, Latuda and Saphris were the only ones I could function on but I couldn't afford them anymore, and somewhat because I wasn't 100% sure it was psychosis until after the fact. So she prescribed me just a mood stabilizer to see if it would bring down the mania, which it did and the psychosis went away with it.

The auditory ones are mostly just talking, it sounds like I'm in a busy restaurant or store and I'm just catching little bits of multiple conversations around me. Occasionally it'll be a voice talking to me, and when that happens it's a familiar voice like my dad or mom or SO. When that happens it's usually my name and things I can't make out, or random words in no particular order that don't make sense. My visual hallucinations are things moving that aren't, usually in a flowing or waving motion. Sometimes I'll see people for a split second, it's usually people I know kind of at the edge of my vision. My main psychotic symptom while manic though is delusions. I have grandiose delusions involving being sent by God or having a special connection with the universe. I believe I'm quite literally the most important person alive, to the point where God or the universe would protect me from harm because if something happened to me it'd surely be the literal end of the world. I start to see patterns or messages left for me in ordinary things and believe they're clues left for me to lead me to fulfill my prophecy.While mixed or depressed I have much of the same auditory hallucinations except more negative but the visual hallucinations are much clearer and the people are no longer ones I recognize. It's generally accompanied by a strong sense of doom or panic and intense paranoia revolving around negative feelings for myself. My delusions follow my paranoia and generally revolve around cameras or microchips and people being after me.

I'm married, I was diagnosed around the time we started dating but it was very clear that I had *some sort of* mental illness even before that. My SO has also experienced mental illness and has been inpatient in mental health units before as well so we have a decent understanding. Although they don't really struggle with them any more it helps that they understand that it's something out of my control.3. I don't know much about medication other than my own experience. Lithium is a common medication, the medication I have the most success with is Depakote and Wellbutrin. Lamictal is another mood stabilizer, I know there's others but I can't even remember the names of the other ones I've been on. A lot of people also take antipsychotics, Saphris worked really well for me but it was expensive. Latuda also worked well for me but it's even more money.4. Misconceptions will vary by person. Personally I don't experience \"mood swings\". I don't go from happy to sad to mad in a day. My mood episodes last months and I don't generally swing fast. I'm not a ticking time bomb, I don't have anger issues and the **only** time I've ever been violent was during my first psychotic episode in the hospital when I had no idea what was happening.

Lots of yelling, storming out, using drugs and drinking to get through the day, slamming doors. Just not good.6. Hypomania, to me is where I can still function normally.

{"eic1zen": {"text": "I've been diagnosed as bipolar for about 12 years but I only had my first clear manic episode about 4 years ago. Before that I mostly experienced hypomanic episodes between long periods of depression.I can't really pinpoint when it all started. Looking back I can't even really tell when I was just hypomanic leading up to this episode, although I'm sure I was at some point as since then I always have a period of hypomania before my manic episodes. I just remember the end of it.I remember that I felt like I was chosen for something. Like I was super important, I was invaluable to the universe because I was going to do something that would change the course of humanity. I don't know what that something was, I never did figure it out, I just knew that it was something. I felt like the universe was letting me know, and that the universe would guide me and protect me because I was so important. So I was always on the lookout for signs from the universe that would point me in the direction I was supposed to go in. I could also hear talking, all around me, all the time. I couldn't make out the words very often, but it always sounded like there were people all around me speaking to eachother and I could only make out parts of each conversation around me but not enough to know what was being talked about. Occasionally I'd hear a voice talking directly to me, usually a familiar one. Many times I heard my dad's voice talking to me, or my SO, or someone from work. It was usually just random words or phrases, it didn't usually make any sense. It was pretty weird but I just passed it off. I was having trouble thinking clearly. Like, my own thoughts were going so fast in my own head that I couldn't keep track of them. I'd never get through a complete thought before the next one took it's place. It was like chaos in my head.According to my SO I was talking non-stop, very loudly, about everything and nothing. I'd come up with outrageous plans or ideas, I'd stay up all night talking about them. My sentences were all jumbled together like my own words were tripping over eachother to get out of my mind fast enough. I'd pace around, bounce my legs, tap my fingers, hum songs that I seemingly would make up as I went. I was getting pretty much no sleep. Every few nights or so I'd actually get a few hours but then I'd just wake up with even more energy than before. This all lasted about a month or two. Then I crashed down into a mixed episode for a week or two, then I was depressed for a week. It wasn't my normal depression though, well not normal for me then at least. Since that first manic episode my depressions changed. Actually, pretty much my whole disorder changed since that first manic episode. I used to spend the majority of my time depressed with really short bursts of hypomania but since then I seem to spend the majority of my time that isn't euthymic as being manic and then crashing into a mixed episode. I rarely get depressed anymore, and when I am it's pretty short now.

I believe the antipsychotic was keeping the Effexor from making me manic or mixed, but after being on the antipsychotic for long enough without psychotic symptoms the doctor decided to try weaning me off to see if the psychosis I had experienced (long story but made a huge scene at university) was a one time thing. I stayed on the Effexor because I was still depressed.The moment I was off the antipsychotic I felt horrible. I'd later find out that it was a mixed episode, but the psychosis came rushing back with the depression I was having, but I had boundless energy, couldn't sleep, couldn't stop thinking or doing. It was terrible. I attempted suicide, I just wanted my head to stop and I didn't really care how at that point.So I ended up back in the hospital, but I had a different doctor this time.

She diagnosed me based on observations and the notes from the previous doctor, I don't remember the week after my attempt but I apparently became manic right after.

That's a pretty hard thing yo grasp if you haven't had one, because they're on total opposite ends of a spectrum. Everyone experiences their manic or depressive episodes a little differently, so you're going to get a lot of variation in mixed episodes too.For me, my depressive episodes are generally experienced as near catatonia. I have trouble moving, I can't talk, I'm basically a sobbing slumped over mess for the duration. Luckily I don't get these often, or I'd probably be on disability. My manic episodes are characterized by a lot of activity, being very sped up, psychosis, etc, pretty much the stereotypical clinical view of mania.My mixed episodes are my depressed thought processes paired up with the psychosis, energy, and sped up feeling of my manic episodes. Except I never have visual hallucinations while manic, but I always get them while mixed and it freaks me out. I also get what the pdocs call \"bizarre\" delusions. Like I once dug a hole in my arm while inpatient because I thought there was a microchip under my skin.Obviously someone who doesn't have psychosis is going to have a totally different experience than me though.", "link_id": "t3_aymbk2", "time": 1552024695}}

I actually thought what I was experiencing was totally normal and I was just weak with not being able to handle it all on my own.When I was about 8 my school sent me to a child psychiatrist for acting out. This psychiatrist asked me some questions, one of which had to do with suicidal thoughts. It was at that point that I realized that it must not be normal to think that way, but I told her no because I thought I would be in trouble if I told her the truth. After seeing her for few months she diagnosed me with ADHD and offered to treat me with medication but my parents refused, they really didn't believe in mental illness at all.In high school we had a suicide in the school so we had a bunch of meetings and presentations on depression and suicide. I again realized that my thoughts must not be normal, but I didn't know what to do about them so I continued to not tell anyone about them.After high school I went to university and all the stress made everything worse, I realized that I did need help so I went to my doctor and she prescribed me antidepressants. I very quickly became either manic or mixed after starting them, and started hallucinating while becoming extremely paranoid. I was admitted and discharged from inpatient a few times and diagnosed with psychotic disorder and depression. They continued to give me antidepressants with antipsychotics which in a way treated the bipolar anyways. Eventually I went off the antipsychotics as I was no longer psychotic, but stayed on the antidepressants.

I can't stop moving, I'm constantly tapping my toes or clicking my fingers on my desk to a song I'm making up in my head as I go that rivals the most elaborate symphonies ever created. I get utterly obsessed with the weirdest things, caligraphy, art, history, technology, etc. I'll spend hours and hours researching whatever I'm obsessed with at that moment in time. I'll stay awake until 3 in the morning deep cleaning my entire house from the traps of my plumbing to the specks on the ceiling. Crave some more sex. Obsess about a new topic. That goes on for months, but that's what I consider hypomania. After that I get manic. I get paranoid, I hallucinate, I have delusions. Nobody can understand me anymore because I'm talking too fast and jumping around from topic to topic in no tangible sense because that's what's going on in my head. I get very angry very easily, which is very uncharacteristic of me. I do drugs, I start smoking and drinking again, I have zero impulse control. I've bought everything from drones on EBay to brand new cars. I've maxed out credit cards which I'm still paying for, I've enrolled and dropped out of college and universities, I have my certification to work in an ambulance for no reason for example.

{"dwnp75w": {"text": "I saw in your other reply you were more interested in manic experiences. Well you're in luck, because that's where I'm at right now! Anyway, so as far as I'm concerned mania is a very personal experience. Everyone has it different, I don't think you'll find two people who describe mania the same way. It has a lot to do with people's personality, their situations, and what they're like at a baseline mood. At my baseline I'm already a talkative and outgoing and positive person, which gets super exasperated when manic. I also have bipolar 1, compared to bipolar 2 where people have less severe (not necessarily less disruptive though) hypomanic episodes.MY episodes generally feel like this to me. I feel very excited, about everything and nothing. You know that feeling when you were a kid and it was Christmas Eve and you were super excited about the next day? That's me, 24/7 for no obvious apparent reason. I'm super talkative, to everyone, about everything. Strangers, friends, bosses, co-workers, customers, everyone. I talk fast, I talk loud, I have no filter, and generally if you don't stop me it makes little sense and doesn't really follow any topic flow. I literally just say what comes into my head which is random. I have racing thoughts, which I feel is a negative experience in mania. I don't like it, my thoughts go so fast I can't even process them before they're gone and another one replaces it. I'll be thinking of topic A and then 1/4 of the way into the thought I'm suddenly at topic X2 that has nothing to do with A and if I'm talking my sentences do the same thing. They'll go so fast that sometimes it feels like I'm standing in the middle of a crowd just catching snippets of a bunch of different conversations.I can't stop moving. I'm constantly pacing or bouncing up and down or tapping my fingers to some random song I'm making up. I love everyone, unless someone does something to annoy me then I'm just a monster. It doesn't happen often but I've yelled and screamed and fought with people before while manic. I feel like I'm super smart and cunning, like I could solve the world's problems. I get psychosis, which is a break from reality. I've believed I'm chosen somehow by the universe, that I can't be hurt, that I'm immortal, I hear voices while I'm manic, I see messages in things that are normally benign. I spend a lot of money when I'm like this because I believed that I could never run out of it, the universe would provide by winning the lottery for me or stuff like that.I'm sure I'm missing stuff but that's all I can think of right now.", "link_id": "t3_88w4gi", "time": 1522638010}}

Like, I get a rush out of not spending money. That being said when I'm manic I'll buy a lot of small things I wouldn't normally waste money on. Weird drinks, eating out, cameras, toys, etc.. In my head when I'm spending money I don't have I don't worry, I'm convinced everything will work out. When I'm manic I'm convinced I'm about to win the lottery or that everything I need would be provided for me or that my money is limitless because I'm so important. Hypersexuality lol. I have problems with that. When I'm manic I feel like I'd do anyone with a pulse. I touch myself in public when nobody is looking. I have no control over my urges. It's ridiculous. I've felt suicidal while manic a couple times. I get overwhelmed by the episode a lot if it goes on too long. Later on in my long episodes I have moments where I just break down and cry for a moment because everything is so loud and beautiful and in my face. I have psychosis while manic so there's all that too. I've also had delusions while manic that involve suicide which can be pretty dangerous.Pressured speech...I just ramble on and on and on. It feels like a literal pressure to speak. Like when I'm not talking I can feel it trying to push it's way out. I feel like I have to talk and you have to listen and what I'm saying is so important. If I force myself not to talk, say I'm in a meeting or something, it gets almost painful. And if I have to answer something it's very hard for me to keep it short and not continue talking non-stop. I'm usually pretty loud too at this point.Racing thoughts to me are almost incoherent. They're so fast in my head I can't even get through a whole idea before the next one is there. It's like standing in the middle of a crowded room with 20 conversations going on and you're trying to listen to all of them at once. I'm usually pretty quiet if I'm having racing thoughts because I can't string a coherent sentence together.

After a few months I couldn't handle how they made me feel so I stopped taking the antipsychotics. I quickly became mixed or manic again along with the psychosis and ended up attempting suicide. I got taken off the antidepressant and put back on antipsychotics which I refused to take with any sort of consistency. I attempted suicide again a short time after and got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder in the hospital.

{"dvolfey": {"text": "My hypomanic episodes generally sneak up on me. They usually start with me just having a consistent feeling of being excited. Like a feeling of anticipation but for no reason. I start to talk louder, and according to other people faster but I don't notice this myself. I talk a lot more, to pretty much everyone I see. Sometimes the topics can be somewhat inappropriate, especially around those I was already comfortable with. I get weirdly playful and touchy, like tickling or hugging people.As it progresses into mania I start to listen to my music very loud. Drive very fast. I get very full of myself. I have trouble sleeping, I get hypersexual. I remember one episode I actually ended up touching myself at work in an empty hallway because I couldn't take it anymore. I get really snappy with people and impatient. I have trouble organizing my own thoughts because they're going so fast and it reflects in my speech. Sometimes I can't form a flowing sentence, it will start on one topic but then everything is going so fast internally and by the end of the sentence I'm 4 topics over and getting weird looks. At this point I usually get psychotic. I hear talking and whispering, I usually think I'm chosen or special or important to humanity somehow. I think I'm invulnerable to harm. I start to see messages in patterns or coincidences. And usually this is when I crash into depression. Anywhere from a couple weeks to months from the initial start of the episode.My depressions don't happen as often. Usually I feel dread all the time. Like there's a weight on me physically holding me down making it hard to move or talk or even breathe. Everything hurts, I want to cry all the time. I have trouble speaking, I'm very quiet and have issues turning my thoughts into words. Like, I can think of what to say but I physically can't, it's like I'm trapped in my head. I spend a lot of time laying in bed which makes me feel more guilty. I don't eat, I don't drink, I don't shower, I'm pretty sure if I lived alone I'd just never ever leave my bed. I usually get psychotic pretty quickly while depressed, which usually landed me in the hospital. I see people following me, I hear people talking to me saying terrible things, I see blood everywhere and get extremely paranoid. I feel like people are after me, a few times I've had what my doctor calls \"bizarre\" delusions where I think a microchip is implanted under my skin and I try to dig it out, or that I'm being poisoned by my doctor or parents or husband. I've tried to kill myself twice before I was properly diagnosed, and it's not because I was suicidal. I do get suicidal but it's not a strong urge for me, I just want the psychosis to stop.

But no matter what mood I'm in having a kid made me more happy overall. I don't think it's something you need to worry about.
