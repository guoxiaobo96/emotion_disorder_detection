I was recently diagnosed with bipolar II, but I guess that's just the most recent \"label\" I have to address the entirety of my mental health (encompassing lots of things like anxiety panic attacks depression ADHD intrusive thoughts ptsd etc.). I was (and kind of still am) in the same position as you. I have been smoking almost every night or second night. It is the only time I have any kind of self compassion. The mean and nasty thoughts my anxiety yells in my head all day are somehow replaced with a softer voice of reason and compassion. I start to put things into perspective outside of the current tunnel vision my anxiety and depression have entrapped me in. I start to see life how it is. I am someone who lives with a mental illness and to compare myself to the perceived \"success\" of my friends and peers is unfair. I start to go a little easier on myself and I start to plan out little steps and decisions I can make in the interest of my continued journey with mental health. I actually decided to start seeing a therapist again while high and decided to ask my doctor to switch meds while high.Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that I know where you're coming from and you're not alone. I know this is just a stranger on the internet talking, but are you taking any steps towards improving your mental health?
