I don't know your height or weight but this is probably less than you, as males have a higher BMR usually.So let's say your BMR is 1,500, for example purposes. You would burn 200-300 calories on the treadmill if you SLOWLY walk for an hour. That already ups your TDEE to 1,700-1,800 a day, without the gym time. At the gym, you may burn around 400 calories. Spread that out over a week, that adds on an extra 150 calories a day -- so your TDEE (this is an underestimation) would be 1,850 -1,950 a day.Yes, it may not be 2,200, but it's definitely not as low as you think it is either", "link_id": "t3_cwlrgx", "time": 1567004123}}

I don't mean violence, I mean grounding them or taking away things they like. Or even calling the police on them if they do something serious.

Me and my sister were horrified because we were taught that it was wrong by our parents! We were never struck, if we did something wrong we were informed why it was wrong, had punishments like being grounded/not being allowed on the computer or games,  and that was that.Violence is not the answer to anything, honestly.
