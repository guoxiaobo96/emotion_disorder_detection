I grew up with my dog gone through many tough times as a kid but I knew something was up because she wouldn't eat and couldn't back she literally looked like she was barking but no sound. So I bugged the ever loving life out of my parents to take her to the.vet and succeeded in doing so. It's always a hard decision to put a pet down but it was the right thing to do ((I am surprised by and you will to that some people won't put their animals down if they are in extreme pain...for example my dog had a tumor in her windpipe and I wasn't going to let her suffer) June first would be like ummmmm 3-6 years she passed in 2015 she's lived a nice long and loving 12 years. It was one of the hardest decisions i have ever made in my lifetime and I know it's probably going to be more since June 6 is my 21 bday that i still have many years ahead it still will be one of the top hardest things. I had so much \"fun \" in 2015 friend drama, dad had to go to a different state to train for his job, we were moving on top of that. Which now I look back on is a godsend but I do miss the two true friends i had. some People the day after told me \"it was just a pet\". In my eyes dogs aren't just pets they're family so that hurt and bless the soul of my friend who hates hugs he hugged me and my other friend did to. So did my homeroom teacher and her daughter. I had so much support that day sometimes it makes me cry just thinking about it. But high school was so much better at the one I stayed for the rest of the time I was in school. ((class of 2019) and honestly it was amazing i meet a young writer friend at youth group and he still helps me out and I've seen so much growth in my writing because of him. It's so amazing how better ((not mentally better but just from a different view like visually better) it was I probably would have had my depression worsen if I went to the same HS as my \"friends\". But now i have another dog named after my best friend Sarah she is cute and so sweet but no one can ever replace my first dog Bambi ((I was 3 1/2 when we got her...my mom said when I first met her \"look mom it's bambi!\" Woo the name stuck ((mom got her without dad's permission but he never wanted to get give her back because she was my dog) we went though many moves as we were in military maybe like two with her i think but I've moved about 4-5 times not fun but it can always be good for those who were bullied fresh new start but yeah.

Channel for A&amp;E 265 On Friday's and SaturdaysOn Atlantic time ((meaning new York North Carolina Florida etc) 9pm-12amMidwest 8pm-11pmMountain time zone 7pm-10pmAn Nd Pacific time zone 6pm-9pm Sometimes the nights get extremely wildExample one. This guy is going a hundred mph with a baby in the back not buckled or in a car set the cops were lucky that even after the put caused the car to roll over she wasn't harmed then he starts shaking her like a maraca once they get her away he pulls out something we screamed ((my mom and I)) we thought he was going to shoot the cops but he was going to eat his weed.Then there was a time when a guy was trying to sell a baby.and what happened Friday....some people heard barking in the storm drain. It was a dog. Bleeding from the nose couldn't walk. It took about an hour for them to rescuse her with the help of a retired vet served 25 years as an army engineer ((my hero)) then Saturday we got the update that she is okay and with her owner turns out she fell into one of those big drains they deduced that from scratches on her back because she tried to pull herself up. But before they did the interview she got up and walked a little ate and drank a little. This dog is 17 years old as well. She's also a beautiful golden retriever.They also have sub parts Women on patrol which isn't on A&amp;E can't remember the channel as I don't watch that oneThere's court cam which hopefully will come back for season two Wednesdays there's live pd: pd cam where it's footage off of helicopter cams, dashboard, and the cams on the vests etcThen live pd wanted on Thursdays where they featured wanted feloniesAnd finally live pd which features everything where people say \"that's not mine\" I'm not joking a.lady once said that's not my groin I'm not joking at all. People run for the dumbest things. They also do a wanted and missing segments. Live pd has found multiple missing kids.
