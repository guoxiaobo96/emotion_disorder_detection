I dont know why I remember it so vividly, part of me says it was a dream or something, but another part just says its a memory. From what I remember the table was in a little wooden play house and I was also looking at the other kids playing through one of the windows. I from the memory I feel like I felt isolated but I dont know why. It was a mobile game called Kingdoms at War, you could join clans, there was a world chat, you would build your kingdom, all this stuff. I just would sometimes talk to people who were bored in world chat or talk to member of the clan I was in because a lot of them were older than me so I looked up to them.  I feel like it was through that game that I realized I had depression. I have only talked to my sister about our mental health once and it ended badly and I refuse to since. But we did talk about how our parents deal with it isnt the best. Our parents didnt have the best childhood ever. My dad watched his dad kill himself, and my moms family was just a mess. So we feel like that parents cant really understand that our sadness just happens for no reason, and they get frustrated when we cant tell them why we are upset. I remember at one point my dad got angry with me for something he was yelling that he was tired of my \u201cbullshit drama\u201d and he hit me. Since that its been very hard for me to be comfortable around my father. When I send my boyfriend the texts he is usually at work and I feel bad for bothering him but he will try his best to respond and he will ask me whats up or if I am safe and he will call me during his break or when he is on his way home from work. If I am with him he will just hold me or hold my hand and ask if he can do anything and usually I say no, so we will just sit there and watch a show or something or he will make me tea. We have talked before that its really hard to \u201cfix\u201d my sadness and that the best thing to do is just be there so he will do that. Or if I am anxious that I am too upset or too sad or too much of a problem he will reassure me that I am not a problem and that my mental health doesnt make our relationship hard.

{"dpp1ey5": {"text": "Well lets try this.\u2022I am a 19 year old female, from the US\u2022I have anxiety, depression, and  anorexia \u2022I have official diagnoses with depression and anxiety, but nothing for anorexia because I dont really talk to anyone about it\u2022Its odd because from a young age I remember being sad. The earliest was actually pre-school, I had put some rocks from our play ground on a wooden table and watched as some as them fell through the holes, and I just remember feeling so alone and I just pushed them off the table and asked myself \u201cwhy try?\u201d After that was fifth grade when I desperately wanted to fit in, although I was an average fifth grader I felt like I was bigger than everyone else (looking at pictures I wasnt) and thats when I started restricting and got very depressed. \u2022I feel like it was probably online, with random people on this mobile game in 6th grade. I never knew how to express negative emotions to those around me because I was very lucky and had a loving and great childhood. I felt an odd sense of relief because I wasn\u2019t alone even though it was a random stranger on the internet, even though my own father and older sister also have depression. \u2022I would focus on telling myself it was okay to be sad. I would hide my sadness so much. I remember in 7th grade I would ride the bus home and as soon as my friends left (they were the first stop I was the last) I would just cry. I just felt so alone and I just wish I could have told myself before all the self harm that it was okay to be sad. I think I would tell my friends so that way the wouldn\u2019t have to find out I was depressed because I was sent to a mental hospital. I dont know about my family though. I sadly have never been close to them. Talking about mental health with my parents always ended in yelling and I would get in trouble. \u2022I usually dont have very long depressive episodes but somethings can trigger them and they are usually very extreme episodes of where I feel very close to killing myself and that I really want to hurt myself. Sometimes I will paint on myself to distract myself or I will journal? Its kinda rare but I will just write out my most extreme emotions. Depressive episodes are pretty easy for me to recognize. \u2022I usually don\u2019t talk about it at all. My boyfriend is the one who knows the most about it with me because I spend a lot of time with him and one of the biggest promises we have is that I tell him when I am not okay. Just simply me texting him \u201cnot okay\u201d is all he wants. The only time I talked about it in other setting was in a class I had at my old school called principles of design. We had a set of assignments based on self portraits and my final was this book I carved out 3 sections in, one for each of my mental illnesses. I usually dont talk about it because it is hard, I have bottled it up for so long that any time I start trying to talk about it I usually cry. It much easier online for me because I dont have to see the person so I can cry as much as I want and it makes me less anxious. Journal post:\u201c11/10/17I will never be enough I ruin everything He is going to leave I will just be alone. He is going to hate me I am too anxious I am too much to handle I wont make him happyI ruin everything I ruin everything I should just leave so he can be happy He would be so much happier without me He could date anyone else and it would be so much easier for him. I am such a shitty person I am the worst He is going to leave\u201dHappened because I had two anxiety attacks that day semi related to him, driving makes me very anxious because a close friend died in a car crash and sometimes being in cars make me anxious. We were going on a date to a ramen shop and I just got anxious from all the traffic and construction, then later that night we were talking about some stuff that made me very anxious and I ended up having an anxiety attack and crying in his bathroom.   \u2022A TV show actually, and its Bojack Horseman on Netflix.
