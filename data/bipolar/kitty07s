That was another thing that was blocking me. I didn\u2019t have very hand on supervision most of my PhD and when it was time to finish, I was afraid of showing my work to my boss\u2019s boss because I thought my work was crap and had to perfect it before presenting. They finally told me they cannot help me if they don\u2019t know where I am. So I finally gave them drafts and they helped with each step. So ask for help and feedback. Unless your advisor is an asshole, they want you to finish, so even if you dread feedback it is better to get it earlier than sitting on it or worse working so much and then being asked why you did this and that.Anyways, just remember to take breaks and not make your life all about the PhD.

I was kind of symptom free for a long time. Had some depressive episodes, which is my main problem, because I don't really experience mania much. Then after a while, I was really stressed, and started having some sort of hallucinations and mini psychotic breaks. I am not sure I was really manic or not but I always associated psychotic breaks with being manic, and I was more talkative, irritable and more emotional, so I thought I was manic. Went to a psychiatrist, told them I was bipolar (as it was my diagnosis from 10 years ago) and having a manic episode. She said what I described wasn't mania. I was upset she wasn't' believing me and she prescribed psychotherapy for me and diagnosed me as schizoaffective. I wasn't having it and ditched that doctor altogether. But my mini psychosis soon after turned into a full blown psychosis. I was hospitalized for a few months. They kept observing me and they said they are trying to find a diagnosis. They asked for my medical files from my former hospital stay. Then they said they can't decide if I am bipolar or schizoaffective, but the treatment for me would be the same regardless of the diagnosis, mood stabilizer and antipsychotic. They finally went with bipolar and transferred me to a day clinic. The doctor there who had my file  said that although they had diagnosed me with bipolar, they still need to do differential diagnosis to see if I am schizoaffective. Later, again I was hospitalized for another psychosis. Again they couldn't decide. So they wrote both on my insurance, and when they transferred me out, they went with bipolar again but said they also strongly think it could be schizoaffective. The doctor, who is from the same clinic, decided to go with schizoaffective, and I think it was because after my mood stabilized I was still having psychotic symptoms, which was the only difference to differentiate the two. It is weird I think my first psychotic episode was indeed bipolar, but my second episode felt like a mix of bipolar and schizophrenia, and my third episode more like schizophrenia without bipolar. The weird thing they subtype they go for me was depressive subtype, so they were debating if I am bipolar or depressive schizoaffective. What I am saying there is so much overlap between the two, and especially with schizoaffective as it has a mood disorder in it, it is hard to say if you experience psychotic symptoms outside of a mood episode or not. But treatment is the same. unless they say is a non-psychotic bipolar, which then I would worry because if you have psychotic symptoms you need antipsychotics.", "link_id": "t3_f8r5ro", "time": 1582591122}}

Maybe after finishing your dissertation and while preparing for defense, you can start applying for jobs, worst case scenario, you go back home after finishing, but I am sure eventually you can find a job in the UK.

He told me it is ok and it is a side effect and my mental health is more important. He told I was underweight anyways (I wasn't!  the low limit is 122 lb for my height) and once I am out I can just run a bit more without changing my food.

I have asked many doctors and psychiatrist about it , and they have told me that  with this particular drug it happens in a lot of patient and eating less is really not the answer, as you would have to go with really low amounts that will cause more side effects with the drug and make you lose muscle.

I think a lot of overweight people at one point in their life decide to lose weight and they they would go on a cleanse diet of eating not more than 500 cals for a few weeks and they drop a large amount of weight in short period. They think after this purge diet is completed they can eat like they used to and not gain anymore and it backfires. That is why slow and steady approach and making it a lifestyle is important and more successful for permanent weight control.   I also think that heavy guilt around eating can make someone develop eating disorder in either direction. There are for example people who binge knowing it is bad for them but they feel they deserve destroying their body like that because of the guilt.  Fat Acceptance movement, however, are hijacking  elements of body positivity and eating disorder treatments that can be used for good use , to normalize  and promote BED.  Yes over-restriction and constant thought of needing to diet can backfire, but it doesn't mean people should not  practice sustainable eating habits that includes caloric restriction to lose weight if they are overweight.  It is always better to gradually fix bad habits/addiction than quitting cold turkey, but reducing it is a step that needs to be taken. Same goes with overeating problem. You can't make it stop by telling people to not eat anything until they are normal weight, but they have to reduce their calorie intake to get there. ", "link_id": "t3_734z9q", "time": 1506698529}}
