{"fuyt2ih": {"text": "Have people been missing any those news articles about children being mauled by dogs? I live in the UK and I swear there's one incident every month.OP's friends are definitely in the wrong, but she should not be keeping her dog as a pet. It really should become a working dog as it's clearly not safe to have as a pet. Unless she's committed to keeping her dog locked inside forever, her dog will most likely attack someone or another animal while out walking.I don't get why people have down voted you so much. Is this a Western thing? Believing animals are harmless because you keep them in your homes? The person's whose comment you replied to is for sure dumb. I'm South American. In my country we're not this naive. It's a dangerous country with a high crime rate and corrupt police. Do you know how we protect ourselves? We keep dogs. Almost every house has at least one dog. The dogs are treated like beloved members of the family, but we have enough common sense to remember they are predators. Our dogs have free rein in our yards and are showered with love, but will viciously attack anyone who steps foot in that yard that doesn't belong there. We don't train them to attack. It's pure animal instinct. We  treat dogs with respect and accept them for the animals they are, we don't anthropomorphize them.In regards to your comment, I've actually been involved in a situation involving a dog like OPs. One time when I was around 7 years old, my aunt's dog escaped from her home and came next door to ours. I was playing with my cousins and we were downstairs while our parents were upstairs. The doors to our home were open because it had been a hot day. The dog came straight inside to us and we were absolutely terrified. It tried to attack us, so we did our best to protect ourselves. One of my cousin's was able to hide behind the fridge door, I climbed onto a table that had our Christmas tree, and my youngest cousin hid in the bathroom. The younger cousin was 4 years old. During the attack, the youngest got terrified so did what any child would do, she left the safety of the bathroom to try and run upstairs to her mum. The minute the dog realised it had a reachable target, it went for her. Thankfully she got saved. The minute she hit the first step, our cat came walking past her. It's as if he knew she needed him. The cat provided a distraction and the dog attacked it and killed it instead. It left with our cat in it's mouth. That was the first time that the dog had ever killed another animal. Case in point: some dogs do see small children as prey. In case anyone has forgotten - a child is also a small harmless animal, why would you expect dogs to view them differently?", "link_id": "t3_h9pire", "time": 1592271224}}

It was quite the norm for kids to shower together or with our mums until like the age of 12+. It was also okay for others to use the toilet etc. while someone was showering. Everyone was really relaxed about nudity. I'm the only prude in my mum's family, because I eventually moved countries to live with my dad and his wife and  finally learnt about bathroom locks.I think things may have been that way in our all female household partly because we were in a country where the water and electricity would get cut off regularly. We also only had one bathroom. Makes sense that showering was a communal thing. Sometimes it was even a public thing, because when the water got cut off you had to take a bucket outside and use water from the water tank. Although, underwear stayed on during the public bathing.I now live with my mum and cat. The bathroom door is only ever closed when we have guests. I have IBS, so have to use the toilet quite frequently. If the bathroom door didn't stay open, my mum would never be able to get ready for work, etc. On top of that my mum has urinary incontinence, when she has to go she has to go or she'll literally wet herself. Bathroom door being open let's her use the toilet while I'm showering. My cat is very fond of the bathroom door open policy too. He cries hysterically whenever there's a locked door between us. He also thinks me being on the toilet is bonding time and likes to sit on my knees. I hope I never have to re-home him. He's gonna take that habit with him to his grave.

I ended up working for an organisation that where my manager would actively try to get me in trouble with HR because she wasn't happy I had to take time off for therapy. She claimed I should have disclosed it during the interview at least, so they could have make preparations. I'm pretty sure she meant they wouldn't have hired me if they'd known I was disabled. It was a shitty temp job, so I didn't fight her on it. Just put up with her and left when my contract came to an end.I completely disclosed everything at my current job from day one, so that they would know I would eventually need to take time out, etc. Worked in my favour. It meant my employers had a legal duty to make reasonable adjustments to help me with my work from day one.

I am very lucky though as most places won't be as great as my workplace. It's a law clinic and very disability friendly as other stuff have disabilities too.You need to ensure that if you ever need help at work because of your mental health conditions, your employer won't refuse to help you. They'll know that they agreed to make reasonable adjustments to help you do your work from the minute they hired you. It's is a legal requirement that they need to meet.

No idea how they justified their inaction to themselves.As for family friends and members of the public, maybe it was just a different time. My abuse happened around the early 2000s.

I was a 27 year old virgin with generalised anxiety disorder, who had run away from home at the age 25 to escape my abusive father. He was an introverted 25 year old, who was suffering from clinical depression and had previously attempted suicide. Initially most of our time together was spent helping me get more comfortable around him due to my severe anxiety, panic attacks and touch phobia. In the end, it got too much for me and I opted to start taking medication to help me cope better. Once my meds kicked in, I was able to focus more on him and realised that he was just as damaged as I was.His longest ever relationship had been with a girl from his high school. They dated for 5 years and it was awful. She used to emotionally, mentally and physically abuse him. She would literally stab him with things, he even has scars. She was suicidal too and would gaslight him into thinking that if he didn't do what she wanted, then she'd kill herself. His depression and suicidal feelings developed as a result of that.Here's the bit I didn't like, to me it was so clear that all the problems he was experiencing mentally stemmed from the abuse he suffered at the hands of his ex. However, despite the fact that his doctor knew what had happened during that past relationship, my ex was never offered mental health support or even trauma support. Thanks to that my ex just assumed that his depression was just part of his personality. He thought it developed on its own like it was a part of puberty or something. I spent the last couple months of our relationship trying to get him to see that he needed therapy because his relationship with his ex had been abusive. He used to just refer to that relationship as a bad relationship and didn't even realise/acknowledge that he had been adused. He kept brushing me off and in the end that's what caused our breakup.We broke up after our first ever argument, because he got triggered and basically started seeing me as his abusive ex. His head couldn't separate the two of us together and so he went on a rampage. Completely verbally attacked then broke up with me. Eventually he completely cut me out of his life and once that was done, I guess he'd realised that he did need help after all. He sought therapy and started taking medication couple months after our breakup.He seems to be doing well these days, now that he's getting the help he needed. He did try to reach out to me months after our breakup, but to this day I'm still a bit traumatised by how much damage he caused to me during that breakup.", "link_id": "t3_gzydtl", "time": 1591752815}}

He also knows exactly what to do when I need to change positions, like if shift him to the side slightly, he'll immediately move himself to where he needs to be. Cats are incredibly smart, it just takes them a while to learn your routine.Please don't get rid of your cat, you can do it! You just need find ways to get keep your cat preoccupied so you can get time to study. I have a friend who is currently in lockdown with a six year old, she's also sitting exams. It's not easy, but doable.I would recommend investing in interactive pet toys, toys that your cat can play with by himself. Once he loses interest, I would suggest you feed him as cats will usually groom themselves and nap after eating. You should be able to be to get some work done while he's playing, eating and napping.If you have a window that is close to a main road, I would suggest you get a cat tree and place it in front the window. Cats love spending time watching people, birds, etc. My cat can literally spend hours just looking out the window. Sometimes when I'm sleeping and he doesn't feel like sleeping, he'll leave me to go sit at the window.As your cat is already used to outside, you will need to leash train him.

I realised early on that he was super clever and bound to escape at some point, since he figured out how to open some of the doors in my flat by the age of 1. He also used to dash out whenever we opened the door and didn't know he was behind us. Thankfully we always caught him before he got completely out the door. I got super scared that one one day we wouldn't be quick enough, so I trained him how to walk on a harness and leash. I try to take him for a walk at least once every two days. He loves it. He walks like a dog would. I've taken off the leash a couple times when we've been outside just to see what he would do and he completely surprised me.

I struggle with the same thing quite a lot.My usual way of coping is to withdraw completely from socialising until I feel a bit better in myself.

Once I feel better, I'll start speaking to my friends again and  just tell them I've been unwell if they ask where I disappeared to.Withdrawing might be your best option at the moment until you learn better coping habits. Are you receiving therapy? The withdrawal doesn't need to be for long.

{"fsdoj0z": {"text": "Reading your comment is a blast from the past. Your father sounds exactly like mine. I'm 29 now, but I had to run away from home when I was 25. He had the same mentality. He thought he had a right to physically, emotionally, verbally and financially abuse the women in his life. I moved in with him when I was  10 because he convinced my mum that he would be better at raising me. He was married at the time and my stepmum was sometimes just as bad as him. She never did anything to defend or protect me. I think she thought I was a scapegoat. My father used to hit her and she never did anything to stop it. When I entered the picture, he focused all his attention on me. I think my stepmum was happy I was there to take the beatings instead.At the time I ran away, my father had recently remarried and had another child. He had moved out and left me with ex-wife because I wasn't allowed to move out of his first house. He said started trying to force me to move in with his new wife and child. I got do terrified I finally summoned the strength and courage to reach out to a domestic violence support organisation and they found me somewhere to live so I could run away.Your post has shown me what my life would have been like if I hadn't run out. My little brother is around 6 years old now and I don't doubt that my father has already started abusing him. He abuses his new wife openly and regularly. I think having to experience my little brother being abused too, would have been the reason I killed myself. I've mostly blocked out his existence from my mind, because I can't cope with feeling guilty about him still being with my father. I've been told by therapist that there's nothing I can do for him. It's up to his mum to protect him. If I intervene my father will know it was me and he'll star targeting me and my mother. I had to take him to court when I ran away to stop him from hurting us. I don't want to go through that experience again.How old are your siblings? Are you in America? I have recently realised the American domestic violence support services aren't as good as the UK. There's not much you can do to improve the situation. There is hope that things will get better though. It might just take a while.

{"fs6kal3": {"text": "What you are asking is something I can't answer. It's something I wish didn't exist either. What you're talking about is more to do with how men and women are socialised from a young age. Women are still very much taught that their role in a relationship is to be subservient because they need to satisfy their male partner's needs. They need to be able to cook, clean and essentially be a good housewife. Along with that comes the notion that the men are the providers. Women look after the house and men look after the money.It's unfair to expect women to behave the same when they're generally not raised to see themselves as equal to men.In your case, it's also dependent on who you are dating. For me personally, I'm bossy. I will always ensure I have the final say on where I go on dates, will always insist I pay my way, even though I'm 3K in debt, earn minimum wage and know for a fact my boyfriend is earning more than double than what I do. The reason I do that is because my father was one of those men who believed that a man's job was to earn money to financially take care of his woman and a woman's job was to take care of the home and bend over backwards to please her man. With that backwards mentality came the belief that men are superior to women and women are essentially property that men can treat however they want. My father would financially support his housewife, but in return he expected her to continue to take care of the home diligently even though he was beating her black and blue and openly cheating on her. I pay my own way so that no man will think he owns me or is entitled to treat me however he wants just because he bought me dinner. Thankfully my boyfriend has more sense than me and will take my card away before I can pay or I'd officially be bankrupt by now. Unfortunately my principles don't pay my rent and bills.On that note, there are still men out there who think that women should sleep with them on the first date because they bought them dinner.

Age doesn't matter. It seems as if they just want to control you.I am sorry you're having such a difficult time with them. You should also look into getting support for you mental health because it's likely to have a negative effect on you later on if it hasn't already.I went through something similar with my mum two years ago. I lost my virginity at a late age due to a lot of personal issues. I was 27 when it happened and my mum was living with me. My mum had suspected that my ex-boyfriend and I had started having sex, but it got confirmed to her when I started spending nights at his. The first night I stayed at his place was awful. Literally an hour after I got to his, my mum started calling and messaging me. She did that until 6am the next day. I didn't sleep at all that night. I blocked her calls, but her messages came through. They were insane. In the messages she kept threatening to call the police and to come looking for me. Then they got incredibly hurtful. She basically told me I was a cheap whore and my ex-boyfriend was only using me for my body. Her behaviour carried on for a week after that and she even got family and friends to call me to tell me off. In the end she had to stop because I told her I'd kick her out if she continued, she was the one living with me. She did stop and we were able to continue living in harmony, but the damage was done.To this day, I'm no longer as affectionate with her as I was before. I'm weary of telling her anything and firmly keep her out of my relationships. I love her and would die for her, but I no longer trust her. It has also affected my current relationship. I've been with my boyfriend for two years now and I've never spent the night at his. I'm also hesitant to have sex with him. Even though my mum has met him and likes him, I am still scared that her horrendous behaviour from two years ago will come back.The only remotely funny thing about the whole situation was that my mum always assumed that I was having passionate sex with my ex-boyfriend whenever I spent nights or weekends at his, but in reality it was never that exciting. My ex was asexual and had a nonexistent sex drive. We used to have sex on average once every two weeks and that wasn't from lack of trying on my part. Half the time I was at his, he ignored me in favour of working from home. He was a workaholic.", "link_id": "t3_gqpeoj", "time": 1590539701}}

If a friend or partner said the same thing to me, I would do the same. If anything, I've learnt that the correct response to someone close to you telling you about the abuse they suffered, is anger at the perpetrator for hurting someone you love. I have even had friends who have said that they'd love to beat up my perpetrator abusing the child me. That was a more appropriate thing to say than what you boyfriend said.Please read this:http://speakaboutitonline.com/2013/11/05/a-mans-response/ It shows the way your boyfriend should have behaved if he actually cared about you as much as you say he does.You may need to step back and imagine if it was your best friend or future child this had happened to.

{"frttfxj": {"text": "I'm a 29 year old female here. I've been on antidepressants for almost two years now. So far I've been on Lexapro and Zoloft. Lexapro was my wonder drug. For the first time in my life I was able to feel something other than anxiety. It was as if I'd finally become a person instead of a bad impression of one. The physical symptoms of my anxiety almost completely disappeared. I no longer shook when I got anxious or had to try to walk on jelly legs. I felt over the moon and was finally able to take control of my life. I even had my first relationship. Something that my anxiety had previously made impossible. My wonder drug had drawbacks though. As happy as I was on it, it wasn't perfect. I was drowsy all the time and I mean all the time. I slept through alarms, struggled to get out of bed, was always late to work, fell asleep in meetings and also on public transport. I lived like the walking dead for a year just because I thought the benefits outweighed the side effect.I eventually decided to speak to my doctor about changing my medication, because my constant lateness to work was affecting my mental health. I'm prone to self hatred, so would spend mornings hating myself for not being able to get out of bed/stop sleeping. My doctor switched me to Zoloft and my god it was awful. From the first week I noticed an immediate change. My mood was dipping lower than it had in years, my anxiety was so out of control I might and well have not been taking anything, and I was even disassociating without there being an actual trigger. My doctor told me to stock it out, because my body was supposedly getting used to the medication. I took it for almost three months then had to stop. The worst side effect of all was insomnia. I went from sleeping too much to getting no sleep at all. I had trouble falling asleep and once I did fall asleep, I woke up literally every hour.In the end my doctor agreed that I couldn't continue not sleeping, so I got switched to Venlafaxine. Venlafaxine is an SNRI. I've been on it for about five months now and so far I don't have any problems. My depression and anxiety are under control. I don't really have any problems with sleeping like I did on the other medication. I do have the occasional night that I struggle to sleep, but those are my fault since it's usually because I got too worked about a Reddit post I read before bed.My advice to you is to speak to your doctor the minute you notice that your body isn't reacting well to the medication, so that they can monitor it. You'll need to change the medication if the side effects start having a big impact/negative effect on your life.Unfortunately, antidepressants are just one if those things that involve a lot of trial and error. You may need to try a few before you find the right one for you.Edit: I keep forgetting I'm 29 now.

I kept getting fired after either engaging in risky behaviours at work due to the abuse cycle I was trapped in, or for having zero motivation to turn up to work or actually do any work. Eventually I got fed up and went back to doing voluntary work for a law clinic I used to volunteer at while I was still at university. I got lucky because the Director at the law clinic was someone who my parents had known since I was a child. He was very kind and always checked up on me to see if I was doing okay, so eventually I felt comfortable enough to tell him my father was abusing me. He encouraged me to seek help for my mental health and also to escape my father. Eventually I think he grew to care about a lot and wanted to take care of me, so he offered me a job at the law clinic. I've been working there for three years now. The Director himself also grew up with an abusive father and was physically disabled. Due to his bad experiences in life, he basically developed a big open heart and genuinely cares for everyone who walks through the doors of our law clinic. He regularly checks in with the staff to see if we're okay and lets us discuss personal problems with him. He essentially turned our office into a home and our colleagues into a family.One of the reasons why I've been beating myself up so much about not being able to tell my boyfriend about my feelings and insecurities, is that our Director passed away from COVID-19 in March. His death broke my heart in half. In the three years I've worked for him, he became my father figure. He always told me how proud he was of me and he regularly complimented me. He understood how difficult it was for me at work sometimes due to my mental illnesses and always made adjustments so that I could manage better. He also told me he loved me, and unlike when my father did it, I knew he meant it. My biggest regret is that he died before I could tell him how much I loved him.

This is my second relationship. The first relationship crashed and burned because it was all too new to me. I was so infatuated with my ex that I bent over backwards to make him happy, I even started taking antidepressants for my anxiety to make our relationship easier. I did that for months, in the end I got angry because he refused to do the one thing that meant a lot to me - meet my best friend, the only friend I've been able to keep from my teenage years and the only friend that hasn't stopped being friends with me despite our many arguments over the years. I got angry and of course it was out of proportion. I'd never reacted that way before in our 6 months of dating. It took him by surprise and he overreacted and got triggered (he'd had a 5 year abusive relationship before me). We broke up like two days after the argument.I've tried my hardest to get this second relationship right because my boyfriend is nothing like my ex. I don't feel like I need to always put him first. I matter too in this relationship. It's not perfect, but he seems willing to work on it with me which is more than I could ever hope for.I'm the same with friends. I only have a handful of friends and they're actually people I work with. I've found these friendships easier to maintain because I'm a different person at work. I'm more confident and have my shit together. I know what needs to be done and have confidence in my abilities. I don't see my friends socially very often due to us living far away from each other and having busy lives, but it's worked for me. It's saved me from getting into petty arguments with them like I did with past failed friendships. My friends are supportive and know about my mental illnesses. They don't understand but some relate due to having issues with anxiety. It's made me feel comfortable explaining to them why I may have reacted a certain way. I also only ever text them, this has made sure I have filter in place and don't snap at them as much as I would in person.I wish I could give you some relationship advice, but I'm still inexperienced. The only thing I've learnt from this second relationship is that it's better to take things slow. Despite being together for almost two years, my boyfriend and I haven't spent the weekend together. I usually see him twice a week and it's almost always after work. We usually just either go have dinner, watch stuff on Netflix or go out to museums/cinemas (before lockdown).

He'd either get hit by a car the minute he stepped outside or get a attacked by a dog (almost everyone here owns dogs).I started walking him on a leash when he was around 6 months old. I didn't do any adjustment training or anything. Just put the harness on him and led the way out the door. Walking a cat is a lot different from walking a dog. Cats like sitting and watching people, smelling plants and going in their own direction. It took a while to get used to my cat's idea of a walk. Eventually he got more confident and actually properly started walking around. He'll lead the way he wants to go and knows what direction to go in in order to get home.I know it'll be a struggle to get the harness on but you need to do it. My cat doesn't like being held either. The first couple months he either attacked me or ran when he saw the harness. I'd recommend maybe grabbing your cat in a towel to put the harness on, that way there's at least some protection from scratches. Once you get the harness on you can do one of two things. Tie the lead to something in your home and open the window (assuming you're on the ground floor) or tie the lead to something near your front door and open the door. This will get your cat used to the harness and The feeling of being outside without being able to roam free. You might find just physically being outside on the leash is enough for your cat. My cat used to try and run out the window and door too despite me walking him semi-regularly. I've noticed that since I started tying him close to the window and door, he'll just go outside and sit near the window and door and watch people waking by on the main road.  It's helped because the one time he escaped through an open window without us knowing, we found him sitting outside the window. He didn't even try to go further even though the leash wasn't on him to stop him.Walking him on a leash has also taught him that he needs to wait for me in order to explore. I've been taking him off his leash to give him some freedom when we're outside walking (while he's wearing a gps tracker collar), I usually stay super close to him and grab the harness clip when he starts wandering towards the road or in bushes where there may be foxes. He has escaped me a couple times by running off behind the building we live in when I haven't been quick enough to grab the harness, surprisingly the little runaway has always stopped when he's realised I'm way behind him. He'll actually stop, watch me and wait for me to come closer so I can grab him take him back away from the road.", "link_id": "t3_goze4s", "time": 1590252166}}

{"frb0evu": {"text": "Oh sorry, I think you missed something I posted before or did I not post it. Bit confused.So here the government has a legal obligation to pay the rent for shelters/refuges. I should say the \"FULL RENT\". Capitals because for us this is super important. Despite the fact of there being a welfare system in place here and the government assisting people with the rents through that, there is a set limit of how much the government will pay for the rent. E.g. a private landlord can charge \u00a32000 per month for rent, but the government may only pay up to \u00a31500, which leaves the tenant to find the remainder of the rent. Now Refuges are so so special the government can't complain or say no. For that reason, the private organisations that own Refuges will charge an extortionate amount for the rent. E.g. some charge \u00a31200 per month per person for what is essentially a bedroom in a shared building that has 20 other people.Because the government has a legal responsibility to pay your rent, most people fleeing domestic violence are advised to quit their jobs. Makes sense too because abuser could get access to you there e.g. my dad harassed my previous employers and got his wife to do it too, to try and track me down. Most people usually turn up to Refuges with no money and barely and personal belongings. It's all fine though, because the rent is paid by the government and welfare provides money for you to live on. If you work you get punished, because the government will expect you to pay the rent or at least contribute a decent amount. I'm actually in debt because of that bit. Didn't listen to advice and stupidly decided to work. Stays in Refuges, are usually only for around 9 months. Once the time is up the Refuge is supposed to assist you with securing your own accommodation. For victims of domestic violence, we are given priority when it comes to government housing, so more often than not we are able to move into affordable homes.That is tricky, but in the case of your mother, you'd have to opt to move super far away. Like here, let's say you were in London like me, you'd have to move out of London and go at least 4 hours away. There's shelters and support organisations in every city at every corner of the country. Support is always kept local too. It'd be quite difficult to run into someone you know because of that and would be hard for your mother to predict where you'd end up. Also, Refuges tend to have a waiting list, so say if you got a place this month and your mother then tried getting into the Refuge to find you, it wouldn't be the same one. There wouldn't be an available space in your Refuge for at least a month or two, therefore, she'd get sent to another Refuge altogether.", "link_id": "t3_gnfdwa", "time": 1590030002}}

Things here would be the same as it is in America if it wasn't for their hard work. At the moment they are still campaigning, but thanks to movements like \"me too\", the attitude of the government has changed as they've had to take note of public feelings. E.g. charitable organisations that support victims of domestic violence have recently been contacting newspapers to tell them exactly how horrendous the situation has been due to the coronavirus lockdowns.

OP should have specified country. Not all countries are created equal.That's actually pretty good that your police have the ability to take you to a temporary shelter. Ours have no idea where the shelters are. Whenever you approach them for help or anywhere connected to the government, their answer is that they can't help you, go elsewhere. That's when you have to turn to charitable organisations, who then have to make loads and loads of calls to Refuges/shelters around the country until they find one with space.I know OP didn't say charity workers should be underpaid. I was trying to educate them, because it's not a well known fact that it's the charitable sector that actually provides the services for victims of domestic violence. A lot of people assume it's the government that does all of this, so then start to expect the impossible. And you're wrong, what you should want is for your government to care enough about victims of domestic violence to provide the services instead of relying on the charitable sector.Also, in law there's something called employer's liability. I'm pretty sure it exists in most countries. Employer's liability means that the employer is responsible for any injury/bad thing that happens to the employee in the course of their work. To protect themselves, employers have insurance covers for this reason. No employer would be able to afford to send what is essentially an office worker to a volatile situation involving abuse for them to assist the victim, when said office worker could be physically attacked.

The government has a legal obligation to house you if you are in a DV situation or a situation where you are essentially homeless, if you have children, have a disability or are elderly. If you're childless, fit and healthy, you're screwed and have to rely on the charitable sector. I'm surprised you got turned away because you were being abused by a parent. 10/10 would recommend you leave that country. Here in the UK domestic violence is domestic violence. It doesn't matter who the perpetrator is. I was placed into a normal women's Refuge, and just to show you how specific needs get met, the Refuge was just for Asian women. Our Refuge was filled with both women who had kids and women without children. 90% were women who had fled their partners/husbands, but there was two of us who were fleeing our parents.In the Refuges/shelters here, the only reason why people get turned away is if they own property. You're seen as having the financial means to support yourself if you have a home, because you can sell it and use the proceeds to support yourself after going through the courts.Another thing is that, some women actually don't need to go as far as going into a Refuge but they don't know it. Married women are protected by law when it comes to their home. There's laws that allow them to get injunctions to stop their abuser from entering the home or coming near the home.I'm surprised that your homeless shelters would make you quit your job. Here the government has an obligation to pay for supported accommodations like Refuges and basically throw a party if you're working. Rent for Refuges are \u00a31200 per month per person here. Shelters cost around the same unless they are night only shelters - those are free. You working means they save a bucket load of money.I am sorry you had such a difficult time escaping your abuser. I hope your country improves in the future to make it easier for people like yourself who desperately need help.", "link_id": "t3_gnfdwa", "time": 1590013543}}

Unfortunately, due to the trauma people in these relationships, they don't see it that way. It's the talking to family and friends that usually gets them to see that they can leave, the option is there, and they just need to summon the strength to make the first move. They need the encouragement from other people.You can't force someone in an abusive relationship to just up and leave their partne They have to do it on their own. In situations where the person has been forced to leave the abuser, you will find that the person actually returns to the abuser. This happens quite a lot with couples who have been forced to separate by social services for the sake of the children. Also, that's why domestic violence therapy is offered to people who are still in abusive relationships. The aim of the therapy is to get them to see that they aren't powerless, they deserve to be treated better and that they can leave.The police offer the service you are talking about. They actually have the power to turn up at the home and protect the victim from the abuser while they pack their stuff to leave. The victim just needs to actually call the police first.As someone also mentioned, there are charitable organisations in almost every country that are set up to support victims of domestic violence with relocation and rebuilding their lives. This service is usually accessible through a national domestic violence helpline.I'm a legal advisor for an organisation that provides free legal advice to people in need and have also supported victims of DV with rebuilding their lives. I was also a victim of DV who was provided an accommodation in a women's refuge by a charity that supports victims of DV after I went to them for help escaping my abusive father. They found the accommodation for me, bur rightly so, it was up to me to pack my stuff and plan my move with the support of friends.Only the police should have authority to intervene in physically assisting someone with escaping their abuser. It would be unfair to ask charity workers to put themselves in harm's way. Their employers wouldn't even be able to afford that insurance cover. As someone who works for a charity, let me tell you, we are paid almost minimum wage, which no where near enough for the stress we deal with. We do our jobs because we want to help from the bottom of our hears, but we are also people too and need to protect and look after ourselves.

The lockdown has been bringing back stuff that I've been trying really hard to forget.My dad was abusive in a lot of ways. He was physically, emotionally and financially abusive. The worst one though was how controlling he was. I was essentially locked in our home from the age of 10 to 25. I was only allowed out for school and work, but literally had to run home the minute that that finished, because I was timed. The only person I was allowed to see and go out with was my mum. However, I had to stay locally with her, couldn't go over or stay over at hers. I wasn't allowed to go out with my friends, so I lost most of them as a result. I couldn't even go to the store to buy stuff for my period without asking permission.The lockdown has made me feel exactly like I did back then. I feel trapped in a never ending cycle.

For me even applying pressure over the skin causes some pain. I've also had a gynecologist do a test that you could also try. He inserted his finger on one hand into me and also pushed down on one of my ovaries with the other hand.

{"fr03lyw": {"text": "29F here. Definitely not an expert when it comes to sex, but I am a semi-expert on mental health since I suffer from so many mental illnesses. Like some have said here, your friend is suffering from extreme anxiety and self-hatred related to sex. The evidence is there from what happened during your attempt at a first time. The nausea is a clear sign, anxiety always affects the stomach when it's past moderate level. The hitting himself while being on the verge of tears is his self-hatred getting out of control.Some people have suggested that he may have gone through something traumatic as a child, I agree. I don't think he reacted that way during the first time attempt because of childhood trauma though. He reached that way because of the trauma caused by his past relationships. For some reason, people never actually recognise that men, like women, can be traumatised from past romantic relationships. Not sure if it's because they think men are too \"strong\" to be affected like that by a woman. What he went through with those previous relationships would have been traumatic for anyone, especially the relationship where the woman withheld sex. I think that would have been the worst one and it may be the source of the extreme self hatred he has. I imagine what happened during and after that relationship, was that he felt that he wasn't \"good enough\" to have sex with since the woman kept withholding sex.I agree with everyone, please try to rekindle your friendship with him. He didn't stop talking to you because you did anything wrong, he stopped talking to you because he cares a lot about what you think of him. He's too embarrassed and filled with self-hatred. He probably thinks that you hate him and think extremely badly of him because of how the first time attempt went. Shutting people out after a bad social interaction, is quite a common thing that people with anxiety issues do. Please, please don't give up on him. Your attempt at a first time with him would have likely become another traumatic experience for him. It's going to be a very very long time before he attempts to have sex again because of it. He will also not attempt to confide in anyone else again, like he did with you, because he'll think he'll end up embarrassing himself again. You are most likely the only person who knows how much he's suffering . Please don't let him continue to suffer in silence. His mental health will only get worse.I myself suffer from generalised anxiety disorder. My anxiety is so bad that I have to run to the toilet whenever my anxiety gets past the normal level. I have been diagnosed with IBS as a result. During the period I lost my virginity, I had to take anti-diarrhea meds every day and cut down drastically on how much I ate. I lost so much weight as a result. Whenever I thought being intimate with my ex, my bowels would die. It got so bad that I never ate when I was with him. We'd go on dinner dates where I'd just sit there and watch him eat. I only confessed to having IBS after four months of being together. He probably though I had an eating disorder. Despite all that, I did manage to lose my virginity, although took several attempts at PIV due to the effects of my antidepressants, which ensured I was never turned on enough.As someone who also blocks people out of their lives regularly due to severe anxiety and worry about what other people think of me, I would suggest you start reconnecting with your friend through baby steps. Send him short messages several times a week. Doesn't have to be super personal and he doesn't need to reply. You could just tell him about your day, send him a funny meme or if you know the sort of things he likes (favourite food, etc) you could say \"have you tried this?\". This approach is very likely to work. It will take time though. It's the approach I took with my ex who was suffering from clinical depression. He would sometimes just stop talking to me due to how badly he was feeling. He was receiving any help or taking any meds, despite his diagnosis. I ignored his silence and kept messaging him throughout, because I understood it wasn't personal since I did the radio silence  sometimes myself with friends. According to my ex, it showed him that I did care about him and it did make him feel a bit better. He said it's also the reason why he fell for me as we had just been friends at that point.Once he does start replying, you could just throw in some stories of awkward first times? It will help him feel better if he knows that it's quite common not to have the perfect first time.

{"fqw2ioe": {"text": "This was me up until three years ago. I'm the opposite though, I had a very traumatic childhood and early adulthood. As a result of the trauma, I developed depression, severe anxiety, PTSD and haphephobia (fear of touching and being touched). Despite all that, I decided at the age of 27 that I'd had enough of being single and I was convinced that if I didn't do anything about it, I'd be single for the rest of my life.I took up internet dating and ended up having my first adult relationship. Before this, I'd also just had quite a few first dates that didn't even end with a kiss. From the start of my relationship I was very open with my now-ex. I told him about the what I went through, how my mental illnesses affect me and how bad my haphephobia was. We agreed that we should just start out as friends because we both seemed to have a lot going on. He was also suffering from clinical depression and had previously been in five year relationship with an extremely abusive ex. It took us about three months from things to progress from just friends and once we started down that route, I began to struggle more.My anxiety was so bad that, I wouldn't let him look at me head on. I was convinced that he was judging negatively whenever he looked at me too intently, which triggered my panic attacks. Haphephobia meant that the thought of him touching me or me touching me also triggered panic attacks. The haphephobia was the hardest to deal with, because it meant the physical side of our relationship took a while to progress. My ex was very good about the whole thing. He decided that I needed exposure therapy, so introduced touch into our relationship by using baby steps. He started by hugging me often and holding my hand whenever we were out. Eventually I became fine with those aspects, but kissing was a whole different story. The haphephobia was still there for that and I was convinced that my lack of experience would cause my ex to leave me, therefore, wouldn't let him kiss me. He used exposure therapy for that too. He started off by regularly kissing me on the cheek and then proceeded to kiss me all over my face but avoided my lips. He was funny about the whole thing. At one point he was so desperate to kiss me, that he said he would kiss his hand and then I should kiss it after \ud83d\ude02. Eventually I think it got too much for him and he added light pecks to the lips whenever he was smothering my face in kisses. His exposure therapy worked and soon I was returning his kisses and learning how to kiss properly from him. Things naturally progressed to sex from there.The journey to that point was really difficult and definitely one of the most anxious periods in my life. My ex's gentleness and understanding did help me overcome the barriers in our relationship, but so did medication. I decided to finally look into taking them, because I would also get panic attacks whenever I was about to meet my ex or whenever I was going to his and I knew we'd be alone. I knew that if the panic attacks continued, there was no way our relationship could ever progress. The medication helped reduce the panic attack feelings I was getting.I think therapy would definitely help you. You'd also need to be open with potential partners, because that way you'd be able to weed out the time wasters. You need someone patient, kind and understanding to help you overcome your fears.

It's their job to ensure you're getting the support you need. Getting them involved means that HR can't fire or punish you without them getting involved. It gives you protection because it's not you vs your workplace. It's you supported by a specialist organisation vs your workplace. Mental health services usually have a list organisations like this that they can refer their clients to.The other option is for you to request to see an occupational therapist. I'm not sure how the request for this one works. Might be through HR or your doctor. The occupational therapist would then do an assessment to see what type of support you need and pass it on to your employer for them to implement.We all spend a lot of time at our workplaces to not get the support we need. Please don't suffer in silence. It sounds like your team leader actually just doesn't understand or know anything about your condition. The only way to solve that is to go above him and do one of the two things I mentioned, or take it upon yourself to educate him.", "link_id": "t3_gjwlim", "time": 1589519430}}
{"fqnv1cg": {"text": "Yes! It's actually something that I've started being open about in the last five years. I ran away from my abuser with the help of a specialist organisation. The path to them only became clear after I finally stopped keeping the abuse silent and talked about it with my doctor, etc. After I ran away, I got placed in a women's refuge and put into group therapy for victims of domestic violence. Initially it was a very strange experience, I was used to keeping quiet about how I actually felt and how much I was struggling with simple day to day things. It took a while, and many group sessions, before I actually started to open up. I found once I started, it was easy to continue talking about it, but only with people I thought wouldn't judge me afterwards. I became very open with colleagues who were close friends in my previous jobs. It wasn't always easy. They didn't necessarily know how to react, but they were kind.I never disclosed anything officially to my previous employers, because I know some would look for any old excuse to discriminate against you. I have been really open at my current job though. My colleagues and employers know I have been diagnosed with several mental illnesses, I'm on antidepressants and I struggle quite a lot with certain stuff and need their support regularly. It's a bit different with them, because we're a small charitable organisation. The size has enabled us to form familial bonds with each other. Everyone is really open about their health, problems with their lives, etc. It's always been that way, mainly because of my boss who recently passed away. He was a very open man. He always shared how he was feeling with us, talked about negative past events in his life, and made an effort to always check in on us. He was our unofficial office counsellor. He set the tone of the office and we all followed his example. It's honestly amazing. I love it. I love that I don't have to suffer in silence. I don't have to pretend I'm coping. I can admit when I'm struggling and ask for help, and know that my colleagues will step up to support me without judgement.Have you thought about maybe just giving your team leader hints about why you're struggling if you're unable to do so directly? This is actually how I started opening up. I'd say things like \"I've been through some stuff, so I find things like this hard\". I always kept it vague because I felt scared to fully open up. You could maybe try saying, \"I'm really sorry I missed that. I was worried I'd get it wrong. I tend to overthink a lot because of stuff that's happened in the past\". Have you been diagnosed with poor mental health? Under employment law, your employers are obligated to put measures in place to assist you with your work - it's called reasonable adjustments. They can only do this if you actually tell them you need the help though.I would advise you to either speak to your team leader at some point and say something like, \"hey, I find X hard because of some really bad things I've been through. Is there anything you can suggest that might help me do it better?\" Or you could request to speak privately with HR, who would then pass down the chain the type of support you need.Reasonable adjustments is a life-saver. It's the reason why I haven't quit my job. Thanks to it, my employers changed my start times to cater for the side effects of my antidepressants, and reduced my hours because I couldn't work for long periods due to my severe anxiety. I wholeheartedly recommend you try it.", "link_id": "t3_gjwlim", "time": 1589501954}}

It doesn't happen as often as it used to thank God.I've never fully understood what \"home\" I wanted to go back to, but at certain points in my life it meant different things. \"I want to go home\" may have meant from the ages 10-12, I want to go back to my mum. I lived with my mum in a third world country up until the age of 10, then I came to England to live with my dad. My life with my dad was hell because he was very abusive. The problem with the wanting to go home thought, was that life with my mum hasn't been great either. We were very poor, experienced homelessness during my early childhood, and my mum was very strict and quick to hit me whenever she thought I was misbehaving.From the ages 12-20+, wanting to go home meant I wanted to die. That was when the abuse from my father became too much to bear.For a brief period during my time as a 25 year old, going home felt like it meant I wanted to return to my abusive father. I ran away from him at this age and as scary and nerve wracking as the whole thing was, this wanting to go home feeling was the worst. I always ended up with really bad self hatred after. I didn't understand why I wanted to go back to a place where I couldn't even leave for leave, breathe, feel or think without permission.I have my own home now where I'm safe and the wanting to go home feeling has thankfully changed.

My father used to put a lot of pressure on me to achieve academic success, because he taught college students for a living. That pressure ensured that I always an anxious mess every day and I could never prepare for exams because I was suffering from around 20 panic attacks a day. I did graduate college, but my law degree isn't worth much. I initially struggled to find work and went through quite a few shitty jobs because I had a lot of pressure from my father to start working immediately after I graduated.The shitty jobs paid well, but due to mental illnesses I kept getting let go because at a certain point I couldn't even summon the will to get up for work. I hated the work, I couldn't concentrate on the what I needed to do because of how bad my anxiety was, and I hated my work environment because I struggled to fit in with my colleagues and was sometimes picked on.I eventually got lucky and got offered a job at a all charity. Pay wasn't good and still isn't but I love it. Being a charity, the workforce is pretty small. There's around 9 of us in total and everyone is lovely. We're all people who decided to dedicate our lives to helping others. Everyone is really genuine, supportive and we're more like a family than colleagues. I've never once been treated badly despite how difficult I find things sometimes because of my mental illnesses.I know you're worried about finding work, so I would suggest you try small companies and maybe charities. From my own experience, working for a large company will not be a good experience. Larger companies have more pressurised and toxic environments. Colleagues are prone to gossiping and bullying each other for fun and sometimes management will engage in that behaviour too. Your mental ill health will put a target on your back and make you more vulnerable to this behaviour, which I'm 80% certain will happen.I work for a charity that actually gives people free legal advice. One of the areas of law we advice in is employment law, and it's incredibly upsetting how  many people we've had to help who have been treated like shit because of their mental health issues.

{"fqfn5bm": {"text": "29 year old female here. I know exactly how you feel. Long story short, I moved in with my dad at the age of 10 because he persuaded my mum it was best if he raised me. Worst decision ever. My father was extremely abusive, physically, emotionally, financially and psychologically. He was also a drunk for most of my childhood. I spent fifteen years living in what can only be described as hell. Every day I was insulted, slapped, controlled and trapped. I wasn't allowed to leave the house without permission, which was rarely given. I couldn't go out and have fun with my friends. I could barely see my mum because my dad hated her. Even prison must have been better than my life.I was suicidal by the age of 12, but never gave in. The abuse I suffered at the hands of my father was never hidden. I was slapped and verbally abused in front of his wife, his family, his wife's family, his colleagues, his friends, our neighbors, random strangers in public, etc. No one ever did anything at all to help me. I basically grew up feeling like no one loved or cared about me apart from my mum. She was the only one that ever showed me any affection, and most of that was over the phone since I could rarely see her. For that reason alone, I decided to keep living for her. My dad also ruined her life and at the time she was suffering as much as I was. I promised myself that I would keep going for her. I would stay alive so that I wouldn't be another thing in her life that caused her pain. Her entire family abandoned her to go live abroad when she was 20, so I was actually the only family she had with her. If I killed myself then she'd be all alone in a country where the only person she thought she could turn to for support was my abusive father. That way of thinking kept me alive, but didn't stop me from wishing I was dead and spending every waking moment feeling hopeless and unhappy.I honestly thought my life would never change unless: a) I did kill myself, b) my dad killed me like he'd promised to do, c) I killed my dad, or d) my dad died of natural causes, my life changed. Throughout the years my mum used to always tell me that I could just leave my father. One day I finally found the strength to take her advice because I couldn't bear living like that any longer.I sought help from a professional organisation that supports people in situations like I was in when I was 25 years old and they actually helped. They found me a place in a refuge and told me to pack my bags and prepare to secretly run away. That one small step I took to seek help was all I actually needed to do to change my life for the better. It's hard to believe how much my life has changed. Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a parallel universe. I have my own home, my mum is a permanent fixture of my life, I have my freedom and can do what the hell I want.Unfortunately, as almost perfect as my life is right now, I'll never be able to fully enjoy it. Thanks to my father, I naturally ended up with depression, two anxiety disorders, PTSD and just general poor health that science has proved comes from a childhood of abuse. I will also most likely have to take antidepressants for the rest of my life.On top of that, I have severe problems starting and maintaining relationships, both friendship and romantic relationships. I barely have any friends and the ones I do have, I neglect because part of me is scared of becoming reliant on people. I'm scared of getting too close to people, because I think they could one day hurt me like my father did. I even keep my own boyfriend at arms length.In addition to that, I have a whole host of irrational fears. I have crippling social anxiety and am convinced 90% of the time that the people I care about don't actually care about me and will one day just disappear on me. I also avoid going into public on my own at all costs, because I have the social skills of a fish. My number one fear is that a random stranger will either try to talk to or attack me if I'm alone in public.My father has stolen so much of life from me.

I'm currently a trainee lawyer with a 2.2 law degree, which basically means my degree isn't really worth anything.Bit about my background: my mum's highest education level was in secondary school and most of her jobs have been low paid working class jobs. Not surprising because she spent most of her life in a third world country where university isn't free and there's no loans or help available from the government.My father on the other hand is very educated. He's from the same country as my mum, but came to England to study. He has two first class degrees, has previously worked for the government back home and is a university lecturer.My father was my abuser. I came to England to live with him when I was 10 and my life was basically ruined because of that.My father lived a middle class life and so did his family. All my cousins went to private school and got first class degrees. My father used to love comparing me them and called me the black sheep of the family. He also said I said I was far too stupid to graduate.I was considered bright as a young child, but the moment the abuse started my education went downhill. I used to disassociate and daydream in class all the time. My concentration was shit and took me forever to learn anything.I developed severe anxiety by the age of 12 and also had suicidal ideation. By the age of 13 I was suffering from social anxiety and panic attacks.Despite my struggle with school, my father forced me to go to university. He picked the university, the degree and paid the fees. It's no surprise I did badly throughout. He constantly put pressure on me to do well, would demand I sit at my desk every night and do homework, didn't allow me out to house to see my friends or mum and didn't even allow me to do things like watch during the week. Naturally I rebelled. I barely did any homework and daydreamed and slept through my lectures. Whenever I did put any effort into my work I ended up having panic attacks. During exam time I sometimes had up to 20 panic attacks a day. The exams themselves were awful because my head would go blank and I would sometimes disassociate.Despite all that, I've only ever failed three exams and passed a majority of the others without having ever finished a single exam paper.I might be an academic failure, but I'm still proud of myself. I completed my degree despite living in hell and suffering from severe mental health issues. I never mitigated during my time at university, I didn't have any mental health support and wasn't on medication.I used to always compared myself to the friends I had in uni and it used to make me hate myself so much.

I've posted my story a couple times on different boards, but it's quite long so I won't repost here. Long story short, I was the victim of domestic violence perpetrated by my father from the ages of 10 to 25. My father was basically abusive to every woman he had a close relationship to. He was abusive to my mum, his wife and even his sisters. Due to that none of them ever did anything to help me. I assuming they thought that since he treated them the same way then it was fine for him to treat his child that way too.I never reached out for help. The abuse was never hidden and sometimes it happened in public. I guess I thought that since no one was helping that I should just accept my lot in life.My mum was the only one who used to encourage me leave my dad. She broke off her relationship with him years ago, but had to keep in contact with him because I was living with him. One day I finally took her advice and ended up going to exactly the right place I needed to.I went to a charitable organisation that supports victims of domestic violence and they were surprisingly able to help. At first I thought there was nothing they could do to save me and was fully prepared to go home and continue living the way I was. They refused to let me go home until they had found me a safe place live. The lady I spoke to made a couple calls to different organisations and eventually found me a place in a women's refuge. I got lucky. This was over the Christmas period, so a lot of organisations were closed for the holidays. I was given two days to pack my stuff, which I did in secret and then went to live in the refuge. Living there wasn't great, but I didn't have to pay rent since it's the government's responsibility to pay rent for places like refuges. I was safe there and they even helped me get free legal advice - I ended having to take my dad to court because he tried tracking me down through my work and friends.I lived in the refuge for another nine months and then they eventually helped me secure government housing.

Not sure you know how general anxiety disorder works or anxiety disorders work, but people who suffer from them go through their every day life hearing \"normal\" people tell them that \"it's all in their heads\", \"they're overthinking\", \"they just need to stop worrying\", and other shit like that. It's the main reason why so many of us fail to seek help. I suffered in silence because of that from the age of 10 and didn't actually seek help until I was 25. At that point of course it was too late, I'd already lost most of my friends, almost failed uni and basically already hated my life. I only sought help because a kind person acknowledged that I did have serious problems with managing anxiety and needed to seek help.I really hope one day people will stop telling people who are mentally ill that it's all in their own heads. Maybe then so many of them won't need to suffer in silence, like my close friends who have crippling anxiety but won't even seek help because I'm literally the only person in their lives that has actually acknowledged and pointed out that their way of thinking isn't \"normal\".

They got together when she was like 25 and then broke up after I was born. I then became a victim of abuse by my father at the age of 10, because he managed to convince ther to let me live with him. She thought he'd changed. My abuse didn't end until I was 25 and had no choice but to run away from home. Initially I resented my mother so much for what happened to me, because my father was never secretive about the abuse. He would openly treat me like punching bag in front of family, friends and random strangers. No one ever did anything to save me. During that time my mum was the only one who ever showed me any love, but at the same time I couldn't help thinking that she should have saved me if truly loved me. I blamed her for everything. I also used to treat her really badly too. Whenever I was having a hard time with my dad, I'd end up taking it out on her.It wasn't until I started taking medication and had a lot of therapy, that I started to realise I was wrong. I was wrong to blame my mum, because she was as much a victim as me. My father had actually been abusing us both at the same time. He would directly abuse me physically, but then abuse my mum indirectly through the phone. We were both abused, it's just mine was more noticeable and I'd been too young to pick up on hers.Thanks to the damage my father caused both of us, we're both pretty up. We both have quick tempers, thin skins and get upset very easily. We argue so much because of our inability not to overreact. It's almost always awful when we argue, we say extremely hurtful things to each other. Some are things my father himself has said to us.I always feel like shit afterwards. We never apologies to each other, but always seem to forgive each other without saying a word. Despite all that and all the horrible things we've said to each other, I know that I love my mum more than anything else in this world and she feels the same about me.I think the only way to sort the issues out with your mum would be to seek help from a counsellor.

{"fpp889i": {"text": "It sounds like you might have been.I was a bit similar as a child. I knew the same things about sex at the age of 5 too and started masterbating at an early age. I don't know why. I originally thought that maybe it was because my adult relatives, who occasionally used to babysit me, used to not care about making sure there wasn't adult material on TV or lying around their place. That made sense up up to a certain point, but didn't explain how I knew details of what felt good.Then a couple years ago, I randomly had a dream that I now believe was a flashback. It was of me being in my aunt's bed with her partner and he was touching me and my cousin inappropriately. I seemed to be really young. I'm convinced it was a memory, because a few years after that I overheard my mum talking to a family member about how my aunt's partner (now-ex) used to have sex with her daughter (aunt's child from previous relationship). My cousin was around 14 at the time or possibly younger. It seemed like her mum's partner took an interest in her and started an inappropriate relationship with her where he made her have sex with him whenever her mother wasn't around. I sometimes used to stay at their place after school while I waited for my mum to finish work, so it makes sense that he would have molested me too at some point.I was also molested a few years after that again by my mum's friend's son. I think I was 8 at the time and he was 14/15. I also only started remembering that after having another random flashback dream. This one was a lot clearer, because my memories came back after the flashback and I remember a lot of details. Like he did it while we were sharing a bed, because we were having a sleepover at my mum's friend's place and the adults thought it would be okay to put the kids together. My mum thankfully stopped it, because she was actually sleeping on the bottom bunk and heard the bed moving.It might be the same for you. In therapy we got taught that the human mind blocks out trauma completely sometimes because it's an automatic survival instinct.

{"fplytdo": {"text": "I've shared this on another thread before, but I think it might help you too:I know exactly how you feel. I was in the same position three years ago, for fifteen years. Long story short, I moved in with my dad at the age of 10 because he persuaded my mum it was best if he raised me. Worst decision ever. My father was extremely abusive, physically, emotionally, financially and psychologically. He was also a drunk for most of my childhood. I spent fifteen years living in what can only be described as hell. Every day I was insulted, slapped, controlled and trapped. I wasn't allowed to leave the house without permission, which was rarely given. I couldn't go out and have fun with my friends. I could barely see my mum because my dad hated her. Even prison must have been better than my life. I was suicidal by the age of 12, but never gave in. The abuse I suffered at the hands of my father was never hidden. I was slapped and verbally abused in front of his wife, his family, his wife's family, his colleagues, his friends, our neighbors, random strangers in public, etc. No one ever did anything at all to help me. I basically grew up feeling like no one loved or cared about me apart from my mum. She was the only one that ever showed me any affection, and most of that was over the phone since I could rarely see her. For that reason alone, I decided to keep living for her. My dad also ruined her life and at the time she was suffering as much as I was. I promised myself that I would keep going for her. I would stay alive so that I wouldn't be another thing in her life that caused her pain. Her entire family abandoned her to go live abroad when she was 20, so I was actually the only family she had with her. If I killed myself then she'd be all alone in a country where the only person she thought she could turn to for support was my abusive father. That way of thinking kept me alive, but didn't stop me from wishing I was dead and spending every waking moment feeling hopeless and unhappy.I am so glad I managed to find something to anchor my life to. Just when I thought my life would never change unless: a) I did kill myself, b) my dad killed me like he'd promised to do, c) I killed my dad, or d) my dad died of natural causes, my life changed. Throughout the years my mum used to always tell me that I could just leave my father. She never understood that it wasn't that easy. Eventually she got through to me. She gave me the right advice. She  told me to look for someone who could give me advice, so I did. I sought help from a professional organisation that supports people in situations like I was in and they actually helped. They found me a place in a refuge and told me to pack my bags and prepare to secretly run away. I thought they were crazy. I told them it would never work. I had lived my life for 15 years, there was no way it could be that easy to get out. They essentially took the decision out of my hands and my mum was there to ensure I did exactly what I was told. They were right. Just like that I managed to escape from my nightmare. It took a hell of a lot of courage to escape and the first year was hell, mainly because I had to take my dad to court to protect myself. That one small step I took to seek help was all I actually needed to do to change my life for the better. It's hard to believe how much my life has changed. Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a parallel universe. I have my own home, my mum is a permanent fixture of my life, I have my freedom and can do what the hell I want. My life is by no means perfect, because naturally I ended up with depression, two anxiety disorders, PTSD and just general poor health that science has proved comes from a childhood of abuse. I also still had days where I felt life wasn't worth living, but it isn't as bad as before. I'm on antidepressants and it's helped a lot with the suicidal thoughts. It's helped me finally feel happy.My life's not perfect, but it's still a better life than I had before. I'm glad I stayed alive, because it's proved that life can get better. Things can change.I know you feel like things are hopeless and they won't get better, but believe me they will. You just need to hold on a little bit longer and know where to turn to for help.

I could have easily gotten student finance and a government grant to fund my education, just like all my friend did.As for shopping, you'd be able to go out on your own.

{"fpergpl": {"text": "I just posted this in another thread, but you may also find it helpful:I know exactly how you feel. I was in the same position three years ago, for fifteen years. Long story short, I moved in with my dad at the age of 10 because he persuaded my mum it was best if he raised me. Worst decision ever. My father was extremely abusive, physically, emotionally, financially and psychologically. He was also a drunk for most of my childhood. I spent fifteen years living in what can only be described as hell. Every day I was insulted, slapped, controlled and trapped. I wasn't allowed to leave the house without permission, which was rarely given. I couldn't go out and have fun with my friends. I could barely see my mum because my dad hated her. Even prison must have been better than my life. I was suicidal by the age of 12, but never gave in. The abuse I suffered at the hands of my father was never hidden. I was slapped and verbally abused in front of his wife, his family, his wife's family, his colleagues, his friends, our neighbors, random strangers in public, etc. No one ever did anything at all to help me. I basically grew up feeling like no one loved or cared about me apart from my mum. She was the only one that ever showed me any affection, and most of that was over the phone since I could rarely see her. For that reason alone, I decided to keep living for her. My dad also ruined her life and at the time she was suffering as much as I was. I promised myself that I would keep going for her. I would stay alive so that I wouldn't be another thing in her life that caused her pain. Her entire family abandoned her to go live abroad when she was 20, so I was actually the only family she had with her. If I killed myself then she'd be all alone in a country where the only person she thought she could turn to for support was my abusive father. That way of thinking kept me alive, but didn't stop me from wishing I was dead and spending every waking moment feeling hopeless and unhappy.I am so glad I managed to find something to anchor my life to. Just when I thought my life would never change unless: a) I did kill myself, b) my dad killed me like he'd promised to do, c) I killed my dad, or d) my dad died of natural causes, my life changed. Throughout the years my mum used to always tell me that I could just leave my father. She never understood that it wasn't that easy. Eventually she got through to me. She gave me the right advice. She  told me to look for someone who could give me advice, so I did. I sought help from a professional organisation that supports people in situations like I was in and they actually helped. They found me a place in a refuge and told me to pack my bags and prepare to secretly run away. I thought they were crazy. I told them it would never work. I had lived my life for 15 years, there was no way it could be that easy to get out. They essentially took the decision out of my hands and my mum was there to ensure I did exactly what I was told. They were right. Just like that I managed to escape from my nightmare. It took a hell of a lot of courage to escape and the first year was hell, mainly because I had to take my dad to court to protect myself. That one small step I took to seek help was all I actually needed to do to change my life for the better. It's hard to believe how much my life has changed. Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a parallel universe. I have my own home, my mum is a permanent fixture of my life, I have my freedom and can do what the hell I want. My life is by no means perfect, because naturally I ended up with depression, two anxiety disorders, PTSD and just general poor health that science has proved comes from a childhood of abuse. I also still had days where I felt life wasn't worth living, but it isn't as bad as before. I'm on antidepressants and it's helped a lot with the suicidal thoughts. It's helped me finally feel happy.My life's not perfect, but it's still a better life than I had before. I'm glad I stayed alive, because it's proved that life can get better. Things can change.I know you feel like things are hopeless and they won't get better, but believe me they will. You just need to hold on a little bit longer and know where to turn to for help.

{"fpau9ig": {"text": "It seems to hurt for most women, so I'd say prepare for it to hurt. I actually started using sex toys long before I started having sex. I guess you could say I technically lost my v card to a toy, but even that hurt. Like a lot. I bled afterwards too. The first time I had sex with a man was quite painful as well. The first couple times we tried to have sex, he had to stop because it hurt too much when he tried penetration. We eventually got the hang of it with the help of lube, lots and lots of lube and preparation before penetration. Even now I still can't have sex without lube and preparation. I do have a friend who also took her v card with a toy. She bought a very small bullet and used lube. She said it was painful and she didn't get very far the first couple of times. It took her a couple of times and a lot of lube to get there.You do definitely need to find a way of preparing before you rush into it. Another one of my friends isn't one for preparation, so she's still a virgin. She has had a lot of bfs, but penetration has never worked out. Her bfs have all been experienced, but not used to virgins so they didn't know what to do to help her. She's now really scared to try penetration, because if how much it hurt during each attempt. She said she's just going wait until marriage, because of how traumatic it's likely to be for her.I would suggest that your partner starts with oral or fingering with lots of lube. You should do that a couple times, so you get used to the stretch before you attempt penetration. Preparation is key. You can actually injure yourself if you don't prepare well enough.
