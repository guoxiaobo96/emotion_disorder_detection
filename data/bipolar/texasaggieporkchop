I had thought that it was the vape and rarely used it (usually when I was out of town). However, as an asthmatic toker, the combustion was killing my lungs and my throat. So, I decided to buy the pax after some research. Same thing happened, I thought it was the vape until I was forced to only use the pax when I was at my sister's for a week. My tolerance lowered slowly but surely and since December, it's the only thing I've used and the only method of consumption I can see myself using. I bought a waterpipe adapter for it and it provides the best hits I've ever had and the best cleanest hits. Personally, I use the first petal until vapor is gone and then work my way up until the 3rd and then, save it as AVB. I would check out  because I learned so much.
