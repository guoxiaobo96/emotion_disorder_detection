It gets people out of their own head. They are not solely focused on themselves, they put their effort and their reason for living into the context of their pet. The reason why I stopped trying to commit suicide was because I got a cat. Because my mindset was, if i die, who will love and care for my cat like i do?

So I already had that foundation with animals and learnt what it meant to take care of them from a young age.If you read that as I didnt think you were taking care of the dog, that is not what I meant. Animals are perceptive to the uneasiness of their owners and it can cause issues over a prolonged period of time. Especially when the dog recognizes that you become that way only in its presence. If you cant handle the idea that you need to be alive to care for this animal, and that isnt a good enough reason to stick around, having a dog isnt going to magically fix that.", "link_id": "t3_gl2xyn", "time": 1589668939}}

I actually read the manga far ahead of the anime and got to the mystery reveal and found it uninspiring and taking the whole premise of the story I had been following up to that point and making it something else without really giving the original story a satisfying ending. I wasnt satisfied by it and anyone has the right to say a show did not meet expectation. The anime follows the manga so closely and anything left out isnt going to be ground breaking for the story that is taking place.If you think those spoilers change the fact that the story overall wasnt that good and suddenly it magically gets so much better, you are completely mistaken. It was fun, but does nothing to fix the poor characters and the convoluted mystery. There are far better anime out there. It's a fun little romp, dont think too much while watching it. The show spells everything out eventually because the twists that are introduced are so out to left field that they need to be thoroughly explained for the audience to be on board.The author is not the best creator, nor the best writer. I'm sorry I paid more attention to that than you. But dont go denouncing someone else's opinion just because you cant see the forest for the trees. When Levi gets an injury at the start of the series, basically a twisted ankle, he is out of action for a relatively long time, in a realistic manner. Mikasa gets her RIBS BROKEN and is chopping wood and walking around like she was merely poked in the side. Yeah, there isnt terrible characterization at all. Obvious plot armour for the main cast.

Armin is the only decently written character of the hero group and even then, he gets the short end of the stick until the Beast Titan arc.If you like the story, that is subjective.

{"fqsxqvq": {"text": "{Given}{Sing Yesterday for Me}{Say I love You}{My Little Monster}{Wagnaria!!}Given is an amazingly realistic BL series where the relationship and feelings are allowed to take time. It's a beautiful anime and everyone I k kw who has watched it has cried at some point during it because of just how well the emotions are expressed.Sing Yesterday for Me is an extremely grounded slice of life save for the main guy character being the classic failure of an adult, yet he has women fighting over him for some reason. But the characters as individuals are extremely human and it does take it's time. It is also ongoing, so you have a new episode to look forward to every week.Say I Love You is a decent anime. Pretty solid in the stance for realism. Personally would prefer a less swishy washy character as, when the series gets more dramatic towards the end, the main character just sort of goes back and forth between committing to the relationship or not. But I suppose that is realistic. A lot of people constantly second guess their relationships and, with the main character's backstory, it is believable more or less for her to be so quick to pull away. It does definitely feel like character growth. From the first episode to the (second to) last, I truly feel like the main character grows. But seriously, fuck the last episode. It would have been great if only I never saw the last episode.My Little Monster is a slow building anime of a pretty hardened girl and a loose carefree guy who has a bad reputation. About halfway through the conflict if the relationship feels like the writer was just forcing it on when they could have connected long before. Just to keep the story going for no other reason than they didnt want it over yet. So there isnt a very satisfying ending, but it is a cute romantic comedy that I still am very fond of.Wagnaria or Working!! Is a comedy series based off 4 panel comics. Like One Punch Man or Axis Powers Hetalia, but the show did an amazing job of using these short comics to make a coherent story. There are several couples throughout and it made me cry, twice, watching it. It does have some wonky aspects not firmly grounded in reality, like an androphobic girl who can literally punch through walls. But if you dont mind the anime comedy aspect, the romances are the SLOWEST of slow burns (one romance took nearly all 3 seasons to bloom) and it focuses heavily on the relationships between characters.

And the entire second season was garbage.Another anime that makes me mad is Soul Eater. Spectacular anime throughout until you get towards the end. Especially the last 3 episodes. The anime completely diverges from the manga for the ending and it shows. And can I just say, you have the main character solo-fighting the big bad because everyone else of the hero squad is down for the count, have the MC show a whole new power that has never been hinted at or alluded to throughout the show, have that power literally do nothing, and what kills the main villain is a regular old punch to the face with the power of friendship.Thanks, I hate it.This show I watched more recently and actually enjoyed until the last episode, but that is Say \"I love You\".

She wasnt even slammed, she was just socializing and moving slow. When I tried to jump on to get the drinks done faster she would snap at me and tell me to get back to the window.On a level of 1-10 on stress, I was at a 7 at this point because she was being needlessly rude to me when I just wanted to help. She didnt like me for some reason and was hostile to me any other time as well. I finally get the frappuccino and before I can even apologize to the next car, the lady at the wheel tore me apart. I had been super eager to get this job and I was really bummed being kicked off bar when it was so slow because it kept me from learning how to get faster. I felt ostracized in the store and I was not used to this level of hostility from customers. I had customers who would act up and be entitled in my other jobs serving tables, but I never had someone so downright ugly and vicious. She brutalized me, blamed me on the wait, demanded my name and cussed me out. I had never experienced something like that in all my years of customer service.I broke. Having a mental illness that was the final straw and I had a full on melt down. My manager at the time just sat and listened to me swear and scream and cry and watched me pull my hair out because all i wanted to do was help and no one allowed me the control of the situation and it resulted in abuse from both my coworkers and my customers and I could not handle it.That was within the first month of working and at that point on I refuse to be anything but polite and firm with my customers while doing my job. If bar is struggling to stay on drinks, I do not care, I will get on bar and make my widow's drinks.I love how people in the comments peg me an asshole when I go out of my way to make sure their drinks get done. When I bend over backwards to get them their orders in a timely and quality manner. Just today I ended up helping a customer push their car through the drive through to the parking lot. I gave them their one drink order for free and some kids hot chocolates on the house since it was cold out and they were stranded until their family member could arrive. I even ran outside to break up a fight between a man and a customer when the dude pulled out bear mace on her for accidentally hitting the side of his van with her car door. And I spent 2 hours talking to and comforting her, helping her to alleviate the pain as she sat there crying and blind, waiting for the ambulance. I'm not going to talk to you like a child or take abuse or deal with customer bullshit.

{"f5ovg15": {"text": "Deadass, I think the funniest part to me was Angel tackling Vaggie like \"BITCH NO! THIS IS STAYING\" but also realizing he is pointing at Husk and NOT THE BAR.It was like, wow, so much character dump in 30 minutes. Read a blog of someone saying nothing was really added and I was shocked. Like, if anyone is super curious, there is a prequel comic in the making you can find the link on Vivzie's twitter and 7 pages have been uploaded so far. In those 7 pages you really only need one yo recognize Val. If you rewatch the beginning, you will see his phone and a line of text messages. Val is obviously a pimp.Now going back to the pilot, Angel is saying he has been missing for 2 weeks and living at the hotel rent free. Sounds like someone who is leaving with nothing. He is willing to play along with the girls despite not really wanting to change, but his bad circumstances have put him there. He also shows to have a caring heart that he pushes down in the scene where he realizes he did actually hurt Charlie.Then we see in the scene with Husk that we have someone who desires a certain type of attention. He doesnt show any interest in Ser Pentious and while he offers to Alastor, the reactions to each couldn't be more different. While Alastor was a shrug, he has such a strong attraction to Husk that it makes me curious. It isnt that he's pent up or anything, otherwise Alastor would have gotten him riled too, and it isnt that Husk shows no interest (again, Alastor and Ser Pentious) but there is definitely something that Angel is clinging onto about Husk and it isnt obvious yet. My theory is a codependency disorder that is what is violently attracting him to Husk, but that has no real evidence at this time.Then there is Charlie's song. That song introduced a lot of characters that are going to definitely matter. I think that is safe to say. But also really cements Charlie's main conflict. She is a demon with the heart of an angel, but the angels themselves are no Saints. It is genuinely heartbreaking to see the conflict she feels between herself and her parents. It is very little to go off of, but the fact that her mother doesnt answer her calls makes me think that one tongue in cheek comment was not so tongue in cheek. Charlie lives in a world of contradiction, her father is the king of hell and she was born there, but has such a tender heart. This is all she k owns but seeks for change. And everything she knows doesnt add up to what is seen. The fact that she cries over dead while no one else even blinks an eye isolates her in a place she should belong, but the sinister and bloodstained smiles of the angels and the fact that she was born in hell also distances her from where she wants to be.There is so much going on, and those two are my favourite. Everyone loved Alastor and, sure, he has the cool factor, but everything about him is off. He has the same nihilistic mindset I have personally carried for years, but outside of that, I cannot relate to him at all. Even his animation is different than everyone else's and he has an extremely off putting vibe in every scene he is in. I can recognize a true puppet master when I see one, and the fact that Ser Pentious has a history with him, I dont find so surprising. He is a cool character, a good character for the story, and while the first episode has pushed him to be untrustworthy, even though I want to, I genuinely can't.", "link_id": "t3_dobf6i", "time": 1572334476}}

You can treat depression. You can cure some forms of depression, but you cannot cure the mental illness (severe clinical depression) of depression. You can treat it, but you cannot cure it. The idea that taking medication will cure a mental illness has also caused problems with patients being treated as you see a lot of people stop taking medication when they \"feel better\" only for the depression, bipolar mood swings and schizophrenic symptoms to reappear after medication is stopped. There is no cure. Stop telling people there is one, because this is reality and not some happy little fairytale where we can wake up one day cured and normal and never have to take the meds again and never have to feel this way again.

My coworkers hate me unless I am working on a shift with them because I always do an excellent job. They can just stand around talking and making plans with minimal work while I bar, do dishes, take orders and anything else that needs to be done. But I need to work harder while my coworker who literally said \"I am moving any faster, they will get their drink when it is done.\" Got promoted to barista trainer.And I even ended up training her barista for her.

This is highly unlikely, but you can't be blamed for trying and it removes the fault from you.2) Call the store and tell the shift on duty asap that you will be unable to come in. Let them know who is coming in for you (or isn't if you couldn't find any coverage).3) if the store manager is in the store and knows what's up, you can ignore this, but if not, call or text your store manager (their preference) and let them know you will not be coming in and if you could or could not find coverage.

{"ewsb2op": {"text": "Before this last revamp of the mod, I had the same exact thing. I have some outbreaks now and then, but they have dramatically decreased. I feel KS could add a trait we can give our sims, like perfect complexion or something so we can choose a bit more on how to deal with acne. I also get frustrated that my YA sims (who I age from 24-32) are still getting acne like they are teenagers. Like, some acne, sure, but not every few days and not the major breakouts. Being able to add a perfect complexion buff after they age up from teenagers would help a lot.", "link_id": "t3_cpq1nn", "time": 1565723798}}
