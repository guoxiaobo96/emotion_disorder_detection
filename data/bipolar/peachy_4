Try drawing in multiple different styles, and put your best effort into each. Do multiple drawings for each style. Find what you think is the most fun, and do some deep practicing. Change things that you want to change, lay down colors you want to see. Slowly, that style will become yours. Something that really helped me find my style was doing a lot of studies. The art class I took my junior year of high school was the best for this. I drew multiple skeletons, facial proportions, and worked with a lot of mediums. Research the basics. Do some proportion studies, learn about perspective and form, practice observation drawing. Mastering these skills will help you put what you want to see on your canvas. Keep pushing yourself. If you continue the effort, techniques and skill will stay with you, and it'll be easier to move forward. I've been discouraged with my art plenty of times. It took me 18 years to figure out HOW I wanted to draw. I wanted to impress people with realism and replicate van goghs colors and movement, but I also wanted to have a unique style. I went from drawing videos on YouTube to painting my boyfriend when we would be video calling. Now, I don't have as much inspiration in my life, so I downloaded an app that generates art prompts. It's a simple app and frequently spits the same few prompts out over and over, but the practice is amazing.

We got to see each other 3 times in the 2 years we were apart. Every time he or I would leave to go back home after the few days we were together, we would leave not knowing when we were going to see each other again. The depression and the lows were HORRIBLE. Every time. I would cry horribly the first entire day we were apart, about 4-5 times the next day, once the third, and then I would stop. I would allow myself to grieve it, but then pick myself back up. We ALWAYS stayed in contact. If we were both home, we would have a video call up. Even when we weren't talking to each other and just playing on our phones, painting, or eating, the call was up. The calls sometimes made it harder for me (I would want to be in his arms/kiss him/hold his hand/hug him so badly that I would cry), but I think ultimately made me feel closer to him.Keep yourself distracted whenever you feel low. I see a therapist, and one of my ways to \"cope\" with my depression/anxiety is to just imagine myself being in my favorite place. For me, it's Virginia Beach in Virginia. I imagine the wind, the smell of the air, the sound of the gulls, the feeling of digging my toes into wet sand. It's sort of grounding and it helps lift my mood a little. I get my mind COMPLETELY off what I'm struggling with at that moment. Especially when its something I can't control, like not being w ur bf. These are things that really helped me during my LDR. I really hope they can help you at least a little. Best wishes and luck (:", "link_id": "t3_dpbkiw", "time": 1572471522}}

{"ezi9q1l": {"text": "I was with my boyfriend for a little over 4 months before I moved across the country. It was, to say the least, incredibly difficult. On things not to do:After about 7 months of being alone, with no physical contact, I cheated on my boyfriend. Obviously, DO NOT DO THIS. I was so caught up in feeling physically loved that I thought it would help???? It helped for maybe 10 minutes. Period. In the week that followed, my bf found out. The \"satisfaction\" of physical contact was NOTHING compared to the hurt that i caused him. Ive also always had a hard time communicating my feelings effectively. In my last relationship, whenever we would get upset, we would lash out at each other for 5 minutes and then separate ourselves to opposite corners of the room and cry. And that was all I knew how to do for 2 years. Scream, and then cry. So when I got with my current bf, that is what I tried to do. While we were together, we didn't have many problems at all. When I left though, distance reared its ugly ass head. I had doubts, worries, jealousy, etc., and I didn't know how to properly tell him. Do not ever come to your s/o screaming and yelling and wanting to hurt them. Another obvious tip.However, to keep the relationship going,,,:We video call every night. We don't even have to talk. We get on call, and eventually fall asleep. It does a great deal as far as \"feeling far away\" goes. It makes us both feel a lot closer to each other than what we are.We also communicate EVERYTHING. We tell each other everything we feel, whether it's happiness, hurt, sadness,,,,,,anything. When it's negative, we always try to go into it calmly. You have think about each situation from the others' perspective. We make plans to see each other. For the first 10 months, we weren't able to. Yeah, it was absolute HELL, but it honestly made the next time we saw each other that much more exciting. I moved away July of 2018. I saw him in March of 2019 for only 4 days. But it was amazing. I saw him again in June for a whole month. He came down here in August for 2 weeks. Every single time we've seen each other, it fixes everything. We both have a very physical love language, so being together is very important. Every relationship is different, though. Do what will keep you striving in the relationship, and always make sure they are doing the same. Check in as often as you can.Good luck.", "link_id": "t3_d12meq", "time": 1567923499}}
{"eyvcipw": {"text": "My mom was in a similar situation.My dad was with my mom since they joined the military. Shortly after they met, they married. They had me a few years after that. When I turned 3, they had another baby girl.And then my mom found out he was cheating on her. With a woman named Beth, who was (and is) mousy, married, and living in Michigan. We lived in Virginia. Every so often, my dad would leave to go to Michigan for \"work\" and hook up with Beth. He left my mom homeless and stranded miles away from family with a 3 year old and a 4 month old. Flash forward about 8 years. My dad was with another woman. They got married, and had a little girl. 3 years later, he was cheating on his wife with another woman(call her Susan). (Fortunately, my dad was not contributing to this family financially, and did not leave her homeless and without support. After he left my mom, he stopped working for himself. He mooched off of women who fell for him)He was with Susan for a few years, and had a baby. I really believed this time would be the time he would stick around. She was young, beautiful, and had a very high-paying job. Everything he looks for. Well, this new daughter turned 3 and, you guessed it, he was found cheating. AGAIN. With the same woman he cheated on my mom with. The point of me saying all this, was to give you an idea of what my mom, my dad's ex wife, and \"Susan\" have all done. After my dad was found cheating on one of them, they'd reach out to the previous women he had cheated on. My mom, his ex wife, and \"Susan\" all talk now, keeping each other supported and updated on their lives without my dad. It did take them a while to warm up to each other, but eventually, they did it. It's sort of like a \"clique,\" where if you are done wrong by my dad, you're welcomed in.I have no idea if you are willing to try and see this man as another pawn in your ex's \"game,\" per se, but I know it helped my mom, etc. As far as him trying to act smarter, better, and cooler than you, consider that your ex most likely was feeding him a bunch of bullshit about you.", "link_id": "t3_cyva8u", "time": 1567488377}}

I hurt him to the point where he was crying and beating himself up, and I will never forgive myself for that, but I have changed.

Alright. Before I moved, I was keeping track of a \"friends\" house and animals while his family was on vacation for the weekend. I slept there/spent my weekend there with no other plans. I invited him over on Friday night to keep me company, after not really talking for 2 years. I felt SOMETHING for him and I was almost positive it was love. (I broke up with my ex a month or two before this. The night we broke up, my current boyfriend called me and let me cry and the cheered me up and talked to me all night)He comes over around 6-7p, and we just kinda hang around awkwardly, not really knowing what to say or do. We end up just kinda running around the house, laughing, screaming, teasing each other, tickling,,,, the works. He gets me \"cornered\" and everything just stopped. We both had these huge smiles on our faces and I was breathing hard but the world just. Stopped. Neither of us could say anything. We only just looked into each other's eyes for what seemed like forever (I later found out this was when he knew he loved me). We end up watching Cult of Chucky and Chicken Run and falling asleep on their couch/recliner. He falls asleep first, my head in his lap, his hand on my side. I spend another hour just watching him. Thinking about him. Thinking how I'm sleeping with him. That was when *I* knew I loved him.He comes over the next day and I make him this huge fancy dinner (honey crusted salmon on a rice pilaf with snap peas as decor ( I later found out he hated fish but ate it all because he didn't wanna hurt my feelings)). We spent the rest of the evening prepping a lunch I was making for my church the next day. We end up sleeping in the same position, and I want to SCREAM that I love him. I had never been that content, happy, and full-hearted than I was in that moment.

NOT TO HURT OR VENT OR RANT. if you want to rant or vent, bring it up later. vent about it and let it out, but not during the fight. chances are, if you bring up an issue to your boyfriend, calm and non-threatening, and he loves you, he will also come into it calm and not looking to fight.always talk it through. if he begins to get upset, do your best to calm him down. reassure him that you still love him and the problem isnt going to cause a breakup or whatever, and help him calm down. reassure him you werent attacking him, you werent trying to fight him or hurt him; you just needed a compromise to help you be happy.which brings us to another point: COMPROMISES AND SACRIFICES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN ON BOTH SIDES.you can not expect him to change completely or fix something for you if you wont try to help him help you. you both need to help each other. good luck, OP. i hope everything works out the way you hope it will", "link_id": "t3_c0pwld", "time": 1560571468}}
{"eqvrplq": {"text": "Honestly? He left me. And it HURT. We still talked for a while but I was still hanging out w some bad people and he ended up blocking me. And that was it. I realized how much he meant to me. How much I needed him. How much I loved him and how much i hurt him. I texted him and we started talking again. He told me he wouldn't take me back unless something changed. Because it needed to. I was reckless. I was hurting myself and everyone who actually cared about me. And so I just..did. All the love that I had felt before all the bad decisions came rushing back and it turned me around. I only hate that it took him leaving for me to remember it.", "link_id": "t3_bzrh0c", "time": 1560348841}}
{"epumhih": {"text": "i understand her spot exactly (the only difference is that i take meds - they just are too low to make a difference) the best thing my bf does for me is to just hold me and get me through it. let me cry when i need to. whenever im blanking out and cant get the motivation/energy to even move from my spot on my bed, staring at my wall, just having him sit next to me and rub my arm is good.however, i am in a ldr now, so if thats the case w you too, id suggest frequent calling. video calls help a lot. i can give you more advice on that if need be.theres a lot that neither you nor her can control in this situation, but knowing that someone is there and that she makes an impact on your life will help her struggles a lot. i.e. the only thing stopping me from killing myself 3 months ago was my boyfriend. every day he would call me and tell me how much he loved me and how he couldnt wait for our future together. he saw me living through all of this when i couldnt, and it helped me tremendously. remind her to keep fighting it.good luck xoxo", "link_id": "t3_bvzbsh", "time": 1559511997}}
