I'm not proud about this by any means, but I've done that before (granted I was a very immature teenager and didn't realize how terrible of a thing I was doing). Most of the time it stems from insecurities and is generally a \"bluff\" for lack of a better term. It's used as a way to not only draw attention away from his faults, but to also make you feel bad for him as if he's now the victim. It is also practically a form of entrapment because now there is a possible life at stake. If for whatever reason, God forbid, he does harm himself during or even after situation, DO NOT let yourself believe it was your fault at all.

Textures would barely render in, enemies would move like scarecrows, constant bugs, nearly no pvp, and the only way to interact with other people is via emotes or using a mic in the proximity of someone else.It's not worth $60, in fact stores have already sold it for upwards of 50% off, which this is personally the first time I've ever seen this happen weeks after a release of a game from a beloved studio such as Bethesda.

First off, I'd like to start by saying that on average I dream about once or twice a month. However, in this last week I've dreamt 3 times which is really weird. This is happening because I'll sleep my 8-9 hours, wake up to my alarm, hit snooze, fall back asleep into whatever dream I was having, wake back up to my alarm, hit snooze, rinse and repeat for about 2 hours. I can see things when I dream (which is why I personally believe dreaming takes you to another realm apart from the physical, but thats another tangent for another day.) My dreams are generally extremely abstract. I think the best way I could even begin to explain this is by just telling you about one of my dreams I do remember.It started and I was suddenly walking around a train station (which was weird because I've never been to one) with my cousin. I told him I had to go find the bathroom so I asked him to stay with our luggage by a fountain. I began walking around aimlessly, and I eventually started walking down the tracks and found some doors. I opened the door and walked in and I was in a completely new place. It was a dark, dank, cave of some sort, I knew that wasn't the bathroom so I did a 180 and left. I walked back up the tracks to find my cousin but on my way this girl got my attention and asked if I was looking for the bathrooms. Of course I had told her yes and she began to lead the way. We ended up back at the door I had gone thru earlier, I opened the door and it was just a bathroom. When I came back out of the bathroom I was in an airport. The girl was still there and she had told me we had to find her sister before our plane left. (Our? I didn't even know her!) We ran around for what felt like forever until giving up and getting on the plane (I remember at some point while searching we had found my grandparents? And some evidence that we were now in the UK). We sat in our seats, I was in the middle seat and she was in the seat closest to the aisle. All of a sudden she started freaking out. Why? Because the girl that had the window seat was her sister. They started arguing and bickering and thats when I woke up.", "link_id": "t3_54nd9v", "time": 1475013330}}
