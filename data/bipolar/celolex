In the United States, the filler in generic drugs isn\u2019t really regulated at all, and generic manufacturers aren\u2019t required to do safety tests on fillers. Plus there can be significant variation in the active ingredient, and a lot of generics are made under really shitty manufacturing conditions.

{"eu3mv0j": {"text": "Good lord, people on this sub really know nothing about photography \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f No, you would not be able to see this kind of dramatic difference from looking in a mirror. That\u2019s because the exaggerated size of her butt and thighs comes from angle and lens distortion. Firstly, the photograph is taken from a low angle - it looks like it was shot from around hip hight. That means that her hips are going to look proportionally larger than her head. Note how big Stormi\u2019s feet are in proportion to the rest of her body. No matter how you angle your body, you\u2019ll never be able to see this in a mirror, because your eyes will always be, well, eye hight. If you were somehow able to take your eyes out of your head and see yourself in a mirror from a lower angle, then you\u2019d look more like this photo. Another reason her front leg looks so huge is lens distortion. Assuming the photographer was using an iPhone (it doesn\u2019t look like a dslr), this was taken using a 35 mm lens, which creates a significant amount of distortion. That means objects closer to the camera (her front leg) look significantly larger than objects farther from the camera (her back leg). ...and honestly, I\u2019m not really seeing what you\u2019re saying about the patio and grass. Sorry for the essay lol \ud83d\ude05  honestly it\u2019s fun for me to break down how an image was shot. it\u2019s important to remember there\u2019s no such thing as objectivity in photography. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s editing going on, but trust me - it\u2019s probably much less significant than you think. Learning to photograph my own body has taught me to recognize the techniques involved, and honesty given me a lot more confidence.

{"dmjyoel": {"text": "Parrot owner here. I love my bird and she spends a lot of her time outside of her cage, playing, exploring, or interacting with me or my mom. It's kinda like taking care of a kid, and it's not true that she has no input about her diet or environment. It becomes obvious pretty quickly if she doesn't like a particular food, so we adjust her diet accordingly. For example, we learned pretty quickly that she likes apples and grapes but not peaches, so we don't feed her peaches anymore. We try to keep it healthy, though: if it were up to her she'd eat nothing but peanuts, but they're fattening, so they are only for special treats.She also has a decent level of control over her environment. It's pretty clear from her behavior and body language if something is upsetting her, so we either remove whatever's making her upset or move her someplace where she's more comfortable. Obviously, there are a lot of abusive animal owners out there, but I do think that it's possible for birds to have good lives in captivity. ", "link_id": "t3_6xz72a", "time": 1504543542}}
