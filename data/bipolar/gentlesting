{"f7qlev8": {"text": "I lived in Germany in the summer of 2016. One late afternoon, around 4 or 5 pm, I was walking alone a friend's apartment. I had done the walk multiple times before, but that day one of the long streets I had to walk down was unusually empty. I was walking on the sidewalk to the left of the road, and the right side of the road was bordered by a park and a fence so cars could only turn left or keep going straight. I was about to reach the corner of the block, when three cars come out of absolutely NO WHERE and pull up, blocking my path. Here's a little diagram because I'll probably explain this poorly:|     \\^     |  &lt;Road&lt;  |     \\^     | .  *Park*  |     \\^     |  **Me**          | Road  |   The cars came down the vertical road. One turned left and stopped directly in front of me. The second car stopped on the corner, and the third car stopped a few feet behind the second car. As soon as the cars stopped, all three drivers (all men, I am a young woman) immediately hopped out of their cars. I made eye contact with all three of them. I have never felt as fearful for my life as I did in that moment. I am very sure I was about to be kidnapped. In what I can only describe as a miracle, a man riding a bike came down the street in the same direction the cars had come from. He looked at me, then at the men, and slowed down a bit. Before he stopped, the men got back in their cars and *sped* away. This all happened within maybe 15-20 seconds. I ran the rest of the way to my friend's apartment.I never thanked the guy on the bike. Mr. Bicycle Man, thank you. I'm pretty sure you saved my life.", "link_id": "t3_dxf5xh", "time": 1573965668}}

They fit well but run *very tight.* I am a size 5, petite, and weigh about 100 lbs. They fit my foot perfectly but have a just-bearable python grip on my thighs, so I've been wearing them around the house to stretch them out a bit. I was finally able to get them on over some skinny jeans yesterday.I would ONLY recommend this boot if you have small calves and small thighs. I couldn't find any reviews online  but thankfully the measurements were listed on the secondhand sight, so I measured myself and found a similar boot, the Stuart Weitzman [Lowland Boot](https://www.stuartweitzman.com/products/lowland/), to try on in-store. The SW also has quite a tight fit even for small calves, but a little less so than the IMs. I loved the SWs but they are way out of my price range and honestly my experience with their shoes hasn't been as great as I expected, particularly for the shoes I purchased from them at full price.All in all I'm very happy with my purchase.

I have done some cool shit that took a lot of effort. I work with people twice my age who have law degrees and I only have a Bachelor's in liberal arts. I did well in college and wrote a successful thesis.However, I also think that I have managed to fool everyone I know into thinking that I am hard working, capable, and intelligent. Nobody actually knows that I'm an idiot. My success is entirely based on lies and deceit, even though I'm not a deceitful person. I've just somehow tricked everyone into thinking I have the capacity to succeed, and I'm worried that one day everyone will find out.That is imposter syndrome!", "link_id": "t3_d1gwj2", "time": 1568042064}}

What we discovered were a series of exchanges spanning at least three years between the brother of our slumlord and a family friend. There were prom photos, poems, and exceptionally sad letters detailing the unfortunate reality of a late 90s - early 2000s teenage long distance relationship. It was pretty sweet.
