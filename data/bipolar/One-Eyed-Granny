In hindsight, though, what should I have noticed before my first episode? I\u2019ve thought about that a lot. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder before bipolar, as that half of the equation was more obvious to me. When depressed I felt like there was fog in my brain, my thoughts were less lucid than they used to be, I thought about more sad things, I lost the joy I find in my hobbies and friends, my self-image was totally wrecked, and depending on the severity of the episode suicide became a very attractive option.Upon reflection, I had one or two hypomanic-to-manic episodes before my major manic episode that got me diagnosed. During those times I got more interested in learning about and developing esoteric philosophy, my self-image skyrocketed to the point where I thought I was a super genius (I\u2019ve got some intellectual game but I\u2019m nowhere near that sort of level and when I\u2019m normal, I know it), I was confident I was unraveling truths about the universe, I stayed up extremely late, neglected my normal priorities in favor of walking around thinking about life, I drank WAY more caffeine as it fit my mood so well, I became more charismatic but simultaneously annoying to talk to as I\u2019d never shut up, and everything became what I\u2019d call more \u2018salient\u2019\u2014everything felt very visceral and important and special to my life.

I also thought it was my right/responsibility as a cia agent to forward my career. There are some really cool papers that came out of India on this applied linguistics formula called HFRECCA. It\u2019s a way of clustering words and phrases within a sentence that allows for you to assess the data hierarchically (ie dividing the sentences, paragraphs etc into categories and subcategories, and those categories into subcategories, etc) but also allows for that clustering to be \u2018fuzzy,\u2019 which means words/phrases are allowed to belong to more than one category. For example, my research for school is on climate change, so in this case it is useful to have the phrase \u2018climate change\u2019 belong to multiple categories because some people might refer to it as a monetary risk, while others might see it as a human health hazard (and others might see it still differently). Essentially, when you divide my data into categories based on the type of stakeholder who provided input and then apply HFRECCA to each dataset (or to the corpus as a whole), it gives you an idea of how they are constructing meaning, and how the groups\u2019 views differ from one another.Anyways, I wanted to go to India to meet up with those professors who had come up with the formula and published papers on it.

The messed up part is it didn\u2019t even occur to me that it was cheating when I did it. Not until I talked to her about it and she called it cheating did I realize what I had done. At the time I felt very isolated, and it was sorta my way of reaching out to the world to feel like people appreciated me. It\u2019s hard to describe the isolation that comes with your first hypo/manic episode. Picture it like you are seeing the world clearly for the first time, but no one else around you is seeing what you\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s a lonely place to be after a little while. So I think some of us look for a connection that is simple and uninvolved that makes us feel good. I feel horrible guilt about it, more than a year later. I will do everything in my power to prevent it from happening again. I never want to hurt another person the way I hurt her.

You could be a climate policy specialist/analyst/advocate, in which case you could work for an environmentally-focused Non-Government Organization (NGO) like the Acadia Center, NRDC, etc. or the UN, or a position in state or local government (especially if you are interested in adaptation policy).

{"f38e0n3": {"text": "Oh very cool, it\u2019s great to meet a fellow bipolar who is into Buddhist philosophy/meditation! I checked out the basic tenets of stoicism in response to your post..very interesting stuff. I like how growth-oriented it seems to be, and the way it sets up a sort of framework by which you can approach other philosophical ideas and daily situations. Very practical stuff. I think I agree with you that everything has a sort of essential unity to it. The thing I grapple with to this day, though, is the fact that \u201cI\u201d experience my own life while other people experience THEIR own lives, and neither of us experiences each other\u2019s life. That intuitively makes me think that there are some things in the universe that are separate from one another. It\u2019s confusing, because when you look at things as a combination of parts like Buddhism teaches, it seems pretty clear that phenomena don\u2019t exist in and of themselves, and don\u2019t have a fundamental essence other than the things of which it is made. So in that sense, my consciousness is a product of my body, and doesn\u2019t exist in any real sense. When I think about it that way, it\u2019s clear to me that the difference between myself and other things is basically illusory. But still, then I lose track of this point of view and somehow get stuck on the first point again!What was your transcendent meditative experience like? I\u2019ve gotten to some really cool head spaces, but never anything revelatory. Meditating on emptiness sometimes gives me this sense of immensity and depth and connection that I can\u2019t really put into words...it feels like being in a sensory deprivation chamber, where there\u2019s no difference between myself and anything else. I love that feeling, I haven\u2019t gotten to that deep a level of meditation in awhile. Working on it though!I love the alternative dystopian corporate futures explored in movies, although I haven\u2019t seen Bladerunner yet. Avatar comes to mind (the one with the blue people not Aang lol). Also the video game Borderlands, where you\u2019re roaming a planet dominated by interplanetary corporations who basically sell guns to everyone and provide regeneration stations so they can profit off of violence regardless of who is perpetrating it. Wild stuff.It\u2019s tough when you talk about things like for-profit prisons because I think the business mindset of neoclassical economics tends to prioritize profits over individual wellbeing, so we end up with these insane situations where prisons do their best to meet \u2018quotas\u2019 for total number of prisoners by putting undue pressure on parts of the justice system to increase incarceration rates. Which should NEVER happen!Elon Musk\u2019s vision of going to mars, etc doesn\u2019t really bother me as much, only because traveling to space is so far removed from that triangle representing the various levels of human needs (I forget what it\u2019s called) that it really is a luxury to go to space. That being said, it\u2019s a shame that the public sphere isn\u2019t putting as much money into a brighter vision for humanity\u2019s future...it would be cool if governments were more interested in colonizing space. Again, though, I think there are  so many other human needs that ought to be satisfied by government before we start expanding our sphere of influence to other planets.

{"f33j041": {"text": "I think that you have two different ideas going on here.One is the idea of hidden knowledge, or sacred knowledge, or a world that some people have access to which the rest of society, either of their own volition or through design, are excluded from. This is a very tempting way to look at the world, because it suggests that SOMEONE is pulling the strings and causing things to be the way they are.And, often, someone is. Check out Chomsky\u2019s work on control of the public mind, in particular the book Manufacturing Consent. Elites often (successfully) attempt to change the course of history to their own ends. The nuclear family was developed and portrayed on television quite intentionally starting in the 40s (?) By these wealthy elite groups in order to encourage couples to own houses, which indirectly halted unionization efforts (individuals with a house and a family, aka with debt in the form of a mortgage and dependents, are much less likely to go on strike). So, yeah, sometimes there are groups out there who see the world as a means to their ends, and manipulate society accordingly.Where I hesitate to agree with you is on the idea that there are some people or groups who have \u201cfigured it all out\u201d and possess the secrets of the universe, or human dynamics, or anything like that. There are certainly collections of individuals and centralized bodies of power that have immense sway in society and whose decisions alter millions and millions of lives (first world governments, the UN, IMF, World Bank, etc), but generally these groups don\u2019t share a cohesive vision or underlying understanding of human social-political systems. They are each purpose-driven, and each generally has a different focus. In other words, I think that the dynamics you\u2019re talking about are actually right out there in the open\u2014the problem is that they are SO taken for granted that it doesn\u2019t even occur to us that things could be another way.This transitions well into your second idea, that there are ways of seeing the world that go beyond how we are taught to see it, as illustrated by your example with the paper airplane. I couldn\u2019t agree more. Unspoken norms and expectations (which are promulgated by CNN, Fox, our education system, etc) preselect out \u2018ways of being\u2019 in society that reinforce mainstream thinking and marginalize  alternative systems of knowledge or understandings the world. For example, Buddhism\u2019s view of the world, consciousness, etc has incredible implications for how we ought to see ourselves and our relationship with the rest of the universe, other sentient beings, etc\u2014and not just in a religious sense. The logic often astounds me. Check out \u2018how to see yourself as you really are\u2019 by the Dalai Lama for a good introduction. The Universe In A Single Atom is good, too.I think the place where we disagree is that this knowledge is \u201chidden\u201d from us. In my opinion, it\u2019s not hidden\u2014it\u2019s just made completely uninteresting and irrelevant to most people because it doesn\u2019t coincide with mainstream ways of seeing the human world and the many institutions that comprise it.These thoughts are wonderful and can result in some very creative ideas\u2014just be careful that you don\u2019t get lost in the rabbit hole. When I was manic I got it in my head that the CIA was actually a HUGE organization (like 25% of the US Population) that controlled the music industry and inserted ideas into the public mind, both within normal cultures and counter cultures, to control society. I had a whole explanation for it, which I won\u2019t go into here. But I thought it was brilliant in its elegance and simplicity. Notice that part of my mania was in identifying a central body with \u201chidden knowledge\u201d as possessing the secrets of the world.I\u2019m not saying your first idea is delusional or anything\u2014I\u2019m just saying that, in my opinion, you actually CAN learn about the \u2018real\u2019 socio-economic, sociopolitical systems that govern the world if you want to.", "link_id": "t3_dfhask", "time": 1570639486}}

Basically, I went from analyzing climate policy to analyzing institutional characteristics of organizations. I came up with some REALLY cool data visualizations though! I figured out how to represent a correlation matrix in a circular figure called a chord diagram. It basically looks like a circle with lots of lines connecting different variables. The darker the line, the stronger the correlation a stakeholder group made between two topics. It was cool because when you compare the chord diagrams of different groups, it\u2019s obvious that they associate information in very, very different ways.

{"f2f3nit": {"text": "I\u2019m on Latuda too! I used to smoke multiple times a day every day. Then I got diagnosed and stopped for about eight months....then I visited some college friends and got high with them, and after that I started smoking weed again. Wake up, get high, go about my day, smoke a few more times here and there. You know the deal.Then Massachusetts banned vaporizers (my preferred method, as it\u2019s discreet) like a week ago, so I can\u2019t pick up any more cartridges. Honestly, as much as I love smoking, part of me relieved when I found out. Instead of buying flower or oil, I decided to use it for an opportunity to quit. It\u2019s so hard for me to control how much I smoke that it\u2019s better for me to stop entirely than it is to try for moderation.I was curious so I looked up some literature on weed and bipolar, and the one solid finding I read was that it tends to prolong manic and depressive episodes. It doesn\u2019t necessarily cause mania or depression, it just makes both last longer. That didn\u2019t stop me from smoking, of course.I\u2019m glad it helps you with your symptoms\u2014I feel like the choice whether to smoke should be made on a case by case basis. But if I were you I\u2019d consider whether smoking replaces or interferes with other aspects of my life. Am I getting high instead of meditating? Am I staying in to watch TV and smoke instead of socializing with my friends (I didn\u2019t tell my friends I started smoking again for that period of time because I told them I was going to quit).For me, smoking has short term benefits (I don\u2019t care as much that I\u2019m depressed, plus being high is the shit) that are outweighed by the fact that 1. I find it almost impossible to regulate my intake, so I end up sacrificing other parts of my life to getting high, and 2. Whether I like it or not, it prolongs my symptoms of depression (I have yet to smoke while manic).Those are my two cents. Hope this helps.

It\u2019s good to set out tasks for yourself to structure your time.If you\u2019re experiencing hypomania or mania, tell your psychiatrist right away because they will adjust your meds as needed.Meditation really help me with my negative thoughts. I\u2019ve noticed it sorta muffles them throughout the rest of the day when I meditate in the morning.Check out \u2018An Unquiet Mind\u2019 by Kay Jamison. It\u2019s a memoir from a bipolar (she calls it manic-depressive)That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got off the top of my head.

The tough thing is I\u2019m not really sure whether the conditions you were flying in were noticeably abnormal/if the wind speeds were outside the recommended zone. In my experience kites can usually handle a bit more than they\u2019re rated for (ie higher winds) so if you want your kite to be able to fly in windier conditions, buy stronger lines. But if you\u2019re concerned your kite\u2019s frame might not be able to handle the higher wind speeds, I\u2019d just stick with the same strength lines and fly during milder conditions.

Basically, we need an ideological revolution. The issue is that we (ALL of us) have blackboxed \u201cthe economy\u201d to a point where it is indistinguishable from reality itself.
