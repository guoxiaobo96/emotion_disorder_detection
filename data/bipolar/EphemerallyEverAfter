You're on the right track. Extended deadlines, you might want to rephrase as flexible deadlines in stages where your disability is in a debilitating state. Even just flexible deadlines might sound a bit better.As for recording lectures, that likely won't be approved for legal reasons. Instead, you would encourage you to request a note taker if you can show the need as related to your condition.In my experience, the real accommodation needed was just that flexibility for deadlines if something happened and I needed to be hospitalized. I also wrote a combined paper for two classes one semester with both professors' approval, as the classes were similar (though this was in grad school and was something people sometimes asked to do anyways).

There's nothing wrong with generic medication; I just remember hearing from a pharmacist in the hospital that people's doses were specific to their brand and could need to be changed if their pharmacy switched who they got the drug from (which can happen).It's a bit of a heavier antipsychotic in terms of sedation, weight gain, and other common side effects.

I base this off personal experience and the observations of theorists throughout the history of Western Philosophy....I too am a deep and analytical thinker.It's the same reason why there is every reason we should be happy sometimes but can't be, with this condition. This neurological affective happiness is a huge part of the gestalt experience that is happiness. And if you have a mood disorder, your body is unable to function properly. You could frame it as, something prevents you from being in good enough health to attain happiness maybe.  In the same way that another medical condition might make you unable to participate in something else  -- like a person whose had one of their legs amputated below the knee needing a prosthetic leg to be able to run a marathon, and actually have done the training to be able to complete a full marathon.I'm not sure how early on in your recovery and diagnosis you are, but if you're new, you should know that getting medication right doesn't equal happiness. That shouldn't discourage you. It may mean that when the medication is right, you will feel great because everyone else is in place. But it also alleviates you from the guilt of \"needing\" medication to ba happy a bit, because you'll know your happiness is an intersection of a lot of things and not you being dependent on a substance.", "link_id": "t3_g6amop", "time": 1587602096}}

{"ffaxymm": {"text": "Can I ask why Theravada? What would the benefit of that tradition be over Mahayana and Vajrayana sects?I feel a bit cautious about meditation groups that aren't tied to some kind of recognized denomination. Just cautious, not against. The reason is because I live on Oahu. I'm not sure if you've seen the film Holy Hell, but... yeah. That group is still active. There is another cult present on island as well. Coincidentally, one of my members of congress who is running for president right now is a member. And I do mean it's a cult. There's also a contact number on the website for Adidam if you are on Oahu and are interested in learning more, and they do have a temple on Kauai. It could be that there is just, like, one or two people on island, and I also know the group shrunk considerably -- especially after Franklin Jones/Adi Da Samraj died -- but this means there could be at least three veritable cults on island. And I do mean cults, not using it as a slur, or being liberal with how I use it (like the Hare Krishna are very active here but I don't consider them a cult). As for why Buddhism, it is a little complicated. First, I saw that therapist for  a year, and had been going to a meditation group he ran, and also did group therapy with him, for about 8 additional months as well... so almost two years. The group therapy was supposed to be Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy but even then he laid it on thick. Really, he did a lot of proselytizing instead of therapy -- especially in my individual therapy at the end.One of the ways I thought about coping was writing an article about this that I would get published somewhere. I'm an academic, so I'm  pretty strong writer when I'm not just hammering away on reddit (just don't want to sound arrogant saying I \"would\" publish it instead of \"try\"). When I was writing it, I googled for stuff about therapist abuse. One site listed cult-like behavio as therapist abuse that happens. It would be extreme to say I was indoctrinated, nor do I think i should say his twisting of the dharma constituted him creating a cult amongst his patients, but I think there was a small tinge of that. I did believe in the principles in Zen Mind, Beginners Mind and some other general principles of Buddhism as well. Admittedly, it took a year before I could meditate again or think about Buddhism.I came back to Buddhism because I was looking for a community and sense of belonging, which a religious group might provide, as well as a form of ontological security -- which religion does provide people. I'm fairly well acquainted with Christian theology because of my studies, as it overlaps with philosophy (and the two were essentially the same during the Middle Ages). I do not think I believe in the Christian God, and for me, I don't think I would feel comfortable going to Church if I didn't. I was raised until I was a teenager in a sect of Christianity that doesn't exist in the United States. I would attempt to find refuge at a church in that tradition and do my best to have a go at it without a solid faith in God if they did exist here. But they don't, so it would mean going to a brand new denomination, just like Buddhism means going to something brand new, if I were to get involved. So, for all those reasons, searching for those things, I looked to Shambhala because of its secularism, the emphasis on happiness instead of asceticism I was finding in CTR's writings, and being from the Maritimes. Actually it was a bit more extended than that... I started thinking about Shambhala back when I was that therapist's patients after he told us in the group that we could go to the Zen Center and the Soto Center MAYBE and dismissing all the other temples I or others mentioned. I asked about Shambhala after as we were leaving, keeping in mind I was Canadian and some day may have to return to the Maritimes since I'm not a citizen, and knowing there was an active presence back home. He said he had never heard of them. And then as I started thinking about a need for a community and ontological security last autumn, winter, I was reminded of it again, but I decided to looking into it seriously after I saw a copy of Shambhala Path of the Warrior in Barnes and Nobles and reading the first page or so and liking it. Because there is no center here (anymore), my interest meant searching on reddit, and I ended up here and seeing the full extent of the controversies and the harm done. We talked about this in another thread, but wikipedia has really downplayed it.Since then, I mean, I've had a mindset of, \"CTR may have been an abusive person, but, it seems like people still think his writing is credible\" and so I started reading Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, own Shambhala Path of the Warrior and plan(ned) on reading it next... I've read the Pocket Pema Chodron, and both Short Introduction to Buddhism and Short Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, and also am reading the Pocket Chogyam Trungpa. I can say that I still feel utterly confused about Tibetan Buddhism after reading the Short Introduction book, but the others I have enjoyed.  I know that Buddhism is not necessarily non-deistic, and certainly if I pursued any of the mainstream Tibetan traditions it wouldn't be, but I'm not closed to believing in some form of a deity or deities... I just don't right now and I feel like I'd be missing the point if that was why I considered a school of Buddhism. At the same time, looking for other non-deistic religions, there aren't many -- if any -- well established ones, and you start to enter into the realm of New Religious Movements. Which can be dangerous for the reasons I mentioned at the beginning of the post, as well as the fact Shambhala is considered one and look how that ended up. I feel so alone. Not just because my life is void of meaningful social connections and friends to spend time with... but I really miss my best friend who understood me better than anyone and I can't believe she did this to me.

{"ff7f3t4": {"text": "That said, there are some positives related to this.It used to be considered a medical fact that bipolar disorder got worse with age, as it causes neural deterioration. Mania and depression damage your brain, and so do rapid mood swings.This was largely for two reasons. There are people who post here who say lithium was a godsend -- and also that they don't experience any side effects from it. Further, because there are more options now, there are less people who have no option to take it, and the strict policing of your life to maintain levels is usually more of a \"thing to keep in mind\" than an imposition, as there are both newer formulations that require you to take it less frequently (twice a day instead of three), and doctors usually make your dose conform you lifestyle rather than make your lifestyle conform to your dose. So for those who benefit from lithium, it's great. I've seen so many people on here who love it. But unfortunately, it only works in about 1 out of 3 people. In the past, this meant people were forced to take it when it didn't benefit them much, simply because there were fewer options.Furthermore, antipsychotics cause brain deterioration. But then, doctors realized that anticonvulsants acted as true mood stabilizers (antipsychotics its' a little different, even the newer ones). These don't cause neural degradation.In fact, now that people have been taking anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, and the only people taking lithium are those who benefit from it, research is showing these drugs actually help the brain repair itself from the damage done before a patient was receiving adequate treatment.As a result, now doctors will tell you that, from their own experience, it tends to get a lot easier with age.

{"ff71mzn": {"text": "Since I saw had that random encounter, and I told my current therapist and grad chair to ensure the University keeps their word... well, I haven't had much luck. The only thing the Center's director offered was to allow me to start my appointments five minutes later, and come in right then so I would avoid seeing the old therapist when he came to get his patients. That is a terrible solution as it puts the onus on me, wouldn't actually offer any protection since other people are late and he could have to go to the front desk for something at any time, and offers no protection for if I need to do an urgent walk in. When I followed up with my grad chair, the associate dean told him to meet with the center's director, who had offered this stupid solution so she won't do anything. Though I do believe I have a good person fighting for me.At this point, I'm fairly certain I'm going to have to end up suing the university for a civil rights violation. This violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (federal), and you could make an argument that it breaks State law too as I go to a public university to things like \"access to all\" are listed in the State statutes, as well as \"pursuit of happiness\" actually being in the State constitution's bill of rights. Federal is more compelling an argument, and I know enough about the law (my degree is in law and society) to know that my rights are being violated. But grad students are poor. I can't hire an attorney. I would need to hope the ACLU or a disability rights group like Bazelon would take my case, which is a long shot since they receive a ton of requests for help and can only take on so many cases, and even if they do take on my case, it could be there is a wait time until there is an attorney available to file the suit and bring proceedings. Going to court is also traumatic. Further, while I do know a fair bit about the law, I don't know enough to represent myself adequately, nor do I know all of the recourses I have. There is a thing called a writ of mandamus where a state actor is compelled to act, so it could force them to do something to protect me and comply with the ADA. But I don't know if that would be filed at the State or the Federal level. At the State level, they go immediately to the Supreme Court. Last year the State Supreme Court only heard 18 applications for one, and only granted one. At the Federal level, it is circuit (trial) courts cannot hear applications for a writ of mandamus, and it is EXTREMELY rare the appellate courts do. That would mean, again, it has to be heard by the Supreme Court... but this case the Supreme Court of the United States. The chances of the Supreme Court hearing my case are like, non-existent... especially if I have to represent myself. A civil rights lawsuit itself means suing for damages for my civil rights being violated, i.e getting paid, when ultimately I want the university to ensure I'm protected and my rights respected. There has to be something else that is more realistic to get this protection than a writ of mandamus. But I don't know enough about the law to do this.My current best friend who I pretty much have lost as a friend (she won't speak to me because I spoke up about her doing something really, really hurtful and it's been over a month) is an attorney (though not in this field). I miss her dearly and it hurts immensely every single day and causes me a lot of distress. It's retraumatizing since it's so similar to what happened before when I developed PTSD, when my former friend I had feelings for ghosted me. And this current friend knows that but is doing it anyways, even though she knows it is and saw first hand how much those people hurt me last year, and it angering her. Fuck I miss her and I just want my best friend back and to be treated fairly in our friendship again. I can't even probe my romantic feelings... but she would be my only in to get a good lawyer to take my case on spec. The chances of me calling a good lawyer out of the blue and asking them to help me on spec when I am too poor to hire them outright are slim to none.", "link_id": "t3_ercy3u", "time": 1579639335}}
{"ff71ldi": {"text": "&gt; I\u2019ve just seen your added words and also wanted to say how sorry I am that you ended up with that Zen therapist. He sounds utterly appalling. Where on earth is the compassion there? People like that definitely should not be practicing as therapists. There is no excuse for that. Horrible.It is part of the reason why things are so rough right now. He is a therapist at my school's counseling center. After it happened, I kind of had the typical victim response: I blamed myself, was trying to pretend it didn't happen, and so on. Also, the atrocity of it remained hidden under the trauma I was experiencing from people who I thought were my friends spreading malicious rumors about me, contacting my family, and gaslighting me, and starting to convince me I was something that I was not and also found abhorrent (namely, a predatory, toxic male -- which hurt me deeply because such a person tried to date rape me when I was younger and had and still have a fear of hurting people romantically or sexually and romance and sex are tied up in my mind). It was only about two or three months later that it really sunk in and I filed a report with the school.I did so through my department (I'm a grad student), because I knew if I did it individually, it would be ignored. They wouldn't take me, a student, seriously, and I'd also encounter the conundrum of being unreliable since I am a patient and it's my word against a licensed psychologist's. It took a while and I (and my graduate chair) were kept in the dark until finally I got this short letter saying they took it seriously, it was investigated, and action was taken. It was one really short paragraph from the associate dean. I was livid as were those who helped me, and there were no details about what happened. The grad chair and department chair met with the associate dean in person about this and some other complaints against the counseling center. She was livid about what happened to me, and didn't need any prompting to recall what the complaint was. She said it was completely unacceptable and that she couldn't give us any details because it was a personnel matter and he was protected by confidentiality, but to please trust her. During this time, my grad chair's tenure had ended and it switched to a new one (they serve three year terms). Both the old one and the new one were therefore involved, as the old one stayed on board. She also spoke to the associate dean who conveyed the same thing. She knows her well, so when she said \"look I really can't say but please trust me.\" The current grad chair is completely skeptical about university administration, and so, it was shocking to him to see the associate dean actually taking it personally the therapist did this and was so angry. So we all trusted her. One of the things current grad chair said was \"we need assurance [me] can go in to the center and not have to encounter this therapist at any time -- either during appointments or if he needs and urgent walk in.\" And she said it wouldn't be a problem. It kind of sounded like they fired him.A year passes and I'm still angry about what he did, so I filed a complaint with the licensing board. We held off, because one complaint doesn't necessarily lead to anything major. The value is that, once a legitimate complaint is made, and some disciplinary action is taken (first offense likely wouldn't mean license being taken away), it makes it easier for others to come forward. Because it sounded like the University had taken serious and harsh action, the grad chair and I decided not to file such a complaint -- at first we were going to do it together -- and even thought maybe the University might do this. But they didn't, and when I filed it I clearly understood why... an actual aggrieved party has to be the one filing a complaint. So I filed it and it was largely cathartic and a way of coping and relaxing to write down \"this is what happened, this is how it was wrong, these are the APA code of ethics he broke.\" He also sexually harassed me beyond telling me to commit suicide. He told me to hire an escort and tried to pressure me into it, the same week I got sober and was reeling the loss of someone who had been my best friend and that I had feelings for... I'm not sure I would have developed feelings for her had he not persistently been telling me I couldn't be friends with an attractive girl since I was a man. I still don't think that's true, even though this is kind of happening again, albeit with no alcohol and this person I did genuinely connect with on a deep personal level rather than just being friends. But he pressured me, hard, even though I was experiencing intense psychological withdrawals from alcohol -- nearly persistent panic attack for a week, coupled with the panic from having seemingly lost all my friends, who subsequently started the things that would give me trauma... I thought with time those friendships would heal and return, and I think it would have with that girl had it not been for their gossip and lies behind my back, built on things I mistakenly told them in confidence about having insecurities about never having been in a relationship, kissed, and being a virgin -- which were ultimately extensions of never feeling loved or wanted, not being a resentful incel. These insecurities were also why the therapist was trying to get me to see an escort. The following week I told him how uncomfortable it made me and he backpedalled and said he was only trying to tell me it would be ok if I did do that since I had been considering it in the past (which was a total lie about me, and a lie about what had happened). That should have been when I stopped but I decided to move on. But before that, he also tried to get me to tell him what kind of pornography I looked at, and he treated me as if I was weird and had a problem for being uncomfortable talking about these things. Ditto for not going to strip clubs -- he tried to make me feel weird for not having any interest in going to a strip club.He did those things knowing that something sexually traumatic happened when I was 11 (I found my Dad downloading \"illegal\" pornography if you know what I mean, you just can't say it explicitly on reddit) and I think knew about the date rape attempt as well. The former, I told him in the context of thinking it was the root of some of these issues with romance and intimacy. Anyways, so writing the complaint felt good. But when I mailed it, I went to bed and had terrible nightmares. I woke up crying and went to the counseling center for an emergency walk in. When I calmed down, I began dissociating and it lasted for two days.I had a regular scheduled appointment with my new and current therapist (who is quite good), and he followed up about that urgent walk in (they do that, update your therapist if you have to come in to let them know what's going on). He told me that he wasn't sure if I knew, but that therapist was on leave that semester and it was unclear if he was coming back the next (this current) semester or not. Given everything that the associate dean said, coupled with the fact I found out he had applied for (and had been granted) a license for what sounded like a private practice, I assumed this meant he had been told to leave quietly, and was on paid leave for a semester or two to get his affairs in order and set up this new practice.I was wrong. I saw him shortly before new years as I was leaving an appointment. Fortunately, he was just a little bit ahead of me so I avoided him seeing me and trying to talk to me. But it gave me a terrible panic attack once I knew the coast was clear and left. So I was wrong, and the University wasn't upholding their end of the deal that I wouldn't have to encounter him again.It turns out it was a medical leave, though as I write this, it could have been a disciplinary suspension and they just told his colleagues it was medical. But who knows.In November he was also interviewed by a local investigative reporting newspaper that is widely read about a crisis of insufficient therapy services on campus. I was livid, because I thought he was on administrative leave for what he did which -- to the best of my knowledge -- kicked off this conversation, even though this was not something people would know, because I believe my department was the first to raise hell about problems there, and my case was the worse. It was mine along with people being denied services because of long wait times for urgent walk ins or to see a therapist for counseling. It pissed me off he would have the audacity to accept an interview when he would know this. And the newspaper has ignored me when I tried to talk to them about this. I gave up because I started writing an article on therapist abuse as a way of coping, which I hope I can publish somewhere. But I'm not working on it right now... too painful. Or maybe once the complaint I filed leads to an investigation (its a long process so right now its like an investigation to see if an investigation is warranted) I'll write a letter to the editor of the major newspaper about how the investigative one ignored me... because once there is an active investigation into a complaint it is listed online so there will be no chance of denying.(To be continued)", "link_id": "t3_ercy3u", "time": 1579639310}}

Neither are like the Antabus, the drug you used to see on TV sometimes where you got sick immediately if you drank alcohol (I remember there was an episode of The Drew Carey show where someone spiked everyone\u2019s coffee or something with it as a joke knowing they were all going to drink).Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, so it calms the receptors in your brain that might cause cravings.Acamprosate on the other hand works on specific receptors on your brain that alcohol works on to try and restore the brains of people who are abusing or addicted to alcohol to a state like it was prior to the abuse. It is an antagonist on NMDA / glutamate receptors, and is an \u201callosteric modulator\u201d for GABA receptors, which means that it alters how it responds to stimuli. NMDA and GABA are kind of opposites \u2014 the former is an excitatory neurotransmitter and the other a relaxing one. I\u2019m not sure how it works, but I believe they are responsible for how things like serotonin, dopamine, and so on get transported but I\u2019m not sure.Long story short, they both treat cravings like in different ways. And people find they help. Not usually alone, because even if you remove cravings or reduce them, you still have to deal with the reasons you did drink \u2014 even if you didn\u2019t know you had reasons you drank. But I wonder if one might help get you on the right track as a start, helping stop those next day wanting to drink.I know medication cost can be an issue.

The quoted block is \"next step\", action oriented, seems on the mark, who and how to dredge up a workable crew for participation?

I think the best bet would be to see who has made the most recent edits and see what their about, if they are recent. Of course, if it\u2019s a defender, then no. Maybe it\u2019s someone else who left, but doesn\u2019t use reddit. In that case they\u2019d be sympathetic.

{"fct1vc4": {"text": "I will say that, in my search for refuge in the dharma, and my initial inclination to turn to Shambhala Buddhism since I grew up in the Maritimes, reading the Wikipedia page I hadn\u2019t realized the gravitas or what is going on with the organization right now. This was only a few months ago, and it wasn\u2019t until I found this subreddit, gung-ho to start learning more and practicing, that I really learned about what was going on \u2014 how pervasive the sexual abuse was, and that Sakyong Mipham had done a lot more than make inappropriate advances against a few women (which would have been extremely wrong, don\u2019t get me wrong, but now I know he did this and much more, and was surrounded by people who enabled and aided him). My misunderstanding of what was going on made me think that the future would hold SM stepping aside and someone else would take the helm, and that would largely be all that was needed to be done, and the trickle down impacts would have been much smaller than they are.Obviously, my impression couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. I say this to affirm the importance of editing the Wikipedia page to truly reflect the state of Shambhala Buddhism.There was a Shambhala center in a town not too far from me. It would have been hard to get to, but hypothetically, I could have ended up finding a way to go out there (it\u2019s a long long bus ride though). I\u2019ve since then found out the reason it closed was because the membership dwindled to around 3 beyond the people running it. I assume that at least partially this was because of a the scandal, and those who ran the center didn\u2019t really want to be associated with Shambhala International anymore and didn\u2019t think it feasible financially to turn their center into an autonomous thing. But what if my circumstances had been different? What if there had been an active center readily accessible to me? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a guarantee I would have been roped into the toxicity (but who am I to say?) but I know there have been people who said the organization still has people who want to defend and enable rather than reform. So who knows? I don\u2019t, but it gives me pause.I can offer maybe a bit of advice on this front though. I was never involved with NXIVM, but when the CBC podcast about it was released, it hit extremely close to home. I had just stopped drinking and joined AA. I had lost all my friends in a slow hemorrhage, and Sarah Edmondson talking about the yearning for a community and making a difference in the world truly resonated with me. It made the abuse within NXIVM really hit me hard and I became somewhat invested in the case. I\u2019ve never been involved with editing on Wikipedia much, but I have looked at the talk sections on their page, and it may be worthwhile for someone wanting to update the pages for Shambhala and other related ones to do the same. There\u2019s been a lot of debate about what to include and what not to. I imagine a lot of the tension from Wikipedia\u2019s point of view and standards  is restricting it to things specific to the organization and what it\u2019s about, while also not turning a blind eye to everything that has happened. For example, you can\u2019t ignore the fact that corporation barely exists anymore, and was a cult, and had a vehicle for sexual slavery and abuse hidden within it. At the same time, it can\u2019t be a page to slander Keith Raniere.I could imagine there being a pretty significant section about recent history, or even a reworking of everything under history. Here\u2019s how it started, here is what people believed, Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa\u2019s lifestyle was concerning for a lot of people (and include his own uneasiness about people emulating him), what happened with his successor whose name I forget, up to what is happening now, including a re-evaluation of CTR\u2019s behavior in light of new norms, and the loss of prominent members and uncertainty about the future of the organization. All these things have been spoken about in credible sources, so as long as it\u2019s presented in a really factual way that\u2019s unbiased, I can\u2019t imagine the Wikipedia hawks undoing edits. It is, of course, better to do it somewhat gradually, as changing everything all at once will raise flags, even if everything is properly cited \u2014 just because it goes against a kind of norm to completely erase a page and rewrite it. It might also be good to start something on the talk section of the page about the need to update it. Since Wikipedia has already noted it sounds fishy, I am sure Wikipedia\u2019s community will be receptive to it. By Wikipedia community, I just mean that there are people whose hobbies include ensuring everything meets Wikipedia\u2019s standards and check up on edits, or there could be people who watch the page because their interested in eastern religion broadly or religion broadly, etc. And that\u2019s totally cool, it\u2019s just important to have a discourse with those people, I think, on the talk page. They\u2019re regular people. They wouldn\u2019t want to excuse or gloss over abuse either. P.S no doubt my history of Shambhala Buddhism is really simplified and misguided, I just meant to offer it as an example of what would work as a framework.I really hope my contribution helps.

{"fbbhcyb": {"text": "I also am not OP... but I do meditate! and, u/oceansrbeautiful, I think it depends on preference and the reason you are meditating. For me, it's both for the benefits for mental health, and spiritual reasons (Buddhism). I never meditate nude. I do meditate outdoors a lot, making nudity unacceptable, but that's besides the point.While you don't *have* to be nude, it does help to wear loose fitting clothing if you are to sit in a traditional pose like half or full lotus. Just like u/subgeniusbuttpirate finds clothing interferes with your flexibility, tight pants can make it hard to sit in those poses for the same reason -- or make it hard to do so comfortably. The purpose of the traditional sitting poses in Buddhism is partly because you can sit in one of them for an extended period of time without causing any strain -- that's partly why they were used in the first place. But it kind of stacks your upper body so structurally you are upright more so than you are otherwise, where you're using more of your muscles to hold you up to. This makes your stomach jut out more, and the waist on your pants can constrain your breathing and make it uncomfortable to breathe deeply into your abdomen (I'm totally blanking on the name for that part of your abdomen today!). So if you are wearing regular pants, sometimes people unbutton the top button their pants while they're meditating   and loosen their belt. I mean, I meditate wearing regular clothes all the time, like if I'm on lunch break sometimes I meditate in a zen garden nearby.

But I'm someone who recently became interested in Tibetan Buddhism and CTR, having grown up in the Maritimes, came to Buddhism through a psychotherapist who was a former monk in the Zen tradition who abused me, and turning  away from Zen because of that and some tensions with Zen doctrine and my own beliefs...

There are a lot of veritable critiques of those groups as communities. I'm comfortable saying that I got sober through AA but rarely attend meetings now, didn't complete the steps, and don't have a sponsor because of the really conservative politics about sex and gender that tends to be prominent in those communities. I won't go in to detail because that's not what this post is about. I also don't mean that Shambhala should turn to the sponsor-sponsee type model.What I mean is that, Alcoholics Anonymous' is highly  de-centralized in that each group is autonomous with AA as an organization really having very little to do with the running of each group; they're all completely run by members of the groups. One of the founders of AA was actually open about having been inspired by Peter Kropotkin, the godfather of anarcho-communism.When so much of the abuse was allowed because of the power dynamics, would something like this, that was a complete reversal of the hierarchy and making centers more autonomous, locally run and democratic, work?

{"fabj6lj": {"text": "Not wanting to go on lithium is fair. The difference concerning depression with lithium and lamictal is that lithium can boost your mood, while lamictal is more useful for preventing future lows -- it's a mood stabilizer that is effective at preventing the dips especially, if that makes sense. Lamictal is a good drug.That said, if at some point down the road if you do need to go on lithium, I want to try and dispel some of your discomforts, simply because it's not as bad as it used to be, and not as bad as people think. There are a lot more medications now then there used to be, meaning there are less people forced to take it when other medication that hadn't been marketed yet that will help more or have fewer side effects.Lithium used to be a pain to be on because you had to really alter your life. There are new  formulations of it now that don't require you to divide your dose up as much (twice a day instead of three). More so, they don't usually tell you to make drastic changes to your life as a result. It's more, \"live your life, and we'll dose the lithium so it conforms to your lifestyle.\" It's usually less \"we're going to get your level right and you're going to make all these changes to your life so it stays stable.\" For side effects, the worse is that, if you take it forever, you will almost certainly develop hypothyroidism. All that means is taking another pill, as its a very easy condition to treat. I don't think those medications are expensive either. So, it's an easy illness to treat, but another drug is another drug and depending on your circumstances, that might be a concern.As for kidneys, one of two things will happen. One, you start taking it, and immediately they see its impacting your kidneys. It doesn't change your scores drastically to the point that harm as done, but more like, \"oh this is impacting your kidneys so it isn't a viable medication for this patient.\" Example: I was on tegretol and one of my liver scores went outside the healthy range while I was on it. So we went off it. But my liver score didn't mean that any damage was done to my liver, and it lowered once I went off it. It is the same with lithium.Second, lithium will impact your kidneys unless they are compromised by something else. This is if situation one doesn't happen. You are digesting lithium fine. Great! But if something else threatens your kidneys, then they will have a harder time filtering certain things -- including lithium. So lithium would make *another* condition worse, if that makes sense.The other side effects are pretty meager. The worse would be some people have tremors but you would probably end up switching off it if you wanted if  that happen. Besides that, it's mostly having to pee more sometimes, getting acne... some people lose some hair. There is a lot of blood work, but that's mostly at the beginning. It's to get your serum level normal (usually  doesn't take long) and then make sure it isn't fluctuating and is stable and nothing wild is happening with other scores. Once that's established, the blood work is not that often. More once and a while, I think every 4-6 months.I say this as someone who does not take lithium and did not benefit from it, so I'm not  the patron saint of lithium.&amp;#x200B;**tl;dr: Lamictal is a great drug and think you made the right choice asking not to go on lithium. But if you do end up having to go on lithium someday, it's not as bad as a lot of people think. So you shouldn't live in fear of lithium.**", "link_id": "t3_e8aejn", "time": 1575924033}}

{"f9y4irg": {"text": "If you're 17, it's kind of a question of \"be on the lookout\" rather than making a diagnosis. On the lookout as in, things getting worse. They might not. Really when you're a teenager, these things tend to level out once you're a bit older. This not, at all, meant to slight what you're going through or say it isn't serious or dreadful, because it is -- and you deserve help and support to get through it. It just really is early, and it really might not get worse and might start getting better. You just can't know yet, because it could be the start of something. What's important is that you're seeing a doctor, so if it gets worse, it will be caught!I know you weren't expecting a diagnosis right now, but I do want to say a little bit more about that... bipolar can be hard to diagnose at your age, because pediatric bipolar disorder is rare. It can happen, and does, but it's rare. So I am just going to assume that this something fairly recent. So, it's a question of treating symptoms until there is a big enough picture to be able to see exactly what's going on.ANYWAYS to answer your questions.**Anger:** For bipolar disorder, yes, sort of. It's not a symptom but is a manifestation of a symptom. Many of the symptoms of (hypo)mania can make you angry. Like if your mind is racing and moving quickly, and people can't keep up with you, you might get frustrated with them easily. On the other hand, if you were depressed, you might get angry at people because of how much you're hurting. Basically, anger is a logical, understandable response that can follow from a number of different symptoms -- and not just the ones I mentioned. &amp;#x200B;**Borderline:** I don't see it from what you've said. It's a notoriously difficult illness to diagnose. That said, at it's core, BPD affects how you relate to others and form relationships. There's a lot of stereotypes of BPD that are centered on romantic relationships -- and it's true romantic relationships are often a really central part of a person with BPD's life -- but even if we put them aside, people with BPD often complain of feeling empty, because they usually find it hard to understand their identity outside of their relationships to others. They also usually engage in a lot of risky behavior for various reasons. These aren't things you've mentioned. The only thing that could *maybe* connect to BPD is you mentioned oversharing. If you feel yourself oversharing because you immediately trust someone, or fall in love/become enamored really quickly (by enamored I mean like \"this person is great they're gonna be my best friend!\" in addition to falling in love), then that could be a sign of BPD. Especially if you find those people end up chronically letting you down by not reciprocating, or if you find that you're opinion of them ends up changing really quickly, that could be too. A lot of people with BPD find themselves viewing people in an either \"all-or-nothing\" or \"black and white\" way. Like I said, it's a hard illness to diagnose. Love and relationships are a part of everyone's life, and BPD also isn't *just* about love relationships. You're right to see that BPD is another illness where your moods can be unstable -- and they do fluctuate more quickly in BPD than in bipolar disorder -- there's a lot going on with those fluctuations. But you haven't really talked about any of those things, and my sense is that -- if you did have BPD -- you would have, because they're not just problems with someone for BPD but things that really impose themselves on your life. I think it would be too hard to set them aside, y'know? That's just my thoughts.&amp;#x200B;**Bipolar 1:** Definitely don't have bipolar 1. At least not right now, since (if you do have a mental illness) things are still in the early stages. Bipolar 1 is not a very subtle illness. Really the difference between mania and hypomania is that mania crosses the threshold where you can't take care of yourself anymore. Hypomania is not \"normal.\" It's still clear to someone who knows you that something is off (maybe not to a stranger). Before I started taking a mood stabilizer, when I would get hypomanic, i hardly slept, had racing thoughts, would talk so fast I'd choke on my words, had an inflated ego, drank ***a ton*** and was making my own alcohol in my dorm room... all of this is out of the ordinary, but I could function in every day life and no one doubted my abilities to take care of myself. And I could. With full mania, you can't take care of yourself. And so, whatever is going on, if it were Bipolar 1 fully manifest, it wouldn't have been able to go unnoticed.But don't read too much into 1 or 2 and your doctor not specifying. At the end of the day, what matters is that medication you take helps you feel better, not the diagnosis. Because mental illnesses are treated symptomatically rather than through physiological tests, a diagnosis is more of a point in the right direction or map than it is a clear, clear cure/treatment. Think of it this way. Say you have a brutal sore throat that's not going away. You go to the doctor and they do a swab, and you have step throat. You'll be prescribed an antibiotic. Easy peasy. Well with bipolar disorder, you have antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, which treat the same symptoms but act on the body in incredibly different ways. Moreover, within mood stabilizers, lithium works differently than other mood stabilizers which were originally used as anticonvulsant medications do. Yet there is no one medication that will work for everyone and completely treat their symptoms perfectly. There's a lot of trial and error in finding medication that will work -- and a lot of people take medication prescribed off label. A diagnosis takes a lot of the guessing game out of things for the doctor and helps prescribe medication that is more likely to help... but it's not the end all be all and doesn't guarantee anything. The best doctor is one who will look at you as a patient and a living human being who is unique, not as a diagnosis.", "link_id": "t3_e7c893", "time": 1575723250}}

{"f8dly5e": {"text": "I'm on Lamictal (lamotrigine). It's the same thing -- an anticonvulsant/mood stabilizers (though works differently and Lamictal is only prescribed for a particular seizure disorder, not for epilepsy more broadly). Antipsychotics aren't actually mood stabilizers, but when they work for all aspects of the disease, it's really splitting hairs. Anticonvulsants work by stabilizing your moods by blocking sodium voltage channels that would allow for a mood swing to take place the same way that a seizure is caused by electric activity in the brain spreading across regions of the brain through those channels. Antipsychotics do something different, but can end up stabilizing your moods by virtue of doing what they do, so it's like they stabilize your moods, but not by acting as a mood stabilizer. Like I said, I'm just being really nit picky.I was on Depakote for about a year. It was a good drug. The only reason I switched was in the hope I would only need to take Lamictal, instead of Depakote plus an antidepressant. It wasn't true, but I haven't had a mood swing since switching, just the same flatline at depression without an antidepressant, so no reason to switch back.Only thing I will point out is, that yeah it does have a reputation for making you gain weight, but in truth only 1-10% of people do (which does make it a common side effect) so don't live in fear.And also, you said sodium valproate. I just want to let you know that that is not Depakote but very close. Are you sure it was sodium valproate and not divalproex sodium or valproate semisodium? It's not entirely unheard of to be prescribed sodium valproate -- especially in the UK. It is virtually the same thing. Essentially, when they first discovered it was effective  for epilepsy, it was administered in an acid form (still a pill) called valproic acid. A lot of people found it caused stomach upset (some people find Depakote does too, and actually I did). But they found combining it with the salt form worked as well and caused less stomach discomfort, so they started producing the two together in a 2:1 ratio. So Depakote pills have two valproic acids for every sodium valproate. But really it's all the same just different formulations (and maybe the dosages vary across form idk).", "link_id": "t3_dzxdfb", "time": 1574497567}}

When we're together, I feel really happy and safe and largely content, like I'm able to focus on the friendship rather than my feelings.None of this means that you're wrong. Distance to focus on myself I am sure is the right thing to do and what I am focussing. I guess I am insecure about all the rejection I've had which has felt very personal, because of the ramifications it had (which is a long story).&gt; Also, honesty is always the best policy. I think you should tell this friend how you feel and if their reaction is, \"I don't feel the same way,\" then tell them you need some distance from them. Then you aren't ghosting them at least.This is where I feel like I might disagree given the context. What they have said to be is they are still crushed over a recent breakup, and not being able to move on despite recognizing how toxic their ex is. Which made the dating apps so much more shocking. But anyways, this makes me think if I told them, the answer would be no and our friendship would end. It's not a risk I'm willing to take, and because falling for best friends in the past has backfired so much and ended things, I decided they would have to make the first move.Because we never dated, I want to think that by all means our friendship is fine, and it isn't even a question of being \"salvageable\" because there has only been a hiccup rather than a breakdown. You are right about a timeout, but I also don't want to make it too long. If you distance for too long, it's effectively ending a friendship. You start to move on from them and don't look back. I've seen it too often. Guess the context matters a lot though. I've just had people say they need space because they didn't have the courage to admit they wanted to end the friendship (maybe admit to themselves) for reasons that ended up being ableist. Timeouts can be inconsiderate to the other person, because it doesn't consider them not wanting a timeout and what they need, and by no means am I getting indications they want a time out. The strategy I've kind of decided to use starting today was, not to be the one to reach out and not make future plans if/when we do hang out next. But being very receptive when they reach out, and kind and acting like normal.Meanwhile...  have a date with someone else tomorrow. I find it hard to let go of the thoughts of my friend, but I have to keep trying and focus on other productive things.", "link_id": "t3_dc2acg", "time": 1570060725}}
{"f23c6zo": {"text": "I'm a straight, cis-gender man with bipolar II disorder who ***did*** question if i might be a trans in the past. I do know that, when I take gender assessment quizzes online, I tend to get androgynous. Anyways, I wanted to offer a bit of my story because I see some similarities, even though our stories are really different in a lot of ways.I'll start by saying that people who have posted and  said that these are two separate issues, they are 100%, totally correct. There is no relationship between gender dysphoria, or your gender expression, and bipolar disorder. However, for me, I do think it came from a mix of societal norms and severe, severe depression. That said, I did ultimately realize that I was indeed male. Here is why I think those things contributed to what I was experiencing. I have always been really sensitive about intimacy and sexuality, because I experienced something traumatic when I was about 12, and then as an adult escape a date rape attempt. I've never been in a romantic relationship, and I didn't have my first kiss or lose my virginity until quite late in life. For me, love and sex are intertwined. I'm not interested in casual sex with someone I don't care about -- or at least not comfortable pursuing it. And that's fine. I'm also a fervent feminist, and men who are pigs and objectify women ***drive me up the wall.*** This bout of depression was triggered by heartbreak, and truth be told, I was a lot less mature then and so maybe now I wouldn't have reacted this way (I actually don't think I would), but it made the hyper sexualization of culture more glaring for me, and intensified the heartbreak and any feeling of inadequacy I had for being a virgin, which I hadn't yet realized that actually wanting to be loved  and have a relationship with intimacy on *all* levels -- maybe even emotional more than physical.&amp;#x200B;More importantly for this story, toxic masculinity also became more apparent to me, and it bothered me more. I was very, very deep into depression and I know my thinking was skewed and off. I began to resent those kinds of men so much that I began to lump *all* men into that category of objectifying women and treating them as sex objects. However, I didn't see that in myself. I don't remember feeling it narcissistically, but it made me wonder if I maybe wasn't transgender and a lesbian.&amp;#x200B;I'm sure anyone who reads this who *is* trans will think that what I just described is *nothing* like real gender dysphoria and I would definitely agree. In my opinion, mental illness took a toll on me, and a strange toll on me because of what I've been through. Everyone's lives are different, and everyone's experiences are different. I live with bipolar disorder differently than another person. It just happened to bring up these feelings in me for a while that I truly, truly do not believe were related to gender dysphoria as it related to coming to know that one is a trans-man or trans-woman.I know it can be confusing, and being a teenager is a confusing time. I don't mean that in a patronizing way... it just is because you're figuring shit out in your life. All I can say in terms of advice is not to force yourself to \"know\" right now. Just because there isn't a connection between gender dysphoria and bipolar disorder doesn't mean it isn't possible to have both. Someone has already posted who has experienced both. But you will know when you know, and I don't think you should pressure yourself into figuring it out right now.I can say that when I was going through this, the people on the AskTransgender subreddit were great. Of course, the usual rule of thumb of not going overboard and asking a billion questions all at once applies but that goes for everywhere.&amp;#x200B;Finally, I can say that what you described -- wondering if you're a top or a bottom -- really isn't a sign of anything related to gender. Equating being a bottom with feminity is one of those instances of a weird mix of sexism and homophobia that becomes a social norm and you don't realize it doesn't have any real basis. Not that I'm calling you homophobic or sexist, I'm not at all. I just want you to know that that's where the idea comes from -- that the person who is toping is the \"male\" and dominant and the bottom is the woman and passive. But in truth there is really no biological correlation between being a bottom and womanhood, because the reason that men enjoy anal sex is because of their prostate, which women don't have. That's why you see articles now saying that straight men need to start being open to butt play, lol. More common signs would be wishing you had th body of a women, and having thoughts like wishing your penis would go away, if I'm not mistaken.", "link_id": "t3_dblium", "time": 1569916157}}

{"f22aosj": {"text": "Relapsing isn't a failure. The time you went without self-harming was a success. I bet it was longer than the interval before! That is, the period between relapses are getting longer and longer. And that doesn't mean you'll relapse again either and it will just be further away than last time. Don't even think about that.

I think there's a saying in zen meditation for when you lose focus and your mind begins to wander, and you need to come back to breath counting or whatever you use to meditate. Coming back to your breath is a success, and getting distracted wasn't a failure. If it happens 100 times, it's 100 successes, not 100 failures.&amp;#x200B;Does that make sense?As for Neosporin, yes. Or, sort of. That will prevent infection, but it won't make the wound heal faster. The best way to make it heal faster is to cover it with a bandage to keep it warm and moist -- this will allow it to heal faster. About three times a day, wash it gently with soap and warm water, and then apply Neosporin. Then cover it with a bandage and leave it. You can get big bandages if need be.

{"en449k6": {"text": "So, I know it wasn't what you were asking, but the reason moclobemide isn't available in the US has nothing to do with it being old. It's actually semi-new, like, 90's. But the reason is money. Essentially, the manufacturer of it before patent expired, Roche, conducted market research that showed it wouldn't be as profitable as  they would have liked, I guess. To give you some insight in to why, it was marketed when the buzz of SSRI's was still pretty strong. I suspect that atypical depression wasn't as thought of as much back then either, and I know bipolar depression was not. These are the primary pools of people who are prescribed moclobemide since SSRIs are first line still in countries where it's available. There are advantages to an SSRI over moclobemide, namely, you only have to take them once a day whereas moclobemide you have to take in a divided dose. There are also a few drug interactions with things that are fairly common -- ephedrine, dextromorphan, and diazepam. So, for all those reasons, I guess their research found doctors wouldn't prescribe it enough to be worth running clinical trials to have it approved -- you have to have trials run in the USA for FDA approval. You can probably see why if you distance yourself from the fact you're probably really suffering and seeing that this drug could help you. A patient comes in for depression, which one would you prescribe? If you prescribe them the one they need to take twice a day (I think it's twice but it could be three) runs the risk of them not being diligent in taking in. If you have to take it once a day, much less of a risk. &amp;#x200B;So, yeah that's why. But that's not why I'm responding.&amp;#x200B;I'm responding because I periodically just search Canadian pharmacy on reddit to stop people from going down the online Canadian pharmacy route. It's sketchy. I'm Canadian, and was raised by a pharmacist. So I know the ins and outs of it quite well. I also have Bipolar II disorder which gives me depression I've really struggled to overcome, so I know how it feels.&amp;#x200B;How Canadian pharmacies work is, when prescriptions are filled, it goes through the doctors billing number. The billing number is basically the number associated with their medical license -- they don't actually get paid for prescribing the medication, it's just what it's called. It's of course to ensure people who are actually doctors are writing the prescriptions, lol, but also because there are limitations on prescriptions based on specialties, etc. &amp;#x200B;Long story short, no billing number, no prescribing privilege. So an American doctor cannot write a prescription that can be filled by a Canadian pharmacy.&amp;#x200B;A lot of online Canadian pharmacies are scams. Like, steal your credit card scams. The more legit ones (i.e one that will actually send you a prescription) say that the way they get around this is by having a Canadian doctor co-sign the prescription. This is illegal as a doctor is not allowed to prescribe to patients they have not personally examined. So they'd be breaking the law. Furthermore, there's no financial incentive strong enough that enough doctors would break the law to sustain this industry. Doctors in Canada are very well compensated, and the provinces impose some guidelines on their practices. No one practicing medicine in Canada isn't busy I can tell you that. &amp;#x200B;Of the online pharmacies that will send you something in the mail, there have been lots of reports about fake stuff being sent. Of the ones that aren't fake, a lot of the time how they get around the laws is they have a rubber stamp  address in Canada, ship medication from a country with laxer laws, and then ship to you.&amp;#x200B;The whole online Canadian pharmacy thing sprung up in response to word getting out that prescription drugs were much cheaper in Canada than the US as the government regulates drug prices. &amp;#x200B;Long story short, my sincere advice is to not try this. You really can't get it in the US and it is not worth trying to circumvent that by trying to get it from Canada, unless you live on the border and can go to a real Canadian pharmacy to get a prescription filled. I'm sorry, friend.&amp;#x200B;I've never been on this medication, but it might be something for you to look into. It's not entirely the same, but, in the US there is Emsam, if you've never gone on that. It's an MAOI like moclobemide that's very new. It also doesn't have the dietary restrictions older MAOI's, just like moclobemide doesn't. They're not entirely the same. Emsam is MAOI-A while moclobemide is MAOI-B -- and I have no idea what difference it makes. People on the bipolar subreddit say they find it works well and has no side effects. The only downside I can think of is that it is a transdermal patch, so you can't really get it wet, and I swim a lot (I live in the US now). So, not a good option for me.

{"em768ql": {"text": "I'm 28, M. I'm not a virgin anymore, but was up until this year. I've struggled with my mood (bipolar disorder) and it's bled over into my love life. As it turns out, I also have PTSD which explains a lot. Long story short, mental health kind of interfered with love and intimacy even though I'm a nice guy and good looking and make friends easily. There was just kind of a block for me entering into romantic relationships and still is. I don't say that as \"nice guy\" complex kind of thing, it's not a resentful/judgmental thing but just a fact my mental health put up a block when otherwise I'm easy to get along with, if that makes sense. But obviously when something like PTSD is interfering, it's not a case of \"oh it just hasn't happened\" but there are a lot of feelings of fear and danger that come with thinking about those things, which is really the reason why it took so long because pursuing someone literally felt like I was risking my life at great pain. And it caused a lot of pain.Last year, I had a terrible therapist. He was terrible because, during the fall, when I was suicidal, he told me to go ahead and do it if I wanted to. That was his response, not to try and help. But it wasn't the first instance of inappropriate conduct. In hindsight, we were on way different pages about gender. I'm a complete, devoted feminist and he thought me too movement had gone too far. Pretty much around this time last year, he told me to hire an escort.Now, sex work is obviously a controversial topic. Some people are in support of it, while others are not. So me saying that it was inappropriate is not a moral judgment about the profession or commenting on that topic. The innapropriatenes of it was the context and timing in which he brought it up. I was going through something very painful and upsetting in terms of heart break and the dissolution of friendships. That cause an extreme amount of pain (understandably) but it was also the same week I came to terms with the fact I had developed a drinking problem, and was getting sober. It was bad enough that I was taking abstinence medication. I asked to go on it thinking it would lessen the psychological effects of withdrawal (and it might have), but even though it wasn't a question of them saying I needed to o on them, the fact i asked and my doctor said yes it would be ok shows that there was a problem. I was in a near constant state of panic for a week and would go to school, then go home and take a sedative (I now am on Klonopin but think at the time it was Ativan) and sleep. I was not in the correct frame of mind for him to be making that kind of suggestion, and he pushed *extremely* hard for it and was kind of aggressive. It upset me. Some friends, I talked to about it. Most were appalled, but one who I trust quite a bit was all for it. It overwhelmed me. I took Ativan and went to bed.I posted about my experience on one of the bipolar disorder subreddits which was kind of my mental-health support home base in some ways. They were really supportive, but someone said, \"you know, you should ask on the sex workers subreddit. They might have a better take on this that will help you make your decision.\"And they did, but truthfully, please don't go there and ask if you are thinking. Since then there has been a bit of a disagreement in that community about if those kinds of posts are ok or not, with some people wanting a dedicated space to just talk about concerns in their vocations and not field questions from (potential) clients and I think people should respect that.Anyways, this as before that was going on there, and a lot of people were very helpful. Someone recommended tantra and said it might help me get more comfortable with and knowledgeable about my sensuality/sexuality and it would be less of a \"I'm going to go get laid\" and more of a therapeutic act. Not that there is anything wrong with either of those. But I had, like a lot of people, a desire for my first time to not be with an escort, had never saw myself hiring an escort, and had a certain perception of who a john is that I did not want to be like. So this was literally around this time, 2018.Flash forward. I lost my virginity in 2019. Obviously if I was just diagnosed with PTSD, things aren't perfect by any means. It's still a journey I am on, and I am sure I will get to a place where I can find someone who loves me and who I love in turn, who I find beautiful, and connect with in all the right ways. One of the reasons I brought up \"I'm a nice guy, I get along with people\" etc is because I used to *not* think that and think I was somehow \"wrong\" or broken, and thought I was ugly (but now think I am handsome) and the fact I am a good person was a realization I had to work towards. I now have to work towards not blaming myself for developing PTSD, but that will come too. The battle goes on.I thought about tantra again. Last year, I started going for therapeutic massages from time to time (meaning, of course, non sexual). The idea was to destigmatize touch. Tantra is kind of taking that feeling to the next level, being exposed to erotic touch and getting comfortable with it.How did I find them? I forget to be honest. I believe I may have searched tantra and my city or state, or tantric therapy, tantric escort and my city or state or something. But something along those lines made me come across her profile on a website called private delights. She actually wasn't from here, but a lot of people who engage in the sex industry tour, and while she isn't a famous super star person, she was kind of going to a few places around the area for a few days. So, it was about a month or two ago I found out and contacted her. I told her my situation, what I was looking for, etc, and asked if she thought it would be a good fit and so forth. Going forward, I was very much motivated by a desire for something therapeutic.What was I expecting? Well, I was largely expecting it to be centered around massage. And it was. But the massage was different. I thought it would exclusively be me lying on my back and a massage that wasn't a hand job but did focus primarily on the genitals, pelvis, thigh, etc. And it wasn't. It was more like a nuru massage, starting with me laying on my stomach and a full body rub, then kind of the same on the front but the front was not really a rubbing with her body and just the kind of massage of genitals. She also licked and sucked my ears which I hadn't expected but was nice.Now I know that the majority of tantra sessions, especially ones that are advertised more openly, do not have any orgasm component but being totally skills based in a sense (breathing, etc). However, I did expect we would have intercourse and here is why. Her ad did suggest this wasn't just the kind of skills based tantra session, it was on a website for sex work, and on her ad she had listed every sexual act other than vaginal intercourse as prohibited. When i got there, once it came time for her to do the front, she said, \"my policy is no fluid exchange, so no oral or anything, and of course not full service, but any touch is fine.\" So as in, I could touch her, I just couldn't perform oral on her or kiss her, and she wouldn't be doing the same for me. This didn't upset me, again because I was going in with the desire for something therapeutic, not to get laid. But it did culminate with an orgasm, and that was the point, and she was telling me to think about a goal during it (because tantra is sacred sexuality, y'know, spiritual). I actually think, had I wanted to, we could have kissed. Because afterwards she asked if, when I lost my virginity I had gotten to kiss, and I said a little bit. My guess is, had I said more, or said \"not really\" (which was true because there was hardly any kissing), she would have offered to teach me. That's just my guess and not an expectation.Knowing I was starting out in my sex life and coming from someone who had been traumatized, she also had a mindset of, I will let you practice being a lover as well. It sounded as if she always gives clients time to pleasure her, but she said she would give me more than most. Usually appointments are an hour to hour and a half but she offered to see me for 2 hours since it was my first time (in addition to time before to get to know each other and discuss, wash, and talk a bit after, so all in all I was there for like 2.5 hours). So I also gave her a \"massage,\" like touching her, and then she told me to massage her between the legs with oil, so also learn a bit about pleasuring a woman.So it was really like a good experience for a young man who wants to be a safe and caring lover but is not experienced.As with anything, it is good to research and find the right person/thing because this person was more engaged and compassionate than some other people, and that's fine. But if you are looking for something as personal as this, you have to have a dialogue and make sure that's the kind of thing the other person is offering.", "link_id": "t3_bj2d7c", "time": 1556682862}}

You should think of it less of bipolar being a disability and more, are you disabled (for work purposes) by your illness. If you do not think it will interfere with work at all, then you don't need to check it off. If you do think it will, then yes. &amp;#x200B;If they hire you, they are required to provide the needed accommodations (though you may need medical documentation, i.e a note from your doctor conforming you need said accommodation for said diagnosis). I'll give you an example. It's really important for people with bipolar disorder, when it comes to work, to maintain a work schedule in line with social rhythms, i.e, m-f 9-5 as in the norm. Deviating from that can make you out of join with the rest of society and can have bad implications for your mood. So, I worked at a call center and ended up working f-m, 10 hour shifts from 5pm to 3 am. It had bad impacts on my mood. I moved to Sunday to thursday 8 hour shifts, 7 am - 3 am. I didn't end up needing a doctor's note because they were willing to work with me as is, but that is an accommodation.&amp;#x200B;Are you lying if you say no? No because this is voluntary disclosure. It has to be by law, and it doesn't exclude you disclosing a disability later. If they give you any flack for it, it is a huge violation of the law under the ADA and you have the right o sue and would win. That's really not a secret so you really shouldn't worry about it. It's standard business practice. Human resources adhere to it.&amp;#x200B;So it comes down to if you feel you are disabled and need some form of accommodation. Accommodation is key.

I was on Zoloft and it didn't make me manic but it was too stimulating, made me uppity and sweat profusely.&amp;#x200B;I grew up in Canada, and one of the benefits of Canada is they police drug companies giving doctors incentives more. Plus all these SSRI's are in generic now it's not even worth them trying (note: I'm not saying there's no lining of the pockets in Canada, just less and it's more when it comes to drugs not yet in generic).&amp;#x200B;Anyways the upshot is that doctors ended up prescribing antidepressants according to which ones were best tolerated in my community. I was in college, so enough said. Everyone was on Celexa. The pharmacist flat out told me once that it tended to have the fewest side effects of that group. Some people only need 10mg, the lowest dose, of Celexa for anxiety.&amp;#x200B;There's LExapro which is a newer version of it, which is kind of like what Pristiq is to Effexor, if that makes sense. I don't know if that would be a better option or not, though I think they may try and push that over Celexa now. The benefit is that Lexapro (and Pristiq) tends to be like, one dose that works and has fewer side effects than the doses of Celexa and Effexor that are often needed. But if you only need the absolute lowest dose of Celexa, ,side effects might end up being lower than the LExapro dose. Something to talk to your doctor about, don't take my word for it. But what i've seen with my friends, and experienced myself, I would advise asking about Celexa if you want to try another SSRI for anxiety because it's really more focused for that than other SSRIs.&amp;#x200B;Not sure if you've ever been on Buspirone/Buspar before but it can be an option too. It's older and can be kind of spotty -- doesn't work for everyone, and I think it can be a bit sedating for some people. But, it would be less sedating than hydroxyzine. It is somewhat similar to an antidepressant, but it's not an antidepressant. It works on serotonin but isn't a repute inhibitor. It's either an agonist or an antagonist, and specifically for anxiety. It can also help for sexual side effects of other psychiatric medication.&amp;#x200B;Someone mentioned gabapentin. Good drug. Very good drug actually.

Research goes back and forth about if they are beneficial or not. I don't know what the most recent research says but I know from bringing it up with my (former) psychiatrist once when I asked about it when he was prescribing an antidepressant and he told me just that: it goes back and forth and in practice psychiatrists know they help some and not others but a mood stabilizer alone should be tried first. Some psychiatrists will even try adding an antidepressant to a mood stabilizer before they try adding an antipsychotic for a few different reasons -- but that's just their respective medical opinions. Another doctor poo poo'ed my worries about going on an antidepressant and said it was safe since I was on Depakote, and I have to say in my case he was 100% correct.All of this is just to say don't discredit antidepressants just because of what you think the research is saying. They have a place in bipolar disorder treatment for a lot of people without side effects. Being on a mood stabilizer -- a true mood stabilizer and not an antipsychotics -- really helps mediate the potential of a manic swing (which is grossly overexagerated). The real concern is if your moods aren't stable, and you use an antidepressant to lift your mood, when eventually your mood does swing it goes higher than it was before. If you're on mood stabilizers and your mood has flatlined at depressed, it's a different question.&amp;#x200B;ANYWAYS, amitripytalyne. It wouldn't be a doctor's first choice, because, they tend to try and start with the more milde side effects antidepressants and then move backwards to older ones when newer ones fail, as older ones do have more side effects and risks but cover more neurotransmitters and are different. I don't think a doctor would prescribe a tricyclic until two SSRI's had failed. That is my guess, not a fact. And I am not sure if they would go to that one in particular as, iirc, desipramine has the fewest side effects of the tricyclics. Though it is one of the more lethal ones, so that needs to be taken into consideration if a patient has a history of suicide. Lots of things to take into consideration as is the case with prescribing any medication class in finding the right one.The exception to this might be clomipramine which is specifically indicated for OCD, if the  anxiety has that kind of tinge to it. However, I honestly can't say if it is any better than the other antidepressants for that, or if clomipramine was just the one they happened to research for one reason or another. I'm told that is the case for Luvox -- that was just the one they kind of picked to do research on and push for FDA approval for OCD while other SSRIs are just as effective (though Luvox works on a protein neurotransmitter that other SSRI's don't so maybe it is different).", "link_id": "t3_aun6i5", "time": 1551182996}}

{"egy8789": {"text": "Can I ask if she is taking medication for her alcoholism? I don't mean an anti-depressant -- though I also don't \"don't mean them\" to poo-poo them because -- but one of the medications they use for people trying to get sober. Usually naltrexone is prescribed -- and for good reason because it's easier to dose. But there is another one called acaomprosate/Campral that works differently than naltrexone, boosting neurotransmitters that alcohol abuse diminishes (naltrexone calms the opioid receptors and helps that way). It's just as effective as naltrexone, but it also being researched for depression and anxiety, so it may be more helpful when a mood disorder is woven into alcoholism. The downside to it is: it's a bit newer so it may be more expensive (I honestly don't know) and the dosing is harder -- you have to take it three times a day instead of once a day (or even for some people as needed). I found it quite sedating too. But it helped.&amp;#x200B;The reason I bring this up is that because alcoholism is definitely a disease. There is no doubt. And the bulk of the treatment has to be psychological. But sometimes people forget about medication, especially after we're no longer talking about medications for withdrawals.

{"eguigfw": {"text": "Well here are my thoughts.1. In terms of passivity -- yes you are taking the first move by scheduling this appointment, but if you are more comfortable with letting her guide you rather than being the active partner, that's fine. It's not weird. She's cool with it, I guarantee. I'd actually recommend that. Not that I'm some expert on sex but my belief is that this first time should be focussed on you experiencing and getting the most out of it rather than taking charge. Do that once you've had an experience under your belt. That doesn't mean you won't do more \"active\" things like a sex position where you are doing the thrusting, but she'll be giving you guidance and helping you instead of you \"Taking charge.\"I'd also hazard a guess that what will happen is you experience one of those moments where there is a lot of anxiety leading up to it, but when you get there you find yourself tranquil and in a state of zen. That's how it was for me, and we seem somewhat a like. And if you are anxious she'll try and make you comfortable and I guarantee you that won't be a big deal either and she won't judge you. She will have had weirder experiences than someone who is nervous on their first time.2. The solution is... don't make the message creepy. Say something like this if it seems natural to you.\"Hi (insert name). I hope you're doing well, and I'm looking forward to meeting you. I've been feeling a little nervous, so I wanted to follow up to let you know this is my first time seeing a provider. I'm actually a virgin, and so I wanted to let you know I might be a little anxious and might need a lot of guidance. But I'm really excited to come to Nevada and begin this part of my life with you. Take care and I'll see you soon!\" I'd maybe not do that now but a bit closer to the date. Maybe a week before, or a couple of days before. If you want a kind of additional \"in\" to be e-mailing her, you could add at the beginning something like \"I just want to confirm everything is ago and we are on to meet next Tuesday at 10\" or whatever day and time. Up to you.If you've dated before, you have the social skills to write a normal, well-adjusted message to her. The mistake would be giving her your life story. You're a virgin. You don't need to justify waiting to her, or give her a reason. You're likely caught up in a lot of social mores, popular tropes, and the patriarchy that are making you assess yourself according to some universal standard of what is and isn't normal. But the narrative you're measuring yourself against is fucked up and stems from a culture that renders women into sexual objects and casts men as studs and makes people like us feel guilty or inadequate for not being the archetype of the male. Even if you're not feeling bad for being a virgin right now, and you shouldn't, you're still thinking according to what you think is \"expected\" and that's not good. It's not creepy to contact a person who has agreed to be intimate with you about being intimate with you so long as you aren't being vastly inappropriate/strange (\"I've been dreaming about you,\" \"I want you to meet my mother,\" \"you fill a void in my heart that's existed ever since JonBenet Ramsey was killed,\" \"I wrote a poem about JonBenet Ramsey. I'd like you to read it,\" etc.) vulgar (\"Can't wait to destroy your cunt\") or harass her by sending tons of e-mails. Just send the one. You can send a thank you e-mail the day after if you want so long as it is short but you're not expected to.3. My response to this is also connected to the kind of narrative, and again it is damaging to both men and women (or part of a broader discourse that is damaging to everyone at the very least).Sex work is stigmatized. And there is actually somewhat of a reason there is stigma. It's an industry that has to deal with sex trafficking -- including of minors -- people engaging in survival sex, or turning to prostitution because of drug addiction.But seeing someone in a legal brothel ABSOLUTELY HAS NOTHING TO DO with those things. That aspect of sex work relates to those people who work on the streets, and those are actually more of social problems then sex problems.So, in thinking about if you will do it again, it's not so much a question of \"Are \u000fyou repeatedly doing something wrong\" per say since this is legal in your case. For me, seeing escorts in my state is illegal. Were I to keep doing it, that's another instance where I risk being arrested and potentially deported since I'm not a US citizen, even though it's widely tolerated here and when raids do occur they are on brothels and not travelling high end providers. I also should not be spending a lot of money on sex because, while I could afford it then and could if I were to do it again, because I on\f\u0019ly make about 20k a year, it's kind of an irreponsible thing to spend money on. Those are the reasons it's wrong for me to keep seeing providers, not because sex work is itself wrong. So ask yourself if/why it would be wrong for you.If it's just because it's kind of taboo, then, well, that's not really a reason you should feel guilt or shame at all, nor does it make you a bad person. I can't say this for absolute certainty, but I don't think anyone in an illegal brothel in Nevada is working there against their will. Someone working at Bunny Ranch once reached out to me once because I posted on Virginity Exchange when I was going to a conference in San Francisco, and the sense I got at least about that place is that the providers are all kind of independent contractors who opt to do a residency type thing there (maybe pay to rent the room or something I don't know, since Bunny Ranch has name recognition) and I am sure they had institutional standards and not just anyone could do it. Anyways, my point is I have every reason to believe what you're doing is safe, 100% consensual (unless you do things that aren't consensual when you get there), and in my mind not morally wrong. I find it less sleazy than sleeping with a total stranger in truth.", "link_id": "t3_as6n9o", "time": 1550627041}}

{"egsd9co": {"text": "I've kind of been in a similar situation. I had less of a romantic life than you, I'm not religious, and I have a very vibrant social life (idk if you did or not). But beyond that, yes.&amp;#x200B;The difference is that, instead of three weeks, it was  three days. Actually two. I had mulled it over for months. In May my therapist recommended it and friends were torn over if it was a good idea or vastly inappropriate of him to suggest. For the record, it was the latter. And I had very lightly thought about it before, skimmed ads on craigslist and back page when they were still things, made an ad once on craigslist, tried to hook up with people on the app Whisper. I never followed through on it.&amp;#x200B;The major website for sex providers, or one of them  that is legit, is a website called Eros. I think I found out it was legit through reddit or google. And I'd occasionally skim it. One day -- and I was grappling with all the feelings of shame and embarrassment and wanting to begin that part of my life and experience sexual intimacy -- I saw an ad for a provider and it just felt right. Obviously it was based off appearance mostly, but it did truly feel right. I contacted her I think late late Wednesday night. It was technically Thursday. I'm pretty sure that's what it was because I was unsure if she'd see me Thursday because a lot of providers don't do same day appointments and I was asking if this could slide since it was \"Wednesday night.\"&amp;#x200B;Here was a thing I did that was key. So prostitution where I am is not legal though vastly tolerated. But on Eros providers often link their twitter pages which they use for sales of photos/videos and advertising, etc. So I went on twitter and messaged her and was blunt/forthcoming and said listen, I'm a virgin. Do you see newcomers? &amp;#x200B;That's another thing -- not all providers will work with virgins or prefer not too, so it is good to ask. Though, at a legal brothel, I don't think it will be a problem.&amp;#x200B;Anyways so I told her that I had no experience and would need a lot of guidance, and the specific things I was hoping to get out f a meeting (which wasn't anything kinky -- French kiss, blowjob, intercourse). And she said yes of course, e-mail me to set up an appointment. We were going to meet that Thursday, and there was screening (I doubt you'll have to go through that since it is legal where you are going) and I paid a deposit, and we were going to meet that evening. It ended up being Friday, though, because I live in a very touristy part of the world, and she had rented a car to go do some sight seeing  and it broke down and she couldn't get back in time to her hotel. That was fine. We met Friday.&amp;#x200B;The whole time I was extremely nervous like you are. I waffled. I'd think no, this isn't right, or is too risky, etc, but then I'd look rather profile andpicturesofher and it felt right again. I had alsocfonsulted with a good friend, who is a girl, and my cousin who is kind of my best friend (male). So they kind of gave me comfort during those anxious days and I had discussed it with them.&amp;#x200B;I'll spare you the pg-13 details of the experience but I can tell you I don't regret it. I had problems, but they say no one's first time is good. But I'm glad I went through with it and glad I had been up front about being a virgin and being nervous. She took that into consideration, like, new what to do and how to approach it and guide me. Had I not told her and she assumed I had experience, I think she would have treated me differently and I wouldn't have had as enjoyable an experience. Being forthcoming and open and transparent about what is going on during your sexual encounter is key.&amp;#x200B;Now, here is the thing that might give you some comfort in these anxious couple of weeks. You go to Nevada, but still, nothing has to happen if you don't want it to. What I mean is, when you go to the appointment, if you don't want to have sex, it'snot going to be forced upon you or expected. Just being there could be a big step for you, and maybe doing other things as you're in the mood  for like just talking or cuddling something... kissing I think is something some people will do and others aren't. The point is, going to Nevada doesn't necessitate you losing your virginity. Going to the brothel doesn't even necessitate that. It's your choice, and nothing will happen during that appointment that you don't want it to. What you do have is a more or less guarantee that this person will make love with you if you want to unless you do something vastly inappropriate or threatening, and knows what they are doing in terms of ensuring you have a good encounter.&amp;#x200B;That was a big part of it for me. I knew a relationship wasn't going to happen anytime soon, or the chances of it were slim, and I asked myself, if I  want to experience it now, would I rather someone who knows what they are doing or someone I pick up at a bar? You know what I opted for.&amp;#x200B;I'll caution you. Sex both is over rated, but also changes everything. Like I said, my first time wasn't great. And while I don't regret it, I felt confused and conflicted after. I said I would spare you the pg-13 details but I had a hard time achieving an orgasm and had to masturbate to finish while she rubbed me. At that point, we were at the end of the time. Usually, it doesn't take as long as it took me and you kind of cuddle and decompress after, which I didn't have the time/chance to do. So I felt weird, and wished I could do it over, had some conflicted feelings that ultimately did settle on being happy I took th decision. But it's also made it much easier to hire subsequent escorts, and that's dangerous. You said religious reasons. Maybe you have a stronger moral backbone than I do. I was adamant i'd only do this once to lose my virginity -- one time thing. I've since taken the initial steps to hire an escort again twice and stopped myself. You need to be prepared for the fact once you do it once, it become easier do it again. You can say you're not the kind of person who would do it a second time, but you have no clue if that's true or not because you haven't had sex yet and that is what will make you know.

{"eg4y4xt": {"text": "So can antipsychotics! But they aren't supposed to zonk you out. They can, but that's one of those side-effects that warrants switching medication. The reason it bothers me is two-fold. First, their ability to stabilize your moods is over-stated. They are more effective as anti-manic than anti-depressants for the very reason another poster made about them lowering dopamine, and don't necessarily stabilize your mood. When I go to support groups, I mostly see people who are really depressed and on antipsychotics. There are exceptions. Seroquel helps for both depression and mania, and olanzapine/Zyprexa is marketed in a combine pill with Prozac for bipolar depression. Furthermore, some of the older antipsychotic drugs that are similar can help for depression -- they just were never investigated for it at the time they were not in generic and there was money to be made (drug companies fund most research and trials, and when a drug goes into generic and the price goes down and anyone can make it, they are no longer interested in running trials because there's no money to be made).The other is side-effects. Antipsychotics are powerful, powerful drugs. The older ones have bad, bad long term side-effects. They cause brain degeneration, increased metabolism, weight gain, and therefore often diabetes. They also lead to parkinson's type symptoms -- tremors that are different than akathisia. Akathisia sucks too. And you can get neuroleptic malignant syndrome from taking them for years, which is a medical emergency. Supposedly, the newer antipsychotics don't have these side-effects, but the truth is we really don't know about the long term effects. Clinical trials have a person on a medication for, at most, around 8 months. Not years and years. And to be fair that would be ridiculous, you can't have years long clinical trials where a person is on a medication for ten years before it goes on the market.Seroquel, when it went on the market, had a similar reputation. Free from the side effects of older antipsychotics! And to be fair, a lot of those drugs are very very sedating, like Haldol and Thorazine. Other older antipsychotics, like Loxitane, not as much. But now Seroquel has been on the market for about 20 years and I've seen people who are experiencing some of these side effects having only ever been on Seroquel and similar drugs like Risperdal. Because the truth is, these long term side effects are/were not from taking, say, Haldol for years, but taking antipsychotics for years. Antipsychotics in general. To be fair, there is the chance these new antipsychotics won't have long term side effects, but we don't know. And some of them, the risks do exist but are just less... Abilify CAN cause increased metabolism and diabetes. When I was on it, my appetite skyrocketed. Mood stabilizers don't have as many side effects. Brain fog is a possibility like you said, but that's not a certainty and a side effect that warrants switching meds. But also there is a conception that they have long term side effects on some of your organs -- liver and kidney. And that's not actually true. It isn't true that Depakote and Tegretol ruin your liver over years. What it is, is that they either immediately impact your liver -- and you have some blood work to monitor it -- or not at all. It isn't a gradual chipping away at your liver, it's initial side effect and then you stop and switch if that's the case. The exception is if your liver becomes compromised for another reason. Like say you are an alcoholic and that weakens your liver. Then, yes, depakote might cause liver damage. Does that make sense?Ditto for lithium and your kidneys. Lithium won't ruin your kidneys, unless it immediately does so and then you stop. If when you start it, your kidneys remain fine, it won't hurt your kidneys over the long term. Now, there is an exception with lithium. Lithium WILL impact your thyroid hyromones if you take it for a long time. That is a guarantee -- someday you will end up with hypothyroidism if you take lithium. But that, while sucky no doubt, isn't the end of the world. With lithium you have your blood monitored (less frequently once your level is stabilized), and they will catch your thyroid hormone levels getting wonky. At that point you can either switch to a different medication, or, start taking a hypothyroid medication once the hormone does get too low. That is not a big deal. The medication, tmk, is not that expensive, doesn't have a lot of side effects, and really effective so it isn't like you have to go through a lot of trial and error to find one that works. Easy peasy treatment.From my personal experience, when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, my psychiatrist had a big big practice. He had a lot of patients and also had a research facility that ran clinical trials for drug companies. His practice was really set up for people whose conditions were not extreme, but too extreme to be managed for a family doctor. The way he described it to me before switching me to another psychiatrist who could see me in the hospital if I was hospitalized, and c ould follow me more closely, was his patients were kind of like \"Billy has ADHD, and I can prescribe him a medication and I don't need to see him for another six months...\" WHATEVER. For that reason, he didn't prescribe mood stabilizers (told me he didn't believe in them), but the truth was because he couldn't see patients frequently enough to do the monitoring required with them. When I was referred to him, it was because I initially was thought to have treatment resistant depression. No one knew how bad it would get. Anyways, once he diagnosed me, he put me on antipsychotics. First Abilify, then Risperdal, then Seroquel. And I didn't get any better -- I actually got worse for a while. It wasn't until I saw a psychiatrist who could follow me more closely who put me on Depakote that I saw any improvement.One of the greatest tragedies of bipolar disorder, in my opinion, is that many people do find relief from antipsychotics, but they are such heavy drugs with major consequences.

{"efusivr": {"text": "I'm a pretty devout atheist. Not because of any animosity or ill will towards religion -- belief just never clicked despite an appreciation of and interest in religion. I can tell you though that struggling with one's faith in the existence of (a) God is extremely common and not unique to the rooms. I'd say it's just a feature of deistic spirituality itself; at times you struggle with it. I will assume you'll in the end find the answers you are looking for and your belief will be stronger as a result of this time.&amp;#x200B;But to bring it back to the program, I would tell you that in my experience, just knowing there is a higher power can be enough. Like I said, I am an atheist, so I don't believe in a God. It's almost mathematical for me. Do I believe I am the highest power? No I don't, therefore, there has to be a power higher than me, or, everything is as powerful as me. And I *know* there are things more powerful than me since alcohol kicked the shit out of me, and I highly doubt alcohol is **the most** powerful thing out there.&amp;#x200B;When I first joined the program, a friend told me you can bend the steps a little bit -- some more than others. I think largely what he meant was that it did not have to be a thoroughly Christian recovery. And I also think he meant that some steps can be more meaningful than others to you. I have met people in the rooms who stay sober by the Grace of God. They get a lot of joy and strength from their religion, and it helps keep them sober. I've been sober for 9 months, which I am proud of because it's the longest I've been sober in over ten years,  but I also know people who are atheists who have been sober for years and years and are in the program. I think for some of them, the steps that are focussed on amends and improvement are more important than steps 2 and 3.&amp;#x200B;But maybe the program you are working depends highly on steps 2 and 3.&amp;#x200B;Maybe, by the logic I mentioned that made me work step 2 and 3, you can set aside the question of if there is a God or not for now while it comes to you. There are three common non-deistic higher powers you hear mentioned a lot: Group of drunks, Great outdoors, Good orderly direction. All of these can be abbreviate to God. I'm not sure if any of them are compelling to you. Group of drunks mean the fellowship of AA will grant you sobriety if you put your trust in it. Good orderly direction (as I understand it) means the good advice and guidance of your sponsor and others who have maintained sobriety -- believing that they know what they are talking about. Great outdoors is pretty explanatory -- knowing just how big the world is and how small you are in the grand scheme of things (but you can also find wonder in the beauty of the world). I'm not knocking religion, but if you feel like you really \\*need\\* a higher power right now but just don't have clarity in your faith, I hope maybe one of these might help as a temporary (or permanent) one in the mean time. &amp;#x200B;I hope this helps.", "link_id": "t3_anjjeg", "time": 1549435124}}

{"efcv2bg": {"text": "It depends on the context.If you're first time is going to be a casual hook up with someone you meet in a bar, who you don't intend on seeing again, don't tell her. You shouldn't.  It would put a real damper on things, because it's a monumental occasion and when you hook up with someone at a bar, you're not expecting something of that value. This is not to say that you shouldn't hook up with someone for your first time. If the opportunity arrises and that is how you want to go about it, then by all means. You know what to expect about your first time (that you'll cum fast or it will take forever). But when you're not going to see the person again, it doesn't matter if the sex was crummy or not because that person is gone. If you  do end up wanting to see that person again, eventually you could tell them but it would really be a \"go with the flow\" when the timing is right thing, I would imagine (never been in that situation).&amp;#x200B;If you lose your virginity to someone you're dating and starting to get close to, then yeah you tell them. Again, I think it's a go with the flow type of thing. Wait for the conversation to veer in that direction. You can maybe nudge the conversation towards sex and sex type stuff if you can do so subtly, but don't bring it up out of the blue. It will go *much* better than you think it will to be honest, because this person isn't just looking for a sexual relationship with you but a more special relationship that is intimate on an emotional level, and even physical levels that aren't sex (holding hands, etc). There is an emotional compassion and care for you. I'm going to make an analogy that I hope will help and is not too extreme. You start dating a girl, she's nice, sweet, caring, has her life together, you click, get along. GREAT! One day she tells you when she was a teenager she tried heroin once. She doesn't have any venereal diseases from unclean needles or anything and doesn't do drugs now and hasn't for a long time, and won't ever again -- it was just a mistake she made in her past. I personally would not end my relationship with her over that. I use this example because it is another thing that is stigmatized, though using heroin is obviously quite dangerous but virginity is not dangerous and nothing to be ashamed of. If you are like me, because I genuinely care about that person, it isn't something that is going to ruin the relationship. But do tell her. Even if it's that you guys are making out and it's starting to get hot and heavy and you just pull back for a second and say \"hey I need to let you know, I've never done this before.\" But you can tell her before hand. &amp;#x200B;I hope that heroin example made sense and was illuminating an not too extreme. I'm just trying to come up with a way to put you in the other person's shoes and be exposed to something a bit uncommon and shocking but that won't ruin your relationship. But telling her before hand, there can be some attention to making sure your first time is special. But I truly believe in waiting for the right moment to tell her, and it will feel right. That's been the case whenever I've told a girl I was a virgin -- romantic or platonic. When I've forced it or felt compelled somehow, it didn't go as well. But all in all, people are good and won't hate on you unless they are pricks, and if they are pricks then who cares.&amp;#x200B;Another option is, and this is what I did, I saw an escort for my first time. So maybe take what I have said with a grain of salt since I've been talking like I've done this stuff successfully and I haven't. Basically, I can't foresee meeting someone I'll be dating any time soon. I'm not sure if I'm ready for a relationship after getting my heart broken, maybe I'm still too depressed, I just haven't met anyone I click with -- and those things are fine. But I'm getting older, and I wanted to have that experience in life. I made a decision I'd rather see a provider than a stranger in a bar, who knew what they were doing, and knew how to work with virgins specifically. Cant' stress enough that this is illegal in a lot of places, and so I can't tell you to break the law and put yourself in harm's way or risk of harm if you go down that route so be thorough in investigating and using reputable sources, and don't do it unless it feels right. I had a good experience, and now the burden is kind of lifted in that anyone I date won't be the first time, so there is less pressure, and my first time was with a really beautiful person who took care of me and was slow and patient and ensured I had the best experience I could. It's not for everyone, nd kind of a morally grey zone because you need to be aware and cautious you're not supporting human trafficking, but I can just say for me personally it has helped and so I wanted to share that with you.&amp;#x200B;But I suppose the tl;dr is this: go with the flow and follow your heart. Things will feel right at some point, and when they do, you have that conversation. Don't fret about having it, or when you will have it. It comes when it comes as you connect with someone.

It's because of jitters and pressure over their first time.So let's reframe this. This isn't your first time, her coming up in two weeks. You are not a virgin any longer my friend because you tried to have sex. You say you couldn't get it up. If your dick entered her vagina at all, even if you couldn't have sex, you're not a virgin anymore really. You got a blow job. By some people's classifications, that means you've lost your virginity because you've had a sexual relationship with someone.You've heard a billion times before that virginity is an artificial, made up construct many times I am sure, and I know it doesn't make it easier. But if you can, use that artificiality to your advantage, and think hard about \"virginity\" and what it means to you. The fact you have a woman who is interested in having a sexual relationship with you and tried to means, really, you accomplished the most difficult aspect of losing your virginity. What remains then is just the \"feeling\" of sex, and that's different than the burden of virginity. So if you can somehow reframe things to take some of the pressure off of yourself, it might help. Honestly it sounds like you're really close to losing it. You've obviously overcome a lot of the barriers a lot of virgins who want to experience intimacy face. &amp;#x200B;And if you want to look at this medically, honestly, doctors are a lot more chill about this than you might think, because ED is so common in old men.

{"eem544h": {"text": "Sobriety has made my life so much better. It will be 9 months next week, though I will admit in October I had a slip up and got high on Vicodin (just the one time), and have had to take benzodiazepines which some people will tell you is just as bad (but I don\u2019t think so since I\u2019m taking prescribed doses not to get high).Anyways, sobriety is better for your mood, and alcohol doesn\u2019t mix well with the medication we have to take. Especially antipsychotics. I don\u2019t take any now but I can remember being on Seroquel and being a heavy drinker. It was not much fun. But even mood stabilizers, even though it\u2019s not as bad, it really makes them less effective and brings you down and makes you anxious and have worse side effects because of similar neuro receptors.If I can give you some advice, I\u2019ll say: there\u2019s no shame in going on medication to help ease the transition to sobriety, whether it is going on a benzodiazepine for a bit and tapering off to make it smoother (Valium is actually primarily used for this now as it lasts way too long to be a good choice for panic attacks), or a medication that is meant to help for cravings like naltrexone or acamprosol. The downside to acamprosol is that you have to take it three times a day, but unlike naltrexone, what it does is basically the same thing as an antidepressant but with receptors in parts of the brain impacted by alcoholism, so it may help with more of the psychiatric components of getting sober like anxiety and depression.I\u2019d get some additional support, whether it\u2019s a substance abuse councilor or something else. Clear it with your therapist first, because there can be concerns with seeing more than one therapist, so you just need to talk to them about it so the therapy you get is in concert and doesn\u2019t contradict each other. It can help you better understand what lies beneath your drinking. Usually, there are reasons why we drink beyond just a pure physical addiction or craving and so it is good to work on those, even if you have been in therapy, it can be beneficial in a more targeted way concerned with your drinking/substance abuse.This will be a bit controversial, given the traditions saying we must operate according to attraction rather than promotion, but Alcoholics Anonymous helped me a lot. A lot of people have preconceptions of it that are bad, and are turned off by the religious perspectives \u2014 and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m lucky to live in a place where there is a good community with a lot of young people. The program itself allows for a lot of wiggle room so it can vary from place to place, meeting to meeting. But I am an atheist and have met others who are, or don\u2019t incorporate religion mich into their program. I don\u2019t bring it up to be preachy but being around other people helped me, and I was able to make connections with people who supported me and I could call, and could invest time in it to distract myself and give back if I wanted. All good if you don\u2019t think you\u2019re an alcoholic, too, but want to check it out. Just make sure you go to a meeting that is \u201copen\u201d not \u201cclosed.\u201d Some people love it but others hate it, but the community part I think is very helpful.Once the physical symptoms pass things will get better and you\u2019ll feel like you can start picking up the pieces.", "link_id": "t3_ai3u5l", "time": 1548077011}}

But the zaps aren't neural electricity in your brain. That **does** cause a seizure.The truth is they don't know, so actually I guess it could be that. But probably not. It likely has more to do with serotonin imbalance, which is why people who are stopping antidepressants get them too. &amp;#x200B;It's true lamotrigine doesn't work on serotonin, but the theory is that by reducing sodium channels, there can't be surges of the mood-impacting neurotransmitters. With epilepsy, there is like a jolt or spark that spreads across a region of the brain and causes a seizure. Taking an anticonvulsant, by inhibiting sodium and calcium channels, makes it impossible/harder for that jolt to spread by blocking the channels it would have to travel through. The theory is by doing the same thing, a huge burst of serotonin or dopamine can't flood your brain triggering an upswing, which your body then compensates for by cutting way way back causing the downswing. &amp;#x200B;So if I had to make a guess, it would be that, when you miss a dose, your body has adjusted to functioning with a mood stabilizer and too much or not enough serotonin gets put in the sensory part of your brain at times while your brain is doing its thing and sending signals everywhere.&amp;#x200B;But again, I'm just hypothesizing for fun since really the neurological components of mood disorders aren't understood yet But the process you describe -- too much electricity -- I think would cause a seizure and brain zaps are a different kind of sensation than even a mini seizure.&amp;#x200B;Thanks for coming to my TED Talk", "link_id": "t3_ai77uc", "time": 1548071227}}

{"edq6ca3": {"text": "Yes, counseling does work. It\u2019s a must, if you can afford it! There is a good chance you first started drinking to deal with an insecurity or personal problem. Maybe not, but if you did, it may come back. And certainly counseling will help you learn to cope with your last and find peace with it. Really, in my opinion, the more help the better. But on top of that, a counselor would likely practice CBT (it seems to be the most common) and help work with you to change your reactions and responses where something might come up and your initial response is to drink. I don\u2019t need to tell you sobriety isn\u2019t just a question of addiction in a clear cut black way where we have cravings and fight them. It\u2019s also woven into our lives and drinking was tied to how we lived our lives. It is just a really valuable support.In terms of some of the symptoms as well, if the doctor\u2019s didn\u2019t rx you something like naltrexone, there is another drug they use for alcohol cravings/recovery called acamprosate/Campral. There is some research to suggest it might help better with mood and anxiety. If you\u2019re not on a drug like that, you should consider it. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist so it kind of diminishes the part of your brain that makes you crave and get enjoyment or relief from alcohol. Campral works to kind of restore balance in your brain that\u2019s disrupted, working on glutamate and GABA receptors instead. Those two neurotransmitters have more to do with mood and anxiety that opioid receptors so it could help, but in terms of abstinence the two drugs are both as effective as each other.The last thing I\u2019d suggest is AA. You might hear of people saying research shows it\u2019s not as effective. The truth is though the structure of it makes it hard for people to study. But there are people who swear by it and have been sober for a long time. Those people usually go to a meeting for the rest of their lives (but don\u2019t think about that). I think the best thing to say about AA is that it works for some and not others and you have nothing to lose except time by checking it out. I\u2019m not pressuring you to go, but what I found was, when I got sober (coming up to ten months) I felt really lonely and going to to meetings got me out of the house and around people who were supportive. Just going to meetings can help, even if you don\u2019t \u201cjoin\u201d and get a sponsor and work the twelve steps in these early days, I think. That was my experience anyways. I started going to 3 or 4 meetings a week and it got me out of the house and put me in a positive environment. And I made new friends who were sober. I had been sober for 3 months before I got a sponsor and worked steps so I do think meetings themselves can help. I wouldn\u2019t do that instead of therapy though. Does that make sense? I honestly had known very little about AA before I went, though of course I had heard of it, so in short if you haven\u2019t ever been involved with it, meetings are reading from AA books and literature, or, a speaker meeting (most common meeting type where I am but not other places) where someone shares their experience and then some other people are called on or volunteer to share a little bit too in response, based off a topic. And then there is a 12 step program of recovery that you do with a sponsor, but no one forces you to do that and you have to take initiative to approach someone to sponsor you. It\u2019s highly spiritual (though doesn\u2019t have to be Christian or have an actual god) because a higher power is central to it (some people who are atheists find other ways to do it so it\u2019s possible). And some people in it are VERY religious and that turns a lot of people off.

{"e49hudm": {"text": "It's kind of hard to explain, in part because we don't understand addiction all that well. I get the impression people might experience cravings differently.It might make more sense or me to say why people are compelled to keep drinking.Sometimes it is to chase a feeling. When you first start drinking, alcohol gives you a high. Your body feels tingly (in a pleasant way), you feel happy, and so on. This is if you are *drunk.* If you are what they call *buzzed,* which means just a drink or two, you might have a body feeling but it's much milder, and it is more feeling relaxed and less anxious. Alcoholics are people who get drunk, and eventually that feeling becomes impossible to achieve. As your tolerance builds up, it takes more and more alcohol to get that body high. Eventually it just becomes impossible. Trying to chase that feeling and wanting to feel that way was a big part of my early alcoholism.Another part of it is to drink to kind of \"stabilize\" things, especially if you are a daily drinker. I'm not a scientist, so take what I am saying with a grain of salt, especially since this isn't totally understood. What I am about to say is very much \"if I recall correctly.\" But basically, when you take any intoxicating substance, your body tries to counteract it to remain stable. I think in high school I heard someone use the term \"anti drugs\" in terms of things your body produces in response. But basically your brain reacts to the alcohol. With that said, its not perfectly balanced in terms of timing. So parts of your brain that were being diminished by the alcohol, which cause the calmness and decreased anxiety, are not hyperactive because the attempts to balance the alcohol out are still going on. There's two neurotransmitter receptors, GABA and glutamate, that are kind of opposites. One is a relaxing neurotransmitters, and the other is a stimulating one. Alcohol works on those (along with others) and so the brain produces an excess of the other to try and counteract alcohol's effect. I forget which one does which. ANYWAYS, the fact the brain is still trying to counteract the alcohol is what causes hangovers in part (hangovers are also caused by dehydration and other things). So a hangover, and *way more so* when you are an alcoholic, comes with a lot of anxiety, and depression, and even physical things like shakes. Some people will drink to make those symptoms go away. When you drink long enough, and hard enough, it effects permanent changes to your brain chemistry and brain structure to this effect making that need for alcohol to be balanced even stronger.Some people use it as a psychological crutch to self-medicate for other problems in their life. If you do not address those issues, they don't go away, and so you continue to drink to escape them.But also, part of it is that drinking can become second nature. So the compulsion to drink becomes unexplainable. In Alcoholics Anonymous,  we talk about that a lot -- why we kept drinking when we knew we shouldn't, or even wanted to stop, and just not being able to understand why. So this is also an experience that cannot really be put in to words, because you just kind of *do it* without thinking sometimes.My parents did not drink, and I'm a young man without kids or a partner. As such, I have no experience with AlAnon or AlaTeen.

{"e445qr6": {"text": "Yes you can *if* it's an open meeting. If it's a closed meeting, you can't unless you have a desire to stop drinking. If you don't identify as an alcoholic, or don't view your drinking as problematic, then I would strongly encourage you not to share at the meeting. But many of the people I've met in the program are also addicts. I've heard people speak at meetings who have identified as addicts but not alcoholics (but that's not as common). There's a lot of independence granted to groups in AA, and so while there is a pretty strict format for meetings, you do find it isn't exactly the same everywhere 100%. Some meetings here it is ok that those people come and share (they are open meetings), while other meetings that wouldn't fly that someone who isn't an alcoholic is sharing.Sharing, by the way, I mean talking about what you think/what's going on after a discussion meeting. There's a speaker who talks, and then the floor is open -- usually with a theme the speaker has chosen.Long story short, there are people who find comfort and utility in AA who are not alcoholics, and a lot of the time that's ok and they can find a place within AA. Here's the tricky thing. Someone once told me \"meetings won't keep you sober.\" There's a lot of merit to that statement, because AA is much more than just meetings. As a program of recovery, there's the 12 steps. It's a lot of hard work that you do with a sponsor, and I can't see it being possible to work the steps in AA without being an alcoholic since the first step is admitting you're powerless over alcohol.With that said, there are 12 step fellowships based off of AA for, like... every addiction. So, there is Marijuana Anonymous and there is Pills Anonymous. Of course, there is NA too. I've never gone to an NA meeting before, but for the majority of my life I assumed it was a program for those who were struggling with addictions to opioids. That's not the case: it's for addiction to drugs broadly -- maybe even just addiction more broadly. Because I've never been to an NA meeting, I can't say this for sure but I would imagine you would be able to find a home in that program, and you shouldn't be dissuaded by the fact there could be people there in recovery from \"harder\" drugs. I saw this meme online that was so corny it made me want to puke. It said, \"it doesn't matter how deep your rock bottom was. It only takes 12 steps to climb back out.\" Ugh. But there is some truth to it, *if* you're into 12 step fellowships. So why AA and not another program? Not sure. But AA is the biggest. I live in a city that has upwards to 48 AA meetings a day. The most NA meetings is 7 a day, and usually it's 5. Other fellowships you are looking at even fewer. So with AA there is likely going to be more options, giving you more flexibility in terms of pencilling in meetings. But also, each meeting can have a different kind of \"culture,\" because you're encouraged to find a home group. So, in addition to the small discrepancies across groups through how they are run (because you do really follow a format despite each group being autonomous),they are shaped by the people who go to them. I'll be honest, as someone who is very happy in AA, there are a lot of meetings that I don't go to because I can't connect with the people there -- despite us all being alcoholics. I can connect with them on that level, sure, and can take something away about how complex alcoholism and addiction is (and that is a good thing to take away don't get me wrong ^__^ ) my daily life is different from someone who is 20+ years older than me, who's drinking may have stemmed from or been intensified from being a veteran, or all kinds of other things. The fewer meetings, the less options you have. So there's that.But here is the other thing. It can be *really* scary to go to a meeting alone for your first meeting. So you have the benefit of going to a meeting with  friend to test the waters. For the reasons I've mentioned, completely working a program of recovery in AA for you will not be possible. However, the 12 steps and traditions are largely similar across programs with the wording changed to reflect the nature of the fellowship. So you will be able to get a little bit acclimated and comfortable -- get a little taste of the MaGiC before you go off on your own, if that makes sense. You'll know a bit more about what to expect.And there may even be some familiar faces at the meetings you go to in another program. If you chose NA, I know here at least there are a couple people who are in both AA and NA. And I *guarantee* you won't be able to go to an AA meeting where there won't be someone who hasn't gone for a ride in the ativan before (Im trying to make a minivan joke).

But my knowledge concerning other systems of socialized healthcare is that they won't perform procedures that are medically unnecessary, and there can be a long wait time for elective procedures. Because this also isn't what orchiectomy is indicated for, I'm not sure a doctor would be willing to do it -- in the UK or anywhere to be honest.Medication is a more promising route to take. But people have missed the mark about what kind of medication you should take (I don't mean to say that in a nasty way). Antidepressants wouldn't make our sexual desires go away -- you'd just (maybe) have difficult achieving an erection or orgasm, or your orgasms might feel numb and not pleasurable.Antipsychotics are more likely to reduce your sex drive, but I wouldn't recommend those as they have a lot of side effects that are unpleasant and can cause health problems. Totally a last resort drug, and I think should be a last resort even for psychiatric disorders where they are used on label (i.e bipolar and depression, while schizophrenia you have no way around it). Also not a total guarantee it would kill your sex drive and desires -- but much stronger chance as antipsychotics largely work by inhibiting dopamine.OK so the most promising thing to look into would be a drug called depo-provera. The generic name is medroxyprogesterone acetate. When you hear of someone being 'chemically castrated,' this is what it means. But the term chemical castration might be misleading because I know before I found out, I assumed chemical castration was like a one shot (pun not intended needle joke) deal where it was performed and you lost all sexual function, like it made part of your testicles dissolve or something (idk what). Anyways, not true. You have to take the medication frequently (usually it is given as a depot injection so not every day). It's what they use for abnormal male sexuality, i.e for sex offenders who cannot control their urges. It's not a perfect drug in that it isn't 100% effective all the time. But it is *probably* the most effective. I say this not having done the research, and not being asexual myself. But that is one thing to look into, and it isn't just used for inhibiting sexual desires in men. It's also use for a lot of women's health issues since it is progesterone.

What I'm going to say isn't based in Freud at all, but what I do want to throw out there that he posited was that, as we are growing up, there are so many moments in which something can go \"wrong\" and we get a perversion or neurosis. Never is this a moral failure.Anyways, now for the non Freudian stuff.People are attracted to people like them, more or less. There is a lot of science behind  that. It really isn't that opposites attract: usually likes attract. And family members are some of the most *like* you physically you can find. However, there is somehow a biological/psychological override to this to prevent incest. Having children with a close relative is medically dangerous for the child, as you probably know, because of a limited gene pool. The risk of defects skyrockets. So, in growing up with someone, somehow, at some point, your psyche makes an exception to the rule for family members and you are not attracted to them despite the resemblance.This is further evident by a well documented fact that siblings and other family members who were separated at birth or a young age, but met as adults, often feel an overwhelming sexual attraction to each other. https://heavy.com/news/2018/02/katie-steven-pladl-north-carolina-incest/ this is a recent case.I'm really speculating, but given what I said with Freud, maybe if something went wrong at some point, even if it was just some glitch, things got messed up and that incest taboo didn't get encoded.I say this because, in reading your post, I don't see an evil person, but someone who needs help and I hope you get it. I'm also not trying to gloss over the fact sexual assault is bad, and you did something wrong. But you seem remorseful and want to get better. I am sure there has to be a support group.

What the answer to that problem is doesn't necessarily mean abstinence.

Many psychiatrists have time blocked off in their schedule for emergencies, urgent patients, and returning phone calls.  This is actually standard practice. Now, I am going to stress that I am *not* a doctor. But I did some research. One of the risks is that, when your baby is born, they will be stopping Seroquel cold turkey and could/will experience withdrawal symptoms, meaning they will be agitated and have extrapyramidal side-effects (think akathisia). It's not fun, and sometimes it is so bad they need to go into the intensive care unit. This seems to be the biggest risk, and not physical malformities. But again, I'm not a doctor, and so I don't know for sure. Some mood stabilizers can cause heart defects, neural tube defects, and cleft palate. Of course, mood stabilizers are different than antipsychotics, but maybe it is the same thing.What I do know is that Haldol comes up alot of \"Safe\" for pregnancy... so if your symptoms do return (sometimes doctors have you try going without medication I think and some people can do it) there are options. Lithium is also safe during some trimesters iirc. And ECT is safe.But definitely call your doctor ASAP and if they still can't fit you in/get the doctor get in touch with you, tell them you've decreased to 100mg. I'd also recommend going to your family doctor in the interim if they can fit you in and the psychiatrist can't talk to you/meet you sooner. ", "link_id": "t3_8te9yo", "time": 1529802502}}

The reason why I'm stressing this again isn't to be a dick, but, because I have seen people at support groups say \"they are a little bit hypo.\" And I can get people who have suffered full blown mania being very cautious of their mood going upwards... but hypomania isn't normal. It's never within the range of being normal. I was the life of the party while I was hypomanic, but those who knew me well thought I was acting strange -- no doubt about it. And I was doing weird things, getting fixated on a girl and brewing my own beer in my tiny, single dorm room.Part of the reason why it irks me is that I did do a lot of damage to my life during that period, and a lot of things that make me embarrassed to remember. So part of this is that, when people in support groups use hypomania as a label lightly, their being dismissive of this pain and suffering hypomania in bipolar II can cause. I want to stress, that is **not** what I see you doing here -- you're good. The other important reason I want to bring this up is just for education about our disease.You've probably heard of Daylio, the mood tracking app. I used to use it, and I forget if it had 4 or 5 levels. But a lot of people here hate it because it doesn't have enough options. I wonder if maybe it would be useful to go up to like 7 or more, so you can have \"Good-normal\" and true hypomania, and then mania. And the same for depression -- \"sad--normal,\" mild depression, and then severe depression. If you kept a total just \"normal\" that would be 7, but I could also imagine only having the \"Good-normal\" and \"Sad-normal\" which would give you six.Just a thought.", "link_id": "t3_8olrwi", "time": 1528246133}}

{"dzsj1t0": {"text": "Hey! I can maybe offer some insight. I've lived throughout the Maritimes and been to the hospital many, many times.First of all, you're not going to be admitted. I would be surprised if you are. In Canada, truly the emphasis is on treating you within the community if they can. What will happen is they will make a safety plan with you and make sure you are safe until you can get in to see your psychiatrist. If you are still unsafe after talking to them, then maybe you will be admitted. But in my experience, most people who are admitted as patients are either people who have gone through with it, or have severe schizophrenia and cannot live in the community on their own. Many psychiatric wards serve as mental hospitals (for a number of reasons). I say this in my experience having spent some time in a ward in Nova Scotia. In terms of voluntary hospitalization... in Canada there is no such thing. You can't decide you want to be a patient in the psych ward or a hospital -- the doctor has to decide it. There *are* private psychiatric rehab type places, but it's not the same thing at all.What will happen when you go to the ER is that you will be placed on a Form - 1, which means they can hold you for up to 24 hours. It's the usual \"you are under our care\" and surrender your rights type thing. But it's not also bad because it guarantees you certain patient rights. It means you *have* to be treated within 24 hours.Every time I had to go to the ER for my mental health, it was at night time. This meant staying over night until the psychiatrist came in in the morning. Edmonton is a bigger city than anywhere I've lived, but it likely is the case. The resident will probably be working in the ward and not seeing ER patients. So, anyways, you go to the ER. The ER doctor will assess you and get the ball rolling and will be able to give you Ativan or something to keep you calm until you can see the psychiatrist. If you're truly distressed, they will do what they can to make everything ok in the short term until you can be seen by someone. A psychiatric nurse will also likely come and assess you.And then, you will be seen by the psychiatrist who will make some adjustments to meds if need be (and they probably will) and make sure you are safe until you can get in to see your psychiatrist.You may also see a social worker to work on therapeutic type things. They may make a detailed safety plan with you, talk about what's going on, etc.If you are in the psych ward at all, chances are it will just be as a place for you to be until you can be seen by the social worke Generally speaking, it's more comfortable than an ER so it might be better. I mean, there's couches, TV, stuff to do, etc. You don't get the privacy of an ER room, but, there is more stuff to do.Anyways, like I said all this has to happen within 24 hours, and the chances are you will not be a psych ward patient and stay there longer than 24 hours. I hav absolutely no reason to believe they are going to admit you. I've gone in with suicidal ideation repeatedly and not been admitted -- and that's not to say they did not help me.Your first step should be to see if your psychiatrist can squeeze you in. If not, then go to ER. If the ER doctor feels like they can treat you, you may not (need to) see the psychiatrist. The extent of them feeling like they can treat you would mean if all you need is an Ativan prescription. If the psychiatrist sees you, they will likely prescribe you Seroquel 25mg -- that's just the standard one in Canada -- for these moments to help you cope until things get better. They may also start you on an antidepressant. That would be my guess.I guess I would ask, is this an emergency for real? I say this because it's arduous.

{"dzshx5u": {"text": "I have two pieces of advice. None of them will be medication related, because it's something I will leave up to you and your doctor. But the obvious applies (take your meds! lol)1. See a therapist. While bipolar disorder is *probably* biologically caused (we don't know for sure, but, we also kind of do) and absolutely not something that's \"all in your head,\" you *can* learn to manage it and triggers better. Therapy will also help you cope and live with the illness. All in all, if you learn to identify triggers and learn how to cope with the crippling depression, stay grounded during mania, and deal with anxiety that you might also experience (a lot of us do), your life will be much, much easier. On top of the usual, stereotypical benefits of therapy (learning more about yourself, etc). Most doctors would agree, the best treatment is medication + therapy. And believe or not, there are people who down the line no longer need medication because of what they've learned in therapy on top of the restoration medication does (if properly managed, mood stabilizer are associated with brain regrowth, as are things like mindfulness practice and meditation).2. Live as structured and scheduled a life as you can. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps a lot, as does eating at the same time, etc. If you can work a job with a fairly consistent schedule -- ideally a Monday to Friday 9-5 job (for social rhythms) -- you're giving your brain stimuli that are easier to manage then if your life is all over the place. For some people, that's not possible. They have to do shift work and their schedule changes from week to week. For sure you can still get healthy, but it's really ideal if you can conform as much as possible to the norms of the world around you.Oh and I'll throw in a third bit of advice.

The first is simply because medicine is divided up into the different specialties and a different doctor treats these illnesses versus the doctor who treats aneurysms, epilepsy, etc. I guess that's not necessarily what determines the name we would use to classify illnesses, though. But honestly, some of the things you are stating to be facts are just hypotheses. Medicine and science genuinely does not know the cause of bipolar disorder or it's mechanics at this time. The differences in brain structure that we can see in autopsies and scans may be a symptom/consequence/effect of bipolar disorder, and not the cause. We truly do not know.Anything to do with neurotransmitters is just a hypothesis. Ditto for other ~~mental~~ illnesses. It isn't that we know depressive states are caused by low serotonin, but that increasing serotonin happens to help treat them. Ditto for mania and antipsychotics -- is mania caused by dopamine? Maybe, or maybe not, but we know lowering it does help lower mania.I wish we did have concrete, neurological understanding of mental illnesses -- especially bipolar (since I have a personal stake in it). Treatment would be so much better, and it would be so much easier to diagnose. I doubt anyone here will not have had to go through a lot of pain and struggle to find the right treatment. A lot of trial and error, and many of us may not have found the right medication yet. That's really because we don't know enough about it yet.I also wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't one single way in which bipolar disorder can emerge and work, but many, and maybe that's why some medication works for some people but not others.OP your heart is in the right place, but I do not think we should call them neurological disorders.

I doubt it is prescribed much in the general population. I can't say if it ever was, so this is largely speculative. But if I am not mistaken, in the days of typical antipsychotics, really it was clozapine, Loxitane, and Nozinan that were prescribed. Thorazine and Haldol were psych institution and prison drugs. Typical antipsychotics are classified according to potency, so I can imagine a doctor having a kind of treatment system so it's like \"ok, a mild one didn't work, on to medium. Medium didn't work? Then we have to try Haldol.\"I also imagine there are older people who are on Haldol because they've been on it for years and years, and it works, and it's not worth risking it to them.

Most people don't notice it having any, and it tends to be weight neutral.You've probably heard of \"the rash.\" I hate that. It's a pet peeve of mine. Here is the truth.When Lamictal came out, on the market, after having passed clinical trials, the obvious thing happened: some people switched on to it from other anticonvulsants. But here is the thing: some anticonvulsants raise the levels of others in your blood stream. I do not know if this is what caused it, but there was a high incidence of Stevens Johnson's syndrome all of a sudden with patients taking it. Now here is the thing.While, granted, Lamictal is *probably* more prone to cause it than other medications, the amount of patients who need to get that side effect for there to be a black box warning is far from the majority. So it was not a gastronomically high number. Most patients who are taken off of lamictal, their rash would not develop into SJS. It's just a safety precaution, because SJS is extremely severe.And it's not a rash, which is why I hate it when people talk about a deathly rash. A rash is a potential early sign of something that is not a rash developing. SJS is more like a chemical burn. It causes the layers of your skin to separate from each other. Obviously, worse than a rash!  But I hope you can also appreciate that, something that terrible, has to be pretty rare for the drug to be on the market.And like I said, other drugs can cause it too. this isn't unique to Lamcital. Its just Lamictal has the black box warning for it because there was a higher indication. Or, rather, and indication that was high enough that warrants one. You'll also hear Lamictal is better for depression. This is somewhat a degree of \"you find what you look for.\" When it went on the market, bipolar depression was just starting to become something pharmaceutical companies wanted to investigate as bipolar II was now in the DSM. Some other anticonvulsants were now in generic, so less trials were ran as there was less money to be made.And its' certainly not an antidepressant. It's a mood stabilizer. So the real beauty of Lamictal comes over the long term as it stops your mood swings, and dips.

I've struggled with anxiety and my mood for a long time, and it got much worse this year as I tried to treat it and medication made things worse. This lead to a lot of the problems earlier this year. The first drinking binge I had, where I kept leaving to smoke. Well for starters i only smoked because I was drunk and had I been sober wouldn't have done that. But I had started taking ritalin which just felt like everything was amped up and harder to manage. She was very patient and understanding up until recently. And I don't blame her or that *at all.*Monday I was diagnosed with ADHD, and so maybe I have ADHD and major depression and not bipolar II like I thought. Who knows. I just want to stop hurting people, because I've had relationship problems in the past. And it's hard to accept knowing that this may have just fucked over this friendship. And by \"this\" I don't just mean mental illness -- I mean mental illness + my behaviors and actions.I'm in therapy (always have been) and compliant with any medication prescribed to me. I also started blogging so I am less emotionally dependent on others, and also so I have a bit of space to try and work through this on my own. I'm trying to read self-help stuff, be outside, and exercise more.I can appreciate that people probably post on reddit alot and being like \"woah is me\" without doing anything to try and put in the effort to take responsibility for their mistakes and try and improve. I absolutely take full responsibility for the end of our friendship, and f eel incredibly guilty and embarrassed, and just finding it hard to face. It's not that I am in denial. I accept this is happening. But I alternate between moments of \"who knows what the future holds, and if I heal eventually our friendship will too and things can go back to us being close when the time is right, since we will still see each other, being in the same social circle and activism groups, etc\" and then switching to \"the cold hard truth\" which is I have every indication to think that, when she reached out to clear the air and say she wanted to be friends and make things right, she really meant acquaintances who could be in the same room without it being awkward. And that we'll never be good friends again or in a relationship.I did go out to the event last night. It felt awkward and hard being there with her and us not talking to each other. I didn't approach her because after the lunch I texted her and said I appreciated her being honest with me, that it was brave, and that I felt bad for letting her down. But that I would let her lead moving forward with our relationship so I didn't step on any toes or cross any lines and make her feel uncomfortable. She thanked me. So I felt like the best thing is to not interact with her unless she initiates it. And she didn't yesterday. It was hard. Really hard. If I had to chose friendship or relationship.... I guess relationship if only because you would have to be best friends like we were to be i a romantic relationship that worked. If it was just sexual and we weren't emotionally intimate, I'd be unhappy.  But if we can't be in  romantic relationship and I can't set those feelings aside and be the good friend I used to be... then that makes me a kind of person I'm not too fond of.

But no right now I get the indication she really doesn't want me in her life at all.It's weird in a sense because, when we met up, she said she didn't want to exclude me from our friend group and the things we are mutually involved with. I believe her, and don't think she would lie about that. But like, tonight, I did end up going to the event. It felt weird being there with her and us not talking to each other.

I think it does make her uncomfortable, or that she would rather I didn't come, but is being respectful. She is closer with that group than I am.

It would be focussed on coping strategies and how to alter your thinking when it's unhelpful or causing strife.

No one knows what happens when you take Latuda for years and years, as it wasn't in clinical trials for years and years. There are new side effects that are emerging with Seroquel now that people have been taking it for 20 years. The long and short is that we cannot know if taking Latuda for  a long time like that doesn't have the risks that taking antipsychotics in general for years and years pose.But for many people, taking antipsychotics isn't a choice but a necessity: mood stabilizers don't work for them, or are insufficient.

But if you only use cash and bring only a set amount with you, then once you've spent all your dough, you won't be able to buy more.* Set a time schedule where you can only have a drink after so many minutes (no more than one drink an hour, or half hour, etc)* Mirror the amount your friends are drinking, if they are healthy drinkers. They order a drink, you do, and don't order another one until they do. If they don't order another drink, you don't either.* Drink water alongside your beer, and alternate. Filling up your stomach with some water will not only dilute the alcohol (idk if that's true actually), but you won't be as thirsty and therefore will drink less.", "link_id": "t3_8ln5co", "time": 1527113571}}

And really, a divorce doesn't mean completely cutting her off if you don't want to. You could still be a part of her life if you are comfortable with that *and* (most importantly) you want to. I know someone who divorced his wife, and a few years later they reconciled and are now happily remarried (neither of them have bipolar to my knowledge).

{"dzgvx4v": {"text": "I had good luck with Depakote. I don't remember much fatigue, though during that time I struggled with getting the right balance -- too much sleep, or insomnia. But if it did cause fatigue, it wasn't excessive. Which I suffered from other medications.Weight gain? Maybe. I didn't monitor my weight. I think during the period I did gain weight, but I also starting working as a waiter at a restaurant and eating *a lot* of their delicious, high fat food.Here is what I will say. For something to be considered a common side effect, the percentage of people who suffer from it isn't necessarily one you would consider high. For Depakote, it's 9%. 9% of people gain weight on it. I couldn't find the average, but sometimes this side effect is only like 2 lbs. I won't lie, some people do gain a lot of weight on Depakote, but I couldn't find the average amount. What I *did* find though is that some people actually lost weight on Depakote. In a study of 77 patients, to examine all side effects, 6 lost weight. 9 gained weight. And no this isn't related to the prescribing information for doctors that says 9% (because I know 9/77 isn't 9%)All in all, Depakote was really a great drug for me. Beyond controlling mood swings, I just felt more *normal* when I started taking it, like my reactions to things and how I engaged with the world was more balanced.Furthermore, it has a reputation for not being good for depression. That's actually a bit misguided. The truth is that, when Bipolar II entered the DSM and bipolar depression became a real concern for the pharmaceutical industry, Depakote was now in generic, and not a money drug. Because pharmaceutical industry is responsible for most clinical trials, it was just under researched. It is indicated for depression for other illnesses, like Borderline personality disorder. It's not guaranteed to help for depression by any means, and like all mood stabilizers is better at preventing mood swings than anything. None the less, it can help. Don't write it off if you struggle primarily with depression.Was it perfect? No. I had problems with stomach burn when I was taking it. It was manageable. I could live with it, and that wasn't why I went off it. I switched to Lamictal thinking maybe that could be the only drug I'd need to be on, since it has a strong reputation for bipolar II and bipolar depression. That didn't end up being the case.The other nice thing is that, depending on what manufacturer makes your depakote, and if it's ER or immediate release, it sometimes smells like vanilla. Mine did. That was seriously nice because I found it soothing to be able to open an old vial and just have a whiff. Yeah, a minor thing. Don't go on a medication because it smells good or bad. But, finding things that comfort you are a good strategy for coping with this disease and Depakote just happened to provide me one. Go figure.&gt; ...over lithium because I heard horror stories...Yeah, I had too. And while I wasn't on lithium for long (I went off it because it didn't work), they were kind of unfounded.

{"dzeu5nc": {"text": "I was not on lithium for very long, and so -- even though this is based off of personal experience -- I only have about 3 weeks of personal experience. I discontinued it because it didn't work. Though it takes a while to take full effect, you do feel something very quickly. I should have felt improvement within one week of having an appropriate serum level. I didn't.I had no side effects, other than *maybe* I was thirstier and went to the bathroom more. I say maybe because it could be I was just more aware of how much I was drinking and going to the bathroom, knowing it could be a side effect. For the same reason, knowing it could be a side effect, maybe I brought it on myself unknowingly and it wasn't the medication.Lithium does have such a bad reputation. I found the reputation it had for being a hard drug to manage were not true. I think that, because it was one of the only medication for a long, long time, people were forced to go on it when it was not a great fit, simply because there was nothing better. And so, there were likely people who had to make major lifestyle changes and police their fluid and salt intake to make it work.I don't know if that's true or not, but it wasn't my experience. Very much my doctor had a mindset of \"we make lithium conform to your lifestyle, not the other way around.\" You continue to live your life, and they dose accordingly until your blood levels are correct. You're not usually given a strict order to change how you live your life -- unless maybe you do things that would radically alter how much fluid you take in a given day (spend all day out in the sun sweating and then the next indoors).Lithium has a reputation for being hard on the kidneys. It's a little misguided. Just like Depakote when it comes to your liver, if your kidneys are fine, lithium will not damage them. Or, usually they won't. The reason why you have to have your kidneys functioned is that, if your kidneys *do* become compromised somehow, taking lithium will make it worse. It would put too much strain on your kidneys. Thyroid on the other hand... that's a different story. It really can affect your  thyroid. If it does, you have two options: stop lithium, or take thyroid medication. Usually they catch your thyroid function dipping before the damage becomes permanent, and you can make that decision. But there is a point of no return where you will have hypothyroidism for the rest of your life. But, the good thing is, that's *very* easy to treat. It really only means taking an additional pill each day. There won't be much of a struggle to find the right medication, and it not be totally effective.Something like tremors is a serious side effect. I doubt your doctor would keep you on it if they were so bad it was bothersome.Common side effects are things that really it's pretty easy to brush off. Thirst, acne, hair loss, being a little clumsy.So, in short, it *is* a drug where things can go bad, but they usually don't.I'm glad your doctor is considering lithium as a first resort. A lot of doctors are using antipsychotics now, and even the newer ones present problems that, in my opinion, really don't make them safe. I think the anticonvulsant mood stabilizers are a better first line treatment. But, lithium is also fine by me ^__^", "link_id": "t3_8lcf18", "time": 1527027406}}

{"dzczwqq": {"text": "I've been on naltrexone before, though briefly. I went on it because my depression and anxiety started to get worse. I have bipolar disorder (which started before I was a heavy drinkers).My psychiatrist then took me off it, because it was more likely to cause worse depression and anxiety than Zoloft was, which I started at the same time. Turns out it was the zoloft making things worse.What I can say is that I didn't drink while on it. Do I think it helped? I don't. But that was because I was drinking for social and emotional reasons, and didn't have a physical dependency. I think I would have maintained sobriety at that time without it. But what do I know? I ended up relapsing. I'm on a different medication now, acamprosate. Just like last time, I *asked* to go on it -- a doctor didn't decide I needed to go on it. And much the same, I think I'd maintain sobriety without it.Here is what I can say. Naltrexone is, absolutely, the first line and what everyone uses. Acamprosate is not used as often, and the pharmacy had to order it. This means naltrexone must be more effective... I can tell you doctors wouldn't prescribe it if it didn't work. But you do need something else on top of it to deal with the emotional and psychological aspects of your addiction.Says me, who has only been sober for 22 days, and only maintained sobriety for like 5 months top :p ", "link_id": "t3_8kxgrn", "time": 1526948149}}

You have to be by the book in your paperwork.

The reason she needs to ask and document to begin with is specifically *because* she is not an expert -- not just in psychiatry but, well, not an expert in anything. In an emergency room, and urgent care walk-ins, things can go sour very quickly.
