{"fljjsaj": {"text": "You've been an inspiration on this sub. Ever since I frequented this sub, you've been giving outstanding tips and empathy to those of us who are going through the throws you're going through right now. You generally give great advice and points for us to ponder when you respond to people's posts, and this community wouldn't be as rich without you. I don't just believe that, I think it's a simple matter of fact.But I'm not going to bore you with the usual platitudes. Yes, this too shall pass. Yes, you'll be feeling better soon. Yes, yada yada.But the one thing I wanted to gently remind you of is: your bipolar brain lies to you. Read your post again and rationalize it:&gt; I don't even know what life after this all looks like. I don't really want to have contact with our kids, either. Why have a parent around who doesn't even know what's going on inside their own skull half the time? They would never want to come and visit me, and I wouldn't want to make them. My family used to be my reason to live, but that's going away. I'll choose isolation, go to work, and then be by myself again. I don't even understand me, just dumb to expect anyone else to try.All lies. I don't even know you; I'm just a stranger on the internet. But I can tell you that these are lies. You're in a bad depressive downswing, you said so yourself.&gt; I don't really want to have contact with our kids, either.I know where you're coming from. I'm a parent too, and if I'm right about you, you just want temporary relief from your kids while you sort things out--and that's okay. I don't think you mean this indefinitely.&gt; Why have a parent around who doesn't even know what's going on inside their own skull half the time? They would never want to come and visit me, and I wouldn't want to make them.Because who else is going to be that strong foundational influence in their lives? You are a lot more than just bipolar disorder. I realize that our perspective is often otherwise colored, but think about it in reverse: would you want your kids to be without their parent irrespective of their situation in life? Your kids love you more than you are willing to admit right now. Trust in this. Solidarity my friend.&gt; My family used to be my reason to live, but that's going away.Don't let it go away. Your kids will always need you, no matter how old you or they are. Stick around for them, at least.&gt; I'll choose isolation, go to work, and then be by myself again.I really know where you're coming from on this one. Very often I just want to disappear and get away from all the chaos. This is okay for a little while, but in the end you'll just drive yourself mad from the isolation. Us bipolar folk need human interaction. Isolation is our defense mechanism to a stressful situation. The best medicine against that is exactly the opposite. Stay social, if you can. If you need to isolate for a time, fine, but don't decide on it permanently just yet. Your perspective will change over time.&gt; I don't even understand me, just dumb to expect anyone else to try.You have a fair point on this one. Except that I would say that just because we're impossible to understand, doesn't mean that the journey in trying to figure us out is a total waste. If anything, you've shown the people in your life (and who know about your bipolar and other issues) that being different is okay. So what if you have to approach life a little differently? Yes, you struggle. We bipolar folk are with you on that. However, you're not worthless and you definitely have something to offer. I mean, at least that's what I think. I enjoy reading your posts because you help *me* understand me. I think that's worth something. So thank you for that.----But... I feel you man. I really do.&gt; I hate this fucking disease. It just robs everything good from you in the end, down to stripping away anything that you used to hold dear. You can fight it, but you can't ever win, and no one will ever understand it enough to stay with you in the end. Suicide's not even worth the trouble when you're already dead inside.Oof! Just, oof. The painful reality is glaringly obvious to us in the end. But that doesn't mean we don't deserve to love or be loved in return. Sure, your marriage may be a little rocky at the moment, but everyone needs to be loved and appreciated, even if it's just from your kids.All this to say, I want you to know that you've been heard. I just wanted to give you a gentle reminder and some counterpoints to what you're saying. I don't mean to be argumentative, rather, that I feel you and understand where you're coming from, but also wanted to share my perspective.In the coming days until you feel better, just try to do one thing: be kind to yourself. You deserve kindness from yourself just as we all do. Hang in there.", "link_id": "t3_fp41k0", "time": 1585215617}}

{"fkp450n": {"text": "Is your main target platform mobile devices? If so, which operating system do you wish to code in? (iOS or Android?) If iOS, you need to learn Objective-C, and for Android, you need to learn Java.Objective-C is an extended language based on C, so you could learn C and move on to Objective-C. Java is a decent starting language. They both take a lot of time to learn though. If you start from scratch, it'll take you a few months of concentrated programming to learn these languages, then it'll take you another few months to either learn XCode (iOS) or Android Development SDK development environments. Then finally, you can get started on your mobile app.For your chatbot, I'm not exactly clear what you want to accomplish with it, but you can probably use any language you want for coding something like that. I imagine it'll run as a service on some server and automatically crawl Facebook or some other social media platform and market whatever it is you need to market.If you wanted to develop these as web apps, you have many more choices for languages, including Java, C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc. My personal favorite is Python (shameless plug, haha). You'll want to learn how to hack JavaScript for sure for anything web app related.This is a lot of information to take in all at once, but if you narrowed down your goals a little bit we can dive deeper.Fair warning: programming is not easy. It's very abstract and ethereal. You have to have a good mental map of your ecosystem and environment, along with knowing basic computer science principles, in order to program well. If you're totally new at programming, and have the thirst and desire to learn, and you put in the time to learn and practice, then you'll eventually see your goal through. If you don't think you can invest the time and energy into it, my advice at this point would be to pay for an independent app developer to make your apps, then reap the rewards of your apps working for you. But that is quite an expensive option. Either way, a lot of *time* or *money* will be required.Hope that helps! Let's keep this discussion going.", "link_id": "t3_fj1dbd", "time": 1584401365}}

{"fkld0dh": {"text": "**TL;DR:** I literally could have written this. This is me, dead on. (Even the bipolar part, lol.)I've been hacking apart computers since I was 12. I've been programming on computers since I was 14. I even have a degree in computer science. Sounds like I found my career path right? Haha, nope! (To be fair, I am a programmer by trade, so I actually did find my career path, but...) While I've been hypomanic, I've changed my career path about a hundred times, give or take. At least, in my head I did.I've learned and studied about a long list of careers, obsessively. Because of this, I consider myself a jack of all trades, a master of none. But here are my notable career changes.While in college, studying computer science, I was planning on becoming a physical therapist. I thought I had it all figured out. I was going to change my major to biology, get my GPA up (it was bad), go to physical therapy school, help people, be happy, and be successful as a doctor.After that I was going to become a massage therapist.And then a lawyer.All this time I've always been employed as a programmer. After I got my degree, I just continued working, but I was never content. I always wanted to get out of programming and into something else.But, this one time, I quit my job, moved my family almost 1000 miles away to go to seminary so I could become an Orthodox Christian priest. I did seminary for a year before I quit due to financial reasons and marriage problems. To be fair, seminary was a blast, I had a lot of fun, and I learned so many things. It was one hell of a cultural experience. I even learned how to take steam baths (banya) and could take temperatures of up to 300 degrees F. It was probably the best time in my life.Then I lost my faith in the Church and in God which sent me spiraling into depression, but that's besides the point.After my return from seminary I went back to programming for a living. I just trudged on through because it was the only real marketable skill I had, and it payed pretty well. I divorced, remarried, and started a new life. Hypomania kicked in again after a particular long depression. During this depression my back and neck started to get all jickety-janked so I went to see a chiropractor. After getting adjusted, I felt a lot better, so I kept going. After a while I began to believe that being a chiropractor is where I wanted to be. For two whole weeks I was obsessing about being a chiropractor. I learned as much as I could about it. I even started applying to Palmer College. I began reorganizing my life around becoming a student again and picking my family up and moving across the country. Then that all ended abruptly when I learned that chiropractic, in reality, is a bunch of crap (except for a few things). Of course, depression hit afterward.The chiropractor incident was about 4 years ago and I've been pretty stable and set in my career path since then. I've come to terms with the fact that I am a programmer, despite not enjoying the field anymore. I both love and hate my job. I'm damn good at it, but the problem is I'm damn good at it and have lost the magic and mystery of it. I understand it, so I'm not interested any more. I want something new. Something fresh and interesting.All that is to say, I feel you. I feel you hard on this one. I guess the only piece of advice I have, and it's probably not good advice, I don't know, but to hell with finding your dream job. Find a job or start a business to make as much money as possible with as little stress as possible. In the end, if you don't work, you don't eat, so you might as well try to get ahead as much as you can cuz after that is retirement and then the end. It's called \"work\" for a reason. That's the way I see it anyway. YMMV. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.", "link_id": "t3_fj517f", "time": 1584303655}}

The real world goes on with or without us, so we're left looking back at ourselves and questioning our existence, rationalizing it one way or the other. Yes, this is all real. Your experience is real and is valid, as is our experience. We understand what you're going through. Yes, we care about you. I care about you. You're someone with whom I'm interacting with on the internet, trying to connect with you and show you that you're not alone. We're all in this together. And finally, you're not a burden.

{"fkj2boo": {"text": "Hey there, thank you for your post. I'll try to answer your questions as thoroughly as possible.&gt; So, I'm pretty sure a friend of mine (16F) is bipolar.First thing is first, what makes you think that your friend has bipolar disorder?For what it's worth, trained therapists, doctors, and psychiatrists even have a hard time diagnosing bipolar, because it can look like *so many things*. Bipolar mimics ADHD, teenage mood swings, major depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, borderline personality disorder, dissociative identity disorder, hypothyroidism, substance abuse, etc. and has just as many comorbid disorders along with it.However, the fact that you're noticing that something could be wrong is a step in the right direction.&gt; For some reason, I'm pretty sure she is.But, if you can't tell us exactly why you think she has bipolar, then it's difficult for us to say whether or not our experiences match hers. She needs to see a psychiatrist for a proper diagnosis. We, and you, can't make that diagnosis for her.&gt; I'd like to know if there are any signs that tell you she really is bipolar?Unfortunately, there is no scientific, medical, or definitive tests that can tell you, or any of us, if she has bipolar disorder. Diagnosis is made based purely on life experience and past history of behaviors. Unfortunately, this isn't good news for us with bipolar because it relies on us to be able to tell our subjective story accurately and often requires the knowledge from the people that are close to us. You are part of that equation for your friend so your experience will be helpful in obtaining a diagnosis.In any case, to answer your question more directly, **mania** is the definitive sign that she has bipolar disorder. If she's at all hypomanic or manic, by definition, she's bipolar, regardless if there are episodes of depression (very rare to not have depression though). The key thing to keep in mind is that everyone expresses their mania differently. I.e., some people have mostly euphoric mania, others have mostly dysphoric mania, others have mostly mixed mania, and some people have only one or two episodes of mania. The same is true for hypomania. Some people may have all the symptoms of mania and others will only have 5. We're all different, and so is your friend.&gt; but she refuses to see oneUnfortunately, this is a decision that only she can make. All of us have had to make that decision. It can be a tough one because there's such a stigma related to bipolar. Having this diagnosis is pretty difficult on any day of the week. None of us want to have this label, but it is what it is.&gt; therefore I'm asking for advice on how to be as supportive and effective as I can.Thank you so much for this! For some of us, we lose friends because of bipolar, for one reason or another. The fact that you want to support your friend is such a huge boost your friend's morale, whether she knows it right now or not. You may never be officially thanked, but rest assured your presence and support can mean the difference between life and death. No joke.In my opinion, one of the best ways to be helpful and supportive is to just be there for your friend in times of tranquility and in times of crisis. Sometimes all we need is an ear to listen to us bitch, moan, and groan. We don't want your advice all the time, though, unless we specifically ask for it. Everyone loves to give us advice as if their magical advice can cure what we're going through. If your friend has bipolar, it is important to remember that she can't just \"snap out of it.\" If she's in an episode, she cannot help how she's feeling and she can't just will herself out of it. *\"In Soviet Russia, you don't control bipolar, bipolar control you.\"* However, this doesn't mean that she can't make choices. In our episodes, we still have a brain and can make our own choices. It's just that sometimes those choices are colored by a different lense than neurotypical people's lense.&gt; From your experience, how do you like when your friends treat you?This is going to sound cliche, but: just like normal people. The last thing we want is to experience the stigma attached to bipolar. We're just normal people with a twist.&gt; How should they behave when you're in your manic state?This depends on what type of friendship you have, honestly. If you're part of her core support network, you have an established rapport with your friend that means you can intervene when your friend is episodic. You'd be welcome to do what you can to prevent your friend from hurting themselves or others and from making poor life choices. It's an important role to play.If you're a friend that she doesn't open up to as much and pushes you away, I think the best thing to do is to give her your distance until her episode is over, and to remain her friend throughout her episodes. Bipolar is a cyclical illness. It goes up and down and up and down and all around. So don't take things too personally if she blows up at you. It happens. It is what it is.Regardless of the type of friendship you have, it's always a good idea to learn as much as you can about bipolar disorder. After enough reading you'll start to get an idea of things.&gt; How can I help her? How can i be supportive? What should and shouldn't I say? What are some dos and don'ts?You're already taking a step in the right direction. Just take it day by day and go with the flow. Have a serious talk with your friend about your concern for her. Hopefully she will listen and seek help if necessary. Just be straight forward with her and it'll work itself out eventually. If she doesn't listen to you and she's in danger of hurting herself or others, talk to her parents and let them know what is going on.As for what you should or should not say, and for dos and don'ts, my advice is to just be respectful. She's the only one who can help her, ultimately. All you can do is cheer her on.I hope this helps. Thank you for being there for her, it means more than you know. Good luck!", "link_id": "t3_finyhp", "time": 1584234403}}

{"fkipatq": {"text": "&gt; Ever since they even mentioned the BP to me I\u2019ve been worrying!Bipolar is a strange diagnosis to receive. One the one hand you've got an identifier for a course of treatment that hopefully allows you to live the best life possible, but on the other hand bipolar itself is messing with our brains. One of these annoying habits that is really common in bipolar is to worry about, obsess over, constantly think about bipolar disorder. (I have been guilty of this for the last 2.5 months -- literally obsessing over it. Why? I have no idea.) So, if you can, do your best to become mindful of bipolar and how your symptoms manifest, but don't obsess over it and worry about it all day every day. It gets maddening after a while. Again, easier said than done.Maybe the new bipolar motto should be, \"Easier said than done!\" It fits really well.&gt; I guess just after trying so many meds for depression and getting no relief... I was starting to accept it was just me and not an illness.I like to think about it like this: why would I *ever* want to put myself through this bipolar mess? Mania? Depression? Fuck that noise. You're not making this up, it's definitely the illness that's messing with you. It's not \"you\" that's doing this.One of the best things you can do, I think, with this illness is to learn to give yourself a break. Be kind to yourself. You are the only one you truly have in this life. Beating yourself up over what you do in the course of being bipolar (including just being in mania and depression) is never productive. Talk to yourself as if you were a scared 5 year old child: kindly and sympathetically. Sorry if this sounds like a lecture--I don't mean it that way. I'm just brain dumping to you what I wish someone would have told me years ago.In any case, I'm glad that Abilify is working for you. And forgive me for being rude, but, welcome to the club!

I bet it's really frustrating.&gt; How do I talk to her to convince her to at least see a shrink to get diagnosed or given a clean bill of health?Unfortunately, this can only happen one of two ways. 1) Her life has been disrupted to the point that she's highly manic, suicidal, delusional, psychotic, etc. and you call 911 on her, she goes to the hospital, and she gets diagnosed there; or 2) she realizes that she has a problem and she voluntarily seeks a diagnosis so she can get treatment.That's only hurdle number one though. The second hurdle will be her being open, and committed, to receiving treatment and being medication compliant.If your wife has bipolar disorder, she needs to know that bipolar is a serious illness and it's progressive, meaning, if left untreated it just gets worse and worse. It also causes brain damage during mania or depression. Untreated bipolar causes havoc in the life of the person affected. It causes them to make poor life choices such as:* when (hypo)manic:   * cheating on a partner   * gambling or investing away money they can't afford to lose   * getting into debt very quickly   * ruining the relationships around them   * ruining their circadian rhythm and sleep cycle   * having risky sexual behavior   * substance abuse* when depressed:   * TW: [committing self harm and/or suicide](/spoiler)   * isolating themselves and pushing other people away or ending important relationships   * committing mental self abuse with far too much negative thinking (\"I'm worthless,\" \"I deserve this misery,\" \"I'm stupid,\") thus affecting self image, self esteem, and self worth.   * substance abuseIn short, she needs treatment if she has bipolar disorder.Hope that helps!

{"fkg0bww": {"text": "Yep, bipolar 2 here.Well, \"normal\" is such a subjective word with bipolar...For bipolar 1, \"normal\" means long~ish episodes of mania followed by depression that happens once or twice a year.For bipolar 2, \"normal\" means short~ish periods of hypomania followed by long periods of depression, or just in depression a lot more than mania that happens once or twice a year.I can't say with regards to cyclothymia or bipolar NOS. Most of us with bipolar, it seems, don't have the \"normal\", DSM delineated, symptoms that we're supposed to have and for the duration that we're supposed to have them. So maybe the better question is, how \"normal\" is this pattern for you? Are you taking medication? If so, does it help?By way of comparison, my \"normal\" (when unmedicated) was very few episodes of hypomania (~2 weeks duration), lots of depression (~2-4 weeks duration), and an even more amount of mixed episodes (almost all the time when not manic or depressed), and rarely stable. With my mixed episodes, my mood would fluctuate wildly like you show in the graph multiple times a day, yet I don't have BPD.Speaking of BPD (as you mention in the title), your mood pattern in this graph does indeed indicate that you have BPD (ultra rapid cycling, or perhaps even ultradian cycling). But the question is: for those mood fluctuations, are they triggered by external stimuli (like maybe getting into an argument so now you feel low, or just completing a project and you feel high)? If so, that's likely the BPD at work and not the bipolar. Bipolar mood shifts tend to happen on their own without external stimuli (but that's not to say your episodes weren't \"triggered\" thus making it look like it was the BPD).That is all to say, it's pretty complicated. I am confused by my mood states all the time and can never really pinpoint where I am (I was only diagnosed a little over 2 years ago so I'm still learning myself).Also, disclaimer, for the above information, take what I say with a grain of salt. I'm not a mental health professional.And, thanks for telling me the app! I hope you're doing well right now. Cheers!", "link_id": "t3_fi8rlm", "time": 1584146816}}

At most I only ever hear people taking lamotrigine two times a day (that's what I do, anyway).&gt; I have NEVER looked into her meds, always trusted that she was taking them, howsoever, I have strong evidence to prove that she is only taking me meds once a day, not for times a day.This is just my opinion, but for you as her partner, it would have been beneficial for the both of you if you were involved in what meds she is taking. That way you can observe her behavior and note how the meds affect her. Keeping track of medication is very important for bipolar people.&gt; But is increased agitation, paranoia, and so on a result of not taking the proper dose?Yes! Not just the proper dose, but the proper cocktail of medication! It's rare for someone with bipolar to be taking only one medication. Most of us are taking some combination of a mood stabilizer (such as lamotrigine), an antidepressant, and sometimes an antipsychotic.----Anyway, I'm sorry you had to go through what you did and I'm sorry you're going through a divorce right now.

So is \"manic\". You wouldn't say, \"I have manic,\" would you? You'd say, \"I am manic.\"Anecdotally, I see \"I am bipolar\" far more than I see \"I have bipolar\", but in the end I'd say use whatever makes you comfortable.

When I'm properly medicated I find it easier to smoke less. When I'm in an episode, I don't care about my health long enough to cut back on smoking; I smoke more.So from this, I'd suggest you start finding the right medication cocktail.

{"fjmpc2z": {"text": "Any time :) It's always nice to be heard. We're here for you! You're definitely not alone and you're not as crazy as you think. I know it sure feels that way. But it's okay to be a little crazy, right? It's almost worth being amused over.That's good (about your husband being there for you). I couldn't imagine the last 4 years without my wife. You bring up a good point though. Are we dependent on our spouses for our mental health? My wife has mental health issues as well and we lean on each other (cuz we don't have anyone else close by). I did think about this (co)dependency idea a few days ago, and I wondered if it should even be seen as a problem? As long as we're both stable while supporting each other than it can work out for the best, right? We certainly know we can't do it alone... Maybe what is most important is that our spouses aren't our ONLY lifeline. If for some reason our spouses could support us in our time of need, do we have a backup plan in place? This is something I need to think about for myself as well.Ah, so regarding the comment (the \"`If that's how you feel then...`\" one), did it sound flippant but it actually wasn't? It just sort of rubbed you the wrong way? I hate how our brains trick us into thinking that something is true when it otherwise isn't. Like looking at us wrong can send us into a spiral of doom. I think it's because we're so sensitive. Our emotions are on high alert and they twang with the slightest disturbance. I'm not saying we always blow everything out of proportion, but... you know... we kinda do sometimes lol. For what it's worth, this happens to me all the time with my wife. We have to maintain constant communication so we don't misinterpret each other. It's hard work.Yeah, that falling feeling you get when your emotions just wash over you... It sucks. It hits too hard. Exactly like you said, like a tidal wave. Then it's right to the guilty feelings and feeling worthless. I just want to say that you're doing very well by resisting the urge to cut. I haven't cut yet, but I've been close, so I can't say much about it, but what I mean to say is, I'm proud of you :) We're all proud of you. Hang in there! And thank you for reaching out and talking about your feelings. I hope this relieves some of the pressure you're feeling.&gt; It\u2019s horrifying knowing these thoughts come from my own brain. I am not suicidal but I fantasize how easy it would be to make this whole thing go away instead of fight the same battles over and over.Oof, I felt this hard! Bipolar, literally, drives us mad. This illness wants to kill us, let's face it. But what do we say to the god of death? \"Not today.\" Not today.&gt; I heard someone say one time \u2018The only thing I am certain of is that one day this illness will wear me down and kill me.\u2019 And I have never fully understood what someone was saying so deeply.Man, that's so true. The battle is tiring. The war can always be lost, but never be won. We stand here fighting, praying that it'll end in stalemate. Then we'll look bipolar in the face and say, \"At least you didn't win. Checkmate.\"That all said, I'm glad you posted this. I hope this response will help you feel less alone. We're fighting this illness with you and we'll back you up all the way.Since you're asking, I would say that if you have good communication with your husband, I would tell him everything that you told me. Heck, just show him your post. From the way you talk about him, he'll read carefully and understand that you're struggling and that you, nor he, never meant to argue and become discontent. As for it being a burden on him? I'm being optimistic here, and if I were to hazard a guess, this wouldn't be a burden on him. He's your husband. Your biggest fan and supporter. Just show him your love and he'll love you right back as if there was never a problem to begin with. Because together, you can stand your ground against this illness and live to fight another day.:) Hugs!", "link_id": "t3_fe7yye", "time": 1583478176}}

Tell her everything so you can get the most out of your own therapy :) Still, I get it.&gt; Where do you go with the worst, hardest thoughts in your head? Who do you tell? Do you worry that it will bite you in the ass later? Is this actually just a symptom of my BP2?I go to my wife with those thoughts. She's my lifeline. If I can't talk to her then I would be screwed because I would just bottle it all up until I explode and end up in the hospital. I don't worry that it will bite me in the ass later. If telling my wife is going to bite me in the ass then I question the endurance of my relationship with her. We have our ups and downs, sure, but we're really there for each other when it counts. I do think this is a symptom of bp2. Our bipolar brains are are always lying to us and sabotaging us. Our perception is colored and we draw conclusions based on skewed data. Our SOs are there to help us get the correct data so we can make more informed decisions.Anyway, I hope you are able to release the energy you have inside you.

I compare it to bipolar:Bipolar is brain based illness, BPD is more of a personality disorder.Bipolar's mood episodes are generally not triggered by anything (they happen on their own), but BPD's mood episodes are most often triggered by an event (big or small) and tend to only last a short while, and they happen frequently. *[That's not to say that bipolar disorder can't be triggered, but a bipolar episode can just happen without any outside influence.]*Bipolar doesn't have an unreasonable fear of abandonment, but BPD does.Bipolar is caused by genetic and environmental factors, but BPD is less genetic but more environmental (usually as a result of childhood abuse or trauma of some kind).Bipolar can't be \"cured\" with DBT, but BPD can be.Bipolar lasts a lifetime, but with proper consistent treatment, BPD can last up to 10 years. *[For some people, BPD does last a lifetime.]*Both bipolar and BPD are difficult to diagnose because they share a lot of the same symptoms (as well as with other disorders), but there are key symptoms that differentiate themselves from each other.**Note: I am not a trained mental health professional.

Your bipolar brain lies to you. We so easily latch onto negative thoughts and let those negative thoughts color the lense to which we see ourselves. These are all lies. Depression lies to you. Mania lies to you. This is one of the more difficult things about bipolar. That is, to see yourself objectively and not through the lies that bipolar tells you.&gt; Anyways I\u2019ve been on lamictal for about a month and doing pretty well so far. I have really dry skin (partly because I can never make myself use lotion) and I\u2019m prone to breaking out of getting red patches that appear like eczema and I\u2019m trying so hard to take care of my skin to try to prevent myself from having anything that looks like a rash and causes me to have to go to a hospital or come off lamictal unnecessarily but it.Look up on google images the famous lamotrigine/Lamictal rash. 9 times out of 10, you'll know when you have it because it'll be obvious. Still, be cautious. If you notice anything odd about your skin, talk to your doctor or go to the ER.&gt; Anyways just wondering if anybody has any advice about making these kinda routines more realistic/doable.What helps me is to do just one thing at a time.

{"fjfjudb": {"text": "I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a little over two years ago. I had a rough childhood, and was often in trouble from lying or stealing. I don't think my bipolar symptoms showed up in childhood though, but there was this one time when I was about 12 where I was suicidally depressed (I forgot why) and wanting to die. I healed from that and from then on my life has been chaotic and uncontent.I began noticing more depression after I got to college during my sophomore year. For a good portion of that year I was in a deep depression and my GPA was slipping badly. I spent the next 10 years getting my GPA up to a 2.8 (I wasn't the best student). In college, I think my bipolar symptoms started showing up mainly in the form of depression with occasional hypomania. My hypomania was never too bad, when I had it.I married my college sweetheart and we had a child together. I was really getting into religion and at one point we uprooted our lives to go to seminary so I could become a priest. My bipolar at this point was starting to become problematic as I was hypersexual so often that we thought I had a sexual addiction. Seminary didn't work out so we went back home and then my marriage started to fail. My marriage eventually didn't work out and I got hypomanic after I moved into my new place with some depression thrown in.Then I got the most hypomanic I have ever been when within the span of 6 months I dated, engaged, married, and started the immigration process of my Canadian wife (I'm American). I don't remember depression following that but the hypomania settled down at some point. Fast forward a few years we end up in a large city with a new job and a new apartment. At this point things are going great, but my moods are still going up and down. I'd get hypomanic for a couple of weeks followed by some depression, and the cycle would continue.At one point I was getting so hypomanic that I started having delusions that I had this body integrity dysphoria disorder. I told my mom about this disorder, as I was convinced that I had it, and she dropped a bombshell on me. It turns out that the father that I had known wasn't my real father. There's this other guy that's my father. And it turns out he has bipolar disorder. Essentially, by telling me this, she was saying I could be bipolar.I got in touch with my real father via text. We had been chatting a while and at one point I was trying to get him to validate me or something like that and he wouldn't validate me, which threw me into a mental breakdown. This mental breakdown changed everything. That's when bipolar really started rearing its ugly head. Following my breakdown I went into the deepest, darkest, most terrifying depression I had ever experienced. It was really bad.I started rapid cycling with intense mixed episodes, so I went to see a therapist. I thought I had Borderline Personality Disorder but she wouldn't diagnose me that. Instead I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD and got on stimulant medication to combat my ADHD. I did okay on stimulant meds for a while but eventually my episodes would continue.At this point I was able to transfer my job to another part of the state and moved back home. My bipolar was getting worse and worse. I was going crazy. Fast forward a year and I go see a psychiatrist because at this point I'm starting to believe I had bipolar type 1. During the first visit with my psychiatrist, she diagnosed me with bipolar type 2. I've been on meds ever since and am stable today.", "link_id": "t3_fcv5ah", "time": 1583293272}}

If you've been bipolar for some time, a diagnosis just tells your doctor the course of treatment to take. Nothing has changed. Your bipolar isn't going to get worse now that you have a diagnosis. You seem pretty high functioning, so all you probably need to do is find the right cocktail of meds and you'll be good to go.&gt; My psychiatrist said that I can still lead a good and fulfilling life.Trust your doctor.&gt; I managed a BA, MA, and PhD unmedicated.Well done! Congratulations!&gt; But, I keep thinking that I'm going to fail because of my diagnosis.If you fail, then you fail. You are not likely to fail because you continue to push forward, personal resolve goes a long way. But sometimes we bipolars just can't do it, and that's okay. Don't let bipolar trick you into thinking you can't do anything, though. If you think you will fail, you probably will. Chin up, just keep looking forward.&gt; What if the lamictal leaves me unable to keep up with my work cognitively and creatively?I won't sugar coat it, this is a possibility. But if it gets to that point you should probably switch to another med. If it doesn't work for you, change it. If you get to the point where you are a zombie or just a shell of a person, then your doses or meds are not correct. Stability means that you should be cognisant, aware, and even keeled.

{"fj2ll1c": {"text": "Hi, I'm 36m and was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a little over two years ago. I had a rough childhood, and was often in trouble from lying or stealing. I don't think my bipolar symptoms showed up in childhood though, but there was this one time when I was about 12 where I was suicidally depressed (I forgot why) and wanting to die. I healed from that and from then on my life has been chaotic and uncontent.I began noticing more depression after I got to college during my sophomore year. For a good portion of that year I was in a deep depression and my GPA was slipping badly. I spent the next 10 years getting my GPA up to a 2.8 (I wasn't the best student). In college, I think my bipolar symptoms started showing up mainly in the form of depression with occasional hypomania. My hypomania was never too bad, when I had it.I married my college sweetheart and we had a child together. I was really getting into religion and at one point we uprooted our lives to go to seminary so I could become a priest. My bipolar at this point was starting to become problematic as I was hypersexual so often that we thought I had a sexual addiction. Seminary didn't work out so we went back home and then my marriage started to fail. My marriage eventually didn't work out and I got hypomanic after I moved into my new place with some depression thrown in.Then I got the most hypomanic I have ever been when within the span of 6 months I dated, engaged, married, and started the immigration process of my Canadian wife (I'm American). I don't remember depression following that but the hypomania settled down at some point. Fast forward a few years we end up in a large city with a new job and a new apartment. At this point things are going great, but my moods are still going up and down. I'd get hypomanic for a couple of weeks followed by some depression, and the cycle would continue.At one point I was getting so hypomanic that I started having delusions that I had this body integrity dysphoria disorder. I told my mom about this disorder, as I was convinced that I had it, and she dropped a bombshell on me. It turns out that the father that I had known wasn't my real father. There's this other guy that's my father. And it turns out he has bipolar disorder. Essentially, by telling me this, she was saying I could be bipolar.I got in touch with my real father via text. We had been chatting a while and at one point I was trying to get him to validate me or something like that and he wouldn't validate me, which threw me into a mental breakdown. This mental breakdown changed everything. That's when bipolar really started rearing its ugly head. Following my breakdown I went into the deepest, darkest, most terrifying depression I had ever experienced. It was really bad.I started rapid cycling with intense mixed episodes, so I went to see a therapist. I thought I had Borderline Personality Disorder but she wouldn't diagnose me that. Instead I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD and got on stimulant medication to combat my ADHD. I did okay on stimulant meds for a while but eventually my episodes would continue.At this point I was able to transfer my job to another part of the state and moved back home. My bipolar was getting worse and worse. I was going crazy. Fast forward a year and I go see a psychiatrist because at this point I'm starting to believe I had bipolar type 1. During the first visit with my psychiatrist, she diagnosed me with bipolar type 2. I've been on meds ever since and am stable today.", "link_id": "t3_fb0qb4", "time": 1582946844}}

I think that most people in treatment are on a mood stabilizer. I am on a mood stabilizer as well (lamotrigine 200 mg). For me, my general experience has been positive. It curbs my symptoms while my antidepressant lifts my mood. I have not had any side effects from lamotrigine.&gt; 2) Without medication, how do people manage Bipolar II affecting their lives? Weirdly I feel very much like I'm \"in control\" when I'm depressed but when I'm hypomanic, I believe I'm in control of everything when I'm really not.For me personally, I was not able to manage without medication.

{"fgw1cdu": {"text": "Hello, and welcome to  what you describe, it sounds like your father has bipolar type 1. I have bipolar type 2 so my experiences are probably not going to match what your father feels, but I can give you a little bit about how I experience things.I am what we call a 'rapid cycler', meaning my phases change frequently. If your father is only having an episode once every few years, then he's your classic 'slow cycler' (for lack of a better term). A phase change for me is often situationally dependent, but mostly comes from after sleeping. I'll wake up depressed or I'll wake up jazzed. On medication, I wake up stable.What your father could possibly be feeling is speculative. But here's some ideas to get your understanding started. There are two ways to think of things. 1) being medicated, and 2) being unmedicated.**Being medicated**For me, being medicated gives me stability. My emotions are flat. They rarely go up or down. I don't feel like I'm riding on an emotional rollercoaster. I have some mental fog and memory issues. My energy is 'meh'. I don't get this amazing rush of creative ideas anymore. Meds aren't a cure all, I still have to watch my mood and practice positive cognitive conditioning. I don't get suicidal anymore, and my 'mixed states' are gone (mixed states are when you are both manic and depressed at the same time. They're the worst). I have a general lack of energy and it takes me a long time to get going in the morning. I'd say all in all, the pros outweigh the cons.**Being unmedicated**For me, being unmedicated means my moods and my life are turning upside down. Rarely do I get this euphoric feeling (as others do), but rather I get this dysphoric feeling. Hypomania (\"under mania\") often means I am obsessing over a particular topic. I get this surge of anxiety that I can't control, even with cognitive behavioral skills. My libido goes into overdrive and I am seeking risky (hospital-bound) behaviors. I've never been hospitalized, but I probably should have been a few times. At other times I can be feeling depressed. Depression is easy to relate to, generally, but it includes a lack of energy, lack of focus, either way too much sleep or not enough of it, either way too much eating or not enough of it, suicidal thoughts and apathy. Lack of direction and drive and an overall mood of \"blah\". On any given day (I never know what my moods will be like from one minute to the next) you can mix and match all the symptoms I described and you'll have a better picture of what the situation is like.Anyway, these are just examples. Everyone experiences bipolar differently, so you're going to get a lot of varied answers. The best way to find out how your father is feeling is by asking him and him telling you. Over time you'll get an overall picture and can probably even start to predict episodes if they start occuring more often. We all have our 'triggers', we just have to learn them.One of the best ways to help a bipolar person is to suffer through their episodes with them, through thick and thin, and always being there on the other side. Be a person your father can rely on to help mitigate his episodes. You're taking the first step by learning more about it, which is fantastic. Keep up the good work!I hope this helps. Sorry I can't give you a more thorough answer. Be well.", "link_id": "t3_f0nd3f", "time": 1581155523}}

Confide in a trusted friend your goals (e.g., not wanting to have sex, not wanting to spend a lot of money, etc.) and have them hold you to the standard you'd like to set for yourself. Then, when you're feeling manic (or even normal or depressed), check your goals with your friend.

I went to see a psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with bipolar type 2.The diagnosis was more of a relief to be honest, because at least I had a professionally diagnosed condition that I can point to and say, \"this is what is affecting me.\"Finding a balance between this diagnosis and current life has a lot to do with stability (being on the right meds, doing therapy, etc). When stable, you don't even think of it anymore. Mood swings become few and far between. At that point, current life can take the front seat and you can move forward.

{"fg63e6a": {"text": "Before I was diagnosed, I dated this girl in college and eventually married her. That was a manic decision. After we divorced (5 years later, and because of undiagnosed bipolar disorder) I spent 1 year focusing on myself. Then one of my best hypomanic sprees happened. I found another girl in Canada (I'm American). We \"dated\", and two months later we were engaged, and 5 months later we were married. That was a manic decision. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 four years later. Thankfully, 7 years later, we're still married, and still in love.The moral of my story is: When you're manic, you are likely to make poor decisions, so don't make any rash decisions. Date for a while and see how things go. Disclose your bipolar diagnosis and teach your partner how to support you.

Medication is necessary to help manage the mood swings of bipolar; it's essential. There are a lot of people here who would agree with me when I say that treatment will actually help you be a better person. Stability is possible (bipolar is pretty treatable, but not curable) and brighter days are ahead of you.The idea of taking psychiatric meds, I think, scare most of us at first. You read about all these side effects that are possible and it's easy to imagine you'll get the worst ones.

If your wife is lucky like me, she'll get the right meds on the first go (and even then it took me 8 months to find the right doses). So be prepared to accept that it could take a while.There are things that you could do to help alleviate some of these consequences while she focuses on her meds. If you're up for it, perhaps establish some boundaries on her hypersexual phases. Perhaps sit down with her and explain that, \"I understand you have your hypersexual phases, and that's fine, but from now on you must satisfy your urges only with me,\" if that's how you want it. There's no excuse or reason that she should be finding relief with other people, especially if you're in a monogamous relationship.

{"ffvgzqx": {"text": "Hi there, father (36) of one daughter (11) here with bipolar 2.I'll throw in my two cents.&gt; A. Passing on my BP2 to my kidI wouldn't worry so much if your child will \"inherit\" your bipolar disorder. Even if your child has the genes, bipolar may not even wake up. I think it depends on how well you cope and how well you give your child the tools to cope. If they end up having bipolar disorder, then at least they'll have you to be there for when things go south. I would say that the fear of passing bipolar onto your child isn't a good enough reason to not have kids.That said, here's what I've experienced. I was diagnosed when my daughter was 9. Of course I had bipolar since before she was 9, but I didn't understand why raising her was so damn difficult. You never get a break. You have to be on the ball at all times until they're at least 10 to 12 or so, because after that they can understand you're going through rough times and they can leave you alone more to deal with your struggles.&gt; B. Parenting them in a way that subconsciously is me trying to rectify the problems in my own childhood and therefore having the \"pendulum effect\" (ie family not talking about emotions and me over-encouraging them to the point where my kids shut down completelyYou can't worry about things like this too much. As a new parent, you'll be winging it most of the time and the answers are never clear. Kids are resilient creatures but they can be messed up by bad parenting. As long as you love your kids, show them you're there for them, and don't worry about the small things that don't matter, they should turn out fine. Remember: they aren't you, they are their own person. Just let them be themselves and love them no matter what. &gt; I only want advice on how you combat these thingsThe best way I think to combat these things is to be on a path of wellness. Taking your meds, going to therapy, having a support network, etc. *Having a support network is a big one.* If you don't have a good support network (spouse, family, friends) then raising a child will be 100 times harder, and it's *already* hard to raise children.&gt; or if you think it would have been easier for you to not have had childrenThis all being said, it's *definitely* easier to not have children. But the question is, is it worth it to not have children? If you want children, have children. You'll need someone to take care of you when you're older ;)Hope this helps.

I crashed into mild depression yesterday and today.Wondering if you're bipolar is actually a symptom of bipolar disorder. You can read many accounts here on   and  where people felt they too were \"faking it\" and felt like they didn't really have bipolar. I guess what I'm saying is, this is normal thinking for a bipolar person and is normal. Try not to lose sight of your cycles and episodes, those right there should tell you if your diagnosis is correct or not.If you were diagnosed bipolar, though, I'm surprised you're not on a mood stabilizer (I'm assuming). It's quite possible that Effexor isn't treating your depression and instead giving you mania, which would explain your mixed states. I'd talk to your doctor about getting on a mood stabilizer as well, that is likely to help.

I've been reading posts all over reddit and the experience is the same. I find this fascinating. I wonder if this phenomenon is more unique to bipolar than other mental health diagnoses.&gt; As for the rest, I seldom have found hypomania to be pleasurable. Maybe for a short while, I'm euphoric but that ultimately turns to extreme irritability, aggressiveness, and rage. If it doesn't get that bad, then it's starting one new grand project after another and obsessing about it until the episode inevitably is over and I abandon it.I experience almost exactly the same thing -- my hypomanic episodes tend to be dysphoric though (lately, within the last couple of years). Before then there were some slightly euphoric ones, but they all lead to the same thing: starting (many) grand projects and obsessing about them until the episode is over and I abandon it. To combat this, when I know I'm about to start on a new project, I take a step back and try to analyze my mood and in general I just avoid starting the project. I don't know if my approach is the best but at least I don't feel bad for not finishing them, lol.&gt; road rageOMG, this! I'm so glad my road rage doesn't exist anymore (on meds).Your description of depression sounds all too familiar. I feel ya man.&gt; Part of me thinks that I don't need the meds, there's nothing wrong, but I just think back to the episodes I had pre-medication and shudder at the thought of going back to it again.My problem here is that, for some reason I can't figure out, I have a really hard time remembering my past hypomanic episodes. I \"know\" I've had them before because, well, look at where I am today... But I have a hard time looking back and going, \"Yep! I was manic!\" Maybe it's because I felt completely normal during my hypomania (even the dysphoric ones) and \"nothing was wrong\"? I don't know, it's confusing to me. But! I do remember how dysfunctional I was over the years and how meds have really helped out with that, so there's that. I've been reading lately how \"if your bipolar meds are working for you, then you're bipolar,\" in  and  This has helped me some.&gt; In my case, I had long suspected that it was bipolar, but was elated when I went through the process to get re-diagnosed and was initially told it was depression and ADHD.I went through exactly the same thing, word for word. I was put on Wellbutrin and Vyvanse first, then a couple of years later was diagnosed with bipolar. The funny part about this is, I know for a *fact* that I have ADHD -- there's no denying that diagnosis.&gt; Confirmation bias can be a very tricky thing, and there's no harm in going back to see if your diagnosis is still valid. If nothing else, getting diagnosed by another provider might put your mind at ease.Yeah, I guess I suppose I have some confirmation bias and I'm trying to cull that out for a clearer picture. A second opinion may help with that.Thanks again for your reply and for relating your story with me. Cheers!", "link_id": "t3_etmfe6", "time": 1580085804}}
