To balance out with the good and help us notice the good parts of our lives. It\u2019s also there as a teaching moment that helps us grow.

{"etcmhga": {"text": "Hey gal, I completely feel where your coming from. (Bf just broke up with me yesterday\u2014says it\u2019s a break; I don\u2019t feel too hopeful tho\u2014bc of my lying, bipolar disorder, addiction, and overall toxic behavior)First thing I\u2019d say, if your not already doing it, is get in therapy. Even if it\u2019s once a month for the beginning. But try to get into it to talk to a professional and if needed get medicated. Depression and anxiety are so awful and sometimes debilitating that if left untreated it\u2019s going to affect your relationships. Also, as shit as it does sound, trust me it\u2019s hurt me too hearing this, but people can\u2019t have healthy romantic relationships until they\u2019ve completely worked on their selves. I mean you can try, but often it ends up like this. I\u2019m sure your boyfriend is hurting just as much as you are, and I\u2019m sure he loves you so soo much, but maybe it\u2019s best to take a little break? I\u2019m not saying break up, but take time to separate yourself from the partnership to get your shit together. Allow both of yourselves to be independent for a bit and have space. And you know, if you guys can, communicate about it\u2014set up boundaries, and like check in after maybe a month to see how you feel; if it\u2019s not too painful, maybe you guys can even continue to have contact with each other. I hope this wasn\u2019t too long winded and helps a little bit\ud83d\ude0a you got this tho", "link_id": "t3_cb11ze", "time": 1562688075}}

I currently am dealing with a problem quitting smoking pot too and I\u2019ve recently relapsed and kinda fucked up my relationship which was my rock bottom to push me to try to get serious in quitting smoking. So unless you\u2019re willing to hit rock bottom, I\u2019d suggest trying to keep yourself occupied so that you don\u2019t find yourself bored and wanting to smoke. But I think what\u2019s most important is believing that you can do this. That your more than your addiction to this and you will get thru it\u2014sure it may take a while and you might relapse\u2014but as long as you don\u2019t give up, you can do it.", "link_id": "t3_cb1q61", "time": 1562686897}}

So like I took it around 4:11, by like 5:30 I was beginning to feel the come up and I decided to take my dog on a walk and enjoy the beautiful day. Then I went on a bicycle ride, where my heart was beat so fast and I honestly went so alive. I decided to chill in my backyard after that and just enjoy the schenery, listened to the Beatles. Then I just kinda starting thinking, my friend/trip sitter for the night came over. Moment I saw her I started crying like a baby. I was so happy to see her. I basically cried a bit there for a while, but the trip didn\u2019t go bad. I was in an good mood. A lot of other stuff happened, but the most significant two parts were that everywhere I would look, if I\u2019d loose focus in my vision slightly I could see a whole bunch of eyes. Like transparent, rainbow eyes in a kinda geometric circle shape, if that makes sense. The second important experience was there was a moment  at my friends house when I was staring outside the door into the dark. It was soo pitch black, I was purposely trying to psych myself out trying to make myself see the devil, and eventually I thought I saw a horned like figure, more like an simple  silhouette shape of a human with arms, or tentacles, or energy beams? Protruding from its sides. I felt super safe tho; I wasn\u2019t scared at all and I am almost convinced that I saw or felt a god like entity? Maybe I\u2019m crazy, I probably am, but I wept a couple times through the trip after then when trying to explain how everything felt. It was all just so beautiful and wholesome.
