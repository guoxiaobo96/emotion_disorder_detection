So I got weighed for no clear reason given that the nurse had no access to my medical records and couldn\u2019t do anything about anything.

{"fsmthw2": {"text": "I think high waisted jeans would definitely work. I took my twin sister jean shopping a couple months after she had a baby (so more weight on the stomach and lower stomach). I worked in a boutique for years that carried premium denim so I\u2019m her jeans expert. Clothes and shoes too. :)She\u2019s used to mid-rise, and I love high rise, so I made her try them and they were way more flattering than the mid rise. She was very surprised! The mid rise cut her off in the biggest part of her stomach and the waistband cut into her stomach despite the jeans being the correct size, if not a little big. I will say that the thinner, stretchier denim was not flattering on the stomach, but the thicker denim was. And the pair she got still had stretch, so still comfortable. (Very important because of her C-section scar.)We\u2019re both 5\u20198\u201d and have longer legs, but I think high waisted jeans do make both of us look taller. I think they do for most people, because the extra fabric above the waist creates a longer line. (Obviously nothing is one size fits all though.)I would second the suggestions to try on in store-I\u2019m an online shopping queen so if you do order online, find a place with free returns and then order multiple sizes and fits. Madewell makes curvey fits (and has a better size range than a lot of places, which I like) so that might be a good option. I\u2019m not familiar with Everlane jeans personally.One more recommendation is to not be afraid to buy them a bit snug. I had to fight with my sister to size down 1 size and she was surprised they fit and looked better. Looser jeans don\u2019t hold you in as well, and aren\u2019t quite as flattering.

The mental health stuff gets me too because they whine all day about their mental health issues but don\u2019t actually do anything to treat them. I think mental illness is treated as some taboo topic, and if you say you\u2019re depressed or have anxiety or whatever, that\u2019s that and you\u2019re no longer expected to be an adult with agency. And anyone who tells you to push yourself to get help or even just get off the couch is a monster who doesn\u2019t understand depression.

{"frxbvfp": {"text": "Yeah I was in your shoes-I knew of it but didn\u2019t even think of it until my psychiatrist/therapist brought it up.So the initial treatment (AKA index treatment) is usually 3x/week for 4 weeks, and that\u2019s what I did starting in July of 2019. I took FMLA from work for the first round. Then for the maintenance treatments, they slowly spaced them out further and further. First one was 10 days after my last treatment, then the next one was 2 weeks after that, and so on. Now I go every 8 weeks and that\u2019s where my ECT doctor wants me to be-he said it\u2019s not shown to be efficacious after 8 weeks.Aside from headaches, the big side effect is short term memory loss. Less common is long term memory loss. I had both, but the trade off is 100% worth it. I would do it all over again without a doubt. Also (per my doctor and my experience) once the treatments are spaced out, memory loss is lessened. (It is a little bizarre though-for example, I didn\u2019t remember that my sister drove from a state away to take me to my treatments and take care of me for a week during my index treatment. I just decided to accept the memory loss and not worry about it because I was/am so grateful to be better.)And of course, you can actually get manic from the treatments. I have to skip my lithium dose the day before treatments because lithium can cause increased confusion. So I actually got mildly hypomanic towards the end of the index treatments. It went away pretty quickly once I was able to take lithium again, and my psychiatrist actually didn\u2019t even have me take an anti-psychotic. (He puts me on Zyprexa when I\u2019m full on manic.) You can also get nauseous from the anesthesia. (I did, so after my first treatment they gave me anti-nausea drugs beforehand, so that\u2019s no longer an issue at all.)Regarding recovery, I\u2019m not supposed to drive for 24 hours (because of the seizure) but that\u2019s the only restriction. I usually have no headache or a mild one that is knocked out with Tylenol. I do tend to nap when I get home, but that could also be from getting up early. I go back to work the next day and I can drive because my treatments are early morning so it\u2019s more than 24 hours typically.Another consideration is unilateral vs. bilateral. For unilateral they stimulate you on one side and bilateral is both sides. Bilateral is more effective but causes more memory issues. For my index treatments and initial maintenance treatments I had unilateral, and then switched to bilateral at my ECT doctor\u2019s suggestion. (Because once the maintenance treatments are more spaced out, the memory loss is less of an issue.)Oh and time-wise, I typically get to the hospital at 7:30am and check in, they get my IV started, weight and all that around 8/8:15am, get my treatment, wake up around 9:45/10am, go home around 10:30 depending on how my blood pressure is. (It sometimes gets low, I guess from the anesthesia? I feel fine and don\u2019t notice it.) Obviously some of that will vary depending on where you go, but overall it feels quick and easy.It really has changed my life, and I\u2019m so grateful I did it.

I like to have all lengths to cover different necklines. Most of my necklaces and pendants are simple and geometric.I also have a lot of rings in various metals and styles, but again, usually clean/geometric/architectural in style.My fave fine jewelry designers are probably Marla Aaron for necklaces and Sholdt and J.

{"fq9buqc": {"text": "I was a buyer for 7 years at a boutique that carried men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing, shoes and accessories.

Because it was a smaller place it was easy to get involved in the buying so I did, and eventually stopped working as a manager and was a buyer full time. I traveled to showrooms, trade shows and wholesale markets, priced items, worked with budgets for each category, analyzed sales reports, etc.I also helped launch their e-commerce website and did the buying for the site, as well as styling the photo shoots.Pros: -Working in fashion is super fun if you love it-you\u2019re surrounded by it, almost everyone working in the industry loves fashion and likes to talk shop-Regular travel to NY and LA, covered by the company (plus I had no daily limits so got to eat at great restaurants for free)-Free clothes from sales reps-tons and tons sometimes. One of my fave reps let me go through his sample rack for the season and pick anything I wanted, I got like 30 things -Fat discount on anything else (I could sometimes buy stuff for wholesale, otherwise 40% off)-Seeing the tangible results of your work quickly-its fun seeing it in the store, and you know quickly if something is a hitCons:-Pay isn\u2019t that great-Regular business travel gets old-For me, moving up would have meant moving to NY to work for a bigger company and I just wasn\u2019t interested in that. I wanted to buy all categories and the more I travelled to NYC the less I wanted to live there-Market constraints, e.g. your customer base won\u2019t buy something because it\u2019s too pricy/fashion forward)-Job is very affected by the overall economy.
