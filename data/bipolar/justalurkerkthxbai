'Many causes of mental health problems also have physical consequences, and mental illness worsens the prognosis of a range of physical illnesses, especially heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Unfortunately, people with serious mental illnesses may not access healthcare effectively,' says Dr Fazel.  &gt;  &gt;Dr Fazel is certain: **'All of this can be changed. There are effective drug and psychological treatments for mental health problems.** We can improve mental health and social care provision.
