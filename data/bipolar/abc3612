This eventually led to him hitting a pole at 70+mph, being stuck in a wheelchair for 6 months and some major legal issues. I got a restraining order to keep him away from me and the kids. They would cry and cry to see their dad. I just had to explain that daddy was not healthy and was making bad choices so we had to give him time to try to get better. I did my very, very best to give them the stability they needed and keep them safe from the choices he made. What I learned from this ordeal was, I had to let him hit rock bottom and choose to get help. And he did. He went to rehab in a wheelchair, now sees a psychiatrist and therapist monthly and takes his meds. He\u2019s almost 4 years sober.
