I had intended to go down that aisle but they were looking at me so I walked past until I saw another person in an aisle and went down that one and asked the girl to look back and see if the guys had watched me walk this way. She said yeah, they are looking this direction. I decided to just get the other item I was there for and leave. I tried to tell the cashier she should get security and why and I would like an escort to my car but as I was telling her one of the guys got right behind me in line! I hurried out to my car which for some reason I had backed into the stall which I rarely do and as I got into my car I looked up and that guy was reaching for my door handle. I slammed the locks closed and tore out of there not caring if I ran him over. I was shaking From adrenaline and My mind started thinking what to do.

I slept thru the whole thing .  Being right there and not being able to save him messed with my daughter for a long time. There was  nothing she could have done that would have saved him.The kicker ?  The kid and his friend we're just going to get a burger to eat .
