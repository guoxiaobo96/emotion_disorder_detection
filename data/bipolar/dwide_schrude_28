They hold more than tampons, so unless you have a very very heavy flow you don\u2019t have to change it as often (They can be left in up to 12 hours, which is a game changer). It can be a little hard to get used to inserting and removing, but it isn\u2019t too bad if you don\u2019t mind getting a little blood on your hand/putting a finger all they way in your vagina. I only change mine at home because I\u2019m not worried about the cup overflowing, but if your flow is heavy, go in the family bathroom. I dump mine out in the bathtub at home, then rinse out the inside and outside. It\u2019s a lot easier to insert when it\u2019s wet. I\u2019ve heard of some people using a water based lube, but water has worked just fine for me. I also know some people dump it out and not rinse before reinserting, but not me. I have the Blossom cup. It\u2019s pretty soft so it\u2019s easy to get in and out. But I\u2019ve never had children so if you have you probably need a firmer one. Sorry for the wall of text lol.
