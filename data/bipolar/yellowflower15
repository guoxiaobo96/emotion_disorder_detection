The thing is also not only February but way back in late November early December there were actually a lot more people than usual sick with some type of flu but nothing was being recorded and there were no warnings. People that were sick were not going to see any doctors as per usual if have a cold or flu we tend to stay home and rest really as not much can really be done. That is unless you are one of the unlucky ones that does end up with a very bad flu. My son was wiped out totally for approx 2 weeks with his throat and head aching. Unlike any other year. Just before November my father passed away very quickly with what started out as flu like symptoms that quickly turned into a chest infection and pnumonia. (I have spelt that wrong havnt i lol). Just after February a lot of people were also sick as per usual which is the change from Summer ending so yes with all of those things that happened as well as covid 19 now here I am really not sure what to say or think. Just to use as an example for one thing and cannot speak for Australia wide only where I am. Yeast is impossible to find anywhere really. I am pretty sure that people have stopped panic buying things such as toilet paper so that there does not make sense to me either as we produce toiler paper here yet the shelves are still very empty of it. I have been to the supermarket when people were crazy racing for toilet paper and the supermarkets are not at all like that anymore. What it looks like to me and of course way be far from the case but by the different times etc .. That i will go to the supermarket it looks like shelves are being half stocked up or something. Hard to explain sorry. And yes also prices of items have gone up in price for sure by quite a bit. Also medications are running low or totally out of stock in some places but there were quite a few medications out of stock Australia wide just before December with no dates available when or if they would be here. The only reason that I know that is because they are 2 of my medications that should be on but am not taking. There are no alternatives for them either. Just to me so many things really dont make sense now or when i look back. I was shocked when i was not able to get my medications. That was not just from the pharmacy but all pharmacies Australia wide. We can find toilet paper but there is just never much on the shelves no matter what day or time you go. It always seems to be the around the amount or quantity. I hope I am making sense.

Also in saying that I really am so terrified now being older saying anything to someone even hinting that I actually have feelings for them and I'm in that horrible situation right now. I've known a guy for over a year. From get go we've gotten along so well. We normally just hang out at each other's places. If we happen to be crashing there it has always been on the couch. We can talk about basically anything to each other for hours and hours. We both have dogs and are huge animal lovers so we also have that in common and our dogs love each other play together like crazy and we all go on walks together. The thing is that I have actually liked him so much more than a friend from the minute that I met him. A lot of times I get the feeling he also feels the same because as well as laughing and hanging shit on each other he does act in this really gentleman like way and makes sure he does act appropriately say in a way that he would never talk to or treat one of his male mates. He does every now throw in something that's obvious it's a flirting thing. He really does tell me so many personal things about himself also asks me personal questions as though no big deal at all. So now I've come at a place where I just really really do like him very much and knowing him so well I think there would be a good chance of us having something. I want to say something coz it's basically killing me but seriously I am so scared to say anything because if I'm totally wrong and he sees me not at all in that way I would be so so embarrassed and most likely even though would always want him as a friend I really don't think would be able to face him ever again and would just stay away and just let the friendship die. What do I do honestly..   Is he giving off hints subtly sussing me out and kind of thinking the same way I am or would have made a move by now. It's really only the past couple of months that we have become much more closer as he was my friends friend so only saw him if visited my friend but now we see each other and do things together without my friend. I feel as though am acting like a very silly teenager but my fear is real. Anyone. Really need it. Advise. What do I do? It's sort of come to a place that something or nothing or whatever just anything does sort of need to happen. Thanks", "link_id": "t3_g7rcgf", "time": 1587819690}}

Sure to the lady next to me at the supermarket or the elder gentleman walking by me on the street but not with anyone I want to be in my life. I've stopped seeing so many people. Some that were so close that have known for over 20 years. I just couldn't get interested in what I can only kind of explain as typical conversations. I'm curious by nature, and always want to keep learning so when I'm talking with someone I like to know who they are and I like deep convos. I like hearing all different interesting stories and knowing all types of different people. I'm very open myself so share a lot about myself too. So many people I meet are only in my life for a very short time and that is exactly the reason they leave. A lot of times I get upset and hurt but at the same time expect it. But the thing is also there are similar people like me and the past two nights in a row I had a friend here all night until virtually lunch time following day and there was no tv on. Just some music for a little while then that was switched off . All we did was talk all night both times. I just love those types of nights. We were so open and talked about everything and anything. It actually feels good knowing that someone trusts you to know so much about them. Also knowing that someone is sticking around. I have about 3 friends in total and they are all the same. Of course we laugh and have fun too but we are all very open and can talk for hours and hours about anything. Really I wouldn't change that. I don't want people in my life for small talk. I've tried. I just can't do it. It's not me. But really I grew up with the thought that it's much better to have 1 or 2 true friends than a whole heap of acquaintances just for the sake of it so when I was seeing a lot of people I actually wasn't happy. It was more a chore spending time with them. There was more drama that shouldn't have been there. I found myself agreeing to do things I really didn't enjoy at all only to not offend anyone. It used to upset me a lot that I just couldn't keep people in my life and I really felt bad because think of myself as a good kind person but for a long time was thinking I just must not be. Or neither was I any fun to be around but I am. Now I love the way everything is. I feel I'm me and being true to myself and who I am.

I did the most walking I've ever done seeing the town at early hours to middle of the night. He had a place he had his mail sent to and I could go on but the point is you can never judge anyone for anything.

I'm not that far gone that am doing very stupid things. Besides taking meth of course. I really don't want professional help nor really have a support system in that way as nobody knows that I do it and I want to keep it that way. I don't associate with other people that do either and I know that will lose friends amongst other things if found out because as soon as anyone hears meth there's an automatic assumption about you. That's true whether anyone likes to hear it or not. Sometimes it's worse when someone finds out that you do meth than doing meth itself I think. I haven't done anything morally wrong to anyone at all but I know that I will be judged. I can have a break for say 2 days and just rest before doing any psychedelics and not mix. But I know of so many trials going on with microdosing etc... And places you can go to get treated in that way so am not using it to replace one drug for another if get me. I'm purely doing it to help me get through a tough time and for my depression. Traditional medicine has never worked and I can't stand to feel depressed anymore. I want to do it the right way and really need to know the best way to do it. Whether microdosing is the way and whether mushrooms or lsd. I've heard many success stories in comparison to normal treatment centres where I hear about high failure rates all of the time. I don't want to put myself in any danger and am also booked in for therapy regarding my depression.

I'm convinced that psychiatry is totally backwards and that only a small percentage ever get better with the help of traditional doctors that mainly give out medications based on kickbacks from big pharma. Me personally have never seen anyone doing great for a long period of time. There is always struggle, change of meds etc... My personal opinion is that doctors and psychiatrists really must know more than they let us know and cannot honestly agree that this system works. I'm meditating, eating well, walking, sleeping well, getting out in nature etc..... If tradition medicine worked then why are there still so many people not well. I think there is a reason microdosing trials are happening all over the place that already should be legalised because I'm pretty sure they know it does work. The side effects of such medicine are plenty and not very nice at all bringing up other health issues and becomes a vicious cycle. I think your body is designed to heal itself. I'm microdosing now and feel better then ever. The horrid side effects of every med I've tried was hell. Maybe it's just me and maybe I'm just venting so sorry. But that's just my take, and just had to say how I feel for once. Thanks for putting up with this long comment. I wish you all the best and hope that they work for sincerely. They both gave me bad side effects but then everything has so yes it may just be me. Much love. Xx", "link_id": "t3_ei1p3r", "time": 1577799357}}

To start you can do guided meditations from YouTube. The suicide hotline will always call services once you ring them. Don't do it not because no matter how much you want to I can just about guarantee that once you try your life will be much worse. Reality is suicide is actually very hard to be successful at. It is very hard to actually do it and you are most likely to come back a vegetable or in a much worse state that you are in now and you will then have to live that way for the rest of your life. I've known people that have jumped off bridges only to survive and have brain injuries etc...  If only for that reason .... Don't do it. It sounds cliche but really it's true that everything is temporary and just like everything this to shall pass. I feel you. Xxxx", "link_id": "t3_egi18c", "time": 1577535955}}
{"fc8i3ni": {"text": "Everyone has a different rock bottom. I'm glad mine didn't include losing everything such as car, home, things I need, not being able to pay bills, or eat etc.... But if I kept going the way I was I would be in that situation unless really I was going to prostitute myself out. I've kept a bit of meth aside that I don't want to touch and I've been putting a little bit into empty gelatin capsules that take in the morning along with a caffeine tablet. Once the capsules are done I'm starting to microdose with lsd. I've done a lot of research and know now exactly how to do it. I've heard wonders on how it helps with depression, addiction as well as other things. I'm starting in a few days. I'm giving up seeing all of my friends that are not a good influence and I know that I'm going to have times of feeling very lonely and want to slip up but I just can't bring myself to spend another wasted cent on the stuff. I'm in Australia and it's damn expensive. I get a gram for $230 or so. The average is around the $250 mark. When I think of all of the things I could have used my money for instead I feel sick. I'm pretty broke now but can still get by. I just refuse to let myself get so stuck that I may not even afford food, or especially not be able to look after my dog. The wasted money has been a joke and I'm embarrassed. I've been pretty well functioning but started onto other drugs as well and found myself hating the feeling of being straight. I've heard nothing but good things about microdosing and hope that it works for me like it has for others. I've come to realize that I'm worth more and if my parents that are no longer alive could somehow see what I've become since they've been gone which is when all of this started I think they would be very upset. So I'm keeping that thought in that I want to make my parents feel proud of me and know that I am doing well without them which is what I would want for my child once I am gone. That's my story anyway. Good luck. Xx", "link_id": "t3_egpwoh", "time": 1577535390}}

{"fc7p50u": {"text": "So sounds a very familiar story. Don't worry about who understand your work. Do something different to make it so enjoy doing it alone from home. Don't ever make your husband your everything. Sometimes when you least expect it something is gone... (Not saying it will). But if it ever does you will be totally way more alone than you feel now. Learn to enjoy your own company. Maybe take up a few crafts..... Go for walks in the park. You always seem to strike up some conversations. Go places where you can just socialise. If you love sitting down with a cup of tea and a piece of cake maybe think of volunteering at an aged care type of facility. Somewhere the elderly are totally alone and would love to sit and chat with someone for a few hours .... Never compare yourself to anyone else.

{"fc118om": {"text": "It is for me. Maybe because I learnt to not be able to really chill. I see my stoner friends just chilling out and can't figure out how they can just be ok with doing nothing. When I do nothing I feel bad as though should be doing something every minute. I've always been a high energy person and don't like drugs that dumb me down. I'm sort of highly strung and feel weird being mellow although got to a point when enjoyed going to bed and just have quiet to drift off. Until I learnt not to if that makes sense. There really isn't any withdrawal. I just look back and wonder what I actually did with all of that time when I was awake and mostly it was useless shit. It just takes a while to sort of feel normal whatever that is in a sense that you use your time much more productively. I've woken up this morning again with no cravings and ok energy. I think I just get used to being at that very high energy pace and hate being chilled. I guess whatever drug people take is kind of personality based if I'm writing this ok as sometimes can't write things down the same as what is in my head. I need to learn that it's ok and normal just to chill. That was hard enough before meth and guess it will be after it.", "link_id": "t3_effn8m", "time": 1577305359}}
