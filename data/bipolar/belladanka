I set my own hours, I make decent money, and I enjoy the freedom of being my own boss. BUT, I'm almost at the 2year mark for the current gig job I'm working. I'm so fed up with how I'm not making the money that I used to, because they've slashed our pay 3 times since I started. I've already applied to other places hoping I can find something else. So, I feel your pain, and I'm right there with you. But, you should look into any gig work in your area, and see if it's something you're interested in. I love what I do, I'm just fed up with the company who doesn't want to pay us a fair livable wage. Other than that, I work when I want to work. I don't have a boss breathing down my neck. I have minimal contact with people. That flexibility is what keeps me doing this type of work. And it's always a good idea to have a few apps to work off of.

So if you were on shift for 4hours, but were only active for 2, they would pay for your idle time. The base delivery charge was $12, plus $.40/item (not unit), $5 bumps for LD(long distance), and $5 LO (large order) for orders over $200 and would increase with every additional $100 spent on that order ($400=$15 LO bump). If it was a club store (Costco, Sam's, etc), that bump ranged from $3-$8 or more. All of this was PER ORDER, NOT BATCH. So, if you got a double, all the above was paid out for EACH order. And tips were great!! (No mileage pay) And NO ONE WAS COMPLAINING.I started at the tail end of the first lawsuit. Got the email if I wanted to get reimbursed, but if you signed, you wouldn't be able to be involved in any following lawsuits. So, I didn't sign.After a few months, once the customer base was developed, they dropped HG. Then a few months later, the delivery base began decreasing slowly week by week. Some zones base delivery got down to $3 per order especially in busy major city zones. That's what triggered for a new pay rate. And it's just gotten worse ever since. This is why veteran shoppers are complaining. This is what every newbie doesn't understand what were fighting for.Over saturation and new shoppers taking these ridiculously low ball batches are hurting our cause to get better pay. When they do this, they're telling the algorithm that it's okay to offer such shit. That someone is desperate enough to chase that $7. And, I forgot to add...

{"ewgqjth": {"text": "The default tip of 5% on a $50 order is $2.50. Instacart is probably only paying the shopper $7-$10 depending on the zone to shop. So, that shopper is only making $9.50 - $12.50 to shop, checkout, bag up, load, deliver, and unload your order. Now take into consideration that if IC is paying $7 to shop your order, and you live 5miles from the store, that's $3 in mileage pay ($.60/mile) that IS included in the $7. So, in all actuality after mileage and tip are subtracted, IC is only paying $4 to have your order shopped and delivered. We don't get the delivery fee, service fee, or any other fees they tack onto your order. And IC is also stealing tips. This is a fact. So tipping in cash is always better. We get taxed on in-app tips at tax time, as well.Now after explaining all of this, what do you think is an appropriate amount to pay someone to do something for an hour (or more) (shopping and drive time), that you can't or are unable to do for yourself?? If you asked someone to do your shopping for you and said you'd pay them for their time, how much would you pay them?? What is their time worth to you?? $4, $10, $25?? Personally, a 10% tip on $50 is $5, and I'd be fine with that. Most shoppers would be to. How you choose to tip your shopper is all up to you. Just take into consideration what I've said here when you place your next order. And if you get great service from your shopper, please rate them 5 stars. IC \"gives\" us $3 per 5star rating that does not come out of your pocket. I hope I've enlightened you on how IC is trying it's hardest to screw their shoppers, and not to mention they're screwing you too, with all the fees and upcharges on certain products. PS...

Long distance and large order bumps are possible, but it's literally hit or miss to make money here. I rarely pick up shifts. There are only 10 shoppers for the zone. The next zone over (I drive about 30min) where I've primarily been working the last couple months since I moved, has a base of $9.10/9.35/9.60, with a club bump of $3, LO &amp; LD bumps too. It's semi-rural, so long drives. I usually stay busy during my shifts (I mainly work sat&amp;sun plus 1 day during the week). I'm ranked 17 out of 41 in this zone, and my speed stays in the 75-80 range. My original zone that I started in is saturated with shoppers now. Last count was around 170, but who knows now. Base is $3 with all the bumps. With my speed, I was mainly getting small, quick batches and worked almost 3 times what I do now to make around the same money. This past week I made $296 in 12active/16online hours and that averages out to $18.50/$24.66 an hour. It would've taken me at least 25-30 hours to make this in my original zone. 5% tips being the same across all zones, but my delivery earnings are higher in my new zone. So for me to drive 30min to a better paying zone is worth it. Fuck, I wish my home zone were busier and more profitable, so I could save some money on gas, but it's not hurting me to bad...yet lol.
