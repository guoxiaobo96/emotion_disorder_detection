{"eyldf7i": {"text": "&gt;  What was alt-right called before? Nazis and Nazi sympathizers.......... What has Lauren Southern said that would make them a Nazi or a Nazi sympathizer?&gt;You yourself just pointed out that a term for a group of Nazi-sympathizers coming to prominence, and Trump's rise to power, occurred at the same time. If that isn't a strong correlation I don't know what is. I stand corrected, actually. The term was coined in November 2008 by Paul Gottfried, in an address to H. L. Mencken Club. Slate reported it, too. Richard Spencer glommed onto the term in 2010. Since 2016 (when Trump became President), it's been used in attempts to disparage anyone who disagrees with Democrats, whether they've been a target of the alt-right or not, whether they've specifically repudiated the alt-right or not. Correlation =/= causation&gt; I can see that you're a social conservative and a fan and defender of Trump...No, I'm not. I'm fiscally conservative and socially moderate-liberal. I support same-sex marriage, legalization of marijuana, and prison reform (among other issues). I wrote letters to my local newspaper and the school board when our school's Title IX compliance officer (the person who's supposed to help LGBTQQIP2SAA students) insulted children who were attending a drag queen story hour at our city's public library. I was also at the event to show support against the white supremacists who threatened to bomb the building and the Catholic hypocrites who protested the event. In the 7 years I've been on Reddit, I just recently started becoming more active so no, you don't know me or my views at all.&gt; Discussion becomes futile when one party doesn't or can't admit to things being fact and would prefer to employ whataboutism. In other words, you're incapable of having an adult conversation with someone who has a difference of opinion than you. I'm curious - how do you function in society being so closed-minded?&gt; We're talking about women internalizing and acting upon their own oppression. The post was commentary on Lauren Southern comparing them to Serena Joy Waterford, a FICTIONAL CHARACTER, with the intent to make a joke and instead of a debate, because apparently we can't have that when two people disagree. \ud83d\ude44&gt; I googled this Lauren Southern once to know what she is about. Just like you claimed to know me and what I'm about from looking at a Reddit profile, right? &gt; I'm not about to give her any more clicks and views or learn any more about her than I have to. Then you probably shouldn't have volunteered to post links to \"educate\" me. You did that BEFORE you Googled her? I thought you already knew all about Lauren?&gt; As it stands right now, she is unimportant to my brain space and to the brain space of society. But you made it a point to comment on this post in the first place, so if Lauren was \"unimportant\" to your \"brain space\", why bother in the first place?&gt; Any person who makes a mockery of transitioning isn't worth any more unneccessary attention than what's already been given. Where or when did Lauren mock transitioning?&gt; So how about you take it upon YOURSELF to post to this show's page and provide evidence that Southern isn't alt-right? But something tells me you're not gonna be able to do that, not with a credible source. I don't need to provide links. The fact of the matter is Richard Spencer is openly alt-right. He relishes it. I've never heard Lauren Southern proclaim themselves alt-right. Ben Shapiro is called alt-right and he's explicitly denied any connection to them. In fact, he's been a target of the alt-right since the election cycle started. He's had death threats from people who are proud to call themselves alt-right. Maybe it's because he's Jewish, maybe it's because he never supported Trump. Where's the proclamation from Lauren Southern that they're alt-right? I haven't been able to find one, but since you know her so well, I'm sure you could provide evidence to back up YOUR claim. Oh wait - you can't have an adult discussion so I guess that's where this ends. Facts are facts. Your hurt feelings aren't facts.

In total, he sexually assaulted 13 girls between the ages of 12 and 17, yet he was only sentenced to 3 years in prison and probation after. You might want to look up his case.   Planned Parenthood of California failed to report the rape of a 13-year-old girl by her father, Edgar Ramirez, after he took her to obtain an abortion under the false pretense that her boyfriend got her pregnant.   Planned Parenthood in Alabama failed to report after a 14-year-old girl had two abortions performed at the clinic four months apart! They didn't obtain proper consent from a guardian as required by Alabama law. All 50 states and the District of Columbia REQUIRE reporting. Planned Parenthood employees and volunteers are mandated reporters. But they're FAILING in their duty.What about the fact that Dayle Steinberg, the president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern PA, KNEW what Kermit Gosnell was doing and did NOTHING?!? She admitted it at Planned Parenthood's 2013 Spring Gala fundraiser, in front of feminist icon Gloria Steinem! Philadelphia Daily News reported it: &gt;Steinberg said that when Gosnell was in practice, women would sometimes come to Planned Parenthood for services after first visiting Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic, and would complain to staff about the conditions there.  &gt;  &gt;\"We would always encourage them to report it to the Department of Health,\" Steinberg said as she sat with Steinem before Tuesday's events.  &gt;  &gt;Of the Gosnell trial, Steinem added: \"It makes more clear why you need Planned Parenthood.\"And spare me the speech about how Planned Parenthood does SO MUCH MORE than abortion.

Columbine happened during my senior year of high school. There had been a school shooting at one of the local high schools in the 70s. I still get a tense feeling in my stomach when I watch the scene because it reminds me how on-edge a lot of us were. I don't imagine it's gotten any better for kids since then.As far as death scenes that were my favorite, it's a tie between Oliver Threadson in Asylum (because Zachary Quinto's acting in that scene is just superb - absolute psychopath) and the hipsters whining about kale in Hotel (they were assholes and deserved it).", "link_id": "t3_brfngk", "time": 1558726836}}

Could always be flashbacks further into the past, maybe to the founding of the orphanage (an explanation for how the land became cursed or something) and flash forwards to a bunch of kids 'legend-tripping' at the site of the old orphanage. A good way to tie it in to other seasons would be to maybe have a child who ends up going to Miss Robichaux's Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies because she starts showing off powers in the orphanage.

I was 11 years old when I had to take a pregnancy test after years of rape from my then step-father. Thankfully, the test was negative but I dread what the whole experience would have been like had it been positive.What bothers me in today's society are the people who protest outside abortion clinics. You don't know what the people going in that clinic are going through, so who are YOU to shame them? On the other side of the spectrum, I really can't stand people who talk about getting an abortion as if it's nothing, just a simple trip to the clinic.
