I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want bipolar to be my \u201cthing.\u201dDuring college I met many friends for the first time who thought my rapid cycling hypomania was a \u201cfun\u201d personality.

Even newer friends who met me full-blown manic believed that\u2019s who I had always been - they had nothing else to go on.The only \u201cmemories\u201d I have are from Snapchat, and it scares me so much to be reminded I was a completely different person who didn\u2019t give a shit what anyone thought or how I looked because I felt so \u201cgood.\u201d Now, sober and sane, I\u2019m trying to lay low while I cope with the fact that some friends only have *those* memories of me.

In general it\u2019s really really bad for you in the long term, and 300 mg is a lot to take every day. If I were you, I would definitely see a psychiatrist before sticking too long with what the hospital prescribed. Seroquel is usually a blanket prescription they give everyone to nip mania in the bud. Unfortunately, many doctors see sedation as treatment when that\u2019s far from the case. It\u2019s important to find the right meds that can offer a reasonable amount of clarity without letting you \u201cfly too high.\u201d Don\u2019t get discouraged, it might take a few tries to settle on the right dose and prescription. But hear me out: your mind will be absolutely FINE. Any grogginess or dissociation you might feel from meds during the interim will not permanently affect you. This should make you feel better\u2013 I have tried practically EVERY medication under the sun:After a series of Lexapro, Effexor and Wellbutrin made me manic, they put me on Lithium, Latuda, Lamictal, Topamax, Risperidone, Seroquel, Trazodone, Vyvanse, Ativan, and more \u2013 all different combos at different times. We just couldn\u2019t figure it out. The closest I came was Lithium; it\u2019s a natural element, like salt, but it has a way of calming manic symptoms without affecting depression. You just have to drink a lot of water because it\u2019s hard on the kidneys lol. Lithium might have to be paired with Lamictal or Latuda for greatest efficacy - they call it the 3 L\u2019s. Their side effects aren\u2019t bad at all. I really liked Lamictal + Lithium alone  (because Latuda can be expensive). I have an aunt who takes Lamictal (an anti-convulsant, not antipsychotic) for migraines and she is a brilliant- and I mean BRILLIANT - veterinarian, mom and teacher. Anticonvulsants help the left and right brain hemispheres communicate better with less \u201cmisfirings.\u201d But these are just ideas. Your psychiatrist (not from the ER) can help figure out what\u2019s best for you. Keep in mind, treating mania will feel like depression at first because technically you *are* going down. The tricky part is getting it to a stable level, not feeling too high or too low. DBT is a wonderful type of therapy to work in conjunction with medication as you find your way back to stability. I\u2019m not currently on medication but have found other ways to self-regulate. It was almost like the meds reminded me how I should feel after I had spent so much time in extreme states, I forgot what normal felt like. Now I remember! I managed to graduate with all A\u2019s and a job offer even in a dark state. Don\u2019t let the fear get into your head. Most people have plain depression, just think of it as two-sided depression. Most people just have \u201cup\u201d to go, but we have to be careful to stay in the middle.If anyone\u2019s brain is damaged from medication, mine would be! But it\u2019s not. You\u2019ll be absolutely fine. Don\u2019t get discouraged, and feel free to come at me with other questions. My DMs are open.", "link_id": "t3_clngxt", "time": 1564945334}}

Here are some things that have helped me get through these \u201cseasons\u201d in the past:1. Fake it til you make it \u2014 actively use affirmative thoughts to convince yourself you are fine, even when your mind is telling you something\u2019s off. When dp happens, your mind\u2019s eye is out of sync with your actual eyes. Don\u2019t reinforce the idea that you\u2019re anything but okay, don\u2019t entertain these thoughts. Greet them, but don\u2019t let them stay for tea. 2. Distract yourself in order to ground yourself. Instead of focusing on how \u201cweird\u201d you feel, focus on an activity, ideally full-body or fine motor, sensory and outdoors. Build legos, do a puzzle, tend to plants, walk around barefoot in the grass, color a coloring book, practice your autograph or flip through old photo albums (these are good ones to reinforce your personal identity). Don\u2019t give yourself time to \u201cthink\u201d about how you feel or should feel, just feel what you\u2019re doing.3.

The fact that you\u2019re able to describe what\u2019s going on and realize that something doesn\u2019t feel right is a very good sign. A lot of people lose themselves entirely and never realize it. But you\u2019re not too far gone. Right now there\u2019s a dissonance between who you feel you presently are and who you think you used to be. This could be for a handful of environmental reasons but most likely you have some neurotransmitters out of order. Our brains are in charge of how we feel, how we behave and how we perceive everything (including ourselves). They\u2019re in charge of our ego and identity as well as our motivation to keep up that \u201cself.\u201d Ignoring it and pretending you\u2019re fine is not the solution, but neither is overthinking it. In the past, you didn\u2019t compare yourself to a previous self, or think twice about enjoying things (at least not as much), right? So this multilayered approach isn\u2019t going to feel natural. But what you can do is take care of yourself, talk to people, even if that means a therapist. Keep putting yourself out there and don\u2019t let your thoughts fester alone for too long. \u201cFake it til you make it\u201d sounds like horrible advice until it actually works. Don\u2019t keep telling yourself how much you\u2019ve \u201cchanged,\u201d or reinforce these thoughts \u2013 really, they\u2019re just thoughts \u2013 by entertaining them. This will make it much easier to slide back into normalcy and feeling like yourself. Excessive self-reflection creates distortions when you\u2019re not bouncing your thoughts healthily off of others. It\u2019s a good idea to hang around friends, as long as they make you feel good about yourself. What is lost can always be found, especially when it\u2019s you.

Lithium may help parts of the bipolar brain but even more so it is poison to the kidneys and liver-- this is rarely disclosed to patients; the doctors make the secret decision for them that the tradeoff between dialysis in 15 years is worth it if their patient would just stop talking so much so he can take a lunch break, or whatever.

My boss is bipolar, my aunt is bipolar, one of my friends is bipolar. Although it should be enough that I experience it first hand (??). Believe it or not I appreciate the ability to experience life at both poles. I couldn't possibly explain it in words as words would limit; but I do try. The amount of breakthroughs and paradigm shifts I experience in a week is crazy cool, and it makes me sad when I realize the world isn't ready to accept certain things, but that's okay (for now). As a mentally strong person--*from the horror stories in this sub clearly not everyone is*-- I am able to appreciate and experience life more fully, instead of getting caught up or tangled in all the stereotypical negatives this sub seems to apply to everyone with bipolar. You'll refuse to believe me and I don't really care because I'm not trying very hard, but any outsider's take on the firsthand experience of bipolar disorder is irrelevant because it's impossible to understand if you haven't experienced the beautiful mindfuckery of a changing conscious experience thru polar shifts (which again-- some people can't handle so it manifests as dysfunction. But the dysfunction *you* perceive is just a side effect of their refusing to self-soothe or get ahold of his/herself). It is frustrating that it is so much more than most will ever know --including you, as someone who just *knows* someone with bipolar. Again, I feel lucky that I'm in a position to analyze and understand the experience because (until last year) I haven't been bogged down by stigma or the awareness that other people would classify my mental acuity, charisma, creativity and occasional existential depression as just part of a sickness. I grew up treasuring the gifts I was given, never once thinking I was broken or being treated like I was. I think that's one reason that all your SOs are suffering-- because they are made to feel that they are stuck with a bad, nasty thing and that they feel crazy or broken in your eyes. Keep in mind this is usually subconscious-- I know you would *neeever* reduce them just to whatever you expect and subsequently perceive. Bipolar or no bipolar, I am a deep thinker and self-soother.

The problem when you contribute to a community cesspool of negative bipolar associations--on a media site which is accessed by thousands of people reinforcing the association between \"bipolar\" and \"hard to deal with,\" marketed not toward actual people with bipolar, but for their neurotypical SOs to chit chat and crowdsource whiny stories between strangers online (if they're all \"begging for help\" as they claim, they need professional help rather than advice from faceless amateur internet users). It is a fact that enumerated in the name of the sub is the term \"bipolar,\" containing a thread full of miserable stories.

It's not only unattractive, it's repellent. But that's not what matters. Most importantly, *you* will have to live with whichever version of yourself you choose to reinforce. So please don't value the opinions of unstable, self-involved pubescents on tumblr. They are *so* irrelevant, I don't know how to make it clearer. You seem like you have a lil bit of emotional maturing to do and I wish you the best of luck.

Not to mention my psychiatrist thinks I'm BPD! Hahah. So I humbly understand and acknowledge your suffering. But I have found that humor changes my entire perspective. It has made my shoulders feel lighter, like the weight of the world doesnt balance on them or anyone's opinions of 'em. People aren't porcelain dolls, which are picture-perfect but no fun at all, because they're so breakable. I'd rather be a funny, confident, cool girl who is attractive because of those qualities. Being pretty is easy. It's not rare or impressive. While I'm sure you are gorgeous(!!), it will be so much more worthwhile to carve out your unique psyche-- metacognitive habits, self-assurance, humble confidence, creative expression. Therapy might also be beneficial.

{"drqx44s": {"text": "Sure, *your* bouts pass. But giving an example of your this-too-shall-pass attitude and it-gets-better experience does not mean it gets better for everyone. I'm bipolar as hell and no medication works for me, besides heavy sedatives. But that makes it even more impossible to function. My brain is either freezing cold on fire, or both, and it is always going to be this way. I suffer from depressive realism as a result of my brain \"exercising\" quadruple-time. I've seen and experienced enough of the world, as well as detached myself from my ego enough to see things exactly as they are, instead of romanticizing them or attaching emotion, and that clarity is excruciating. Especially because on the outside, this endless influx of information looks like psychosis on the outside and people dismiss me because of my diagnosis- \"oh she's just bipolar.\" I shouldn't have to suffer through this every day or alternatively, kill myself violently. I wish I had a less active brain so I could enjoy life, but it's just not gonna happen. I'm 21 years old but I feel like I'm 70. I'm ready to go and I'm in so much pain every day. I'd rather die peacefully than keep suffering and being alienated and misunderstood. It's gotten progressively worse over the past 2 years and the more my brain develops, the more intense my thoughts and broader my understanding will be, although it feels like \"the worst\" every time. I thought it was bad last year, but it's 100x worse now. I can't imagine how bad it'll be next year. This level of awareness is so debilitatingly complex that human language convey it without limiting it- and that is the loneliest, most painful feeling. Human bodies weren't designed to think this much, of course we have a growing depression and anxiety problem. I only ever attempt to explain it to my mom, so if I ever do kill myself she'll know I did it for a good and logical reason, and not just another bipolar statistic. Smaller minds will assume I'm delusional/pretentious. No one will ever understand unless we trade consciousness. The GP's brains are functioning at a much lower level, and I ENVY them because it allows them to find satisfaction in the curiosity and mystery of the world. Look at society and keep telling yourself that with a catered-to majority, the standard of functioning society *isn't* simple enough for the simplest of majority minds. But of course I just sound frenzied and pretentious. And I'm so sorry for that, but I'm even sorrier to myself because it further confirms to me that no one will ever understand as I do. And I'm not saying I'm a genius--I'm terrible at math and science, most physical and blindly-accepted things, but I understand how the GP's motives and minds work, as well as abstract concepts. I'm so dissatisfied with the world, one that is catered to simpletons, therefore reaffirming and enforcing simple awareness and training new generations to be simple. My brain hurts, I can't write anymore. I don't even know why I'm trying to explain it. Merry Christmas tho!!", "link_id": "t3_7m0tgc", "time": 1514228124}}

{"dptuwsx": {"text": "I'm not gonna PM you. I want to make sure people who see your comment see why it's wrong. It is true. Trying to fix \"institutional racism\" by distinguishing which races deserve extra credit will not work, it will only serve to  segregate us further. Affirmative action is undoubtedly unfair and outright wrong. To assume that all blacks have it worse off than all whites is called mass self-victimization, and it's not representative of reality. Just because you're white doesn't mean you have it better off: No guaranteed access to education or healthcare, or whatever you think only affects the black population (most of these complaints are entirely subjective and based on the assumption that white people are collectively racist). To assume we all have white privilege is to generalize a race, which is inherently racist. That fact was published online but the research was done in person- at the polling booths. All the sources said Hillary was going to win because liberals have made it a goal to outcast Trump voters from society, calling them racists and homophobes and misogynists. Trump voters were too scared to come out and tell the truth without being ostracized so of course the numbers were skewed. It's a mortal sin to support the president in this country, which is madness. I'm glad there was a silent majority, so everyone felt a little less alone. And do I look a singular black person in the eye and assume they're trying to overstep me? No, of course I give them the benefit of the doubt as an individual. But I can guarantee they wouldn't actively denounce the Black Panthers group because they can get away with it. People I've spoken to have NO issue with the Black Panthers, or Malcom X. In class we are taught that they were \"brave revolutionaries\" (while violently enforcing Black Nationalism). We are seriously overcorrecting this slavery thing. Like a weeble wobble: going too far one way, then too far the other way, when we should be in the middle (because it will keep going back and forth, which is why white nationalists are using this anti-white rhetoric to spread their platform. We can't let this happen either).Yes, I'm in college. I have first-hand witness to the minds and ideas of my peers. These young people's minds are going to replace older minds soon enough. Which is a terrifying thought, because I know how self-righteous, assuming, self-obsessed, self-victimizing and small-minded these millennials are. It's terrifying that we are going to lead the nation some day. Even the landscape of commoners is becoming a dangerous place to be any race, but especially white (because the narrative is now against them- because they \"deserve it\" and \"can handle it\"). I cannot believe you're blaming me for being made fun of- you're assuming all whites think their culture is the default. Why shouldn't you assume that of all cultures? Your thinking is very America-centric. People in Africa and Indonesia see their culture as the default, because that's how they were raised. Is it only a sin for white people to be proud of their culture? \"Every other ethnicity should celebrate their culture and see it as the default, but whites- no. That's racist.\" I never thought my race was better than anyone else's, and for you to assume so is racist (but you think you can get away with it because I'm white). Do you see where I'm getting at?\"Poking fun\" at my pale skin, my lips, calling my race tacky and cultureless would not be called \"poking fun\" if I were any other race. I have never made fun of dreadlocks or rap culture, because if I did, I would be called a racist. On the opposite hand, white people are worshiping both of those things nowadays- so of course there's a problem with that too (cultural appropriation). You are the perfect example of voluntary blindness to overcorrecting against whites. Because you refuse to see whites as anything but the villain. You prefer to blame us for everything and allow us to be bullied by minorities because \"we're the real bullies.\"I have ceased my friendship with the Hispanic group because they were so explicitly racist against white people; the comments never ever stopped, even when I called them out. They were claiming the same things you are. Tearing down whites with insults is \"poking good fun,\" and praising minorities because they deserve extra credit. Who's to say who deserves what? To implement, it would require a LOT of hasty generalizations. It's wrong even though it must feel good to use whites as a punching bag for your grievances. For minorities to give us a taste of our own medicine!!! Yeah!!!I'm not superior to anyone else. I will never support white people more than another race. I will never be \"pro-white\" or exclusively \"root for whites.\" So when someone claims to be \"pro-black\" and exclusively root for blacks or people who look like them, we gotta problem.

{"dckk09z": {"text": "Hi Molly! I'm so sorry for the way you've been feeling. You are not alone in any of it. Sometimes feeling numb is worse than feeling anguish. Something that really helped me was meditation. There are several podcasts that guide you through and often help you fall asleep! You also could find some interesting ones about topics you like. For example I love true crime! It's so interesting. My favorites are \"Astonishing Legends,\" \"Generation Why\" and \"Serial.\" Those can get kind of dark but there are other podcasts you can find on the app store or podbay.com that are funny and lighthearted. If not that, then find something you are really really interested in. Reddit is great for that, so is tumblr, pinterest, etc. It may sound silly but more than anything I'd suggest researching buddhism and zen. I don't view it so much as a religion but as a way of thinking and life. I suddenly realized that I was in control of my happiness, and that I don't need to let anything get to me. Allow your feelings to flow through you instead of linger. Good and bad. Your soul is always there. You don't need to strive for extreme happiness all the time, that can be quite unattainable. People get in bad moods, it's a fact. But if you strive for blissful contentment through positivity and resilience to negative situations, you absolutely can feel good most (if not all) of the time. Another trick I learned is to get up in the morning, shower and get dressed. Put on a little makeup and comb your hair. While I was depressed I stayed in my pajamas and lied on the couch for weeks until my hair got in these MASSIVE, gnarly, tangled knots. Also, when you walk, keep a pace. Walk confidently and strut in a way. Don't act like you give two fucks, and people will look up to you and you will in turn feel better about yourself. It sounds silly but it works! In addition, I'd suggest talking to your doctor or psychiatrist. Maybe talk therapy would be good for you, but I'm not sure if you already are doing that. I would also talk to your doc about perhaps upping or lowering your dose? I'm no expert so please do not take my word for it, but this could genuinely be a matter of chemicals in your brain. For example, I love Effexor! Honestly I feel so balanced in a way that inspires me to be creative and express myself without feeling anxious or glum. My serotonin was completely messed up for a long time and I always felt so shitty and teary. I only ever looked forward to sleep because I could escape my consciousness for a little while. The world felt like too much. But remember, it always gets better. I thought I was brain damaged for good, but that was not the case. The human brain is so resilient! Take your vitamins and eat fruits and make things. Make art and put it on your walls. Browse pinterest for DIY ideas and keep in mind that you are just as much part of this universe as anyone else. The secret that most people don't understand - is being aware of it. I have a quote on my wall, \"DO NOT FEEL LONELY, THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS INSIDE YOU.\" And it's true. There are so many ways to feel better and more adjusted to belonging to this planet. I completely understand the darkness you're in. I promise that with the right measures and the right mindset, you will be healed.
