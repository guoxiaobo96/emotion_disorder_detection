{"dbv9005": {"text": "TL;DR Don't let not having a formal teacher stop you from picking up an instrument. You can learn almost anything on the Internet.__________________________I held off from answering because I thought I was not the best person for the question, but now that I think of it I have both taken lessons and been self-taught. I think the absolute best method, in the end, is just to go for it and learn it. We live in an age with so many great resources on the Internet (websites, YouTube, etc), there's no real reason you can't do it. Don't let not having a formal teacher stop you from picking up an instrument. In fact, in my harp lessons, we used a book called \"teach yourself to play the folk harp.\"Now that I got that out of the way, I can say everybody has different learning styles. I took guitar, piano, and harp (oh and voice lessons) through a teacher,  but my parents put me in those classes because I had already started teaching myself and writing music.  I could have learned all of that stuff through the Internet (for piano, things like intervals and scales, etc. For guitar, things chords and how to place your hand on the neck of the guitar, etc. For harp, things like posture and harmonics, etc. For voice, different vocal exercises to expand your range and tone, etc.). But I probably wouldn't have at first (I would've been totally in my own narrow world of ideas of how to do music).  If you're motivated, you will.  I loved learning myself and figuring things out as I went along. Eventually I might have wanted to learn on the Internet the things I learned in lessons. I still consider it well worth the money, granted I didn't pay it, haha. Voice was my very first self-taught instrument, and I actually didn't start singing until I was 15. I didn't take lessons until after my first album was released, but it totally changed the way I could control my voice. However, I attribute the sweet and raw tone of my voice to the fact that I didn't have lessons when I was first starting to sing. I would not have had the same voice that people love. If you've got a natural gift for singing, I might hold off on voice lessons until you really explore who you are as a singer. Then use voice lessons as a supplement to give you tools to change your tone if you want. But at least at that point it'll be a choice. Any other instrument, I consider it worth it to have a professional walk you through it, but it is not necessary based on all the resources we have these days.", "link_id": "t3_5lej5t", "time": 1483284014}}

Then why am I so fucking sedated on it?\"But worse than the sleepiness is the bland feeling... I'm not really happy. I'm sliiiightly depressed (no suicidal thoughts or anything), but just like \"ehh... I'll just live my quotidian existence until death, whatever.\" It's awful. So what I did a few weeks ago was stopped taking abilify altogether, and I have never felt better. Sleeping 7-8 hours a night, feeling more joy, no mood swings. I just told my pdoc that I did this and I can tell she's pretty concerned, but this is my life, man.

{"dacd9px": {"text": "Just my experience:When I got my first diagnosis, I didn't believe it and wanted a second opinion. It took forever to find a psychiatrist who would see me without me being already seen by a therapist in their same office (some stupid rule in USA perhaps). I called, told the receptionist that I was looking for a second opinion on a diagnosis of bipolar, and the appointment was scheduled. When I went in, I assume the psychiatrist was told I was looking for a second opinion because he immediately launched in to a stream of questions (have you ever felt this? have you ever done that?) as well as asking me about my life growing up. He was very throughout, asked a lot more than my first pdoc, and listened to a lot more context than she did. He confirmed the diagnosis. He also knew the clinic that I was already going to, and made a joke about how they waaaay over-diagnose  ADD/ADHD over there and it's a miracle I got out of there without that diagnosis.My only regret is that I wish I didn't tell the receptionist that I was diagnosed with bipolar, because I don't know if the psychiatrist was \"looking for that\" when he asked his questions. He seemed really professional, so probably not, but whatever. Your psychiatrist may very well ask why you're there to see him/her, and you can say whatever you think is necessary. There really should be no under-sharing with someone dealing with your brain. Although I'd probably keep pdoc 1's name confidential.Now, about leaving your current pdoc for the new one if you like him/her better... I got no advice for you. I want to leave my current one for anyone else, but I don't want to hurt her feelings. Yep. Go ahead, make fun of me. I did, however, leave my first therapist for another therapist in the same office. I just called the office and said I wanted to see X therapist instead of Y therapist (I did research on who I wanted to see), and they gave me a LOT of push back, but I kind of insisted (and implied that I'd just go to a different clinic), so they did it. I didn't tell Y therapist at all. I just never rescheduled with her. I've seen her around the office once or twice, and it's incredibly embarrassing, but that was over two years ago that I left her so she probably doesn't even care/remember.My biggest advice: if you're looking for a second diagnosis, say as little as you can about it at first, until they evaluate you. Then you can tell them every detail about your current treatment and everything and see what they have to say. Also, remember that these people probably have SO many clients that they will hardly care if you choose someone else. They may wonder about it for a while, but they'll get over it fast.Sorry this is so long, but if you have any other questions, definitely don't hesitate to ask!", "link_id": "t3_5egu8f", "time": 1479907531}}

I also discovered that I was demisexual through private browsing on the internet out of frustration (for me, I googled a lyric from one of my favorite bands that summed up how I felt exactly: \"the truth is I can't be aroused unless I'm in love.\") I also have been asked by multiple people if I'm asexual, but knew that couldn't be the case because I've felt fierce sexual desire (if only a few times in my whole life). I'm married to a man who is on the opposite spectrum from me. I won't go into detail about that to protect his privacy, but believe me when I say we are polar opposites. I've written in my journal how I feel like I'm a different species and that no one else on earth shares my values when it comes to sex and love. It's a painful place to be. On the one hand, I don't believe there's anything wrong with being sexually aroused by strangers, yet when it happens to my husband, it is devastating. I don't trust any of his female friendships. I don't trust his intentions. It's awful.I don't have many answers for you, but I will say that in recent weeks/months his sexuality has normalized for me. I realized this is partly an issue of trust. Do I trust that he would never cheat on me? Yes. And, yes, It still feels like emotional cheating that he has sexual fantasies about strangers, but I have to remind myself that it means nothing to him. He can't control who he's sexually attracted to. I would never fantasize about a stranger, but that doesn't mean he's bad for doing it. He's not trying to hurt me. He loves only me. I think that's what it comes down to. We have to keep telling ourselves that sexual attraction for non-demis is not love. It's nowhere near it. It's really hard for us to grasp that.

It can take years to find the right fit for you, and I'm still in that process. Just remember that you are in control of starting and stopping treatment. Bipolar is only a problem if it is negatively affecting your life, which it sounds like it may be. You may have some friends who can recommend good counsellors. The hardest part of living with bipolar is sticking with treatment - you go when you're feeling bad, and then stop when you're feeling good. I'd encourage you to write down what you feel when you feel bad, that way if you're seeking treatment and decide you don't need help anymore because you feel good, you can look at your list and make a judgement on if you're willing to go back to that.

My best friend (who is the most outgoing, spontaneous, awesome person) has often texted/called me and said \"WE'RE HANGING OUT AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT!\" Her personality really helps to draw me out and makes me feel at ease.

Then once I start swinging down, my friends will invite me out but I'll be too bummed out to go... And then when I actually want to hang out with them again, they've all kind of given up on asking me :( It takes time and maturity to learn how to balance all of that.I guess the bottom line is this: having bipolar isn't an excuse to blow off your friends.

{"cnhtwyh": {"text": "I take 200mg of Lamictal. I can't tell you how much the quality of my life has improved! Yes, my highs are capped (New Year's Eve is definitely a different experience when you're medicated) But overall, my work performance has been wonderful (my managers had always said the reason they wouldn't promote me is because I'm \"not consistent\" - and this was before my diagnosis!).It took a while to find the right dose (and I'm not positive we're 100% there yet), and I had a hard time sticking with it. It's the kind of thing where at first you'll still experience some minor highs and be like \"wow!! The meds are really working, it's amazing!!\" and then something will happen (you get a little too impulsive, or super irritable) and you feel like the meds did nothing and it's all hopeless. Or you'll feel boringly even-keeled, and start craving the highs. It's a long process; stick with it!!I'd say every single day is like a tiiiny little high - I get more stuff done, I'm happier (and not irritable as f***), my creativity hasn't died (which was my main concern, as I'm a musician), my delusions and psychosis have - for the most part - faded away. Yay!Honestly..... looking back at my life before meds: Yes, charming, creative/quick-witted; had a sharp, intellectual mind; but I was also, at times, NOT a part of reality (whether because of depression or euphoria or psychosis or delusions). I feel bad that I was so removed from life for so long...TL;DR: Lamictal has made a HUGE positive impact on my life, both in my experience, and in the opinion of those around me.", "link_id": "t3_2rogwz", "time": 1420675609}}

Feijoada is a staple of Brazilian cuisine. Those three are \"real meals\" not just snacks.Some really easy things to make from home (but not really full meals like the stuff above):1. Tapioca. My grandmother made these for us in a frying pan - melt some butter in a pan, sprinkle a layer of tapioca (cassava flour), put in a filling (like cheese), and fry it up! This recipe looks like how we did it: http://www.instructables.com/id/Brazilian-Tapioca/2. Brigadeiros. I make these at home all the time! Cook up some butter, condense milk, and nesquik (I use nesquik, but you can probably use whatever). Recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/brigadeiro/3. Pastel. My mom has made this for us as kids! I think she just used wonton wraps that you can get at the store. Fry those up with some oil in a pan with some fillings (cheese, meat, etc). They're so crispy and delicious!Oh and make sure to have some Guaran\u00e1 if it's available in your area (Antarctica or Kuat are my favorite brands).

Thank you all!And yes to the hallucinations - mostly giant bugs peripherally crawling away, lots of silver slashes and bubbles, I hear strangers talking about me (sometimes by name), I've seen an \"extra-dimensional portal\" swirl into existence a few times, felt myself being poked and pinched and a hand brushing down my back, lately I'll hear my name being called by a ton of different people.

{"cm5mww1": {"text": "Hey there! First off, congrats on being engaged! That is awesome :)Just a bit of backstory: I grew up as a homeschooled kid to mystic-spiritual artist/musician parents in Los Angeles, so my mood swings and delusions (even hallucinations) were unnoticed/overlooked for almost my entire life until I went to college and had to join the working world. I've been married for 6 months (as of yesterday), and my biggest struggle has been feeling like a burden to my husband. We only just found out about the whole bipolar thing a couple months ago. It has caused a lot of guilt in me because I feel like he didn't sign up for this craziness. I feel like he sees me as exhausting, or that he gets exhausted from dealing with me as we try to figure out which meds work.So, things that have helped me pertaining to your first question: a) Let your fiancee know that you love being a part of this with her, and that you love listening to her. (I need constant reassurance of this).b) Another thing you can do (or, rather, not do) is ask her is she's having an episode whenever she is enthusiastic or angry (or any emotion). Never do this! It is seriously SO infuriating! I'm sure you don't do that, but I had to say it anyway :)As for the second question:a) She can try maintaining a steady sleep schedule. Definitely try to get enough sleep. It can be rough when you're depressed because you may oversleep like crazy :( Moderating sleep is an important part of health.b) Try to eat healthy! I've been juicing every morning, staying away from junky food as much as I can, and drinking TONS of water. I do believe it has a positive effect on my whole day.One thing I would like to say to YOU is that the stress/pain/struggle does not last forever. If she's committed to taking her meds (ones that work), it doesn't have to be a struggle. Hang in there!", "link_id": "t3_2mmb79", "time": 1416280461}}
