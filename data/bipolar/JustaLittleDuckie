The label is simply grouping your symptoms together and giving them a title as others also experience these symptoms and they too have this disorder.\" Very simple. But I still question if I am just a loser doing this to myself... for fun? I don't know why.If you are looking for a smoking gun, you aren't going to find it. If you go into my google account and type \"bipolar\", you will find the first 10 pages of links are purple as I have read them all. I searched for that one article or blog post that would show me a person who has the exact experience I have with the exact diagnosis. Some articles have come close and honestly I find it so validating. But I have also found articles that are so off base that it makes the questioning. There is no smoking gun. You will not find an article that completely describes you because it effects all of us differently. For example, I am a shy and orderly person. My manic periods do not immediately appear manic to an outsider. But the behaviors I display, for me, are manic, when for a naturally outgoing person would appear like a normal day. When I am manic, I find it necessary to wave at all of my neighbors and shout hello across the street when on any other day I completely ignore them.Depending on your income, region and insurance, you may be able to utilize your local Mental Health Department.

{"cwqt13v": {"text": "My story is a bit long, I hope you don't mind:At age 4, my mom took me to a psychiatrist. I don't remember much. I remember finger painting and playing. My mom started to give me a pill at night and said I had an \"overactive imagination\". I remember being very shy, horrible vulgar nightmares and I hated bedtime because I was so scared. I slept with my parents until I was 7 and they started locking the door.At 12, I wrote notes down in my daily school agenda to reflect my mood. I found it fascinating that my mood changed dramatically in a matter of days. So I jotted down smiley faces or \"I want to kill myself\" out of curiosity.At 13, I was very suicidal. My mom told me that it was normal hormones and I was being dramatic. I confided in a friend at school (she found me crying in a book room) and she told a teacher. The school MANDATED my mom take me to a psychiatrist NOW! and my mom was pissed she had to take time off work. The psychiatrist saw me 3 times. On the third time I had done well on a test, I was happy, and she basically said goodbye.At 14, I was suicidal again and my mom told me to go to my room.At 15, I made a collage of violent images and text. My mom asked me if I was \"ok\", I said I was, and the subject was dropped.At 16, I begged my mom to take me and she was very angry, but took me. I was on Paxil for 3 months but she never took me for follow ups and stopped refilling the meds. Manic depressant was mentioned but I assumed it meant \"super bad depression\".I avoided school as much as I could. I faked sick and lied a lot. At 18, senior year, I had 67 unofficial truancies. I drank a lot. Still graduated.At 18, I moved to Arizona and did a lot of embarrassing stuff that I choose to forget.At 19, I moved back home, and married my highschool boyfriend. Baby born at 21 and 22. Divorced at 24. Remarried at 27, baby born at 27. From 19-27, I worked at the same company. A lot of weird emotional outbursts, attempts to revolutionize the company with some wild idea I had with a 6 day no-sleep binge followed by weeks of deep depression. This company listed me as \"mentally unstable\" which now makes sense because I was. Or, I am.I am 30 now. I sought treatment again 4 months ago after I spent several days obsessed with a wild business idea and was ready to quit my job and school, and then crashed down and became suicidal again. I was laid off. I came across an article on Bipolar 2 and everything clicked.Currently I am seeing a psychiatrist once a week, have been diagnosed with bp2 and GAD but my new psychologist believes I may be Schizoaffective-Bipolar.Anxiety, panic attacks, delusions, hallucinations, depression, intrusive thoughts, paranoia, hypomania, insomnia... most of it started when I was in puberty, some earlier, some later.No drugs, ever. No arrests. No hospital admissions. Most do not know I have anything. I am seen as quirky, eccentric, intelligent and moody, but my disorder is well hidden due to my parents encouraging me to \"knock it off\". My current husband is my universe. Also, I feel that I am somewhat more stable now as I am simply a stay at home mom. For the last 3 years I have been a full time student while also working full time. It was a whirl of dramatic breakdowns, depression, and hypomanic days. Now I just hang out with my toddler, obsessively clean, and attend my appointments. I have no idea wtf my plan is now. Every job I have had has told me I am mentally unstable. My grades fluctuate with my moods so getting into grad school is very unlikely and not really desired at this point.My psychiatrist says because I was not supported in childhood with my issues, I learned to hide it all, and everything is now surfacing in a very raw way. She says I am \"lower functioning\" than I appear because I have gotten so good at pretending to be normal. But, get to know me better, spend time with me, and it is very apparent that I am low functioning.At this moment I am drinking cold coffee, going to begin my daily cleaning routine and then see my psychiatrist at 3pm.

{"cwiidom": {"text": "My family has never been supportive of me. When I had anxiety as a child they told me I had an over active imagination, like I was bored and intentionally finding things to worry about. They have essentially always blamed me. So in turn, I have always blamed myself. I am slowly learning not to. I got my diagnosis 4 months ago and felt validated so I was hoping that maybe with a diagnosis they would finally recognize that I genuinely have a problem. Instead I have gotten eye rolls and asked repeatedly when I will be jumping back in to school/work. Me not working is simply unacceptable and that was what my sister was going at. I really appreciate your perspective and it has inspired me to reconsider my future a bit. I think I will take baby steps. I don't want to take this diagnosis and roll over like \"Welp, I'm sick. Thats it. I will just sit on the couch and mope.\" so getting back out there is probably what I should plan for.But also knowing my history is important to. Outbursts, spotty attendance, not being able to get out of the car to go, being so hyper my coworkers tease me about the drugs I took, etc. I am thinking maybe a small volunteer job to start.I don't want to just roll over. But I am not going to go from 12 hour days of insanity, get a diagnosis, and then climb back on the horse like nothing happened. My grades are not too good, I have a lot of damage to repair. My career is pretty shot now that I look back and see how many bridges I have burned.The comment about rubbing it in people's faces is not out of nowhere. When I was 19, I had a heat related seizure. A saw a neurologist who set up tests for Multiple sclerosis. About a week later the results came back that I didn't have it. But, during that week we were all at Grandma's, the dishes needed to be done and I made one sarcastic comment about how I can't because of my \"disability\". It was meant to be funny, but I have never lived it down. My mom and sister routinely reference how I used MS as a \"crutch\" even though it was one sarcastic comment 10 years ago. So I am sure in my sisters mind, \"Here Duckie goes again, getting out of work by using an excuse of a diagnosis\". I am not a hypochondriac and I do not excuse myself from work because I am lazy or whatever. So I think she has it in her mind that I have found an excuse to be lazy and I doubt my family will ever recognize that I actually struggle with issues I don't make up for fun with my \"over active imagination\" and I don't use it as a crutch.I would love for them to recognize I struggle and always have, I don't want to be like this, I am trying, and I can't \"just stop\", \"just relax\" and \"stop stressing\". I doubt they will ever meet me in the middle, ever. But, I will meet them in the middle by having a plan and goal, but I doubt that will be enough.I never talk about my issues, I never even say anything about bipolar or anxiety or panic attacks, ever. We all just pretend it doesn't exist like we all have done since I first had issues starting at the age of 4.

It is not what you expected. You may not pursue the dreams you once had or you do but they don't turn out how you had planned. The secret is that we all feel that way too. And we all really don't have too much of an idea what we are doing exactly. In math, you could flip to the back of the book and find some answers but you really can't do that when you're adulting. The adult life I have is not what I planned out at 16. A lot of people reminisce back to their teen years because it was so free of burdens, stress and difficulties. I know I do.

When I asked her about bipolar she said I didn't have it because I had no drug abuse or criminal record. I was set up with a pdoc. He saw me for 10 minutes and basically told me the same.

With that organized box, I know it is simply in my generic make-up and I don't blame myself as much.I never really knew my father though my mom has always told me he was bipolar, as were both of his parents. My hypomania is sometimes euphoric but sometimes just all consuming anxiety. I come up with these huge life altering plans and I just know I am a genius, nothing can stop me.

It feels nice to have everything explained, but dealing with the guilt that maybe I have just done this to myself is overwhelming.My psychiatrist has expressed that I am much lower functioning than I appear because I have been suppressing everything my whole life due to embarrassment and my mom's tendency to push away my issues.

{"cvuuk9e": {"text": "I always thought I had depression but was diagnosed with bioolar 2 a few months ago. I have done extensive research on this and read several books.Bp2, specifically, is almost always mistaken as major depressive disorder at first. This is because the depression phases are almost identical. The only differences is in bp depression the (1) person often oversleeps and feels like they want to, and could sleep for a thousand years, (2) the person overeats, especially carbohydrates, (3) the person feels like their body weighs 800 pounds and (4) the person's mood is reactive and will improve when something good happens. These are all symptoms of atypical depression which is MORE common in bipolar and LESS common in \"regular\" depression.Also, there is almost always a comorbid condition that accompanies bipolar. Anxiety disorder, panic disorder, OCD, ADHD, PTSD, etc. Personally, I have 2 of them and am borderline 2 of them. Hypomania can be easily overlooked. You may overlook it and even your family could. Who doesn't deserve a few days of a good mood when you deal with depression, right? Also, hypomania can manifest itself in other ways such as irritability or anxiety. Sometimes mine is a week of huge debilitating anxiety with a panic attack or two thrown in for good measure.There are soft signs of bipolar which indicate that you have a higher likelyhood of bipolar. This includes 1st degree relatives with bipolar, earliest age of onset of depression, and your reaction to antidepressants.No one on here can tell you yes or no. You can research a bit and read, go to your doctor and be fully assessed. One common tool they use is the Mood Disorder Questionnaire, which is available online. It is a small piece to the puzzle so getting a positive or negative should not be seen as anything close to a diagnosis. ", "link_id": "t3_3o7hyl", "time": 1444492326}}

The biggest help to me outside of seeking medical attention has been researching and reading books. I have learned a lot and now know what is happening when it is happening. In one of the books I read, an entire chapter was devoted to dealing with crappy doctors. This was very beneficial to me because I ended up dealing with a crappy doctor. It is common, especially with bp2 because the hypomania symptoms are often hidden and you almost have to fight for attention to them. Dealing with that crappy doctor was emotionally damaging but less damaging because of the book I read. There was a good lecture video posted here earlier. It is dry and an hour long, but it may offer more insight and be a good starting point.To be diagnosed I went to the low income mental health clinic.Good luck and I hope you stick around here.

I am actually so good at this that I have convinced my family and friends that I am \"fine\" as well as one psychologist that insisted I do not have any mental health problems (he was a jerk and spent 30 minutes with me, its a long story). By the time we got to the birthday party, I had put on a happy face and no one had any idea that I had just had a panic attack. Hiding mental issues from others is what most of us do. So the mom that has her nails done and is involved in PTA? Bulimia. The mom that is very patient and hand crafts bows? Agoraphobia. She isn't alone, but it certainly feels that way.Now as far as money goes, I have noticed that overall, adding another child is not that much of a difference because your life is already child focussed. There is no comparison to going from 0 children to 1, so going from 1 to 2, or even 2 to 3 is just an addition. We are always poor and barely make it most of the time. But we make it work by being frugal and living pretty simple. ", "link_id": "t3_3khv6e", "time": 1441987332}}

I started smoking at 19 (10 years ago) but did not smoke frequently until about 5 years ago. I have smoked several times a day for months straight as well as as little as once a week.I am confident that my symptoms of bipolar and anxiety are not caused by it due to my having mental health problems since early childhood. I have used it in liue of antidepressants but have found that it no longer works well for me. Quitting smoking has not really given me any side effects at all. I have noticed in these last few months that when I smoke in a depressive period, it will temporarily relieve my symptoms. It allows me to organize my thoughts and takes away the crippling guilt. If I use it when I am hypomanic, I typically become more hypomanic. If I use it when I am having paranoid or delusional thoughts, they get worse. After the initial high effect immediately after use, I feel groggy but the main high is gone and does not carry over. This is important for me as I typically smoke only once in the late evening so my mood changes the following day are not related to smoking 12+ hours ago the night before.Do I believe bipolar symptoms could be mistaken for chronic use? Maybe. If a person were to smoke every 2-4 hours around the clock, it could be. But that would be maintaining a constant high which could be mistaken for anything, even schizophrenia. I think that the stereotypical stoner on the couch smoking all day, every day, is actually quite rare. I don't believe someone like me who smokes once a day (previously more often though) could have full blown bipolar symptoms continuously for an extended period. The use could add to and intensify symptoms but also temporarily alleviate symptoms as well. I am not smoking at all until I am stable for while, and if I do return to it, I will make sure that I am only doing it in the right state of mind and occasionally.

{"cu9x0o3": {"text": "When I experience (what I beleive to be) hypomania, I get a feeling of butterflies. It feels like my red blood cells are dancing from my toes to my hair. I have recent memories of this happening in random places. Once I was in a biology lecture minding my own business when the feeling came on. Another recent one was when I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep. It also feels like I am a pressure cooker and I HAVE to release the energy. I get a huge urge to do something physical... running, jumping, etc. The energy is very intense and I just have to release it. I also become very interested in sex and go from sex a couple times a week to a few times a day though I want more but my husband is tired. In general my thoughts are really fast paced, like eminem is dictating them. But they are choppy and scattered which goes along with my actions which are also choppy and scattered. I will begin a task to jump to another one to then jump to another one. I obsessively clean for 12+ hours, only stopping when my legs begin to cramp. I speed walk everywhere and no one is going fast enough for me. I become very argumentative and confrontational to strangers but also my family. Basically if anyone crosses my path or gets in my way, I bite their head off. I also feel like I am a genius and I am completely gorgeous and convinced everyone is looking at me. I become paranoid over cars parked outside or \"officials\" monitoring me (basically anyone that looks important or professional. Extra points of they have a clipboard or ear piece). I've also caught myself thinking there are cameras in the ceiling. I've also become paranoid in public and confronted my aunt at a parade for talking about me to a person she was standing next to. I once thought my sister and brother in law were actively molesting my neice while I was in the shower. Recently I am convinced that the difficulties at the psychologists office are on purpose to test me to see if I am truly sick, which I still believe.  The list of these delusions goes on and on although I am aware that it is not real, for the most part. Even when I know it's not real, I still truly think it is.I also sometimes have intense anxiety where I worry about everything. Check the coffee pot 15 times, look out the windows, see a police officer and become paranoid I am going to be arrested. My heart beats irregularly, I breathe rapidly and rub a part of my head so often that I am going bald in that area. The anxiety is kind of always there but extremely intense once I am hypomanic.I usually become obsessed with something, like a business plan, researching, writing. I don't sleep for several days at a time or if I do, its only for a few hours. I can't stop thinking or moving while also feeling like I am more enlightened than anyone else on Earth. I begin a project which I become engulfed in and only leave to pee. I pour hours and hours and days into this project. I can't tell you how many blogs, books and websites I have started. I also volunteer for things, accept jobs or enroll in classes which I feel that I can master, but then realize that I am way in over my head. I don't know which comes first, my realization that my obsession is a waste of time or the depression, but they go hand-in-hand. I crash down and become full of guilt, and complete despare. It hurts to be alive. I feel like a burden to the world, like wasted space. Being alive is a burde, killing myself is a burden. I wish I could go like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and just never exist at all. But i have comfort in knowing its temporary. It lasts anywhere from a week to a month and I always know its temporary. It has always been temporary.Aside from the panic attacks which started a couple years ago, I have been this way my whole life. I was always jealous of my cousins who seemed to hold it together so well. I just recently realized that they are that way because they have nothing to hold together.I also go through a phase where I convince myself I am just fine and I don't need help. Its just all in my head. But that seems common in bp. And I have a severe phobia to vomit which has just gotten worse through the years. I have an appointment tomorrow with a new psychiatrist that can assess me. I am nervoue and I hope it goes well. I hope she doesn't laugh at me or call me immature like the others did.

It was an awful few weeks of depression which was prefaced with the first \"manic\" episode I recognized. There are others but I've never really noticed it before.

I have finally gotten in touch with a psychiatrist but we are playing phone tag so no appointments have been made.

The voicemail of this new psychiatrist says she is the head of the dual diagnostics program. So I am being seen as a drug addict? I haven't smoked weed in a week or so. Honestly, I didn't even count because it's not that big of a deal. I just walked away from it and am now dealing with my issues with nothing. I understand if I were an alcoholic or I do cocaine. Weed is essentially the only thing I do, and it has medical benefits. But whatever.

I am not \"severe\" which I think is adding to my problems of being diagnosed with anything, but I am not going to wait until I completely lose it before seeking help. It's kind of the same situation with financial assistance \"Oh, you can barely make it? Well, that's not bad enough. Call us when you are starving and laying in the gutter.\" Preventative medicine, people! Or at least ONE medical professional to simply acknowledge my issues and eventually address them.Also, I hear voices however I am not sure that they \"count\". I told the psychologist a little about them but said they are \"atypical\" and he shrugged his shoulders (this was while he went through my list and dismissed every symptom I have). I hear people calling my name sometimes, as well as music being distantly played or incoherent whispers. Apparently this is not \"hearing voices\" but rather something else to be dismissed. I am hoping this psychiatrist calls me back. And does not assume I am a meth addict. I am a housewife for Pete's sake! ", "link_id": "t3_3go2dm", "time": 1439864273}}

Every time I am \"up\", I know to avoid big decisions or put them off until I return to normal. I know the paranoia is not real and talk myself out of it after a few minutes. The thoughts in my head go so fast that I sometimes listen to music on headphones to fall asleep. But everything is getting worse. I am not able to control my anxiety anymore. The depression is getting weird, like gruesome pictures in my mind. This whole time I have been just rolling with it but it is just progressively getting worse and that's what scares me.I am fine with quitting smoking and have done so as of today. I also talked to my sister who is a pharmacist and advised me to pick up and follow the prescription for antidepressants to at least give a medication starting point.I brought the list, which included my psychological history as well as a general synopsis because the one previous person I saw did not allow me to talk. So I guess that in a way, I was forcing them to listen to me because I was asking them to read it.This whole process has been very discouraging. I have read a few books and all of them talk about an almost identical process the autho went through. I've yet for anyone to recognize my symptoms and talk to me about them. All they want to discuss is depression. I don't want to be that crazy person that hunts for a 5th opinion but I feel like I have no other choice. I am hoping to find someone who will listen, give an educated diagnosis whatever that is, and helps me deal with this with techniques or medication or therapy. I feel like people in my shoes should be greeted with reassurance and people who listen but instead it is confusing and discouraging. ", "link_id": "t3_3go2dm", "time": 1439439571}}

{"cu0hyu9": {"text": "Thank you so much for your response. This whole process is very confusing and discouraging. I had no idea it would be this complicated.I am no expert in this. But I am an expert in myself. I want someone to recognize that I have these three pages of symptoms, and have my whole life. Even if someone says \"Let's treat the depression and see if your other symptoms are taken care of. And while we are at it, how about we do some lab work to eliminate other possibilities too.\" that would be fine with me. I am going to call the office today and try to arrange to see a psychiatrist. I saw one, one time, and then she left the company. I have since tried twice to arrange to be seen by someone else but I have been blown off. I am making it a mission to arrange an appointment.If I don't have bp, and maybe it's something else, then at least I want to be treated for my life long issues. And don't tell me that my smoking marijuana regularly for a few years is causing all of this.... and retroactively has caused all of it for nearly twenty years. Thank you. I don't want to be this crazy person that researches a disorder and doctor shops until I find one that won't argue with me. I honestly would like to move on with my life.
