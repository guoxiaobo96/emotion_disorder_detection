I mean the characters were hatable but it showed how compromising on personal matters can bring out the worst in people.I don\u2019t think Jadzia was being a bitch.

She had been incredibly forgiving of him and was trying to make the best of the situation with a surly boyfriend.

A strong independent woman wouldn\u2019t even put up with any of the bullshit leading up to that, so it showed she really was committed to their relationship, in her own way. Perhaps this is the 7 lifetimes of experience. In the end, Jadzia Dax is both Jadzia and Dax. She does have lifetimes of experience but she also has her young, singular lifetime to grow as a person within. She is still guided by the personality of her Trill host, who is a young woman. We see it often throughout DS9 that she is very feminine, gossipy, self-pampering, fashionable, etc. Worf on the other hand has always been the rigid, professional warrior. We learn how he was shaped early by his experiences to keep himself pent up for the protection of those around him. The fact that he felt comfortable sharing that with her at all signified a turning point in their relationship; he released his narcissistic defenses and allowed himself to be vulnerable with her, and she in-turn reciprocated with compassion and understanding. The whole terrorist plot was just a vehicle. A bit hammy but it drove home the point that people who are suffering from personal isolation as Worf was are capable of ruining everything around them without remorse. Worf is not a bad guy, but guided by frustration he couldn\u2019t see how awful his actions were. It was a good episode that exploded out a lot of themes that are usually more subtle.

{"fjp970u": {"text": "I wouldn\u2019t call anyone who helped me \u201cmeh\u201d so that\u2019s not a good sign in my opinion. I refer to my therapist as \u201ca jewel of a human being\u201d for instance. It\u2019s hard to imagine getting genuine help in the way that I have and feeling anything but overwhelming gratitude. To describe what it was like, I hold a pair of \u201cpaddles\u201d in my hand, they are like little plastic handles with wires that extend to a little control module held by my therapist. Whenever we \u201cgo in,\u201d I close my eyes, relax and then the paddles vibrate in an alternating cycle, left... right... left... right... bout a half second. I stay in for about a minute or two (I have adhd so I have no concept of time, it could be 20secs or 5minutes for all i know, but it feels like 1 min.) The first thing we do is go in and go to my safe space, which is a combination of memory and imagination, a zone where, if I was there I would feel peace, contentedness, sometimes joy, and completely fucking safe. It gets little features every time I go there that make it more real for me. After safe space we begin the actual work. The therapist asks me to recall the moment I felt X. X might be fear, rejection, overwhelming anxiety, whatever. If we are just trying to source the feeling it might be a recent memory, like when I had a mild panic attack while driving and had no idea why. I close my eyes and just try to remember what the fuck was going on in that moment. Sometimes it takes a few tries and really meditating on the moment, but then details start popping up. The more time I spend in it the more details come up, what I remember going on, what I saw or thought, what I felt just before things got all fucked up or even while they were fucked up. When I come out I tell her everything I notice. Sometimes it\u2019s just superficial stuff but the more I dredge up the more clues I get. Eventually we strike something meaningful. A thought that scared me, or an emotion that overwhelmed me. We go back in and I explore this thought in the safety of that room and with the peace of having been to my safe space recently. Sometimes it kicks back more memories. Sometimes I just get perspective on the issue, seeing my tormentor for the mangled, broken and miserable human he was, or laughing (like genuine laughing not defensive laughing) at the completely ridiculous level of dysfunction in that household. When the session ends I go back to my safe space to sort of pinch it off and finish in a tranquil mindset (very -VERY- important, I discovered...).After that the next week or two is mine to digest what I experienced. Sometimes I have juicy insights, sometimes I just need to metabolize the emotions out properly, and sometimes life is so crazy that something else more important comes up.All in all, between taking meds for the adhd and the EMDR, I\u2019m the best I\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019m going on about 8months now.  I still have moments but they are neither as debilitating as they were nor am I completely walled up emotionally as a way to cope with them, and there is a lot of security in knowing that there is a protocol in place for dealing with them.Just to make this clear, I see emdr is a tool for unlocking myself, from myself. Once I\u2019m cracked open, the work is on ME to look inward and draw meaning from it, to learn from it and grow from it. My therapist is just a guide, a facilitator in this process. Revealing the nastiness is meaningless in itself. And really, even opening up takes a lot of effort, not to mention guts. It\u2019s truly disturbing sometimes to admit deep deep seeded hate or judgement, or malice, or any toxicity. But I feel better for getting it out 100% of the time.So to add to what I said at the beginning, maybe the person who reviewed that therapist simply didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t do the work required. I don\u2019t even need a all my fingers to count the people I know that I think have the capacity to look inward with the honesty it takes to have a meaningful session. I didn\u2019t at first either, that had to develop, and for a while I had to put faith in the process. So, my advice is to taste and see for yourself.", "link_id": "t3_fecl5x", "time": 1583544936}}

I\u2019d argue that the drive to stay comfortable is how I get knotted up in the first place. Similarly, if a bone mends improperly it has to be rebroken for it to heal correctly.These are just the ways that I came to terms with the effects that EMDR had on me. It didn\u2019t take very long before I began to appreciate the value in having undergone it, as I began to feel compassion, empathy, love, vulnerability and intimacy in all the ways I never could have before, and they were all dimensions that brought meaning and richness to my life.

We are more isolated and more polarized than ever, and I think it is safe to assume -any- cultural construct that reinforces patterns of distrust are implicated.

{"fcugq0z": {"text": "These is just a theory I\u2019m developing for my own understanding but this far in to all my research, the answer to me is yes, somewhat.The most defining aspect, the core issue with ADHD (for me, but I suspect for most of us) has been the \u201ctime blindness\u201d described by Russell Barkley in his book Taking Charge of Adult ADHD and many of his youtube videos. We are -impulsive- because we cannot see the reward or harm of any choice of action if that reward or harm isn\u2019t immediate, so we do things that are stimulating _right now_. We are literally incapable of logically connecting the emotional experience of failure, guilt, accomplishment, validation, etc to anything. As Dr. Barkley describes it, this is due to a bottleneck of activation in the portion of our brain that connects the \u201ccold logic\u201d rational brain to the limbic system that interprets emotional value.Imagine being clinically tone-deaf, a condition where music just sounds like noise to you. Would you listen to it? Probably not. This is ADHD, except instead of music, we don\u2019t get, or understand, consequences and rewards.__ADHD is neurological and genetic, but the cause is unknown. So how could ADHD be cognitive?__Well know the brain is incredibly plastic, especially while we are children. And we also know that kids who experience early neglect, abuse, separation, etc, known as Adverse Childhood Experiences, have a much higher rate of becoming neurotic later, including adhd bipolar and ocd and many others.So.... how can it be both? It\u2019s either a genetic thing or not, why would ACE kids grow up with these symptoms at an increased rate?My idea currently is that some people have a genetic marker for resilience or adaptation to complex trauma. ADHD is an adaptation to negative environments. Essentially, I am __extremely well suited to being disappointed regularly because I have no expectations and I don\u2019t remember feeling like shit__. I\u2019m blind to time. I see whats in front of me and I\u2019ve gotten damn good at making the best of that. Does that make sense? Maybe if a kid is profoundly disappointed over and over and over again, the part of their brain that is supposed to develop forward thinking instead bottlenecks that brain activity to prevent more emotional torment. I\u2019m basing all this primarily on two sources:- _Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving_ by Pete Walker- _Taking Charge of Adult ADHD_ by Dr. Russell Barkleybut this is the culmination of many many many sources, outside experiences, and my own recovery from alexithymia, a sub clinical condition where I couldn\u2019t feel certain emotions. The recovery from alexithymia is probably the main thing that spurred this theory. In essence, the adhd is no different. I knew when my mother died I was supposed to feel something, but I didn\u2019t. When I think about failing a course if I don\u2019t do an assignment, or think about graduating with my bachelors degree, I know I should feel something, but I don\u2019t.Recovery took a lot of EMDR therapy to get myself to start attaching emotions normally again, and I\u2019m hoping for some success with ADHD as well", "link_id": "t3_eitkym", "time": 1577980552}}

I also think you hit the nail on the head about trying to out-think my problems.I have to add, I get the impression that you do not accept ADHD as an actual disorder with demonstrable physiological causes; that, or you are implying that there's naught to gain in viewing it as such. Either way, I only got diagnosed after seeking medical help because of a recognized gross inability to function in a normal capacity in certain areas, namely consistency. I have to think on what you said above, but my gut is telling me that you are speaking without all the facts. Some things simply are, and suspending them from my mind will not make them go away. If it worked that way then I would not have been symptomatic until I got diagnosed, but in truth I've never not been symptomatic.Lastly I'd like to ask how anyone can live in a way that you describe. I don't mean to sound critical of what you wrote, I just don't understand it. Without referring to past experiences, how can anyone avoid making the same mistake over and over again? Without setting goals for the future, how can anyone achieve anything? Contemplation is human. I don't think that I have a problem spending too much time in these modes of forward or rearward thinking. What I'm describing is an experience where future goals and past experiences do not connect emotionally. Plans are immaterial. Goals are effervescent. They have no weight on me and I have great difficulty moving on them because there is no emotional connection to them. I can recognize them as important logically, but that is not enough to warrant action or restraint.I'll give you an example. I'd like to own a house some day. It would be a good thing for my dog and I'd be able to express myself with the space. The investment would likely appreciate over time. It could be a place of respite for me. I make enough money to save for something like this. How could I ever actualize this if I don't recognize it emotionally? Why would I show restraint and save money if it never _feels_ real? Like a real possibility?Likewise, while acting on impulse has caused me innumerable failures and frustrations, I do not emotionally connect with those experiences. I can recall them but they are, once again, immaterial and have no weight. I could fail and fail and fail and fail and fail and fail and fail and fail and fail... and it would go on like this until I die a failure. The lesson is never learned in an emotional capacity. The fear of failure never guides me away from the impulse.", "link_id": "t3_eg7ru1", "time": 1577464950}}

{"faoo59x": {"text": "__TLDR at bottom__Gonna try and answer this as completely as I can without giving my life's story: I started seeking treatment for CPTSD with EMDR therapy before I was diagnosed with ADHD. I'm 31yo and I've only just started correcting myself this past year. The diagnosis for severe ADHD is recent (like maybe 2months), and accurate as fuck, but at this point the diagnosis seems like more of a description of symptoms than a well-understood dysfunction; ei. it explains almost nothing and treatment is vague. Psychiatry seems to downplay the role of complex trauma in the development of ADHD. I am quite certain that in my case, however, it was a major contributing factor to my stunted emotional development and concentration issues, impulsiveness, depression, outbursts. I grew up in constant negativity. I was bullied at home and school. I was manipulated. I was tolerated, but not accepted. _Of course I developed unhealthy mental coping mechanisms._ I don't mean to self dramatize here but it makes complete sense to me that my unmet needs as a child developed into unhealthy modes of behavior and cycles of thought as an adult. So do I have ADHD or is was I just broken in such a way that makes me behave like I do?I guess the real question is, what difference does it make?To me, it seems like CPTSD and ADHD are two different frameworks for describing the same issue. They both approximate the cause and therefore put forth possible solutions, but neither do a complete job.To answer your question, finally, EMDR therapy is something I do with a therapist. The benefit to me is hard to even describe without sounding sensational or dramatic, all I can say is that I feel like a human being for the first time and I am connecting with those around me in ways that would have revolted me before. I'm happier than I've ever been. Goals for my future seem achievable and worthwhile. And yes I am struggling with ADHD right now, which very neatly packages all of my symptoms into one nice little bundle of bullshit, but I __am__ dealing with it. Success to me now is more important, more achievable, more worthwhile than it ever has been. TBH I have not seen a dramatic impact on executive function, but I actually have not done an EMDR session since I was diagnosed with ADHD. All my sessions since have just been normal talk sessions. My therapist and I are currently working together to sort out my thoughts and feelings as I move through drug therapy and the impact on my life. It's a lot. HOWEVER! My rejection sensitivity and emotional outbursts are doing way better, and now having the support and understanding of my friends and family (because I can connect with them now in a meaningful way, thanks to EMDR) is a tremendous help in dealing with ADHD.I would not recommend EMDR anything without a therapist. I can't imagine it would do much for you at all. A lot of the session is my therapist simply guiding me through memories and feelings to try and tease out buried emotions so that they can be confronted and processed. Like, I don't know what that would look like solo. But if it was possible to do it solo I would not want to do it either; EMDR is fucking intense. I had nightmares for days following my first couple of sessions and I absolutely needed help working through that. In worse hands I could see the whole thing just re-traumatizing me.I posted above because the self-defensive thought cycles are a mental trap I fall into sometimes that feel a lot more like CPTSD than they do ADHD, and if you give that book I mentioned a shot you will see exactly what I mean.The last note I will make is that the human brain is by far the most complex and fascinating black box that scientific inquiry has ever sought to understand, and we absolutely do not have a handle on it yet. Psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists all have different windows into the mind and they are all drawing their own conclusions based on their own limited scope.__TLDR:__ EMDR is for emotional resolution and subtle, complex trauma, and it was my main approach when treating my symptoms primarily as if they were emotional issues. It has helped tremendously with stuff like OP's problem and several other issues, but I have not had a chance to target issues of focus and executive function. I would never suggest EMDR without a _good_ therapist that you trust; it is __fucking intense__, but that is the nature of big resolutions. You wouldn't expect to heal a bone that fused wrong without some intense re-breaking. If you feel like some of your symptoms may be the result of emotional abuse, neglect, or plain ol' persistent negativity and isolation, I would _highly_ recommend the book I mentioned so you can make up your own mind. Despite what psychiatrist's say, they are sure about very little regarding ADHD and there is still a lot of conflicting ideas, so in my opinion you have to form your own thoughts about it.btw could you tell I have been tweaking as I wrote this :DI gotta paper due tonight haha", "link_id": "t3_ea3qhy", "time": 1576268727}}

{"f8epb4q": {"text": "Okay, well now that we\u2019ve established a context for your inquiry I\u2019d like to share a quick story:When I was 20 years old I joined the US Marine Corps. At the time I joined I looked up to a few family members who were also Marines. Bootcamp was a sort of hell. It was miserable but I performed pretty well. There were some intense struggles and at one point I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it because of an injury I didn\u2019t tell anyone about. Towards the end of the entire thing, after a culminating event that was brutal, there was a brief ceremony where all us recruits were lined up and one by one presented with a Marine emblem, because we had passed the final challenge and could finally be recognized as Marines. While I was standing in this formation I felt a slight sting in my eyes and suddenly they started leaking. I couldn\u2019t move because I was in formation so I couldn\u2019t clear my face up. I got irritated with myself. Why the hell was my body doing this RIGHT NOW?? My drill instructor was getting closer and, after training me to be a machine and a killer of men, he would see me like this and assume I was _crying_. I wasn\u2019t crying. I felt nothing except for the sharp wind. For years I unironically remembered that moment as the most unfortunate timing of a wind shear of my life. But it wasn\u2019t. I had been, in fact, crying with absolutely no emotional response. My body carried out the expression with zero feelings attached, and I could not understand why.When I became aware of my own alexithemia and began healing past it, I looked back on my life and realized I had been controlled by my unfelt emotions my whole life in several important ways without ever understanding what was guiding me, because I couldn\u2019t perceive it. It was like I had been on a railroad my entire life, never seeing it and always thinking I was the one making choices about my actions. In truth, it was my emotions. So I write all this to point out that it is more complex than simply separating emotions into \u201cthinking\u201d and \u201cfeeling.\u201d Had I been confronted with the truth earlier than when I was ready I would not have accepted it. The answer I was looking for with the question about compassion is that we start to develop it when we feel emotional pain and remorse for causing pain in others. If you cannot feel emotional pain than you cannot understand what you have inflicted on someone else and therefore you cannot feel sorry for having done it. Psychopaths adapt to this by mimicking compassion; they realize that when another person is expressing suffering, there is a societal expectation for an outward response. What\u2019s the difference if the outward response is the same?I can only speak from my own experience, but I know for a fact that I have emotionally hurt many people because I could not understand what I was doing, and _if_ they brought it up to me I _could not accept it_. They were being dramatic, or lying, or manipulative. I never learned compassion like most do as a young adult. Most people learn that you cannot hurt others without inflicting distress on yourself. You don\u2019t tease people anymore because being cut down emotionally is awful and has lasting, painful affects on a persons psyche, and if you\u2019ve done the work of repairing that damage you would not do that to others.Instead what I learned was that hurting others made me look bad. So I stopped doing it because I wanted friends, because I was lonely, because I was emotionally isolated, because I was incapable of truly connecting with other people, because I was disconnected from myself.", "link_id": "t3_drdbe6", "time": 1574531622}}

You\u2019ve only a notion of what they\u2019re experiencing. You have no personal triumphs, defeats, persistent struggles, or inward reactions about the experience of that feeling.

To put this one last way, alexithemia is pretty uncommon. I\u2019d had it for years. I can explain it to others who have never experienced it, who have no idea what it\u2019s like to be completely unmoved by the death of a family member or by achieving difficult long term goals.

Not only is that unknowable, it\u2019s undoubtedly not the case.Most everyone just makes a safe assumption that the person they\u2019re speaking to has an acceptably sufficient notion of the feeling they express. So your last point was either willfully pedantic or you missed my meaning entirely, sort of proving the limitations of words in the process. To your first point, I don\u2019t think anyone could possibly be an authority on how a feeling or emotion is _supposed_ to be experienced. I spent a lot of key presses trying to explain that there is not a single experience in the whole of human experiences that isn\u2019t entirely subjective. What I express as fury might inwardly include physical and emotional inputs, but to you be perceived as only as a persistent, violent, intrusive thought. The best anyone can say with any real authority is that a reported experience associated with a particular feeling/emotion is or isn\u2019t common, or that experiencing emotion X as sensation Y is often associated with condition Z. But even this is just interpolation. Now if I\u2019ve completely missed the point of your question, and what you really want to know might be better asked to me as \u201cIs there a difference between feeling sad and thinking sad thoughts while making sad faces?\u201d then the answer for me is yes, absolutely. Emotions are \u201cfelt\u201d for lack of a better word. The sensation approximates a tactile experience but it isn\u2019t associated with external stimuli and often times the locale is difficult to even point to. The critical difference for me, however, is the realness and impact of a feeling vs a thought. Thoughts are trivial to dismiss. Feelings are much less so. It\u2019s the difference between hearing a description of water and drinking it.Taking that step from hearing about certain feelings and experiencing them was tremendous for me, not just for enriching my life but for giving me an opportunity to genuinely connect with others on a deeper, human level. I\u2019ll tell you straight up that I confused sex with love for a long time because outwardly they seemed similar.", "link_id": "t3_drdbe6", "time": 1574410997}}
{"f8aglu9": {"text": "Words are just symbols, m8.They exist to transmit a concept from one person to another. Many words symbolize concepts that transmit cleanly. If I say \u201cRectangle\u201d or \u201dYacht\u201d or \u201cFive\u201d or \u201cKarma Debt,\u201d then even if you don\u2019t know what they mean they can be easily pointed to, illustrated, demonstrated, and mapped until you have an acceptable understanding of the concept I\u2019m attempting to transmit. Abstract things are more difficult. Attempting to communicate something like \u201cLove\u201d is tricky because we all have different experiences of what that word means to us. It would be nearly impossible to exhaustively explore that word with each person you speak it to, so when it\u2019s spoken  we usually just reserve some consideration for acknowledging that limitation. That word, like _many_ others, is dirty in the sense that it is imprecise and very subjective. Even clean words have a margin of error. A yacht to me may look different than a yacht to you. And imprecise doesn\u2019t mean ineffective. My point is that words, and truly all forms of communication, are inherently limited in their capacity to completely encapsulate and transmit a concept. The arts are usually a better, cleaner, way of expressing human concepts (like feelings) than wordy definitions. I can name a few songs that do a better job of defining sadness or joy or loss than any dictionary definition ever could.If you can accept this framework then maybe you can see that trying to define a feeling may be a step backwards in trying to understand it; words are intrinsically vague, but a person\u2019s raw experience with a feeling incorporates all of their subjective sensory and emotional inputs. And if you say \u201cI\u2019m sad\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m happy\u201d then there\u2019s a certain amount of trust you have to have in me when I acknowledge your expression that I too have experienced the same thing.Your question is philosophical in nature, and if this answer is unacceptable then your pursuit to getting down to some bedrock of truth will in all likelihood take you only deeper into a very personal understanding of what a feeling is.But the entire human experience is subjective, so why not this too, y\u2019know?", "link_id": "t3_drdbe6", "time": 1574396716}}

I'm not sure the creators thought it through to that degree, it's possible they just wanted the unstoppable god-killing badass to play as and it just worked out, but it's a tale as old as time (not really, the rage of Achilles is predated by the epic of Gilgamesh, who processed his emotions quite differently.)

{"f5kpbox": {"text": "Absolutely we do all have needs. Specifically, to the point of this post, for love, intimacy, and acceptance. Again, this is just my experience, but I found that when I started nurturing relationships with friends and family and practicing self-love/self-compassion a lot of those needs were completely met. In fact, I have to spend more time alone these days because I have such an abundance of connections with my community and family. I\u2019m simplifying this quite a bit but I can to go into more detail if you like. \u201cNeediness\u201d does have a bad connotation. It\u2019s true that we all have needs but neediness comes off as a sort of despair for some deeper unmet needs. _In my particular case,_ I could not be happy alone. I now believe this was because I was emotionally neglected as a child and never developed a sense of unconditional love from my caregivers. As an adult I continued to seek this out from partners, which is, of course, a completely impractical expectation. I unknowingly chose (sought out, fell head over heels for) partners who also had this quality and together we became codependent; these relationships always ended in toxicity. The neediness was the feeling that my life had little meaning outside of a relationship and that if I wasn\u2019t building intimacy with someone I was failing. I blamed others, I blamed my looks, my race, my income, my military experiences, on and on, but none of those were the real issue. I finally got a wake up call when my last relationship became -so- toxic that I had to get therapy and start looking inward.All this to say that I believe neediness is inherently toxic. Having needs and neediness are not the same thing. Once I (mostly) eliminated that stuff and worked through it, I no longer feel loneliness in the same sense, so for me they were connected. These days I am content with the relationships I have and where I\u2019m at, if there is a girl I\u2019m interested in I don\u2019t have a intense desire to make things intimate quickly. Things are simply \u201cgood enough\u201d where they are. My standards are much higher now as well, since I\u2019m pretty happy with life and inviting someone else\u2019s energy into it needs to fit, rather than making my life fit around their energy.Hope this explains what I said a bit.

{"f2ye7eg": {"text": "Gonna take a stab because my experiences with codependency have been absolutely awful and seemed to get worse with each new relationship for some reason I don\u2019t understand right now. It\u2019s been a common thread I\u2019ve seen in past SOs and myself and I thoroughly believe now that it is not possible to love another if you don\u2019t have genuine love and appreciation for yourself. I know you are wrapped up in the potential of this new relationship and I don\u2019t mean to squash that; after working through a lot of this myself I can say that the difference between relationships, romantic and otherwise, before and after starting this path is just insane. When I\u2019m not being driven by insecurities or satisfying needs I can really relate to others for their true merit as people. The stakes are low because my own self worth is not hinging on their acceptance and approval so there\u2019s no pressure to push things into an intimate space to establish a connection. There\u2019s almost no pressure at all, actually. The good news is self-love is neither difficult to cultivate nor is it impossible with bipolar; it is, however, a purely personal journey.To the point of your topic, the swings definitely hurt my ability to stay focused and keep expectations healthy. A downswing makes me really fragile and desperate (pathetic, actually) and an upswing can trigger obsession over a new prospect. The real problem for me, tho, is maintaining self-love during these swings to avoid codependent behavior. Like, it\u2019s really fuckin hard to do basic shit when you\u2019re depressed, and that makes it really difficult to believe you are worthwhile. It\u2019s also really difficult to believe in yourself when you just blew up your bank account buying shit you def did not need or spent the last 13 hours binging the new Zelda title. In my opinion, that\u2019s the real struggle with codependency with relation to bipolar.e: Guess I should mention what I personally am doing about the struggle. Firstly, obviously, curbing bipolar behavior helps a lot with how I see myself. The bigger and more difficult task is accepting that bipolar is a part of who I am and that does not make me less of a person. Everybody is dealing with something; this is just my mountain to climb.

I don\u2019t think it was intentional, she just had her own trauma and insecurities and would stress me out any time she started asking questions about why I stayed in communication with certain people that I guess she felt threatened by. I just talking to those people less, and to catering to her other needs just wound up unplugging me from most of my friends. We were both at fault. I needed her a lot as well and de-prioritized all my other relationships. She just really didn\u2019t have any to lose I guess, so I was the only one that got isolated. When we split, the sudden total isolation totally crushed me. What has been helping the most is reconnecting with people and being open with them about where in at. My friends were surprisingly understanding. I\u2019ve got a relationship with my sister for the first time in years and with my father for the first time in my life. I\u2019ve visited friends in other states and reconnected on an even deeper level than when we left each other.I don\u2019t know your situation but when I felt completely and totally alone, I was extremely surprised by how responsive people were when I reached out. Renewing relationships with people you may have neglected and making new connections with the people around you will help you depend less on your abuser to get away from the isolation. Another thing that has helped a lot is just journaling. I\u2019ve been doing it consistently for the first time in my life. Just spilling your thoughts to the paper is extremely therapeutic. What I noticed after a while was that I was developing a sense of intimacy with my self. I\u2019m not sure if that sounds bizarre. It started off as just a way of tracking my mood as I started new medication, but the first time I sat down to do it I wound up filling several pages just talking about stuff I was still processing from my day.Last thing is, if you aren\u2019t seeing a therapist, I strongly recommend it. I\u2019d never ever ever in my life seen a therapist, and I have never had so much emotional growth in my life. Just talking to a professional about where you\u2019re at and getting objective (but sensitive) feedback on what\u2019s been bouncing around between your ears does wonders for unknotting a tangled mind.

{"ex03xmm": {"text": "I got that concept from Pete Walker\u2019s book _Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving_. I\u2019d recommend picking it up, I\u2019ve given away a few copies already haha. The idea as that as children we are programmed to develop through unconditional love from our parents, especially our mother. When we don\u2019t get it as kids, either because of abuse or emotional neglect or regular neglect or harassment, we become developmentally arrested, and continue to seek it out. The problem is that unconditional love is not a reasonable thing to get from others, and to some degree, it\u2019s not even a thing we should be getting from our parents after a certain age; the example the author  uses here is when a mother withdraws affection from a child if the child hits or bites her. The child may cry as it\u2019s suddenly confronted with the reality that even love has boundaries.So people with trauma often seek out the intimacy and unconditional love in partners that they were programmed to seek out as kids. Not just those things but acceptance and adequacy. Problem is, normal people are usually turned way the fuck off by this neediness, but other traumatized people reciprocate.  This leads to codependency and toxicity since both partners are carrying a lot of baggage and trust issues and other bullshit, unknowingly looking for a savior or a sense of completeness from someone incapable of being that for the other person.I\u2019m summarizing a hell of a lot and I\u2019m not a professional. When I wrote that line about intimacy in the post above, I was talking about my own way of getting with girls who need love as badly as I do. I just never realized how deep that hole was and how incapable anyone ever would be enough to fill it.  Intimacy is part of what I think love is I guess.

One thing that has been helping me cone to terms with losing my special powers has been acknowledging that ultimately it makes me unstable, and stability is much much more critical to happiness and achieving my goals than the edge that the hypomania gives me. If you go to the gym, you know that the most important part, the most difficult part, the easiest part and honestly the only part that truly matters is just showing up consistently. Everything else about being successful there falls into place if you can just be consistent about showing up. Thats true for anything.

TLDR: I feel your struggle, I\u2019m looking at changing my meds and had to come down on my original rx for similar reasons, it\u2019s sad letting go of the hypomania but it\u2019s important to depending on what your goals in life are.

{"ewnritq": {"text": "Just my 2c. I had to take off work when I first started confronting a lot of this stuff. I was really unwell, very erratic and emotional, edgy, mopey and generally unproductive with little control over my mind.  It\u2019s gotten much better since then with therapy, family, books and this forum, but I was not in a solid working state for a good minute. I do not think I could have been successful with even half the load you described. I treated healing like I would have treated having been diagnosed with a serious illness. I gave it all the same considerations and patience. It\u2019s a ton of work, and it got better only with great time and effort, mine and others\u2019. As for the psychiatrist, I can only speak for my region of the US but my understanding is that they are really only reached out to when needing more precision and experienced with prescribing psychiatric drugs. I think I may need one in time to control my manic-depressive episodes but a tremendous amount of work has been done just in therapy, which was much more available. My therapist has masters level education, so he\u2019s not a doctor, but I really don\u2019t think I need one at this time. Tbh almost all doctors I\u2019ve encountered had similar listening problems and trigger happy approaches as the ones you described, so I wasn\u2019t really interested in pouring myself out for one. That, and I have a firm belief that drugs treat symptoms rather than addressing causes. One more thing about therapy: I recently started EMDR treatment, a process specifically designed to treat trauma, and the results after only a few sessions have been profound. Utterly profound. We haven\u2019t even begun dredging up trauma, but simply the act of creating a mental \u201csafe space\u201d has allowed me to get past some very stubborn emotional blocks. Literally cried last session just talking about how happy my coworkers made me. I\u2019ve never had happy tears in my life. Or sad tears for that matter. If you\u2019re shopping for a therapist I would strongly recommend looking for one who is certified to perform EMDR treatment.Lastly, to the point of your header, yes I do get completely and totally exhausted while working through this stuff. Might even say it feels like burnout. There\u2019s a sense of hopelessness that permeates through to everything. When I feel like that I just put a lot of the healing material down and focus on my life around me. Working through the trauma is still in the back of my mind somewhere but I disengage from it as much as possible. The \u201creal\u201d healing is forming new, healthy memories and making genuine connections anyways. Thats hard to do when you are focused on unknotting your past. Eventually, my faith in the process is refreshed and I can begin the work part again. Hope this helps. Sounds like you\u2019re dealing with a lot.

Where I\u2019m at rn I\u2019m realizing that the need for others, as pure and innately human as it is, is complicating the process of getting better. From reading books and talking to therapists, I\u2019m pretty confident the issue starts with being denied real connections with my caregiver at an early age. Because of the trauma process, it just created a self reinforcing behavior that further isolated me in all of my interactions, well into adulthood. My approach at the moment is forming a real connection with myself. The goal is to have healthy connections with others, relationships where I\u2019m not bound by insecurity and loneliness. It\u2019s really hard to imagine manufacturing love of yourself from within yourself, making something from nothing, but it\u2019s the best hope I got.

{"ewenb2d": {"text": "Surely. So Pete Walker talks a bit about self parenting in his book _Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving_ and I\u2019ve kind of adapted that a bit to suit myself. (I can\u2019t recall completely everything he wrote on it so I won\u2019t attempt to summarize it and will instead just talk about my approach.) The premise is that as children we were denied a caring, nurturing relationship with our caregiver, a person we are biologically programmed to seek love and approval from, and who we model our own emotional reactions after. We will never be able to go back in time give ourselves what we lacked in those times, but even as adults, our inner child still very much still has those needs. So with that in mind, the idea is to act or treat our selves now like the caregiver we needed then. It goes like this: periodically throughout my day I will take a moment and just examine myself, state of mind, surface level problems or victories, and just imagine that I\u2019m discussing this with a parent that I trusted and loved. It might be something simple or something involved. \u201cI\u2019m worried about this coming semester. I know I can succeed if I buckle down but I guess I\u2019m not sure I will.\u201d Or \u201cI went on a date with a girl I really like. I feel hopeful about her, I want her to feel the same about me.\u201d Or \u201cMy room is a disaster right now. I think I\u2019m depressed.\u201d And then I try to imagine myself having a child I adored, whose happiness and success was my own happiness and success, who had all the potential to succeed were it that he had some guidance, and that child just told me what I had just said. What would I tell him? What would I do? Encourage him to keep his nose to the grindwheel because good things are on the horizon and nothing worthwhile ever comes easy? Or let him know that he needs to take the 10 minutes to just clean and organize, it\u2019s getting out of hand? Or how bout just telling him that he\u2019s doing a great fucking job and he is loved and appreciated? And that\u2019s basically it. I have these conversations with myself throughout the day, some times out loud looking myself in the mirror or talking to myself in the car. I tell myself what I would tell my child. Note that this is not the same thing imagining what I wish my caregiver said. I\u2019m literally putting myself into the role of parent and feeling compassion for my inner child, and interpreting from there. It sounds bizarre maybe but it has done so much help to see myself this way instead of the ego-rotting perspective of myself that had been projected on me. Pete Walker talked about imagining being an adult and sitting your younger self on your lap, telling him or her that they are safe and loved and a bunch of other things. Ultimately this is about feeling Good Enough from within. It\u2019s a sense we should have developed in a nurturing environment, but instead we seek it from without because it is unobtainable to us from within. And when we don\u2019t get it, it crushes us like a paper cup. Anyways, thats my bit. Hope it helps, I\u2019m happy to answer anything else", "link_id": "t3_cnlm16", "time": 1565329803}}

It is of course dismissive, and it belittles the unique struggle we face. It still irritates tf out of me but I know (or at least choose to believe) that what they _mean_ is \"life is hard, and I feel your struggle.\" And that's fine, even if I don't think they do, because they are at least _attempting_ to empathize.If it's not coming from a place of empathy but of judgement or dismissiveness then fuck em. Seriously, just shrug them off. You allowed yourself to be vulnerable about your issues and they reciprocated by basically saying they weren't interested in knowing the exact details of your particular battle; your struggles may be unique but having to struggle is not, so they don't think what your dealing with is worth mentioning. It's unhelpful at best, downright psychopathic at worst. As someone who had all compassion beat out of me when I was young and tender I can tell you there is no reaching someone like that.

So maybe a week ago I was spiraling pretty good, getting into insane arguments in my head and screaming in my car, having violent fantasies, all in response to these jerking pangs of fear in my gut. Every time I got a pang from thinking about my problems I flew right back into a semi-psychotic rage.So I tell my therapist about this somewhere towards the end of the session and he asks me what I\u2019m arguing about. I tell him and he asks why that matters to me. I tell him why I think it matters and he points out that I\u2019m still trying to control things by yelling my way through it, by getting people who aren\u2019t even in my life anymore to see things my way, because I\u2019m right and I know better and they would see that if they would just fucking listen to me.Shit.

I kept reminding myself what my therapist said; this is completely normal. Eventually, the fear subsided. The fear was the real cptsd reaction. It was a flashback of being tormented as a child for feeling this way. Once the fear was calmed, all I was left with was the emotional bedrock. True sadness. True loss. It\u2019s a feeling just like anger, with all of the physical and mental postures and sensations, just different.

She's been selling sex and murder to people for centuries, playing a game of favors and blackmail to achieve status and fortune literally all her life. She's fucked up, yo&gt; Ortega fell in love with a 250 year old sociopathic terrorist who happened to be in her boyfriend's body?Ortega is rashness incarnate. Her attraction to Kovacs isn't that surprising, considering the situation, considering his eminence, considering her feelings to the greater conspiracy that swallowed her life up and left her barren and empty&gt; Kovacs is a sociopathic terrorist, uh, with a heart of gold, or something?Kovacs just came off ice into a world that's familiar but wrong, everyone he knows is dead and he has zero connection to his humanity at all. In the first episode he almost chooses the darkness over life because he has no grounding, but over the course of the season he begins to question his humanity and purpose and develop meaningful connections. Honestly, as a veteran, this is always the stupidest fucking arc for me to see in movies; the bitter war-hardened badass suddenly reconnects with his/her humanity and learns to care again. But it worked here, and I believed it. Kovacs chose between absolute nothingness and life in the first episode, it makes sense for him to start developing meaningful connections to people. And through the flashbacks we see that Kovacs always had a sense of justice. As a kid, and as a militant activist.&gt; And, uh, why is Meriam fucking with her husband and drugging him, then fucking the Jihadi they unfroze from 250 years ago?Meriam is sociopathic, as are the rest of the meths, this was a theme that was reinforced multiple times in every episode&gt; And like, actually tho, wtf Rei, why wait 250 years to unfreeze your brothe no. His stack was apparently lost even to her, until she convinced someone with even more pull to pick it up. She even tried to have dimi the twin pick him up the night he was sleeved, but that went to shit. &gt; Also, Meths, what is with the whole wanting to fuck people to death thing?Meths have been living too long, have too much control, and life has no mystery, no consequence, no justice. They do what they do because they are like undisciplined children and all of creation is their toys. Who wouldn't get bored with fucking vanilla after the first couple of lifetimesThis was just my interpretation obviously, but what really irks me about the way you describe it is that you can't see how tragic that final moment was when Kovacs pulled the trigger on his sister. She literally gave up her humanity to save him, she became pure evil in order to amass the power and influence to have him resurrected back from oblivion. And when she finally got what she had worked for centuries to accomplish, she couldn't even connect with him because she'd become an unrecognizable wraith. She wanted to reconnect, but could only do it in the way this life had taught her: coercing people and killing the unwilling. And in the end she was practically begging him to kill her. She knew what she had become, and she was disgusted with having evaded justice all this time, she knew she couldn't stop herself.And no one is talking about how Kovacs pulled the trigger on his own stack.

{"dpjcn9t": {"text": "I guess I\u2019ll start?  I\u2019ve never been good at fighting games because I\u2019ve never put the time in. It always felt like a rapid fire Rock Paper Scissors game. After being subbed to  for several months tho (because the sub reminds me of pre-reddit internet) I realized there was more to them than mashing and hoping.  So I bought GG Xrd (PC) on my wishlist and bought it when it went on sale. Absolutely loving the game. The learning curve isn\u2019t that brutal and the missions/combo modes are fun af. It almost feels like a rythm game or something. Since Nov1 I\u2019ve logged 18 hours just playing solo/with friends, but I realized there was no online community, so last night I upgraded to Xrd2.  I was only able to find people to play with in the With Friends! option as all the Lobby rooms were deserted. I played 5 matches and every opponent crushed me like a paper cup (even got perfected on by a fkn Ramlethal, my least fav match up.) I have used the links in the sidebar but it is a lot of info and I\u2019m chunking through it. The crash course is helpful. I often feel, tho, that the game moves really fast to put most of that stuff into practice. so these are my questions:-Where is everybody?-Is getting brutalized in online matches helpful or should I just be using episode/dojo? Simply spectating opened me up to possibilities I hadn\u2019t considered (like using roman cancel with Johnny to dash again quickly and close distance somewhat safely)-I\u2019m using an xbox controller and having difficulty consistently getting inputs correct. Johnny\u2019s coin toss is easy af but I still miss it. Actually I\u2019m stuck on mission 8 (hit confirming with ky) because the input for his sacred heart move is too difficult to nail in the time window of the combo. I can get it sometimes but not 3/5 times. So do controller users find more ease with the Dpad or the stick? I looked down at my controller and there was a fine rubber dust on the left side where my thumb had grinded off the lining on the thumbstick so I went to Dpad-I chose to main Johnny for no reason other than I love his style. The coin thing is just awesome and there\u2019s something really cool to me about a quickhand cowboy with a katana. The combo into coin&gt;coin&gt; into mist finer is just fkn sik. But his gap closers feel extremely vulnerable and he has zero projectiles. Anything outside of close to middle range and I feel like it\u2019s a scramble. I get punished for closing in and punished for staying far. Am I off base on this? What are some common strategies for closing gaps? I\u2019ve been practicing with my dash blocking but it feels like there are frames when I can\u2019t cancel the dash, and my opponents know this and exploit it. -what really should I be doing rn? Whats a goal I can work towards? I\u2019ve completed the game on normal and almost on hard. Thanks for your time.

This is the second worst movie I\u2019ve ever seen in theaters, the first being american assassin, which was also staring an actor previously from a series where they were special for no fucking reason and again are special for no fucking reason. I can\u2019t talk enough shit about this movie. I respected all of these actors before seeing it, but it just goes to show how much a shit script and director can squander the talents of an exceptionally gifted cast", "link_id": "t3_75961q", "time": 1507565569}}

They could keep a blank character sheet on them as they slowly figure out they can understand elvish and have a really high stealth roll, or maybe that taking 15 damage knocked them out. If they are a caster, you might tell them that their character recognized the words to the goblin shaman's fire bolt cantrip and realized that they can cast that cantrip as well.I'm not in love with the idea that you'd be making everyone's character for them, but I think it makes the most sense as far as the gameplay mechanics.

{"dhvizn3": {"text": "Waking up with amnesia on a derelict spaceship after hundreds of years is the plot of [Pandorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandorum).I think the not knowing your stats might be amusing for a bit. Like attempting to jump across a pit and finding out you have no athletic ability, or one-shotting an enemy and discovering you're really strong. I'm not sure how that would work with spellcasting tho, as it requires a ton of preparation on the caster's part, as well as the players. So the way I'm envisioning this working is your PC's start at level 0 and are classless (but not raceless) wanderers, who's classes are determined by the events of the campaign. One PC may find a battleaxe and begin wielding it in combat. As he begins downing more enemies with it, he becomes a capable fighter, and classes as such. A caster might instead be given a choice for a staff that grants him the use of the eldrich blast cantrip or fire bolt cantrip. If they choose the eldrich blast staff, they later make contact with an extra-planar entity that offers power for service. Otherwise they may find themselves surging with magical energy, producing random effects. If they start seeking spells like a fanatic, they may take on the path of a wizard later.I think this would be a cool starting point because you would play through the actions that shape your character. Normally you just explain *how* your character came to be a wizard, monk, druid etc., but this way you live it.I would say since the PCs have amnesia, they have no proficiencies, save languages, but they aren't aware what languages they speak until they are confronted with it. As the game progresses, the things they do give them proficiency over time (like wearing armor or shooting a bow) OR certain things might trigger memories. Like they pick up a bow and realize nocking an arrow is as natural as breathing, or, not thinking about it, they cast a spell they didn't know they knew at an opportune moment. For the level 0 phase of the game I would have everyone using the same max hp (unless their race would give them bonuses to constitution) and all attack rolls being the same, like 8 + 1d12, since there are no stats yet. They could class up on reaching level 1.", "link_id": "t3_6ckvf0", "time": 1495429943}}

{"dhs3lt3": {"text": "Hey this is a wealth of interesting ideas! You're clearly operating on another level!! I'll respond to your points separately. &gt; why nightmares? Nightmares are innocuous and difficult to source, but can have devastating impacts on a person's psychology (this is explored in-depth throughout the campaign.) In my world, the threat of war looms on the horizon due to escalating border skirmishes. The BBEG's patron draws power from the suffering of mortals, so he is not only trying to haunt his victims but influence them into going to war. The war would allow his cult to spread and bring on all the atrocities that come with it.&gt; if you like the whole *hag-Azmodeus-yugoloth theme/line* of this story, might i suggest the nightmares are some kind of low-grade exploratory creature looking for souls that are ripe for the taking (i.e. neutral evil or close to it). In the meantime these quasi-intelligent ghost-like things lurk in the shadows of the mind turning fears to life in the astral plane... if that was your idea, i like it.You mean they are like beasts, simply looking for a snack? And they shit actual nightmare beings into existence within the astral plane? This is a reeaally cool idea. That's not what I was thinking but I may be able to work with it. &gt; The BBEG need not be dead. Yugoloth were enslaved and hated it, in their mind this is the worst torture. They would NEVER want to kill anyone. They would want to punt someone around for all eternity. Especially when they can track where your soul goes and keep giving you new bodies.Hey this is even better than what I thought! As the BBEG is defeated and his mortal coil begins to fail, he laughs, coughing blood, and promises to return, for he has the favor of his god. And just as he slips, he sees the drow approach and pull something out of his tunic. \"We'll see about that, old friend\" he says, smiling hatefully. The drow reveals his true form, and opens the soul vessel in his hand. BBEG's eyes grow slightly wider for a moment, fists clench, and with his last breath, squeaks \"Nnnnnnnnhhhh\" before his body goes limp. P E R F E C T &gt; not only do these four books still exist but anyone can make a copy of these passages and control whatever yugoloth are featured on these pages. That gives yet more ideas!Maybe BBEG got a hold of one of these passages? This would be more plausible than him stumbling over a celestial artifact one day. I don't think it requires much more exposition, tho. It might be sufficient to say that a powerful magic wielder learned the name of a demon and bound it to service.&gt; Your BBEG of BBEGs (an Arcanaloth) is probably being attacked by its yugoloth family. Sent by your BBEG or friend-allies of that BBEG, these guys keep showing up and doing their job. The yugoloth are probably a) all dear old friends b) never trust one anther c) have been fighting one another for centuries thanks to these stupid Four Books. d) get that this 'infighting' is nothing personal e) most get that an Arcanaloth is the smartest and most powerful and kind of want him to win.Hey this is interesting. It might be difficult to work into the rest of the narrative. These are pretty low level PC's, I'm not sure how I would handle DC 10+ encounters while maintaining that these extraplanar fiends are very dangerous. But I like the \"orders is orders, nothing personal\" bit of it. &gt; your BBEG of BBEG of BBEGs could be anyone who is just a bit gormless with a photo copy of that Arcanaloth's Fourth Book instalment. Imagine, any 'inspired' caster (cleric, bard, warlock &amp;/or sorcerer) could easily control this powerful Arcanaloth with a scrap of paper. You could have your own fiendish version of [*Much Ado About Nothing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Ado_About_Nothing).This is genius, and if the campaign continues this will definitely find it's way into later adventures, but probably *after* they've been introduced. Remember these are low level PCs and just encountering a yugaloth is extraordinary &gt; If EVER your players are about to be crushed by a smart caster you can have someone that spots this Arcanaloth standing still a bit too long and WHOMP your fiend. I'm not sure I follow this last bit. The arcanoloth attacks a party member?&gt; You will have to work out what spells are in the Arcanaloth's book.As it is right now his role is simply for intrigue. Having him cast spells might blow his cover if he's posing as a drow tracker, and he wouldn't be able to attack his master. &gt; he may be a she, she may be sympathetic to a hag group that is 'rebelling' against other hag trios. This would be a manipulative relationship on both sides but your Arcanaloth would deeply enjoy both the suffering, the control of suffering and the irony.This is interesting but I'm not sure I follow. I like that the arcanoloth delights in meddling, but it seems a bit tangential. I really hope I can use this, it sounds like fun!Thanks for your bit of brainstorming! I'll definitely credit you in my handouts haha", "link_id": "t3_6c2poj", "time": 1495221771}}

{"dhs0liz": {"text": "Great advice! Tyvm! I think I can seed bits of information so the players aren't lost or I'm abusing exposition. The campaigns we have played so far have been fairly straightforward dungeon crawls with literal mine cart rails to follow. In beginning to design this, I wanted a lot more interaction from NPCs that could either help, deceive or refuse the group if they can't 'crack' them. I wanted my high charisma PCs to feel important, as well as spells like 'friends' to be meaningful, and for the group to feel like their choice of words can change outcomes. I started to generate branching trees of outcomes if the players don't engage with certain hooks. I think I can recycle the plot points with different contexts, tho. For instance, choosing not to follow the boisterous dwarf headlong into the unknown gives them an opportunity to encounter a local crime boss that wants them to recover one of his spies from another gang, since they are unaffiliated and won't provoke a war. If they do follow the dwarf, this same quest would be offered later by the constable to free an undercover agent who's cover had been blown. Either way, the person they free has information that will advance their main quest.This is my approach to avoiding railroading.  What do you think, could this work? Ultimately I realize the most important thing is that I let the group decides what it wants to do and give them believable, dramatic outcomes, and this may derail from what I've prepared. It's maybe not a true sandbox, but this is my first homebrew. ", "link_id": "t3_6c2poj", "time": 1495218370}}
