I eventually decided that I didn't care what people think or feel about me, I was gonna get my life back. I discovered that if you're honest with people about your condition they are usually very understanding, not all, but most. Now your therapist is right. In most cases therapy without medication is very ineffective. And it sounds to me either your mother is ignorant of mental illness in today's society or she's afraid of how it makes her look. If you're an adult go and find  a doctor to prescribe you medication yourself. If your a minor talk to your mom and tell here you want/need medication regardless of how you're looked upon. If she refuses talk to your therapist and a social worker about options of overriding her. Even if it means getting a child advocate or calling Child Protective Services because you need help and she is being a negligent parent. You don't have to live like this there is help.

My visual hallucinations manifested as moving shadows and movement out of the corner of my eyes. My paranoia came out as a extreme fear of the dark in my home and I would jump at ever little thing. I used to think there was something evil in the dark. I slept with all the lights in the house on. I stayes at a friend's house to test my auditory hallucinations. They still happened. When I went to a mental health clinic I told them about it. They told me that where my bipolar disorder had went untreated for so long it causes slight brain disorder affecting other functions besides my moods. It's sorta like brain damage. As long as my medication continues to work I'm ok but when I develop a tolerance my symptoms restart. I recommend seeing a doctor to diagnose and treat you.

In our area it's cheaper to marry due to tough child support laws. The mother or father won't care about the spouse and still have affairs simply because they know if they try divorce the child support laws are in their favor. The guys do more or less the same thing, but with a twist. They use manipulation and emotional abuse to lower the woman's self esteem to the point they think they can't find anyone else.

{"fsikl8r": {"text": "I don't know if this is gonna help, but let me tell you my story. I had an emotionally and physically abusive father. My mother knew he abused me emotionally, but she didn't have a clue he was beating me. I never told her cause I thought that being beaten black and blue on the back and arms and butt was what parents were supposed to do. I hated him growing up. When I turned 18, I got a job and was making good money. I thought about moving out but I was afraid for my mother's saftey. So I stayed. When I was 26 my mother died of cancer. My father got sick and was suffering from kidney failure. He totally changed. His muscles wasted away to nothing, he couldn't walk without a walker and someone to steady him, he couldn't feed himself, he couldn't control his bowels or his bladder, and he got dementia to the point he didn't know anything. My hate for him turned to pity. So I stayed and helped take care of him. Because, I realized that this husk of a man could never hurt me unless I let him control my hate and fear. I used to have violent nightmares about him chasing me and hitting me. I realized I couldn't change what happened to me but I could choose how it defined me. So I learned how to treat people, wives, girlfriends, and children by doing the OPPOSITE of what he did. He taught me to be a better, stronger, loving person by being what he wasn't. When I was 30 he passed away and I forgave him. I've never forgotten what he did nor did I ever think he was in the right. After I forgave him, my nightmares stopped, and he no longer has a hold on me. Now forgiveness is a long road it can take years. Now if I was you, I'd see about seeing a therapist or a guidance counselor to try and sort out your feelings about it. And maybe if after some therapy you can see if you're parents really want to change and maybe you could do family therapy. But remember, YOU ARE NEVER THE PROBLEM! And what you do with this can make you a stronger better person. I hope this helps you. Good luck!", "link_id": "t3_gufzaj", "time": 1591009271}}
