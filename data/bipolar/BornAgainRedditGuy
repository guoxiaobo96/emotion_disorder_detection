It took me going to the darkest place I've ever been before I finally swallowed my pride and sought treatment. But it's not all butterflies and sunshine yet. Medication helped, but I was put on the wrong medications (VERY common among those with bipolar) and I didn't bother talking to my psychiatrist about it because I just wanted to get our appointments over with. Each appointment with him was 5 minutes at the most. I was cool with that until I got tired of the side-effects of my medication and developed a drinking problem as a coping mechanism. I still couldn't talk about my suffering with anyone. Jim Beam became a father figure to me.But I'm trying to do my part in fighting the stigma against mentally ill men. I'm beginning to open up to friends and family, mostly just telling them I am bipolar and speaking about it clinically. They aren't ready to hear about my episodes in detail haha. Also, quarantine has been really rough on me and triggered a bunch of fucked up shit. I'm a grad student but I haven't been able to do any work on classes or my thesis.

I have a lot of traditionally masculine qualities and I like a lot of traditionally masculine things, not out of insecurity but because that's genuinely who I am. But even then, I ignored and hid my mental health struggles out of pride and to a greater extent, fear. I really want better discussion on men's issues. Discussions about them now devolve into toxic arguments that don't do shit for anyone.

{"fhkwcze": {"text": "I'm a day late to this, but this is a topic I really want to be able to discuss productively. I grew up on a wrestling mat and I was a coach for two years, plus I was a competitive powerlifter for a couple years. But for wrestling specifically, it's such a great sport and did so much for me personally. I think anybody should be able to do it because it's such a unique experience and builds a ton of character. Getting your ass kicked for two years and slowly getting better and better until you are the one kicking people's asses is so rewarding as you can see the value of your hard work.There's always been a few girls who wrestled, but over the last couple years girls' wrestling is becoming more of a thing. I'm really glad to see that and I want it to keep growing, because there are plenty of girls who kick boys asses and the women on the world teams and in the olympics are phenomenal wrestlers. Trans kids shouldn't be shut out from these experiences and opportunities for growth. But unfortunately, combat sports and strength sports tend to be pretty republican. The wrestling community isn't saying shit about Jim Jordan, for instance. And the powerlifting community can get pretty alt-righty. So naturally, the participation of trans-people in these sports quickly becomes a toxic conversation. In general, men are stronger than women, with a few obvious exceptions. Stefi Cohen being the one that sticks out to me. She can deadlift nearly 6 times her own body weight, pound-for-pound making her one of the strongest people on Earth. Plus she seems like a super nice person. But trans-women are not men, they are women. And vice versa. I personally think that trans-women systematically kicking the shit out of their competitors is overblown and reactionary, but there are a handful of instances of that happening. I have also heard that hormone treatments over time can level out any initial advantages/disadvantages. Ultimately, as far as these advantages/disadvantages go, one thing that wrestling taught me is that there will always be someone stronger than you, better than you, hungrier than you, etc. I wonder if specifically getting upset over the advantage trans-women have over their competition, to the extent that it exists, is really just a case of missing the forest for the trees. When I was in middle school I occasionally had to wrestle boys that were jacked and already had moustaches. Sure, I was at a disadvantage strength-wise. But was it necessarily unfair? I beat kids I had no business beating, because I found a way to do it. In any match, one wrestler will always have some type of advantage over the other. So this so-called \"advantage\" that trans-women have over their competition maybe shouldn't be considered any different than wrestling someone quicker than you, stronger than you, etc. I've heard a story about a trans-woman fighter who had recently transitioned entered a competition as a woman and didn't say anything about being trans. This fighter beat the shit out of her opponents at a dangerous level. But painting all trans athletes with the same brush as this one specific asshole is unfair and reactionary.", "link_id": "t3_f2zndw", "time": 1581692394}}

{"f742dnj": {"text": "After a post I made yesterday about how I urgently need to quit drinking, I bought 3 boxes of apple cider mix. Having some now. I think it'll also help me cut back on coffee, which is probably good as well. I'm going to clean up my apartment a little, I find myself needing to do that quite frequently. Then I'm going to do some studying from home.All that being said, I did meet up with a buddy last night for a beer. I got home by 7:30 and had the lightest beers they had. It was a brewery in my city. If anybody lives in the Baltimore area check out Suspended Brewery in Pigtown if you'd like. I opened up to my friend about my mental health struggles and also how my youngest sister is starting to show the same symptoms I started getting at her age and asked him for some advice on talking to her about it. It was a good conversation. Also, I've mentioned on here about my academic pursuits. I was planning on taking the PhD qualifying exam this January so I could get into the PhD program. But midterms didn't go so well and I really need to focus on my GPA right now because it's lower than it should be and the school is putting pressure on me for that. I'm also beginning research right now and there's pressure on me for that. Earlier last week I was sitting in class glazed over thinking about all the shit I have to do, and I realized that there's no way I'll be ready for the PhD exam. I decided it's in my best interest to just focus on my Master's for now and just worry about a PhD later. This way I'll at least have a Master's to fall back on, and that's a good place to be. So that's taking some pressure off of me.Things are good. I'm not going to drink any alcohol tonight or tomorrow. Things are looking up.\u00a0", "link_id": "t3_dub2b1", "time": 1573397566}}

The problem with the way he wants to implement it is that his intention is for it to replace welfare programs. So let's say if you get disability and food stamps, etc. and you receive about $1000 a month in government assistance. Yang's plan is to give people on these programs the choice between being on those programs or getting $1000 a month. So if they are already receiving that much, then UBI doesn't do anything for them but rebrand the assistance they get.Additionally, if you aren't on any government assistance but you rent rather than own your home, that $1000 a month isn't going to help you either. As soon as people start getting $1000 extra each month, then all of a sudden landlords will be getting an extra $1000 per month from each of their tenants. Without rent control in place, much of this money will go straight to landlords.Now, if you own your home and aren't on any government assistance programs, then that extra $1000 a month is actually an extra $1000. While I do like the idea of a UBI, it has to be implemented alongside already existing programs rather than replace them. $1000 a month isn't enough. And there will have to be nationwide rent control as well to keep landlords from taking advantage of their tenants.

I will repeatedly tell myself that not only will I never find love, but that I am incapable of it and that I don't deserve love and general happiness. I have been going in and out of a very weird state of mind over the last several months where I've had a fixation on this. But one day last week I had an epiphany. Dying alone is a very common fear that most people have in general, but obviously for me my mental illness magnifies this fear to a level that is detrimental to my health. And every time I get this fixation on not deserving love, it's actually a defense mechanism for me to deal with this fear. It's hard to explain because it's frankly just absurd. I'm a good dude, and a human, so of course I deserve it. But these episodes make me feel like I'm not a human like everyone else to some degree. This detatchment is a way for me to rationlize these fears to myself. So last week, out of nowhere, I thought to myself \"I'm not afraid to die alone\". When I say that, it's not me accepting that I WILL die alone, it's just telling myself that I'm not afraid to. And all of a sudden I wasn't having those dark thoughts anymore and I've actually had a little bit of hope that I actually am capable of finding love someday.I know this sounds like some  material. And I'm sure that this is just a natural progression of moving in and out of episodes and that realization, much like my dark thoughts, are ultimately not under my control. So it's not like I willed myself out of depression or \"made the choice to be happy\", because obviously both of those are just dumb. My point is, I think that feeling is very common among people with our illness. So maybe it might help if you try to look inside yourself and see where these thoughts are coming from, if you can.

I appealed it and got it all back, but I was freaking out. I'm pretty sure I would have qualified for Medicaid, but still. I went through all that stress in part because the priorities in our health care system put private companies' profits over health. It's fucked up that public health, including my own sanity, is being treated as a commodity.And it's not just that. Mental illness, aside from depression and anxiety which have become socially acceptable, is made into a scapegoat for violence in our country. If a black or brown person kills people then it's because of black and brown people, but if a white person kills people then its a \"mental health\" issue. And since over 90% of domestic terrorism in the US over the last few decades has been carried out by radical right wing white extremists, we have politicians talking about monitoring people with serious mental illnesses as a fix. All because they wouldn't dare take a stance against the radical right or against the absurd about of guns in our country. Which of course goes back to capitalism. The right wing in this country will do anything to keep increasing the amount of guns in this country because our neoliberal capitalism has made it so that defense contractors are oligarchs pulling the strings for where our tax dollars go. But yeah, let's just blame the crazies and take their money so defense contractors and insurance companies can profit off of public misery.

First, just before finals, a professor whose lab I was going to be joining told me that he didn't have funding for me. So I was SOL there. In a search to find funding, I started asking around wherever I could to find a TA position for the fall semester while I find a new research opportunity. Everywhere I went was a bust. My own department head told me that since I didn't have an adviser there was no point in giving me a TA position and he brushed me aside. So I couldn't find funding, but it wasn't the end of the world because I still had my loan.Then, a couple weeks later, I received a notice that I had been placed on financial aid restriction due to my GPA being below a 3.0. So I didn't have funding, didn't have a direction to go in research, and couldn't access my loan to even attend classes. This also prevented me from getting a TA position as well. And around that time I also decided I want to pursue a PhD as well. My GPA was only low because of an intense depressive episode I had during finals in the fall semester. So I've been grinding all summer and finally this morning I got everything worked out. For the first few weeks of summer I looked all over my department for interesting research, and I'm now working with a professor on a cool topic, and that professor is my adviser now. He's a good dude, and also has some collaborators that I will be working with outside the university. Also, I submitted an appeal against my financial aid restriction about a month and a half ago, and finally got a notice that my appeal had been approved yesterday. So not only can I get my loan, but I can get a TA position now, which I submitted the paperwork for this morning. Fucking finally. I can relax now.", "link_id": "t3_cq7yc6", "time": 1565793543}}

I lost 30 lbs due to not eating. I'm not strong anymore. I don't even look strong. My clothes fit better though. My point is, if you're going to do an intense sport like a combat sport or a strength sport, you need to be smart with how you go about it. Make sure you are taking good care of your body and make sure you are doing a well-rounded training routine. For instance, I never stretched much as a lifter, nor did I do any hip training. The combination of those two negligences led to me damaging my hamstrings in my left leg, preventing me from squatting or deadlifting without a ton of pain. I'm going to ease back into it.Also, fuck what your friend says. Intense sports are great for mental illness. I wrestled when I was in school (ages 10 - 18), and my mood was always stable during wrestling season.

Something I realized last night, it's hard for me to pursue hookups or anything casual with women because I associate sex with love, and my brain won't let me believe I deserve love. And since I can't convince myself I deserve anyone's love it's hard for me to try and pursue dating. Yesterday I got it into my head that I can't be loved because all I am is someone's fetish. A lot of the time I have myself convinced that the only reason a woman would want to date a crazy guy like me is to either manipulate/gaslight me into doing whatever she wants, or for the story so she can talk about that one time she dated a bipolar guy.

I love my students, I enjoy working with kids, but it's not what I'm looking for in a fulfilling career. Next school year, I'm going back to school full time to pursue a masters in engineering. I don't even know if I'll be an engineer forever, but you're young and you have a lot of time ahead of you. You'll be young for longer than you think.

Thus, when doing incline dumbbell, it was putting a lot of pressure on my shoulder.I stopped doing incline dumbbell, but kept doing the regular barbell bench, because 1) I needed to and 2) it didn't aggravate my shoulder. I did this until I no longer felt any pain in my shoulder (a month or two), and started doing incline dumbbell again but with proper form. Haven't had any shoulder pain since.All I did was figure out specifically what upper body exercise was hurting my shoulder and stopped doing it, while still doing others that didn't hurt my shoulder.

{"dt8xuen": {"text": "I was doing deadlifts yesterday and an employee at my gym told me I was a monster, so that's a pretty cool feeling. I've been doing my own program for a cycle, and I like it so far. I can already see some improvements in my lifts. My bench especially. I don't think my max has gone up significantly, but it's definitely much more controlled. Earlier this week I did a clean set of four reps at 260, whereas not too long ago I would've struggled pretty hard. I feel more confident in my bench. I'm testing my maxes after this cycle. I think my bench is around 290-295, my squat is in the low 400s somewhere, and my deadlift is in the mid 500s. This is all based on my top sets. I do an AMRAP set for my last working set each day (inspired by the 5/3/1 I was running previously). I like my current program a lot more than the 5/3/1, though 5/3/1 is a great program and I saw good success with it.Non-powerlifting related, I decided I want to make a change in my career. I'm currently a teacher, and I've been doing that for a couple years. But I'm going to be honest, its rough. I'm a pretty mentally tough guy, so if my heart is in something then I'll deal with the hardships to achieve what I want. But I'm burnt out on teaching. So I decided that I'm going to finish this school year and I'll be applying to graduate schools. I want to pursue a Masters in Engineering, and start my own engineering firm. I believe in the importance of education, and I believe in what I do as a teacher (although most of the time it feels like I'm busting my ass for nothing, I can explain what I mean if an explanation is necessary), but what I want to do is pave my own way. I want to live by my own rules and create my own legacy. I want to answer to myself, not a school district ran by people without an education background.

{"doqm5k7": {"text": "In the process of making some changes in my life. I've been working on quitting smoking/dipping. It's difficult, but I use nicotine patches and that makes it a lot easier. However I will sometimes forget to put my patch on before work in the morning, and that 100% of the time leads to me buying some tobacco at the end of the day. I'm a teacher, so my stress levels are pretty much always high. Stress leads to substance abuse for me.I also realized today that I really need to cut down on my drinking. I had a buddy over last night to watch the Notre Dame - USC game. I'm a huge ND football fan, but I barely watched this game. I started drinking at like 3:00 pm and by the time my buddy got to my place I had already drank like 8 IPAs. I was just sitting in my apartment just throwing back drinks for no reason. Just because I had them.I don't think I drink enough to have a problem, but I do think it's a problem that I drink as much as I do. A few weeks ago I had a rough day at work and when I got home I threw back a six pack of PBR Tallboys and smoked like half a pack of cigarettes. I did this on  a Tuesday evening. I don't do that a lot, but I always drink somewhat heavily on the weekends. I don't get hammered drunk often, but whenever I'm drinking with someone, I always drink way more. Once I start drinking, I find it very difficult to stop myself. I'm not addicted to alcohol, but I am addicted to getting a buzz. When I start drinking, and I feel a little buzz, I start chugging to get my buzz stronger and to maintain it. I do this primarily on the weekends, but I feel like it affects me during the week. I'm always tired. Alcohol keeps you from getting a restful sleep. As a teacher and a powerlifter, I need sleep because I undergo a lot of physical and emotional stress. Even though I'm not an alcoholic getting blackout drunk all the time, I think I need to make some changes now before I do become that way. I can feel myself forming a dependence on alcohol. I've never used it as a coping mechanism, but lately there's been instances where I have. Take good care of your bodies young grasshoppers.

He told me to hand over my ID and get off the train.I used my credit card to pay for the ticket, so I had proof that I paid on my phone. I told the cop this and he said that was cool.

They gave the other guy his ticket and said he was free to go. When it was my turn, I offered to show them my proof of payment, but they said \"no\" and just gave me a ticket for $50 anyway.

It's a commercial gym, not a powerlifting one, but it has everything I need, the people there are cool, and most of all its convenient.The first year of teaching is so tiring, being a wrestling coach is tiring, and powerlifting training is tiring, and if you do all that you can't get 8 hours of sleep every night. But going into my next year I'll be able to balance my time better. This year I had long periods of time where I was too tired to lift and could NOT catch up on sleep. I felt like a zombie walking around half the time. But somehow I was still able to hit the gym enough over the past year to get stronger.This time last year, before I started my first year teaching and before I moved out of my hometown, my bench was 245, my squat was 335 with terrible form and no belt, and my deadlift was 405 with straps and no belt.  As of now with &gt;3 weeks before my first competition, my bench is around 280, my squat is around 380 (and my form is fixed), and my deadlift is around 500 with no straps. I haven't tested these maxes yet, but they are based on the results of the 5/3/1 program I'm running. The way I see it, if I can deadlift 480 as the last joker set of my 5/3/1+ day and I'm already worn out, then I can hit 500 in a competition. I might be wrong, but I'm going for it on August 5th.", "link_id": "t3_6o6md1", "time": 1500480440}}

{"dkdsbl9": {"text": "One of my favorite stories to tell people involves going to Bub's. I'm from Noblesville and I used to wrestle back in high school. During my senior year season I was cutting from 135 down to 125 every week, so I had a huge appetite and couldn't eat much. Once the season was over, I was eating everything I could get my hands on. One day, me and a wrestling buddy went to Taco Bell and I had two burritos. Then we went to McDonald's and had what we called a \"McGangbang\". For those unaware, a McGangbang is a McDouble and a McChicken, where you split the McDouble in half between the two patties, put the McChicken in between, and then put it back together and eat it like a fat Hoosier. Then we got a call from some other wrestling friends to meet up at Bub's. So we went right down there and had to wait a while. I tried picking a fight with some Carmel basketball players, because 1.  our towns hate each other, and 2.  this was right after the \"Carmel Basketball incident\".  For those who aren't in the know, some Carmel High School basketball players molested a freshman trainer for the team on a bus. They fingered his butt and laughed about it. Privileged jerks. There was footage of them in the holding cell after being arrested and one of them was in there practicing his golf swing. They weren't worried because you can sexually assault someone and get away with it if you're rich. Anyway, once we sat down to eat, I had the Big Ugly, and I finished it. My picture is on the wall there and I look miserable in it. I felt terrible. On the picture, I drew a frowny-face on the plate to let everyone know how bad I felt. Now, there wasn't much time in between each meal, just travel time from one place to another. If I hadn't made those two stops beforehand, I could've eating 2 Big Ugly's that day.", "link_id": "t3_6nvcv0", "time": 1500391072}}

McGregor's only chance to beat him is to get him to break his style and become aggressive, and maybe he would make a mistake and McGregor could catch him. But I don't see that happening. McGregor said he's going to go with a Southpaw stance, which Mayweather has struggled (just a little) with in the past. Southpaw is supposed to mimic a left-handed boxer's stance (not an expert on boxing, so correct me if I'm wrong), and it's supposed to be harder to stop left handed jabs. But Pacquiao was left handed and only landed 9% of his jabs against Mayweather. Just spend like 5 minutes online reading about this fight and you'll see McGregor doesn't stand a chance. He's not going to get into Mayweather's head, and Mayweather will go back into retirement 50-0.", "link_id": "t3_6nnihi", "time": 1500230656}}

{"dige7lp": {"text": "I appreciate this post, man. I'm a teacher at a very diverse school. About half of my students are black, then approximately a quarter are white and a quarter are hispanic, but I have a decent amount of Asian and Middle-Eastern students too. I have straight, gay, and transgender students. My students, in there diverse backgrounds, have a diverse array of adversity that they will have to overcome. And as their teacher, I work hard to give all of my students the best educational experience I can give them. I try to push all of my students to strive to be their best. Many of my students have struggles that I, as a white man, do not have to face. I try to stay aware of the inherent privilege I have been born with. That's not to say I've never struggled with anything, because I've been through some shit. Being white won't protect me from heartbreak. But my struggles don't de-legitimize the struggles of others. Just because my life hasn't been a cake-walk doesn't mean that white privilege doesn't exist. Because it does. To my understanding, white privilege means I don't have to be a victim of the systematic oppression in this country. And it bothers me to see people not even trying to understand that.If you say the phrase \"white privilege\" then a bunch of people come out of the woodworks saying that white privilege doesn't exist because there are white people who also have it hard. I don't believe that most of the people saying that are racist. And I don't believe that the people in that thread the other day saying white people should be allowed to say the n-word are racist either. But I do believe that denying the existence of racism, systematic oppression, and white privilege, as well as making light of them, is ultimately destructive. I think some white people want to deny or make light of such things because their existence makes them uncomfortable. But what's worse? White people being uncomfortable with the truth, or halting progress? When I was younger, I was one of those people who denied that racism still existed. And I was one of those people who made light of racial issues. Until I was called out on it. I was called out for having ignorant views, and while it did make me uncomfortable, it also made me think. It made me think about the real impact my beliefs and words had on other people, and I grew out of it. I grew to realize that I didn't know as much as I thought, and that I needed to listen to others. That experience made me into a better person. If I still had the opinions I had when I was a teenager, then maybe I would be skeptical when my students talk about their struggles. And if I had those opinions, I might end up seeing those students as \"whiny\" or like they don't want to try, and then I might not push them as hard. But I do my best to understand what experiences my students have when they're not in my classroom, because I want all of my students to succeed. I want all of my students, black or white, asian or hispanic, gay or straight or transgender, to grow up into happy and successful adults. I recently recommended a student of mine for a scholarship that is awarded to black students who want to go to college to pursue a STEM-related career. This is a very competitive scholarship program and there are others like it, and they exist for a reason. But denying those reasons does nothing but allow systematic oppression to continue. This ended up being a really long post. So I'll wrap it up here. But somebody could read this and call me corny (I've been called corny on this sub before for saying similar things), or they could call me a SJW, or feel any type of way. But if you're offended by reading this, then ask yourself one thing: What's worse? You being uncomfortable, or halting progress?", "link_id": "t3_6f5xjl", "time": 1496604902}}

But basically you just have to find what works for you. People suggested singles bars as well as Tinder, and none of that stuff works for me. I'm a decent looking dude, but I tried Tinder and got zero matches. And for chatting up women at bars, I just get too nervous to approach women in that context. For me, the best thing to do is find friends first and meet women as my social circle increases.What are you looking for? Hook-ups or dating? Because me personally, I'm not a hook-up guy, I'm a relationship guy. Maybe that mindset is part of why Tinder and singles bars don't work for me. Or maybe I'm just overconfident in my looks lol.

{"dh08bqi": {"text": "I had a student who brought a gun to school one year. Now, I know what people are thinking when they read that first sentence. People are probably thinking he was going to shoot someone at school. But long story short, he brought it on accident. This kid lived in a rough part of town. A few months prior to the incident, his cousin was murdered, and someone handed him the gun and told him he needs to protect himself. He kept it in his room, and no one knew he had it. He would take it with him when he went around the neighborhood just in case. One weekend, he went to a party and brought the gun with him in his backpack. The following Monday he came to school and put his backpack on the x-ray machine (imagine the conveyor belt x-ray machines they use for airport security, we have those at our school. All kids have to put their backpacks through it before they can enter the building). As soon as he set it down, he heard a thud, and remembered that the gun was in there. He forgot to take it out before he left for school.So he immediately put his hands up and told the security guards what was in it. He didn't want any more trouble than he was already in.So he went to the security office, the police came, and took him to jail. It breaks my heart because this kid was a good kid. He never caused any trouble in my class or anyone else's. It was a complete shock to anyone who had him as a student. This kid was a good football player, and I enjoyed talking to him in my class. Even if he wasn't super interested in what I was teaching lol. This kid wanted to become an electrician after high school, and I was helping him get resources for how to get in to that.I was talking with his dean about possibly being a character witness for him when it goes to court, because he was a good kid. Imagine being in his shoes. Imagine that you are 16 years old, live in a rough neighborhood, and one of your cousins has recently been murdered. On top of that, someone hands you a gun to protect yourself with it. This kid was scared and depressed, and he was going through more than any 16 year old kid should have to go through. I didn't hear a lot about him after the incident, but to my understanding he ended up OK, since that was his first offense of any kind and since he was a minor.", "link_id": "t3_68ma2h", "time": 1493680148}}

{"dgch6ix": {"text": "Happy Easter everyone.Now I know you guys want to talk about Kendrick, and I do too. But I'm here to talk about something else entirely. I've been binging Game of Thrones again lately and I've figured out a couple things about how I think it will end. I'm not on any Game of Thrones forums or anything, and I've never read the books, so the stuff I \"figured out\" might be obvious and old news to some, but I'm excited either way.It started out with me thinking this: what are the three things we know of that kill White Walkers? Answer: Dragonglass, Fire, and Valyrian Steel.Now what do these three things have in common? Here's what I think, it's dragons. Fire is obvious, dragons breathe fire. But what about the other two? Dragonglass is also called obsidian, which is a volcanic rock. When Arya and the gang were at Harrenhall, they saw that some of the castle was melted. Someone said that only dragon fire is hot enough to melt stone like that, and since obsidian (dragonglass) is molten rock, I think the molten stone at that castle turned into obsidian. So I think obsidian is made by dragon fire melting stone (hence the name \"dragon glass\").So I think once Daenarys gets to Westeros they will use the dragons to make dragonglass. I don't know how it will get to that point, but that's where I think it will go.Also, the secrets to making Valyrian steel were lost with the city of Valyria itself, just like Damascus steel in real life. Valyria was powerful for centuries because they had dragons. If fire kills white walkers, and dragon glass kills white walkers (possibly because its made with dragon fire), then I think that Valyrian steel was forged with dragon fire. I think when Sam is studying at the Citadel he will figure out how both obsidian and Valyrian steel are made, and they will use the dragons to make both.Also, I think the dragons are going to fly around the Army of the Dead and burn the shit out of the white walkers. It's a pretty popular theory and I'll be disappointed if that doesn't happen. But I also think that Bran is going to use his warg powers to get in the head of one of the dragons to more strategically kill the white walkers. I also think that Arya will use her murder skills to kill Cersei. TLDR: New Kendrick is too dope.", "link_id": "t3_65qw9g", "time": 1492372166}}

There's a fine line though, because if you're the \"fun\" teacher then it will be hard to keep your class in order. But the way I see it, if I'm going to spend half my waking life in that school, then I'm going to enjoy it. So I'll tell jokes in my lecture, talk shit to the kids, and it's all gravy.
