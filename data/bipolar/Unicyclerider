First, figure out who you are and what you want in life and then go from there. I can understand wanting to be \"normal\" and not having a mental illness, but (excuse my french) fuck normal! \"Normal\" people are the ones who make you who you are and you will stand out in the crowned one day! Don't be afraid to cry. Those emotions are just letting you know you are human! Lastly, you want purpose in life? What is it you like to do? What do you want to do when you \"grow up?\" Start thinking of that know and don't wait until you're 18; 21; 30! At these ages, your depression will get worse if you don't act on them now!
