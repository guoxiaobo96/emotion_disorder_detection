Hack a Bic lighter uses flint mechanism.Anyway, I see you managed to pop off that little black plastic cover, from what I can tell that's the outlet valve/flame adjustment. That cover is just a way to make it easier for users to adjust the valve by twisting it with their thumb.So this means this is a butane lighter, 100%.Which that leaves the last remaining mechanic, the circular looking cover with a pin in the center. It is most likely the fill valve. Now there are no standard valves, different manufacturers make them differently. I personally haven't seen a valve like that before, maybe you can pop off or twist the little metal plate off? However I don't see why a pin-like mechanism would be exposed like that if that's a covering. Or maybe you can fill the lighter by simply by pushing the pin down with a can of butane gas. On second thought, the pin maybe a convenient way to bleed the valve (by pushing down the pin), so most likely you need to remove the metal covering in order to fill it. Not sure where you live, but I usually order butane cans online, they almost always come adapters to fit various valves.

I believe there is very little difference between light class 3's so pick which ever you want. Even though Magus (dark-dark) is the most \"powerful\" magician with the strongest spell/move in the game, but being able to spam Lucent Beam+ in the late game against the undead enemy is much more useful (can't do that with dark classes).For Hawkeye, I would go nightblade (dark-dark) as debuff and have a few non-elemental damaging moves/spells. He is also great at dark class 2 and can learn many spells/moves before meeting the elementals, (I guess fire jitsu is not technically a magic move but a ninja move). But Angela covers a lot of the spell/moves so I find Haweye somewhat redundant, I usually just control Angela and spam spells (can be hard on money/lucre because faerie walnut is expensive). Light Class Hawkeye gets very unique spells/moves and might not be good for beginners, but I think overall the game is easy so in the end it really doesn't matter what class you pick lol.For Duran... that's a hard choice.I find sabers very useful, but that can be covered with items. However the effect does not last the whole round, particularly boss fights, so having saber moves from Duran (dark classes) can be useful. I personally find sabers only useful at boss fights. Now if you go dark with Duran, you won't have any healing spells in the party, which is actually fine because you will have enough items to last you, especially if you explore the maps thoroughly and pick up free items/chests. But if you go light Duran you get a cool shield and he works well as a tank supposedly.TL:DR:Light AngelaDark Haweye (nightblade is better imo)Dark Duran for attack power or Light Duran for tank and healing", "link_id": "t3_ggmv3y", "time": 1589057697}}

{"dbeg8di": {"text": "The Ronson runs on lighter fluid/liquid fuel, easiest to refill and repair. But like zippos, they have the tendency to let the fuel evaporate, would probably need a refill every week.Depending on the condition, it's worth from 10 USD to upward of maybe $100. I don't remember see any Ronsons in the 100s though.I wouldn't pay more than $20 for the ronson in the link, but maybe because it's cheaper to get one in US, so estimate might be off.I don't know much about the ibello lighters, I mostly collect Ronsons, Zippos, Sarome and Imco. I like Dunhill lighters too but they can be very expensive, but very stylish IMO. I managed to get a liquid fuel Dunhill, it works too!The ibellos likely run on butane, which can be difficult to refill since the gaskets/seals are probably harden and leaky.Some very few lighters use pre-filled cartridges that cannot be refilled, and manufacturers don't make the cartridges anymore, obviously.Although I have seen pre-filled cartridges being modified and allow refill, but I wouldn't trust the work. It is pressurized gas fuel after all.I have personally repaired a few butane lighters, at about 75% success rate.", "link_id": "t3_5i6i67", "time": 1482190244}}
