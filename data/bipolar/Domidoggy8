We're at 89 people before accounting for caterers and photographers. I hate being the center of attention and would love nothing more than to elope but my fiance won't have it. I sat here for a good couple minutes trying to articulate why he won't have it but basically familial obligation to his parents since his brother is a hot mess and will be the last to marry (if at all).I feel like I'm taking this on myself and I despise it. Nothing gets done without me nagging (took months to get a list of names for wedding guests on his side). It's been half a month since he decided that he wants a church ceremony but he's yet to reach out to the person he wants to officiate or to the church for that matter. We have less than a year until the wedding and I can't even contact photographers until he gets things figured out for the ceremony. I was diagnosed with bipolar in March and I'm doing more than enough struggling without having wedding planning on top of it. I'm having to relearn how to handle myself and communicate effectively. There's a lot of guilt that I bring to our relationship with the diagnosis but that will hopefully be figured out in time with therapy. The diagnosis makes me fear that I'm setting up our marriage to fail, as a large percentage of bipolar marriages do. Anyways, enough of me venting in your venting post. I'm not sure how traditional your wedding beliefs are but I went wedding dress shopping with just my fiance.

Long story short, best thing that could've happened. I was constantly anxious and was upset about not being able to please my bosses no matter what I did. I couldn't understand why the previous law firm owner was pleased with my performance but the new owners were so displeased. I was in tears on my way home more than once.I learned a hard lesson about how naive I can be and that I need question lies more often. I also learned to be truthful if you can't manage your workload. Most of all, get out of that job if you repeatedly aren't able to live up to their standards no matter how hard you try. It is better to end it before being fired than it is to have to admit to being fired during every job interview. You won't get many calls back if you've been fired.I will never work for a law firm again. I'm a CSR for a local company and it's very different from what most people think of when you say a CSR. I have never been yelled at by a customer because our customers are other companies. I work 8-5 and am not restricted when it comes to things like when I can go to the bathroom and how often. I don't have any sort of quota to fill, I just have to make sure our customers get what they need when they need it.

{"ej8b5yk": {"text": "I was diagnosed earlier this month with Bipolar 2. I've only had one hypomanic episode but got help once I realized what the symptoms were. The second day, I was absolutely elated. This was a very stark contrast to the depression I've been dealing with for around 9 years. My happiness was so obvious that my fiance commented on it and I told him that I thought something was wrong. The same day, I got too close to a car in front of me after they cut me off. Driving aggressively is absolutely not me. The third day, I was irritable. I've been irritable since last October but never to this degree. I flew into a rage over my fiance leaving an oven mitt on the counter. I genuinely wanted to put my fist through the wall. I told myself that I was not going to become my grandfather. My grandfather was very scary when his Bipolar 1 was not managed properly. I still remember walking my cousins around the block when the cops came after he threw the remote at my grandma as well as the time that he threatened to kill my dog after my dog got in between my grandfather and mom during an argument. That moment and those memories made me realize that what I was experiencing was not normal and I needed help. The third day, I had a bad panic attack while at work where my heart rate was 136. There was nothing that should've caused the panic attack. I also had abnormal thoughts due to irritability, like wanting to tell a coworker to shut up. I was so anxious in traffic that I was fidgeting with my coat zipper, something I had never done. The fourth day, I was really talkative but I can't recall any other symptoms. I saw my primary care physician on this day and we created a game plan. I had been referred to a psychiatrist in December but was told that their schedule was still 5-7 months out. Fortunately, the social worker at my dr's office meets with a psychiatrist every Thursday and presents cases like mine where medication recommendations are needed. The fifth day, I was extremely outgoing, talkative, and social. I met with the social worker and got my diagnosis of Bipolar 2. During the last 5 days, I had easily spent a few hundred dollars. The sixth, and last day, I had a lot of energy in the morning and crashed in the evening. I sleep a ton, partially as a coping mechanism for depression and partially because my sleep is never refreshing no matter how much I get. I slept 5 hours that night and woke up at 4 am. I decided at about 5 that eggs sounded really good. I got up at 5:30 and made my fiance breakfast in bed. I NEVER make breakfast at 5:30 am, I'm barely conscious at that point. I was so awake that I only drank one cup of coffee instead of my normal two cups, and I could've gone easily without any caffeine but I had already made my cup and was unwilling to waste it. My thoughts were racing and again, I was really social and talkative.The day after my hypomanic episode ended, my social worker called me with a plan for medication that she and the psychiatrist came up with. I started Lamictal with gradual doses that will reach 150 mg. in early April and will be completely weaned off of my anti-depressant, Desvenlafaxine, in a 2 weeks. I am so grateful for my \"team\" of health care professionals who have taken of me every step of the way, especially when I was unable to get the help I needed without going to a psychiatric hospital.If you have an awful memory like me, I would highly suggest writing down what you're experiencing.

Everyone is different though and for me, it was worth the shot to pinpoint a medication that would work.The test also has financial assistance based on income, which was heaven-sent for me since I'm still paying off a surgery from over a year ago. I paid $25 out of pocket for the test. Even if the medications don't work (or in my case, are diagnosed with Bipolar shortly after), you're not out a huge amount of money depending on your income.

This happened many times and I still have no clue what it might have been.In the same house, baby toys would frequently go off in the basement. It wasn't until years after we moved out that my mom told me that she refused to go into the basement because the toys that were going off hadn't had batteries for several years. Another weird experience was after my aunt unexpectly died back in 2007 when I was 12. I was standing in front of a mirror in my great-grandparent's bedroom, brushing my hair to prepare for her funeral. I looked up and saw my aunt standing behind me. She mouthed the words \"I'm ok and I love you sweetheart\" to me before I looked behind me to check if she was there. She wasn't and she was gone when I looked at the mirror again. I'm not sure if this was a trick of my mind or if I truly saw her ghost that day. My other aunt had a dream about my deceased aunt a few months after she died. My deceased aunt was holding a baby and told my aunt how beautiful her (my living aunt's) baby boy was. My aunt took a pregnancy test and found out she was pregnant. The baby ended up being a boy.

{"dlizuqd": {"text": "My aunt had either accidentally or intentionally overdosed on sleeping medication in 2007. My cousin, who is a year younger than I am, was 11 at the time and had fallen asleep in bed with her while watching one of the Spiderman movies. He woke up in the middle of the night and she wasn't breathing. He got the guy who was renting a room in the house from them and called 911. The fire department responded because my aunt and my grandma were the EMS workers on call that night (the aunt that died also worked as a dispatcher at the base that the rest of my family members worked at).My cousin who is 3 years younger than me found her step-brother after he hung himself in the basement. He was upset that his mom wouldn't let him go live with his older sister in Texas. He had tried to commit suicide by ingesting Tylenol less than 24 hours prior to hanging himself. He was taken to the ER but hadn't been kept for suicide watch for some reason. He then went home and was left on his own without being checked on that he was able to hang himself. Every kid in that particular part of the family has been institutionalized at least once for trying to commit suicide. Coincidence? I think not.Another story is from my uncle who watched a man die and couldn't do anything. He's an EMS worker and one night was driving in the ambulance down a highway out in the middle of nowhere. A truck behind him flipped and was carrying gasoline. The truck caught fire before he and the other EMS worker could get the guy out. They stood there having to wait for firefighters to arrive, listening to the poor guy scream as he burned alive and not being able to do anything. My own story was that this past May, I was driving to work at my new job. I work about 3 blocks from a court house and there's a park right across the street from the court house.

A different family member was recently accused of abuse by about 100 people. There were absolutely no signs whatsoever to him having another side and had someone ever suggested to me that my family member was a pedophile prior to people coming forward, I would have laughed and asked if they had ever met my family member.After about 20 people came forward, I remembered that there were a few times where I felt uncomfortable with the way that family member looked at me. I chalked it up to just being me due to my childhood experience. This family member was outwardly a very good-hearted person who did a lot to help my family.

The sensor isn't particularly great unless you're just passing by the mirror or your face is inches away from the mirror. I dislike that it doesn't really adjust past the mirror's face swiveling up and down. That's an easy fix by placing it on top of a small box or something to bring it to my eye level but for the price, people shouldn't have to resort to that. Initially, I had to use my boyfriend's iPhone to pair the mirror with the app because it wouldn't work with my phone (Android). I have no issues now that it's been paired and I can adjust light settings just fine. Just a small annoyance that took me a day to figure out how to fix. I thought that I would use the lighting settings a lot more than I do but I think waking up at 5:45 for work deters me from doing anything unnecessary, such as messing with a mirror's lighting since I use a light box for SAD year round while I do my makeup.", "link_id": "t3_6lpbxy", "time": 1499533448}}
