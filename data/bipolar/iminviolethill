I work in the call center industry and these bonuses are meaningful and very valuable and do contribute to performance, * If structuring performance bonuses around a group/team, what would be the best methods? or unintended consequences?Not sure about this one, it would largely depend on what kind of people you're handlind (age/gender etc)* What kind of benefits are most important to those living in Guatemala?Schedule flexibility? (A lot of Guatemalans study and work at the same time) Transportation? (Public transportation here sucks) * Are there significant generational differences in the importance placed on careers?I would say yes, specially because some of the younger generations are very career focused* What are the best ways to structure performance reviews? Frequency? I don't have too much experience in this but the place I work for has weekly coaching sessions and it works well. * Should we prioritize public recognition to promote exceptional performance?I have no idea about this one * Our sales support members are currently working in dedicated account teams rather than as a pooled resource. Would it be better for our team members to be working as a pooled resource to encourage team work and to better align with Guatemalan workplace structures? * From a Guatemalan perspective, does offering flexible workplace arrangements (being able to run errands during the day, working from home, etc) undermine the importance of the work that we\u2019re doing? Hmmmm... I would say you would have to establish  strict rules if you are going to allow this * Should we publicly share and focus on team metrics/KPIs over individuals ones? Team * What are the best and most important ways to incorporate family and culture into our workplace environment? incorporate traditions, special days, understanding that guatemalan people are vey family oriented,. * Are there significant differences between how compensation is structured in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador?

{"f1g5mzj": {"text": "My best advice is to play around, buy affordable things in different colors, finishes (matte, dewy, shimmer etc) until you find something that you feel good in! makeup has no rules and that is the beauty of it. I have a couple of transgender friends and they have had trouble with facial hair, so if that is an issue with you looking up color correcting tutorials can be useful. I really recommend you to look at Lisa Elridge's tutorials. She does many tutorials and looks in people with different types of skin tones, complexions and features. Also, I think it can be a little bit overwhelming when you see beauty gurus do a 40 step beauty routine with many steps, as a makeup artist myself I can tell you that is not necessary at all in real life, unless you feel comfortable with it.
