{"fnfhiyp": {"text": "I had to figure out which ones I could deal with and which ones were dealbreakers. Like depakote, as long as I stay under 1000mg I\u2019m fine but any more and my hair starts to fall out, which I\u2019m not cool with. Because of this I won\u2019t raise my depakote. The sedation of seroquel was actually dangerous because I had to get up so early for work that I would be falling asleep driving and just out of it until early afternoon. Had to ditch it. I was on invega for two years and it was great but it messed with my hormones which caused me to have no period for a year and gain about 75lbs which is just ridiculous. I had to come off of it even though it worked so well because I couldn\u2019t continue gaining weight. My weight gain leveled off but I\u2019ve yet to lose any unfortunately. And lithium...just...fuck lithium. I will never touch that shit again. All sorts of side effects but the worst was the tremors, I couldn\u2019t even read my own handwriting. Those were all side effects I couldn\u2019t handle. I\u2019ve had other side effects that I just deal with bc the med works so well for me. For example, lamictal blurred my vision, but also gave me my life back, so I just got stronger glasses.", "link_id": "t3_g15bei", "time": 1586908160}}

Obviously old school anti psychotics are known for TD. But that hasn\u2019t solved the problem.But as to your original question, I remember one time when I was still trying to get meds figured out I tried seroquel. It worked really well but sedated me too much so I ditched it. When I tried it again a few months later it did diddly squat. So there may be some truth that stopping and starting the same med might alter its effectiveness. But I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any empirical evidence to confirm.Also, just so you know, you risk seizures if you just cold turkey quit lamictal so make sure you taper down, and if you want to go back on it you\u2019ll hAve to do the same slow taper you did in the beginning to minimize risk of SJS.

I got everything under control, had a good six years med/therapy free, and then my mood swings started again. It was clear to me that it was bipolar this time though, as the mood swings were not related or triggered by any situational event in my life.
