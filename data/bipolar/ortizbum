{"ehi4fws": {"text": "I would suggest to not take it personal.  We live in a culture where we all like to be the victim but not the oppressor.  The truth is that we are both the victim and the oppressor (the world is not just black and white, good and evil like we like to believe to simplify what we cant fully understand).  Trust me, we've all been there.  And the excrutiating feeling it produces makes me prefer 10X more to be the victim rather than the oppressor.  The victim gets social support, the oppressor gets social rejection.  I just put my energy towards learning how to not define my identity based on what other people think of me - that's when social rejection hurts the most. Focus on what you think of them and not on what they think of you, and you'll start to see things from a totally different perspective.  When you hurt someone you like/admire for who they are, how they act, etc., you will focus more on changing the action so that you wont hurt that person again.  You wont feel remorse because you are not focused on what that person thinks of you now; instead, you are focused on what they feel now as a result of your actions. So, you will focus on not hurting that person again instead of geting them to like you again. Thats a shift from feeling remorse and wishing youd never done something wrong  because now everybody thinks badly of you.  Remorse is a drastic distortion of the self image we get from others.  Regret is the wish that that self image we get from others had never changed.  Empathy is when we feel what the other person is feeling as a result of our actions.  Definitely aim for empathy because that means that youve been focusing on what you think/like/dislike about other people, and as a result you construct a separate identity for yourself.  Construct your identify from what you like of others and not from what you think they like of you. This is definitely more productive, helps you grow, and is less painful.

My mom was critical in my recovery after I got out of the hospital and I will list some things she did for me that really helped me and strengthened my relationship with her. 1. She trusted me and had confidence in me when I didnt have it myself.  This was huge for me because when you are mentally ill your \"rationality\" is thrown into doubt.  Even your ability to take care for yourself is thrown into doubt.  Remind her that you believe in her and that she can win this, instead of feeling sorry for her (if she's already doing that she doesnt need more self pity). 2. She taught me how to knit and brought me stuff that would distract my mind (like jigsaw puzzles, coloring books; she would even make me wash the dishes and do laundry right after I got out of the hospital).  Make her feel functional not disfunctional.  Give her little tasks to do, like cleaning, washing dishes, doing laundry, so that she senses she is slowing incorporating back into her daily life. 3. Listen to her (even to the most bizarre stuff).  Some things may sound dilusional to you, but they are very real to her, so dont dismiss it. You dont have to engage in her delusion (I wouldnt suggest that), but do try to listen to her because that will give her experience legitimacy. When you go through hell and back, the last thing you want someone to say to you is that your experience wasnt real.  I really hope she gets better soon and that you guys can work through this.

{"egobti0": {"text": "Wow, I felt like you were describing me at some point.  I shaved my head in college and I guess it made me feel liberated and like a different person.  That was kind of an extreme, so I decide to dye my hair if I am looking to feeling/looking different.  I've struggled with an eating disorder as well for many years, so I think the shaving part added to me feeling like I scaped the monotony look of myself in the mirror for a moment.  You know, when you have an eating disorder sometimes it may feel like you're trapped in your own body, so a change of look can help ease those feelings.  In terms of the bipolar, it can be a little more complicated.  There are definitely triggers for moods - it can be people, situations, things.  For me, I really try my best to recognize those triggers and not run away from them, but instead learn how to deal with them.  I try to link them to a new situation.  For example, there was this song I would listen to that would really make me sad because it made me remember a lot of hard things I went to.  It triggered a big emotional response in me and made me remember a lot of bad thoughts, so I would often get lost in those thoughts or contemplate them too much, leading myself to depression.  What I did to deal with it was that I looked up the singer's story on the song/why he wrote it and what it meant for him.  So, now everytime that song is playing I think about what it means for the singer and why he wrote it, which helps me deviate from my own feelings of the song.  This can work for other triggers of emotions as well, but it can get a little tricky.  I know people tend to run away from triggers or prevent them as a coping mechanism, but I find it hard to live a social life that way.  So, I try to face my triggers head on.  Dealing with bipolar can take a lot of self discipline and perseverance, especially without medication.   ", "link_id": "t3_arm7b9", "time": 1550428276}}

The problem is that when it comes to the mind, we're still very far away from understanding all its complexitites. So, it is unclear when a mental condition is not controllable anymore.  And telling someone \"you can't control this, so take these pills\" might actually further unable the person from controlling it.  In that case, I think the person should draw the line where they think their mental state is not controllable instead of the doctor drawing that line for them.  For example, if everytime a child misbehaved we told them \"don't worry, you couldn't control it,\" we enable the child to remove themselves from his/her behavior, and he always will have an excuse for misbehaving instead of taking responsability for him/herself.  Finally, calling an opposing opinion simply \"ignorant\" reflects more ignorance in itself with respect to understanding a different perspective from yours.
