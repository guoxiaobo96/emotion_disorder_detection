I ask because I am and I know we have a tendency to think that everyone knows and understands our history.)---So, POC being in a  position of power  =/= no systemic racism. The fact is that the United States was founded on the systemic oppression of POC. This ties back, of course, to slavery. Look at Black Codes from this era. Look at Jim Crow laws. Look at our language and our laws concerning the very existence of POC throughout history. Look at The Great Migration (and the second Great Migration). When these things ended, they did not simply vanish. They influenced the way POC are treated to this day, though they no longer exist. This is the systemic racism that I'm talking about. Though these systems have been (mostly/partly/depends on who you ask) dismantled, they still influence our society. So yes, there is still systemic racism in this country.If you're interested in reading material, I can connect you with some that explains it better than I can.

{"fly5ajb": {"text": "Your response to the other commenter was unecessarily rude, but I'll answer your questions.&gt;At this point any order from any store has about a five to seven day delay. Orders from Costco are unavailable. I am assuming that is because it takes too long for it to make economic sense for a shopper to do a Costco run.&gt;Could someone explain how it works if I place my order today and the first slot is on Thursday theoretically.&gt;How does instacart know that a shopper is available on Thursday but not until then. The delivery windows are super far out because more people are using Instacart than ever before because of the pandemic. The system really isn't built to accommodate this many people. There are more orders than shoppers (which is why they're hiring so many more), and only so much time in which to deliver. The app doesn't know that the shoppers is only available on Thursday because the app doesn't work that way. It's been pushed out because that's the first available slot.&gt;What factors does a shopper use in evaluating whether to accept an offer? I have read that some orders are so unattractive that they won't be accepted. So far I haven't had that issue and I assume a more or less standard order of $150 with a 10% from a store that is fairly close wouldn't be declined.&gt;I find the backstory interesting in terms of orders being accepted based on how *attractive* the job is - e.g. difficulty of fulfilling the order; total amount to be made etc. It differs for each shopper, but overall most shoppers like to make sure that the pay is worth the gas, the mileage, the time shopping, etc. Instacart doesn't pay well for the mileage and shopping per item part, so shoppers look for good tips. Tipping $2 on an 80 item, $300 order means it'll sit until someone new or desperate takes it. If you want your order snapped up, tip decently. Especially in these times. We're being overwhelmed with massive orders that pay about $10 and tip $2. We're working twice as hard because the stores are sold out of everything and we need to hunt down replacements, because there are limits to items that you've requested, because there's a frickin pandemic out and people are acting like you're doing them a favor.

I joined right after my graduation with my degree, but my team had some kids that had just finished high school and others that were taking a break from undergrad. Everyone comes from different experiences and different backgrounds and there were a LOT of growing pains, but we've gotten into a great rhythm, probably thanks to our second deployment.&amp;#x200B;To answer your question. Our FQS is PA, and we received training specific to site inspections, but we didn't do any. Our first round we worked at the CRC in Virginia and supported the various lanes. We all used a lot of Grants Manager and got pretty comfortable with it. Our first round was cut short when we were deployed to Florida for Hurricane Michael relief. We did DSA the entire round. It was exhausting, but probably the most frustrating and fulfilling thing I've ever done. Our third round, we ended up getting sent right back to Florida to work in the Branch 1 office supporting the mission. We work in IRC, Hazard Mit, PA, IA, and Planning. So overall, we didn't travel much. &amp;#x200B;Other teams from our campus went to Philly, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Puerto Rico, Kansas City, DC, Florida, etc. There's no way to tell how much or how little you'll get to travel.
