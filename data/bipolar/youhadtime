You may be bipolar, idk, but THAT is not a bipolar episode. While ultra-rapid cycling exists, it\u2019s super rare and in the majority of cases we need to be careful to define episodes as those that last for x amount of days (I could look up what it is in the DSM but I don\u2019t have the time rn), that they check multiple boxes on the BP symptoms list and that cause significant impairment to your life/functioning.I may be a little bitter than most though. I had a friend who went to a psychiatrist with a list of classic BP symptoms (after I shared my story with him in detail) and argued for a diagnosis that he later used to get out of assignments, drop classes without losing financial aid, etc., all the while carrying on normally in every way. I\u2019ve known him very well for YEARS and he most definitely does not have bipolar...but he\u2019s convinced that he does...because he thinks any kind of minor mood swings are a mental illness and he seems to pride himself on how many diagnoses he can collect.

Not taking responsibility for his actions and how he hurt you is a huge red flag, imo.\u2014My experience: I was best friends with this super charming, funny, sweet guy (we described eachother as \u201cplatonically married\u201d because we were such perfect friends, we\u2019re both queer and we spent almost every day together so I knew him very intimately) and after the honeymoon phase of our friendship (8months), that sweet version of him started to dissipate when we were alone together.At this time I was diagnosed with BD and I was talking to him in detail about what I was going through. A week later he told me he had gone to the doctor (not a pdoc) and received a BP II diagnosis...even though there were absolutely no signs of depression, hypomania, mixed episodes, anything. Another red flag.He remained close to me for a bit longer but I started to see through this nice guy personality and it was obvious by what I saw and what he told other people that he didn\u2019t have BD. The picture he was painting made no sense, he told some people he was depressed and others that he was manic in the same day, usually to gain accommodations or sympathy, and I really really really didn\u2019t want to believe that my best friend was lying.Then he told me he found a loophole for a summer course he signed up for \u2014 he found out he could keep the financial aid he was given over the summer if he medically withdrew before the end of semester. It was evident that had no intention of finishing that class (he never went to class and would email his professor saying he was depressed when he was perfectly fine) and eventually dropped the class because of his \u201cdepression\u201d. After that everything fell apart and I started seeing discrepancies between reality and what he was telling people, and me.Soon after I started researching why he was doing this and I came across the term \u201cCovert Narcissism\u201d and realized he fit the description perfectly. Before getting out of that friendship I (subtly) questioned him further and nothing he said matched up with BD, even though he was using the disorder as an excuse for his shitty behavior, similar to your boyfriend. He couldn\u2019t name his symptoms, his patterns, his current mood state and at the end he slipped and told me he was only taking the valium he was prescribed because the mood stabilizers did nothing (I wonder why...). Eventually he knew I was seeing through him and he began a smear campaign in order to discredit me, telling people I was mistaken and was going through an episode.Long reply. Mostly just ranting. It\u2019s totally plausible that your boyfriend is bipolar and nothing like my situation, but I like to share my story just in case anyone here can relate.I hope things get better for you two and that this is just a bump in the road, but don\u2019t ignore the red flags and do your research on this disorder regardless of what\u2019s behind this behavior.&lt;3", "link_id": "t3_9s7u7y", "time": 1540849795}}

The job fell through a few days before I was supposed to get all the paperwork in order, after I had told my family and stopped applying for other jobs. I ended up having to work at a local italian restaurant for about six months before finding something in my field because I was broke and disheartened. I was a great employee for the first two months and I enjoyed the flow to it but then one day my soul was just sucked out. Too many customers coming up to my register and shouting their orders at me before I could say hello or people lying to me to get free food. Had this one guy in his 60s come up to order some gelato who asked me what I studied in college. When I told him where I went to school and what I majored in he scoffed and said, \"I'm sure your parents are proud you're scooping gelato with that degree\". I was speechless. It got to me.There were a few good moments though. I had a regular who always found me when he came to pick up his food and we would talk about Shonda Rhimes and film and I would give him free cookies. There was an old italian lady who came into the restaurant every week with homemade food because she insisted we don't make *real* italian food.The most memorable moment was this sweet elderly woman who asked me to help her choose a dinner and wine for her husband. We had a popular little italian market so people could pick up their own ingredients and she spoke to me away from everybody else. She said that she's getting her scans back tomorrow that will confirm or deny that she has cancer. She was especially worried for her husband, whose first wife had died from cancer. She wanted to make them one last meal, just the two of them and a bottle of wine, before they got any of the results. I spent a lot of time with her, talked her through the menu, suggested my favorite wine and sat with her while my manager boxed up her food. I hope she heard good news the next day, but I never saw her again.I guess it took me out of the \"I need to find a career or I'm a failure\" mindset and placed me in the real world in a way I hadn't been before. At first I settled into the job and stopped looking for anything more but as soon as I had a steady paycheck I was able to relax and refocus. In hindsight, I felt too much guilt for not working in a job that reflected my degree. But whatever. I learned that things fall through and there's no shame in any kind of work and you gotta do what you gotta do to survive.

It had to do with the end of the world, the end of humanity and my place in all of it. I ended being chosen for a mission to see if there was life on another planet and when I stepped off the ship I died a slow death by suffocation that felt so real I woke up to my roommate shaking me awake because he thought I couldn't breathe. I remembered every detail. I remember accepting my death as I took my last breath. And I felt and feel different, like there was a before and after the Dream.It wasn't until about a month ago that the dream began to replay over and over in my head. Weird things started happening around me and I couldn't ignore how strongly I felt that I was supposed to dream that dream and that I was on the verge of something life-changing.I began \"leaning into it\", or not blowing signs off as coincidences and really listening to them because something that feels *this good* can't be ignored, right? Soon after I stumbled into a tarot reading by somebody who had been doing it for 30+ years. The reading confirmed everything -- my old self was dead and I was being reborn as a new self that had been a culmination of everything before this point. I went home and dove in and came to the conclusion that I believe something Big is coming and I have to get ready for it. I have a special role in preparing for it and leading society through the Big Thing when it happens, as if I was part a of a divine team. I've been packing bags and buying maps and radios and reading up on survival skills just in case something goes down.I see myself as a realist and logical person, not a doomsdayer or a conspiracy nut. But I *do* recognize I've made a lot of connections lately based off of feeling alone. But other people get to follow their hearts and make decisions based off of feeling so why can't I? And I've heard arguments that people who are bipolar or schizophrenic are actually just people with the ability to see past the world as we know it into something greater, so even though I know I'm hypomanic I feel like I'm supposed to be.So yeah, maybe I can't get it out of my head that I'm Chosen by the Essence of the Universe to carry out certain work on the earth in preparation for the Big Thing that is going to happen but I'm doing pretty good otherwise and my psych knows I'm in a hypomanic state so...I'm just going to keep on keepin' on and vow not to stop taking my medication on my own and to hopefully keep some sort of insight.

Thankfully all but one professor were happy to help, especially because my work was great, even if I was occasionally late or absent or lacking in participation for a stretch of time.

I don't need extra time on tests and I will always do the readings but often I won't be able to participate in discussions or make it to class). Sometimes it allowed me to request an \"incomplete\" after finals which allowed me to turn in work as late as the end of the next semester. A few others just wanted to know my motivations behind asking for accommodations because, unfortunately, there are people abuse the system.In these meetings (or emails) I always stressed that:a) I'm asking for these accommodations because I have a disability and it's sometime difficult or impossible to attend class.  b) I hopefully won't need these accommodations because I understand the value of being in class.  c) I'd complete an alternative assignment to make up for my absences (I can't leave the house but I can write a semi-coherent essay from bed).  d) If I do need accommodations I will communicate with my professor as soon as possible (usually through email).I encourage you to advocate for yourself because having those accommodations in place will give you such peace of mind. I find that most professors are very reasonable. I even had a couple of incidents when professors or TAs encouraged me to go home because I was obviously sick (whether they knew with what idk).

Your therapist will probably ask you those types of questions and it personally helps if I write things down before I go into a session.", "link_id": "t3_5hv1oe", "time": 1481531309}}
