When I'm in an okay state I exercise regularly and make healthy decisions, I do everything you're supposed to do, but it doesn't stop me from going into a manic/hypomanic or depressed state. My brain is the way it is, and because of this disorder it is in progressive decline.I will continue to make good choices when I can, and try to take care of myself, but I will always be this way. I have gone to sleep excited and on top of the world only to wake up unable to move, like a completely different person, who makes different choices.

Even if my coworkers are offered money from our director I genuinely don't know if I will get any. My position is funded by our children's centre because my job is to support a specific child's participation and needs.

{"fkkw2py": {"text": "I live in Ontario, there are no cases in my city and we are still closed down until April 6th. The children that have contracted COVID-19 typically have very mild symptoms such as the dry cough and fever, it's been shown that people are contagious BEFORE they even show symptoms. Children are the perfect carriers, coughing is often overlooked in children because they'll cough and continue doing what they're doing without any issue, they seem fine. When these children come into contact with others they could potentially be infecting others with the virus, even though they have not been tested because, \"they just have a cough\". Child care centres need to be shut down to prevent the spread of the virus, not because all the children are going to die or have severe symptoms, but because they could potentially pass it to people (ie, their grandparents who love them and just want to spend time with them, regardless of germs) who will have the severe symptoms that could lead to death. Just because it's not severe or life-threatening to some doesn't mean it isn't to others. If you've been exposed and don't show symptoms within 14 days, you don't have it, that's why it's important to close for at least 2 weeks.
