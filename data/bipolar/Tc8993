{"fnax844": {"text": "You're welcome for my comment. And I agree with everything you wrote here in your reply. I suppose I should have put in context my comment about it being 100% And investors fault if they're over-leveraged. I had a specific type of investor in mind, name one of the person with a handful of properties that just kept cashing out equity to acquire more doors. Obviously, this isn't every type of investor. What is very common here on Reddit in this group.So I agree completely with what you wrote about investors being blindsided through no fault of their own. I mean, who really does predict for a pandemic?The spirit of my point, was more people totally ignoring the risks of leverage, and only focusing on the upside; or, potential upside. Risk isn't bad. Neither is leverage. That's the power and beauty of real estate. What is bad is over-leveraged or turning a blind eye to risk. And unfortunately, that's the position many, many investors are in. Regarding the banks and your comment about the 20% who may be forced to sell or want to sell, yes I agree that they will try to sell. The question is, if they are in the position that they have to sell, will they be able to at terms that work?Specifically, even if they personally agreed to a loss, the lender would have to agree to a short sale. So if I cash investor comes in and offers 50% of a ARV, the lender would have to agree.NO WAY will that be happening quickly. And evaluating short sales will be far, far down the list of priorities for lenders once everything picks up again. I think the investors that are in the position to only have 3 or 6 months of rent coverage are in for a tough go over the next year. They may not lose the property because of the freeze on mortgages and foreclosures. But they're going to have one hell of a hole to try to dig out of after this is all done. Especially if they're in a hole after only losing a few months worth of rent, and their numbers not working with even a three-month blip. and regarding gambling, out here in Seattle, which is one of the hottest markets in the country and has been for 5 years, it's full-on gambling  most small investors. The auctions dried up about four years ago, and I stopped trying to do any buy and rehabs about 2 years ago because I just don't have deep enough pockets. and my risk tolerance isn't as high. But I think the risk tolerance in this market isn't even risk, it's foolishness. Most investors are now paying to 80% of the ARV for a flip. The people who this model works for are the people you are buying and selling 40 or 50 houses a year. I know a few of them, and they have deep enough pockets where they tell me that if they make money on a 2 out of 10 deals, they're good for the year. I am not in that position, nor are most of the other investors I know. We need to make money on each deal, and above all, not lose money. But I see person after person just buying whatever so that they're in the game out here, assuming the markets just going to go up or that people will bid the property up. this is not investing. This is gambling. I would never bet on appreciation or the bidding up of a property. but it's been happening here for the last four to five years, and it's only gotten worse because there so few properties available. so I just decided to go on the sidelines a couple of years ago, hold on to what I have, and then just have reserves when either a market correction or market opportunity (I.e. a change in zoning density to allow for more units per lot) appears.And after this pandemic, we're a lot closer to those opportunities than we were even a few months ago. So I think you're very wise to get clear on your own personal risk threshold and where that falls versus gambling FOR YOU personally. Sounds like you're already doing that and that you were in a good spot. Thanks again for your post. And for your comments. I appreciate your thoughtfulness and diplomacy. Stay Well!

Think about what you can bring to the relationship, and begin contacting people. Also, begin looking for your own deals. If you find a good enough deal, it won't be hard to find the money. You're just not going to get it through a bank. and before you start finding your own deals, you should probably backtrack 100 deals. Meaning, evaluate 100 properties, ideally active listings. Run your own numbers, and then come back to them in the near future to see what the results are. this is tangible, real-world experience that you can use once you get started. Not only is this what I would do if I were you. This is exactly what I did to get started about nine years ago. Good luck with everything.

{"fm17gh4": {"text": "Please, look up specifically dr. William Walsh and the Walsh research institute. And his colleague, dr. Albert mensah. Newberry dr. Walsh wrote a book called nutrient power. It's saved my life.In it, he details five genotypes for depression. And he details, at length, women struggling with postpartum depression and bipolar like symptoms.An overwhelming percentage of these women had copper overloads in their system. medium, while pregnant, their body made exponentially more copper to support the growing fetus.However, after birth, much of this copper did not leave their body. And when it doesn't, it very often results and postpartum depression. Dr. Walsh's work and the simple blood test that I received through doctor Mensa a year ago, have changed my life. I haven't take medications for years, but getting the zinc copper ratio in my body corrected has had the single biggest impact of anything I've done for my mental health in the last 25 years.In fact, you can go to his website, the walls research institute.

So please no my post was praised for you, not critiquing you negatively. Because what you wrote and that 1 picture, took me about 10 years to get clear on on myself.And it finally hit me upside the head, then if I wasn't clear on what I did want, all I had to do was list all the things I didn't want, and think about what the opposite is of that.Once I started doing that, it helped so much. Let me be clear, I'm still very clear on what I don't want. Fact, I'm a master of telling myself and people that. It's just that for me, once I reframed it to what I actually want and need and value, I found I became much more supportive, accepting, and encouraging of myself. I guess I best basically became a better friend to myself. So know that you are doing fantastic! Because with codependency, with like so many issues, the first step is just getting clear that we're stuck. In the easiest way to do that is list everything that's wrong and everything that we don't want more of. the truth is, if you read the reply that you wrote to me, you intuitively already working on what you do want! that, you listen several things in that reply that you want. And even wrote that you want that you actually want to begin making a list of what you want!This is fantastic! Again, my original comment was more prodding and encouraging then it was critiquing you.

I've been going to CODA meetings regularly for the past six months. I went about 3 or 4 years ago for a month, and it just didn't jive with me at the time. You wrote that you found \"class\". If the schedule is weekly, I'm assuming this is the regular coda meetings.If it is, then yes, all the meetings are free. When you attend, it's normal to be nervous the first few times. But it's actually a very reserved and calming place. There is no expectation to share. So don't feel like you have to, open when there's silence. There are many people grab not spoken once the entire time that I've attended. But clearly they're getting benefit from attending and being around like-minded people who are trying to heal. Also, during every meeting, they pass around a basket for donations. Most people put in a dollar. But a donation is not required. And the the leader of the group for that night will specifically say that people attending their first second or third meeting, do not make any donation. You're just there to check out the group. at the beginning of the group, they'll also ask if this is anybody's first second or third meeting. Don't be shy about raising your hand. They should also give you a hand out that overviews Kota and explains all the things that the leader talks about / reads at the opening of the meeting. if they don't give you a handout, feel free to ask them if there's any printed information you can look at. I mean, feel free to ask that right at the beginning of the meeting so that you can read along as they are explaining the process. the meetings usually start with about 10 to 15 minutes of the leader reviewing all the cota guidelines. And by the way, and most groups, there is no real leader for the group. It's just someone picks up the binder for that night, and access the leader or the guide. But they all follow the same exact flow and instructions.Then, and the groups I've attended, people take turns reading from a cota book for about 10 minutes. And then that leaves about 1 hour we're people have time to share for about 3 to 4 minutes each whatever they want to share. This is the part where I'm saying don't feel compelled to share.

{"fiwgm0u": {"text": "Hi Cloud.First, THANK YOU VERY MUCH for the time spent in writing your reply, and the detail. I really appreciate it.Second, thank you for your service. Man, sounds like it's been a tough go. Both over there, and here, with everything culminating seemingly at once. I'm glad that you're okay... and even more, that you're still continuing on and still hopeful. Good for you. :-)I can relate to the VA wanting to push meds. I have several mental health diagnosis. Have for nearly 20 years. And I stopped all medication about 15 years ago. All of them, and in all combinations, made me worse. Yet... that's STILL the main tool the VA wants to use. So I'm glad you declined all that.You T sounds as low as mine. Just had the test results follow up last week. My total T was 280, the absolute bottom end of \"normal\". (BTW... up until about 3 years, the \"normal\" range Lab Corp used was about 330. So, they just keep lowering what normal is.) And I workout/lift, eat decent/a lot of protein and healthy fat, etc. And they said T wasn't an issue.  I went to three different docs and they wouldn't refer me to endocrinology. Sounds just like your deal.I'm VERY happy for you that you're finally getting treatment. I bet it will be life changing for you. Sounds like you're already experiencing improvements. Good for you.My overall experience with the VA has been very positive. I've been eligible for care for nearly 25 years, but only sought treatment this past May for suicidal depression. The care I've received in mental health, physical therapy, and ea for surgery and sleep apnea treatment has been terrific. My doctors have all been open minded, curious, and listened to alternative treatments/therapies outside of drugs/pharmaceuticals, even some therapies they personally have never prescribed.However, my primary care provider(s) (I fired one and got another), and their ignorance, ego and stubbornness, have been my biggest hurdles. They have acted as gatekeepers and screeners, rather than partners.Never more so than with my request for endocrine tests (i.e. thyroid, testosterone, etc.) and a referral to endocrinology. It's just not happening.And, as you wrote in your suggestion to seek outside care for the testosterone/hormone issue, the more I've learned about the VA endocrinology department and doctors, the more I'm convinced they wouldn't know what do do, anyway.So, I'm taking your suggestion. I'm going to seek an outside provider. This is no different than what I'm already doing for mental health. I don't take any medications, but found an M.D. that focuses on targeted nutrient therapy. He does my bloodwork and writes a custom compounded nutrient prescription. The VA couldn't fill this, anyway.  As it's only vitamins/minerals, not drugs. I had to pay about $1000 for the initial consult; $400 for initial tests, and then my supplements are about $120/mo. Sounds like hormone/testosterone therapy will be similar. And, will be worth every penny.Because the hormones amplify the depression, anxiety and mood cycles I experience. Even more, however, is the quality of life. The absolute apathy and lack of motivation/initiative is what eats at me the most. I'm NOT lazy, or a victim. Yet, it is literally just so hard physically and mentally to do/pursue/complete what I used to. My threshold for overwhelm has dramatically decreased. And I just want to feel \"normal\" again; normal energy, initiative and outlook. I'm NOT look for super energy or to be the Energize Bunny! just normal, stable and consistent.So, I'm going to get outside care.

I bet it will be life changing for you. Sounds like you're already experiencing improvements. Good for you.My overall experience with the VA has been very positive. I've been eligible for care for nearly 25 years, but only sought treatment this past May for suicidal depression. The care I've received in mental health, physical therapy, and ea for surgery and sleep apnea treatment has been terrific. My doctors have all been open minded, curious, and listened to alternative treatments/therapies outside of drugs/pharmaceuticals, even some therapies they personally have never prescribed.However, my primary care provider(s) (I fired one and got another), and their ignorance, ego and stubbornness, have been my biggest hurdles. They have acted as gatekeepers and screeners, rather than partners.Never more so than with my request for endocrine tests (i.e. thyroid, testosterone, etc.) and a referral to endocrinology. It's just not happening.And, as you wrote in your suggestion to seek outside care for the testosterone/hormone issue, the more I've learned about the VA endocrinology department and doctors, the more I'm convinced they wouldn't know what do do, anyway.So, I'm taking your suggestion. I'm going to seek an outside provider. This is no different than what I'm already doing for mental health. I don't take any medications, but found an M.D. that focuses on targeted nutrient therapy. He does my bloodwork and writes a custom compounded nutrient prescription. The VA couldn't fill this, anyway.  As it's only vitamins/minerals, not drugs.So, I'm going to get outside care.

{"ficlji9": {"text": "Hi Dr. Kent. Thank you for offering to answer questions. 1. Do you agree with my assessment that I should switch to deep TMS from rtms after only three visits?2. If not, how many more visits with rtms would you attempt define the right spot?3. And how much is efficacy compromised if there's more than desired distance between the coil and head, or the coil is at an angle?I'm receiving TMS to treat MDD with a bipolar 2 label. I've had 3 sessions with rTMS using a MagVenture Pro machine with  cool B-70 coil. I experience moderate to significant eye pain at the top front-to-middle of my left eye during the session. When it gets to about a 7 out of 10, which I would be unable to sit through an entire session of taps, I tell them they have to back off the power or move the location. There's no way I can get to even 100% power, let alone 120% power, at the ideal location. It remains about 4 out of 10 on a pain threshold during the entire session.  The coil placement has been manipulated more than a dozen times in three days. And the ends of the coil are not equidistant from my head. So it's shooting at a slight angle. Yet, during my testing, and each day, the location that activates the greatest motor response, also causes the most pain.Today, the onset of eye pain (aside from the pain during the session, which is mild, but constant) began about 4 hours after treatment. And it's gotten progressively worse as I now near 11 hours since treatment.it's not severe, but it's more than uncomfortable. My left eye, above my inner eye, and the left side of my head feel slightly painful and sore. However, the actual location and tapping on my scalp doesn't bother me at all. I was advised that there were many more manipulations they could do with the rtMS, including putting a sponge between each end of the coil. Either way, however, and reading your comments, it sounds like with even perfect placement, rtms can miss the mark by 30%. I've continually asked how these manipulations affect efficacy, specifically the angling of the coil. And I've been reassured that it will hit close enough (my words). I - continually - ask about the possibility of compromising efficacy, and I'm told that it will be okay. I've been told their treatment results I've been about equal with either the Brainsway Magventure. However, when I drilled down as to why one type of TMS would be recommend over the other, and what percentage of patients used either technology, I was told that they have many rtms machines. But only one deep TMS machine. thanks so much for your help. And this spring, I may be moving to one of the locations where you listed that you practice. I'll definitely look you up if I move there.Thanks so much for your time and help. Thomas Seattle Washington USA \ud83d\ude0a", "link_id": "t3_ec4sbe", "time": 1582351180}}

{"fgqqybs": {"text": "Actually, I believe you're already well on your path to healing / improving. Awareness is actually the first step. You can't change anything without awareness, what do you have.After awareness, becomes personal accountability/responsibility. Reading your post, you have that, too. I'm in a very similar point in my healing journey as you. And I've read tons and tons on codependency, go to support group meetings, in practice active healing.After all this, I found that what works for me on my own personal path, is to literally question every single thought impulse I have to give / help / advise / assist / another person. While I'm intense about this, I'm very informal and not obsessive. I had too many years of doing that!So now, what I recognize my impulse or near action to do / give the someone, I stop and questioned it. With questions like: did this person ask for my help? If he or she did, do I want to help? Why am I considering doing this action right now?what I mean by informal is, I just kind of have this dialogue with myself, in the moment. For example, yesterday I was near a habitat for humanity and Goodwill outlet store. I have a close friend who's in need of bedroom furniture for her daughters. Specifically a dresser. Well, I was literally passing the stores after leaving Costco. I was in my truck and had my trailer with me. and I thought to myself, hey, I'll just pop in there and see if there's a dresser that I can pick up for her.But I'm about two months now and they're practicing catching myself, and I realized, that while generous and kind, this help wasn't asked for. And probably more importantly for me, no matter what her situation or why, it's not my responsibility. But the funny thing is, it was only in my mind, with my own mind, that was thinking it was my responsibility to help. She never asked me to do anything. for me, I made the conscious decision 3 months ago to stop helping everyone with everything for an indefinite. Of time. This is not to be mean or rude or selfish. Instead, I've done so because I needed to protect me from me. Me, and my compulsive need for caretaking and thus trampling the boundaries of others, I've been hurting me. I Am naturally an empath. I'm a kind, generous, supportive person. Yet, giving and caretaking is how I felt needed and validated myself internally. But by doing so, I've actually completely invalidated myself and distanced myself from who I truly am and what I truly need. And by automatically saying no (internally) do every internal impulse to help / assist, I am healing. And it is becoming less difficult to separate kind and healthy giving / helping, vs compulsive and sickness- driven giving. But I had to stop everything to be able to recognize this difference. so my goal is to not stop being kind or generous, it's not to stop giving forever. And sad, it's about reparenting myself and educated myself as to what is healthy and proper giving in any given situation. because they are out is nice people do nice things for other people. And they are there for them in times of need. I don't want this ever to change for me. I really like that part part of me and admire itBut I can only truly give in a healthy way in the future if I amfirst aware of all the ways I do so in an unhealthy way, and then consciously take accountability and work through changing those Ways. I'm actually very surprised and pleased with how much progress I've made and only a few months, even though I've been aware of this issue for years. and I can feel intuitively that I'm much closer to the time where I'm going to be able to begin giving and assisting and a healthy way, without compulsion or covert contracts assigned. I wrote a ton about me here, but my reply is really for you. Because I hope something in what I wrote it's similar to what you may think feel or experience sometimes. And that are shared experience and common humanity and healing might help you in some way.

But so many people, including many doctors I've talked with, are completely ignorant about the actual severity of bipolar 2. Even today, twenty-something years after my diagnosis, I'm continually re-educating both my psychologist and psychiatrist, who are still so wrapped up in potential mania or hypomania. It's like all these people remember are the trails and movies like in silver linings playbook with Bradley Cooper, we're somebody cycles, and goes off the wall, totally manic, 4 days or a week at a time.When in truth, in bipolar 2, it's a 40 to 1 ratio of time spent in depression vs. Hypomania.

By the letter of the law, you wouldn't be allowed entry. But given the discretion of the agent involved, your country of origin, and your age, I think more than likely you will be admitted. But I wouldn't guarantee this. And you should really have a plan B for immediate return travel if you're denied entry. The most important thing, like I wrote previously, it's absolutely disclosed your history. Do not try to hide it. And if you do make the trip, I suggest acting completely ignorant about the U.S. laws regarding entry. Do not get into a debate.In fact, do the opposite. Use your youth and charm. And act dumb, depressed, and defeated. Basically be accountable and admit that you were young and dumb. But that you're now a changed person and I've been looking forward to this trip all your life (even if you haven't!)Anyway, that's my two cents. I'm writing all this not to scare you or worry you. I just wouldn't want you to show up here, to then be surprised at being denied entry oh, and having to scramble to get back home. Good luck with everything. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "link_id": "t3_etmra1", "time": 1579976848}}

This last time in September, she reached out again after about 4 weeks. Apologizing for everything she did, the pain she caused by the way she handled things, it's suggested we get together at some point foreclosure, and because she thought that I / we deserved that. That was really choice coming from somebody you chose to break up over a text and then ghosts the person they've been yearning for for nearly three decades. she then send another text message the next day, obviously perturbed that I didn't reply, saying that she didn't expect a response. But she just wanted to say she was sorry and that she wishes she was different. I'm sharing all this for the o p, because she ripped open wounds that had barely scarred over and began to heal.

{"fc65cng": {"text": "Hi there thanks a lot for your message. Oh, I'm not complaining about how late it happened to me in life! The reality is, and one of the most painful parts for me has been, is that app now and I'm codependent for two decades. Yeah, it's basically impossible to heal - completely - while you're enmeshed in a codependent relationship. And this is the first time in decades I haven't been in a relationship. So even though I've done a lot of healing over the years, this is the first time where I'm truly on my own. So this is what I've been able to do the real work. I think that's a great question you ask. Like you, my most passionate and charged relationships I've also been my most dysfunctional. However, to your question, yes oh, I think it's absolutely possible to connect with others healthier, I'd even say, deeper level. However, the qualities of the attachment, for me at least, aren't always the same. there are two different women I have really connected and bonded with over the years, who am I think I could have had a terrific relationship with. But I ended those friendships before they even led to a kiss or anything inappropriate, because I was already in a relationship. These were genuine friendships were a spark was then set off. What I can tell you is that, even though nothing transpired and I didn't pursue a relationship, I can tell you the connection was just a strong as I've had with either of the avoidant narcissist I've been married to. However, and what I always remember, is that the quality in dynamics of that connection we're completely different then with my ex's. And I am not blaming my exes oh, because I was half of the equation in both marriages. But with my access, where I was the gas and they were the match, and everything got set on fire. With the two people I'm referring to, it was like I was the water and they were the plant. Meaning the qualities in dynamics of the relationship were peace, calm, yeah it's support, understanding an inspiration. so one of the big takeaways I realize and I've journaled a lot about over the past 6 months is that in my next relationship, I really desire and I'm going to seek out a person who is calm, grounded, centered, kind, and probably even a little subdued or less energetic. And I'm not saying submissive!But I'm pretty passionate, outgoing, and could be high-strung at times. And both of my exes were the same way. So when we would go up, it's almost like we were on cocaine. We'd go sky-high. But one movie crash, it'd be like going off a cliff. It was a never-ending roller coaster of up-and-downs, progress/retreat, get close/pull away. So basically, I'm now going to attach to something that calms yet inspires me. Rather than something that charges/energizes me, yet is volatileI hope something in here helps. And I wish you the absolute best in 2020. , and I hope this all makes sense. This is all talk to text on my phone, and I either talk too fast or my phone sucks! So it doesn't always make sense. All the best.

{"f489m1g": {"text": "\u00a0@SteenyStuff\u00a0 @SteenyStuffHi Steeny. Thank you for the message. And I have a message for you and your daughter: HOPE. Truly.My life is 180 degrees different. I went from being suicidal in May 2019 (and four other times between January and May 2019) \u2013 like, literally standing on the chair with a rope around my neck \u2013 to a calm (not a bliss, or euphoria), stability and presence that I haven\u2019t experienced since my very early 20s. I\u2019m now 48. And just today, I completed filling out my six month progress report to send to my doctor.Please google reddit Tc8993. That\u2019s my username. There, you can click on both my post history, and my comment history to others posts, and I share much of my learnings and experience.I\u2019ve suffered from bipolar two with rapid cycling for more than 20 years. With the depression getting worse, which is the course of the disorder, each year. Bipolar is on the same spectrum as schizophrenia. Yet, ironically, bipolar is more difficult to treat. Really.The information in this video and in the user comments was helpful. Yet, I\u2019d already been using various supplement routines for more than 15 years. Yet, could never find a balance.Then, sometime last December, deep down the user comments in some YouTube video on depression and bipolar \u2013 buried way down the list \u2013 someone mentioned the name Dr. William J. Walsh. And his information, his book, \u201cNutrient Power\u201d, and his protocol, administered/overseen by Dr. Albert Mensah, completely \u2013 transformed my life.Ironically, I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t find Dr. Walsh earlier as had known of the research of his mentors, Dr. Abraham Hoffer, who has TREMENDOUS success treating schizophrenics with niacin, and Dr. Karl Pfeiffer. In fact, I\u2019d followed Dr. Hoffer\u2019s niacin protocol with mixed results. Dr. Hoffer was a pioneer, but he just didn\u2019t know what he didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t have the information available nowadays.Anyway, I\u2019d found Dr. Walsh information in December 2018, researched it into February 2019, and was just dumbfounded how simple it was, how he had the science and case results to back up his data, and to convince myself that \u2018this\u2019 might actually be an answer after decades of deflated hopes.Dr. Walsh is a researcher, not a medical doctor. He doesn\u2019t sell the nutrients/supplements he recommends. And he runs a non-profit to further the research. He\u2019s been at this since the 1970s, and, IMPORTANT TO YOU, one of the first groups his research team had great success with were people suffering from schizophrenia. Like, they had incredibly good response rates from targeted nutrient therapy. In fact, Dr. Walsh now says that it is one of the \u201ceasier conditions\u201d his protocol treas. Does this guarantee success for your daughter? No. BUT IT CERTAINLY PROVIDES HOPE. And, EVEN IF it doesn\u2019t completely resolve her condition, her symptoms WILL improve, to some degree, whether minimal or massive. SHE WILL BE, AND HER BRAIN WILL BE, BETTER OFF.Dr. Walsh has a VERY SPECIFIC testing protocol for determining NOT ONLY what nutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements) people are deficient in. But, more importantly, according to him, what a person is overloaded in.And, his research, which now has more than 30,000 case studies and 3,000,000+ actual test results using his protocol, has shown that while there are more than 100 neurotransmitters in the brain, Dr. Walsh says that it is only about five or six that cause major issues. So it\u2019s very easy to target an individual person\u2019s needs, and then achieve some level of improvement.For example, in his research, and to your point about BIG PHARMA (which, by the way, I stopped all medications 15 years ago), more than 90% with a cognitive challenge (i.e. mental or brain disorder) HAVE A ZINC DEFICIENCY. More than 90%! But, no doctor or psychiatrist I\u2019ve talked to in the past six months, and NONE in my previous 25 years of research, EVER MENTIONED A SIMPLE ZINC TEST. The entire system is completely ignorant about it.Dr. Walsh said that if he could recommend one test for anyone with a cognitive challenge, it would be a plasma zinc test. Without exception.And, you guessed it? My zinc levels upon testing were well below his DATABASE group, which were all lower than what a \u2018normal\u2019 person would be.So, back to your question and this video, a lot of this information is good. But, what I learned after connecting with Dr. Walsh is that a person, like I was likely doing, can actually do more harm than good by trying to administer nutrients without proper testing. That is why he titled his book, \u201cNutrient Power\u201d. He says that, \u2018nutrients have power\u2019. But, they must be respected because they can really throw things off if the wrong ones or wrong amounts are given. And that a person can\u2019t figure this out through trial and error.So, look up William J. Walsh and YouTube and watch all of his videos. Also check out his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dr. Albert Mensah, in Chicago, who I flew out to see. Also, he was a non-profit, Walsh Research Institute.Again, WHAT I REALLY LIKE about Walsh is that he is a researcher, not a clinician. And, he does NOT SELL any of the nutrients/supplements or the testing he recommends. And the tests themselves aren\u2019t very expensive. I believe I spent about $400 and it was nine different blood tests (all from three blood draws) and a hair sample test. I paid Dr. Mensah around $1,200 for the consultant, review of tests with, and then my customized nutrient program based on the test findings. Note: he spent more than an hour with me, in person, taking a full history and explaining everything. And this was after his nurse, who\u2019s been with Dr. Walsh and Dr. Mensah for more than 25 years, spent about an hour with me prior. So, that\u2019s more face time in one visit than I\u2019d had with doctors the 10 years prior.I spend about $120 a month on my supplements. But they\u2019re very target and specific TO ME. For example, I take 100mg of zinc, but in three different forms. I take 2,000mg of vitamin C. Then, 50 micrograms/mcg of biotin. I write this because there is NO WAY  a person, on their own, could know how to do this, let alone do it. I know, I tried for nearly two decades. And, AGAIN, UNLIKE pharma, I like that Dr. Mensah has no vested interest, no profit motive. His clinic outsources the \u2018prescription\u2019 to a compounding pharmacy which they have no financial ties to. He makes his money off consults and follow ups. The pharmacy makes their money off selling their supplements.I got rolling here, but I really wanted to help. Again, Dr. Walsh has had TREMENDOUS success with people suffering from schizophrenia. FWIW, he\u2019s actually presented at the APA (American Psychiatric Association) annual meeting which has 10,000+ attendees three or four times in the past seven years or so. But, because of the \u2018system\u2019 in the U.S., psychiatrists here are much slower to adopt simple blood tests and then nutrients. Yet, providers throughout Europe, and especially Australia, have been following Dr. Walsh\u2019s protocol for a long time, with fantastic results.So, again, this is a message of hope. There is hope. Please feel free to contact me. Read my Reddit posts. I\u2019m just trying to give back and help for all the help that I\u2019ve received. I wish you  and your daughter the best. \uf04a Thomas, Seattle, Washington, USA", "link_id": "t3_djl9q9", "time": 1571434782}}

{"f488pjy": {"text": "This is going to be a really long post. This is a comment I posted in a YouTube video about nutrient therapy just last week to a user who has asked me how I was doing a year after I had made comment on the video. I'm sorry that I don't have time to edit it or personalize it to/for you. But, know that I'm 48, male, and have suffered with bipolar 2 rapid cycling for over 20 years. On average, bipolar 2 sufferers experience depression at a 40:1 rate to hypomania. That's 40 times more time spent in depression, not 40% more. And, the stats get worse over time. And, with the number of medications someone is on. So, read this post. Then, click on my user name and look at other comments and posts I've made. Specifically in the past 12 months, and especially the nutrient and lithium orotate ones. There is hope. ALL medications made me much worse, and my life has completely transformed in the last six months, where in early May 2019, I literally called the Veteran's suicide hotline while standing on a chair with a rope around my neck. I had 4 suicidal epsiodes between January-May 2019, where previously I rarely had them. And, each episode got worse and more real. So, read this comment with hope. Feel free to reach out.

{"f1n0ugu": {"text": "Thank you so much. I'm surprised you're finished reading all that I wrote last year! Haha. Hey, one more book recommendation that has completely transformed my mental health: Nutrient Power by Dr. William Walsh. I have a history of bipolar 2 and depression since my early 20s. These, along with alcoholism, run in my family. So, my brain is just predisposed/susceptible to any kind of triggers. And alcohol, for me, was really a coping mechanism. Anyway, the basic blood testing and then the resulting nutrients/supplements recommendations have - completely - transformed my life. I've been on the individualized program since May, when I was suicidal. I'd experienced many of these episodes earlier in 2019, and many more during that last 20 years. My brain and my life has completely transformed. I've never been this stable, calm and present since college in my early 20s. And one of the biggest things I've learned is that nearly all people with either mental health / cognitive challenges or substance abuse problems, have major overloads and deficiencies of specific nutrients. For example, nearly all alcoholics I have a severe zinc deficiency. Without zinc, the brain can't make enough dopamine or serotonin, which are your motivation and feel good neurotransmitters. This information isn't that dissimilar to the Joan Mathews Larson book about alcohol-free naturally, or the Julia Ross book. Difference is, this protocol all is completely individualized. I wrote all this in the hopes that it might help you on your journey, and on your path. Because along with learning to love myself and accept myself, this has been the most helpful information I've ever found, and I've been searching for 20 years. I always knew there is a biological a neurological basis for both mental disorders and for addictions. And I could never wrap my head around why some people around me could have one drink and just stop, but as soon as I had a sip I'd have to have 10 drinks. I have no control. Again, thank you so much for your acknowledgement and your thoughts. They mean a lot to me. And I wish you the best on your journey.", "link_id": "t3_d9x0gx", "time": 1569606408}}

But secondarily, because when the down cycle of my bipolar 2 rapid cycling heads, I can be on the couch from anywhere from a week to three weeks. so truthfully, I know my limitations gone up and there's no way I could have held down and 9-5 job. Yeah, both the pressure and in the isolation I've really worn me down. there's great perks to being self-employed, like setting your own schedule. But what so many people who haven't done it don't understand, is that at all rides on you. You only eat, you only sleep, if you bring in the money and provide the service. And unless you're making a ton of money, you can never leave the work at work. It always comes home with you. and truthfully, I'm just more tired now that I've gotten older. So I'm really looking forward to going back to a part-time job, even an entry-level job. It's funny I used to be a suit and tie, pitching CEOs, I've done a lot of real estate, my ex and I open up a wellness center in the downtown, she still running that. So we've done a lot, but I'm still looking forward to just the simplicity and the lack of pressure. fortunately, I've done okay and I've been very good with money in terms of saving it, so while I haven't made millions, I'm comfortable because of my frugal lifestyle. Thank God I don't get full-blown mania and some of the stories that I read here where people go into debt. I really feel for you. anyway, I just wanted to acknowledge your comment.

{"ew1chnn": {"text": "Yes, what's happen frequently. I'm now 48 years old, and it's happened more in the last two to three years than at any point in my life. For most of my thirties I tried to be an advocate / champion for mental health awareness, and share my diagnosis with people and try to explain. and now, honestly, and whether it's selfish or not, I've realized it does absolutely no good 'educate' people because, even for those who are deeply compassionate and interested, I found that if they don't suffer from bipolar themselves, no matter how well-intentioned or interested, they simply don't get it. and I'm not saying this judgmentally, but their brain simply can't wrap their head around it, especially in the middle of an episode.So, after losing my last relationship in large part to my cycles, and the stress and pain that they put her through through no fault of her own, I've learned that for me, I'm just not sharing it with anyone. Unless I get into another serious relationship. Because even my family, who have been terrific and supportive and very involved over the last 20 years, when they see me in a cycle they simply don't understand it. They don't get it. So, all these advertisements in campaigns that take the stigma of mental health oh, I agree with the spirit any intention of these campaigns. But the reality for me is, in my day today experience, is that people just don't get it. And I've burned too many relationships in friendships, and probably extinguished others before they even started, by being overly attached and promoting my diagnosis. So no more for me. Sorry I got on the sub box here. But to the original poster yes, I've experienced this a lot. All the best, Thomas Seattle Washington USA", "link_id": "t3_cm7ggd", "time": 1565020362}}
{"evz8kea": {"text": "Please, order or check out from the library book called Nutrient Power, by dr. William Walsh. All of us who suffer from mental or cognitive challenges have severe deficiencies and overloads and very specific vitamins and minerals, leaving the imbalances in neurotransmitters. Overwhelmingly, these are genetic or epigenetic, meaning your brain was susceptible to an imbalance, and then specific triggers activated it. For what it's worth, he's not anti medication. That, he says medication can serve a purpose. But, everybody with mental or cognitive challenges has some type of imbalance. And it's critical to get tested see you know what vitamins and minerals to take. Just as importantly, to learn which ones not to take. Branson's, don't take a multivitamin. It's more likely than not, you're going to be overloading and something that your body is already toxic in. This goes against decades of learning that I had a little bit of everything would be good. Anyway, I've been following his protocol for about 4 months. I have rapid cycling bipolar 2, PTSD, and pretty moderate add. I got off all prescription medications more than 10 years ago, well before I found out about this information. And went bipolar, specifically bipolar 2, it's absolutely horrendous the statistics I've recovery of people that are on two or more medication simultaneously. in my opinion, it's outright criminal that the psychiatrist, most you are completely incompetent and don't suffer from the disorder themselves, we'll just stack medications because that's all they know how to do. They're not trying to do anything else.So, if you're not on medications, stay off them until you can start some type of nutrient regimen. Anyway, that's my two cents. You can also go to YouTube and just Google dr. William Walsh. I'm actually following his protocol through doctor Mensa out of Illinois. It's been very very helpful. best of luck. I've been where you are, and I was even recently about four weeks ago. So, hang in there, and please know it's not you oh, it's your imbalance brain. And there is hope.

{"evyi67c": {"text": "FWIW: I switched from lithium carbonate, which is the prescription form, to lithium orotate, which you can buy over the counter, several years ago. Truthfully, it seems to have worked as effectively as the prescription form of lithium.as a bit of background, prescription lithium carbonate has 25 mg of elemental lithium per roughly 150 mg of the prescription dose. Because it is in the carbonate form, the body does not process it and break it out as well, especially the kidneys. Which is why higher and higher doses are needed for the body to actually absorb the elemental lithium.Lithium orotate has 4.8 milligrams of elemental lithium / 120 mg dose. however, because it is in the orotate form and not the carbonate form, it is much easier on the kidneys. Also, because it's in the orotate form, it can pass the blood-brain barrier in the body just absorbs it exponentially better than lithium carbonate. So, you only need a fraction of the dose that you do prescription lithium. now, you're going to read horror stories or scare tactics about it can cause kidney damage. There was one study done in 1979 with rats, and they gave equal doses of carbonate and orotate. However, that's not a fair or accurate comparison because you need about five times less lithium orotate then lithium carbonate to get the same therapeutic dosed. So, the study was completely skewed. more importantly, and time directly into this post, is the fact that prescription lithium carbonate is one of the trickiest drugs for P4 by psychiatrist subscribe. Because it's a very very small tolerance / difference between an effective therapeutic dose and toxic overload to the kidneys. That's why blood tests are having to be done three or four times in a year. it's funny, I was talking to my psychiatrist two weeks ago, and brought up lithium orotate. I even reference the book nutrient Power by dr. William Walsh. The psychiatrist looked at me like she had no clue. The only thing she knows is what she can prescribe and write down on a prescription pad.So, I'm not saying lithium orotate will solve all your problems. And, as a lot of people have mentioned, there aren't tons of long-term studies done on it. However, it's been around for decades, kids as young as six and seven eight years old are taking 40 mg of elemental lithium lithium orotate per day and it barely moves the lithium level in the blood. It's so well absorbed it appears to be not toxic at all.but, I can only assume, because it's a natural substance and cat and be pant patented, there's no money to be made in it. Which is why then people bash it specifically the drug companies about it not being safe. Yet, as in this post, people are lithium carbonate, which while very effective for mania, is very, very risky and terms of long term use. Personally, I find it comical if not outright shameful, that's so doctors and so-called professionals go on and on and on about the long-term risks of lithium orotate oh, yeah, act like lithium carbonate is benign. Lithium carbonate, again which is prescription lithium, has one of the most narrow dosage range of any medication. Meaning, with only a few hundred mg, the dose can go from therapeutic to toxic. and what's really comical are the people claiming that lithium orotate isn't safe, especially for the kidneys, when it's been proven that lithium or carbonate is the most destructive drug to the kidneys long-term. It just makes me wonder, why doctors and psychiatrist will prop up lithium carbonate as it's being \"safe\", yet still require you to come in three to four times a year to check your blood levels went to reveal any kidney impairment or damage. anyway, I used to be on 300 mg of lithium carbonate which is 50mg roughly of elemental lithium. So now I take between 7 and 10 lithium orotate tablets per day I get the brand by Hans nieper its advanced research. So I'm taking anywhere between 30 and 50 milligrams of elemental lithium. And it appears to work as well for me as a lithium carbonate, except I have no toxicity. if you want to learn more, just go to Amazon and read the reviews on the advanced research brand lithium orotate by dr. Han's nieper. He's the guy that actually created the orotate process. I think he want to Nobel prize for it as well. And, there's a guy on YouTube, called the lithium doctor. His name might be Mark Myers. I'm not sure, but he has a lot of really good informationanyway, I hope something in here help. Not really trying to start any arguments or whatever.

{"eb0k3bw": {"text": "You are stronger than I was. I made it 13 months my last sober stretch. Thought I could handle a few drinks. And, well, two years later you can figure out how that went.\ud83d\ude09So, after MANY long sober stretches only to fall back in, I realized and decided to change things entirely this time. To question, critically, and then simply throw out all of the teachings I'd internalized, especially from the religion I was taught. Things like I was bad, broken, a sinner, and only falling g to my knees in full repentance and begging for forgiveness would save me. (And, actually had me wondering and questioning, for the first time, what kind of God/parent would intentionally create/bear a child who was inherently flawed and could only be 'saved' through repentance and a whole bunch of rituals?)And I realized, for the first time, That EVERYTHING I'd been taught and learned about religion, and even my beliefs, has ALL been taught to me. Just like they are to most people. NONE of it came from my own personal, direct spiritual communion and experience. I'm sharing this background NOT to bag on religion or spirituality. I now believe ALL religions are great, if they make a person feel whole, comforted and better about themselves and the world. I love it!It's just that for me, carrying around the weight of feeling like I was born 'broken', that I was inherently wicked/a sinner and needed 'saving' for eternal salvation DROVE SO MUCH OF MY COPING mechanisms, like anger, severe codependency and ultimately severe drinking. Alcohol for me, was a symptom and effect of my underlying issues, NOT the cause. And all of this hit me in 2017 as I was nearing the end of a 15 year long healing journey. And I realized that I'd been both VERY harshly judging and abandoning myself MY ENTIRE LIFE, because that's what I'd learned. And that this time, it was time to turn inward, and do THE ONE THING I was never capable of before: TO LOVE AND ACCEPT MYSELF - EXACTLY - AS I AM. DEEPLY. COMPLETELY. COMPASSIONATELY. And, it's made all the difference. And I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO RECOGNIZE and HONOR yourself for the roughly 525 DAYS YOU WERE SOBER, and have compassion, kind eyes and forgiveness for yourself for the last 14 days or so. EVEN AT Harvard MIT, your 'sober grade' is 98%!!!!Think about THAT! YOU HAVE BEEN ALCOHOL FREE for about 510 days out of the last 525. That's 98%. That is an A++ ANYWHERE. And it just doesnt go away because you the alcohol hooks got you for a few weeks. You're INCREDIBLY STRONG. JUST LOOK AT the math I showed you. Those, your sober days, ARE FACTS. And don't just go away because some badge/counter needs to be reset. The counter can both be a tool, and a curse. I fall for it sometimes. Focus on it when it supports you. But remember, always, it really doesn't matter. Because if you have 1 day, or 1,000, or 10,000 days sober, it's still the same thing. Becauae it's ONLY achieved ONE MOMENT, ONE BREATH, at a time. Not even one day at a time, really. Anyway, sorry if I hijacked this. It's just your post struck a chord with me because of how much suffering I experienced that I was unknowingly creating. ESPECIALLY the judging, blame, shame, guilt and self-ridicule I'd dump on myself when I slipped up with alcohol. Remember, YOU ARE NOT WEAK, FLAWED OR INHERENTLY BROKEN. in fact, you're JUST THE OPPOSITE! YOU ARE VERY STRONG! It requires a TON MORE HOPE, COURAGE AND FAITH to recognize you have a problem and then intentionally and actively heal that problem for 500+ days of sobriety than it does to think it's hopeless so you never try. To me,  alcohol is the Devil. It's evil. And, it can hook anybody, like it did me. It's addictive. So, it's not your fault... Just like it wasn't mine. SURE, it was my responsibility, I initially chose to drink. But once addicted, I was no longer to blame. Just like you aren't. But now, it's our responsibility to heal. No one can do it for us. And I've - finally - found self compassion, self acceptance and self love to be the key. And I hope you can find the same for you. Because you're worth it. We all are. And again, BE VERY PROUD of the 98%+ days out of the last 525 days/17 months you were sober. Seems to me that YOU ARE AN EXPERT AND EXCEL AT BEING SOBER!!! Best wishes.

{"ea1rymy": {"text": "For me, I made it through a many meetings and know A LOT of people who have been in AA for many years. But it wasn't a good fit. I just didn't like a lot of the teachings, and premises - specifically that I was powerless, needed a higher power and would ALWAYS be an alcoholic - and my dislikes were not meeting-specific. It, and the big book, and just the energy was not a good fit for ME. I felt less hopeful, more like a victim and completely powerless to alcohol. Now, I understand that I was 'doing' all of these feelings. AA wasn't doing it to me. It only triggered things within me that generated these thoughts, feelings and emotions. But I didn't like the way what it elicited in me felt. So, I used other avenues to address and heal what AA trigerred FOR ME, and me only. That said, I LOVE AA for all the people I mentioned that it helped. It's been so positive for them and theyre among the most generous and compassionate people I know. And, I actually attend a lot of outdoor social activities with these group. Really, really good people. So for them, AA has been wonderful.

{"e8olm5o": {"text": "Hi Matt. You're welcome for the kind words. Your post helped me tremendously. Perfect timing, to the day, I guess. Unfortunately for me, and the hardest part of my journey in healing (of which alcohol was only a result, but a real problem on its own), was being fully aware - painfully aware - of all the stuff/baggage I was carrying. And living that day after day, but feeling trapped in an internally driven prison. But simply being unable to break free. Truthfully, i wish I'd been less aware/more ignorant throughout it. Then again, this awareness was the starting point of it all. So, who knows?You ask an interesting question. For me, the times i struggle the most is when I get lost in my own head. A prison of rapid, repeating anxoius thoughts. I can get lost for days, but it used to be weeks or months. So I've improved a lot with this. And credit much to meditation, awareness, and most importantly, self acceptance and self compassion. Those are the real keys for me. So, I need to be reminded when my thoughts start really going. I have pretty significant mood/energy cycles, but I manage them so much better than before. Also, the times that catch me are when  actually doing well, not when low/down. For example, an alcohol craving is FAR MORE likely when I'm 'up'/doing well. And it sounds good to highlight or add to an already fun time. Ironically, this is EXACTLY when I tend to end up struggling again because it's like my subconscious thinks everything is 'fine', I'm in control and have life - finally - all figured out. So, I unconsciously fall off from the structure self care I setup and need to function as well as possible. The basics, like: sleep, exercise, meditation, walking, connecting with others. But , with the awareness I've mentioned, and a clear intention, that's getting better, too. Thanks a lot for asking. I'd really enjoy hearing what works for you, or where/how you experience challenges.  And how you approach them. And I've shared your original post with friends.

Especially now that you've added exercise, if you weren't doing a lot before. Just as in weifhtlifting, where you breakdown a muscle during the workout, it actually repairs itself , and grows stronger, during recovery/rest. Really, recovery is more important than the lifting if you go even  somewhat hard. You body is doing the same, for all of it's organs, tissue, etc right now with the deep sleep. If you're sleeping that long, your body and brain need it. Now, for the melatonin, 5mg is a lot, especially if your now logging 12 hours. Ideally, you'll get to where your not taking it at all.

I REALLY appreciate it, and wanted to reply after had a bit to sit and consider all that you wrote, and suggested.  It seems/feels like we've walked a similar path. And, truly ironic that you mention narcissism and separating from family. I've always heard the term 'narcissist' as used in popular culture. But, my concept of it was far more shallow/superficial than how deep, pervasive, all-consuming\u2026 yet seemingly subtle it can be.If you would have told me a few years ago that both my mom, and my soon to be ex-wife, were both narcissists, I would have argued. Knowing what I know now, I realize they're over-the-top narcissists. And I was a HUGE enabler, playing out the roles and all those limiting beliefs I'd absorbed during childhood, and then struggled through life with. Which, along with the other abuse, led to a life-long feeling of unease, uncertainty, prevailing fear and inferiority. Even though I excelled in high school sports star and was a college athlete, graduated with honors from university, had a few small businesses and have always been fit/healthy/muscula  Despite appearances, the inside NEVER matched the outside perceptions others had. So, THANK YOU for all that you shared. Specifically, the techniques/teachings and then actions you've taken. And, like you, addiction runs deep in my family, generational, including my parents. I'm understanding more and more the effects of this.  I've delved - heavily - in learning about the narcissism, and the toxic shame, the past year. Beverly Engel's work has been the best for me, and Darlene Lancer's is fantastic, too. I've read Melody Beatie, John Bradshaw, and others, too. Like you, I've ramped up my lifting again, too. I've always worked out/exercised pretty regular. And have maintained pretty darn good physicality, especially compared to most men around me in their 30s-40s. I'm 47 now. So, I know what you mean about it/health/strength providing a mental boost.   I'd suffered a ton of mental drama/trauma stuff for decades, so my experiences with CBT weren't great. I ran my course with it when years-upon-years of attempting rational thought and logical debating didn't change the core feelings.   Fortunately, energy work (tapping, etc) and learning and actually understanding that all of this trauma and beliefs are actually stored in the body/mind-body energy field, frozen in time, and can be triggered in an instant, to the same emotional state as when first experienced, drive all of this heavy, negative 'stuff'. And are at the core of not feeling good enough. The work of Dr. George Pratt and Peter Lambreau, Roger Callahan, Henry Grayson and Bessel van der kolk have helped IMMENSLEY. Ironically, back to your CBT suggestion\u2026 I'm now finding it easie effective to use this NOW that I've faced, and worked on, so much of this stuff at the core. So, thank you for the suggestion.  I never went the AA route, and still struggle at times. For me, while I appreciate the common humanity of that group setting, I've had a tendency in my life to freeze/get stuck, especially when commiserating. And the feeling FOR ME, and ME ONLY, is that the more I focus on the alcohol, the more power I give yet. Yet, I dolong fo the social connection. But, I've just had too many bonds in my life that were based upon a 'negative', something to fight against, that I'm not choosing that path. This board, Stop Drinking, has been my most helpful support. And, each day I read posts hoping I'll read one, read a story, like yours.

I took that first drink. Moderated for a while, so I thought was in control. However, within two months I was drinking more alcohol, and more frequently, than I ever had before. Daily blackout drinking... Massive depression, anxiety, fear, and near suicide at many points. I lived and suffered that way for more than two years, until last September when I was at my lowest. And dedecided it's either suicide or sobriety. Because the alcohol was literally killing me, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

You're right, I have a lot going on inside; which is driving all of this.I've actually done more introspection and self-healing the past year than at any time in my life; including facing and addressing, head on, the harms I've done to others. I realize now that I was using alcohol to cope - emotionally, mentally, spiritually - and the specific aims (codependency, childhood trauma, among other things.)Ironic you mention volunteering. My entire 30s into my 40s was spent on being 'other focused', with an unhealthy bent on volunteering/giving (like, tens upon tens of thousands of dollars to various causes, as well as many hours per week.)I realize that I was giving to try to fill a void within; to try and feel like I was \"good\" and \"worthy\". Now, I'm all for volunteering and giving. I believe it's a responsibility, as a human being, to share either your time, talent or treasure. Everyone has something to give, especially living in the U.S.But, I spent so much time 'giving'/doing, to try and feel whole/good/worthy, that I was creating even more distance between my perceived self, and my true self, who I never knew.Understand, I still give/volunteer. But it comes from a place/intention of true compassion and gratitude that I can do something, not a combination of these plus my own mental baggage. And it's been a refreshing change.I appreciate your time and thought, truly. Your perspective, and basically identifying/calling out my overactive \"Me. Me. Me.\" focus is a wake up.

And the one thing I THANK GOD FOR is that her and I didn't have a child. It was such a toxic, dysfunctional relationship. Her, a narcissist, codependent, dishonest user. Me, an extremely shame--filled, thus low self-esteem, enabling, off-the-charts codependent and enabler. She kicked me - constantly - while I was down. And i willingly let her do it because I was weak, self-devalued, and more afraid of being alone than attempting to heal. And my biggest way of coping was drinking. My God ,what the environment would have been like for a kid. And I know shitty environmens from the abuse and alcoholism in my home while growing up. Sorry I got on a tangent here. I'm just suggesting considering another alternative. Because I don't care HOW MUCH a parent loves their child, it's impossible to be a good parent if you're an actively drinking alcoholic. Impossible. And, having a kid doesn't automatically make you stop drinking, either. I have an adult son from a high school 'date', and had 50/50 custody until he was in high school. And, he's suffered from my drinking... And it's been my biggest regret, one I've been working on the most to heal. So, again, I applaud you for your sobriety and awareness.

Especially the sobriety.For inspiration: my neighbor was the most functional HEAVY alcohol I'd ever seen. Nearly 2/5th's of whiskey a day, then Bailey's in his coffee on his way to work as a mechanic. Smoked a pack of cigarettes a day. Completely inactive; no exercise of any kind. In all my 45+ year life, he's the one person I NEVER thought would  get sober, or even consider it.Well, one day, he had an accident at work. Could have cost him his life. He stopped drinking that day. Still smoked like crazy.On his one year anniversary of sobriety, he decided to just stop smoking. He'd never even really considered not smoking. But, the idea just hit him as he got healthier.Now... he's the most active person I know. He climbs mountains (like, real mountains... Mt. Rainier in WA, etc.), does 20+ mile hikes in elevation every weekend, is a huge member of AA's hiking group, and is the healthiest and happiest I've ever seen him.He's been sober for 14 years. Off cigarettes for 13. Now is married, flush with cash, and happiest point in his life.And it's all because he stopped drinking. So, please go easy with yourself on the smoking.

{"drqvt3v": {"text": "Hi there... Merry Christmas. Thank you for your message and thoughts. Again, I'd highly recommend you try Naltrexone. I read A TON - like three books and all the websites - before trying. So, I know my experience isn't the norm. It has a very high success rate if the basic protocol is followed: NEVER drink without taking the pill. ALWAYS take the pill at least one hour before you drink. Do NOT take it on days you're not planning to drink.And, thanks for the comments on the badge. I appreciate it.Truthfully, it's been challenging. Not overwhelming, but challenging.I have been wanting to quit for a few years after a two year stretch of no drinking, which was actually VERY easy once I got past the first two months. Then, I thought I had 'it' figured out, and started having drinks socially. It - very quickly - progressed to daily drinking.I started the Naltrexone last Spring because I was at one of the lowest points I'd been. I knew alcohol was destroying me and my life, and I didn't know how much longer I could continue with it.I found this website, and it helped me a lot: https://stopdrinkingalcohol.com/I then sat down for a few hours, and really thought about, AND FELT - emotionally - about how alcohol has affected my life. What it has cost me, what it has robbed me of. I got deep, and honest with myself.And I just realized that I had to change or it would kill me.I've also read Alan Carr's \"Easy Way\", which helped some. Specifically drilling the point into my head that 'alcohol is a poison'. I hear it's similar to Annie Grace's \"This Naked Mind\", which I haven't read. (Though I do feel Carr makes the whole thing too analytical in a 'mind over matter' way.)I've meditated for years, so sitting with my core feelings of sadness, loneliness and just being with them helped a ton. And then, DECIDING, and learning how to actually be loving, kind and compassionate to myself.And the 'one day at a time' concept has really helped, because I really can only live one day - one moment, really - at a time.ALSO, what has been important and helpful to me, yet which I CONSTANTLY have to remind myself of is to not get obsessed with the cravings and not focus on 'just getting through today'. This seems contradictory to the 'one day at a time' concept, but to me it's not.In my mind and heart/core, I've decided I'm not going to drink; that I can't. So, when cravings come up, I try to go back to that decision in my mind, as often as I remember. Because, in my mind, it's like, \"If I've already decided I won't/can't drink, cravings are a non-issue.\" I remind myself that alcohol, fo me, is a poison. It hurts me, despite any romanticizing I have about it. And, it will kill me.Now, this isn't all 'scary'-like now. But I have the conversation often.And, I don't want you to know I have 'it' all figured out. I've struggled lately. I just made a long post yesterday on here that you might find helpful. (I'm assuming you can click on my user name). Because I was very close to having drinks the other day, despite all that I wrote.I DO KNOW from previous experience, however, that I'll reach point where I don't even consider drinking alcohol, let alone think about it daily. As far as I remember, that was four to six months the one time I had a many years stretch of non-drinking. But the first three months or so of that one was straight will-power and white knuckling. And it worked.Again, thanks for your reply. I hope something here helps you. I wish you well on your journey. And, have a very merry Christmas today.

Screw it... I like the people, but I AM NOT paying for their drinks, or splitting the bill. So, I drop a $5 for my club soda and a tip. And that's that!!!Hope this helps.

{"dog9tai": {"text": "A FANTASTIC book that would be VERY valuable is, \"Conquering Shame and Codependency: 8 Steps to Freeing the True You\" by Darlene Lancerhttps://www.amazon.com/Conquering-Shame-Codependency-Steps-Freeing/dp/1616495332I am NOT implying/suggesting that you're codependent. But, as a 46 year old guy who's had business success, good fitness and health, yet severe depression at times and TOTALLY disfunctional relationships, I didn't realize how codependent I was. And Lancer's was the best on the subject.I suggest this book because she has three or four FANTASTIC chapters describing who we alienate from our true selves, so much so that we end up not knowing who we are. For example, we create:* Ideal self: who we think we SHOULD be and what we think we SHOULD strive for.* Persona/Mask: who we present ourselves to be to others, even though we're often faking it* Critic: internal critical/judgmental voice that compares us to our Ideal Self (again, who we THINK we should be), and compares us to others, and then hammers and devalues us for 'not measuring up'.* Devalued Self: Who we end up thinking we are as the result of our \"Critic's\" judgment.* Authentic/True Self: who we - truly and innately - are at our core. Which is perfect and unchanging.She then continues to explain how most of us don't know, deeply, what we truly FEEL, NEED, WANT and VALUE. So she suggests exercises on those.I'm not affiliated with her in any way, other than I've read most of her books and her web page, and she's provides great information and tools.Secondly, DEFINITELY started meditating, even for 5-10 minutes a day. There's a great saying, and exercise, by some ancient philosopher (or someone) that says, \"Put a chair in the middle of the room, turn off the lights, sit there... and wait and see who shows up.\" Great exercise, literally and figuratively.LASTLY, you can NEVER go wrong with loving and accepting yourself. Gay Hendricks book, \"Learning to Love Yourself\" is a FANTASTIC resource for this. Mine will be the top review on it because it literally saved my life and I'm forever indebted. And it ties in beautifully with meditation, and can be learned in 5 minutes.I hope I didn't hijack this thread and that you found it useful. It's just as a 46 year old guy who lived through A TON of internal pain, fear and despair despite the outward appearance and trappings of so-called 'success', if I can help alleviate similar suffering for anyone, I will.Good luck. - Thomas", "link_id": "t3_7670db", "time": 1508175907}}

{"dnu4jy5": {"text": "Hi again. For me personally, I receive MUCH better \"brain\"/mood benefits from cardio vs lifting. (Though I have an improved psyche/self-image after lifting, if that makes sense.)From my understanding, lifting (resistance training) doesn't provide the same neurological for the brain as cardio. (Although some CrossFitters/high intensity advocates will claim lifting can be both aerobic and anaerobic.)Me, personally, I view cardio for my brain. Lifting for my body. And, for me personally, I believe lifting is actually more important of the two. Frankly, you really don't need that much (duration or intensity) of cardio to receive benefits. In fact, I rarely run/jog... just too jarring for me. But, I use a rebounder, elliptical, jog/sprint occasionally, and walk a lot. And, I've found that if you can walk briskly, even getting your heart rate over 80-90bpm, you can receive A LOT of benefits. And, humbly, anyone who's not lifting, start. You don't need to go crazy with it, or try to be a body builder. But your body is either getting stronger or weaker. And if you don't use or push it, it will get weaker. So, I lift 3 days week (push/pull/legs split), and do formal cardio 3 times or so for 20-30 minutes. (you CAN do too much cardio... check Mark Sisson's info). And then walk dogs daily for 25-35 minutes, walking pretty briskly. WORLD of difference in my moods with cardio specifically vs when I don't do it. NOT trying to hijack the thread.

I still lift regularly and am in darn good shape for 46. But, I'd always equated cardio to fat loss and for my body. IT'S NOT! Your brain needs movement... it grows and creates new neural connections. Which translates into an improved psyche, outlook, and has a positive affect in all other areas.So, congrats to ALL of you. Cardio is good. Cardio is for your brain.I recall a quote from a Harvard psychologist, Tall Ben-Sharar, when a doctor was trying to prescribe anti-depressants to me, which I refused.Sharar said, \"Not exercising (cardio specifically) is LIKE TAKING an anti-depressant!\" That really hit me... and has gotten me out of bed every morning since, often just for a long walk.So, good job to all of you!

{"dns73re": {"text": "Congrats on choosing sobriety. Sometimes, when evaluating ourselves, I believe we're WAY TOO CLOSE to see things objectively. And, equally, WAY TOO DISMISSIVE of our progress, no matter how seemingly 'small' it appears. Basically, we're not very good/supportive friends to ourselves. And, we fail to celebrate all the small steps/accomplishments - the humble victories no one else but us know about - as triumphs and achievements. Because, IN YOUR FIRST PARAGRAPH you listed two MAJOR progress points that you've recognized: better sleep and less reactive/not getting pissed off at minor things. THESE ARE MASSIVE PROGRESS. Truly. Why? Because sleep will allow you to show up in your life differently (and, along with the removal of alcohol, be less reactive/triggered. And, your raised tolerance and raised threshold for annoyances/triggers will keep you in a calmer state, longer. And definitely impact all of your relationships and interactions positively. So, IMHO, RIGHT NOW: Go to a mirror. Clean off. And look into lovingly and... Acknowledge yourself. Compliment yourself. Congratulate yourself. Be your own cheerleader and best friend. Because you deserve it.   FOR YEARS, decades, really, I dismissed the little things I accomplished and did well, and just focused on what I struggled with or 'failed' at. Then, I met a very wise and generous person several years ago that spun my perspective 180 degrees. He said: 'Most people suffer because they base their progress against their goal/intended result. When, it's much more loving, and accurate, to measure progress based on where you STARTED.'From your post, I infer you had poor sleep, thus weren't rested during the day or mentally sharp; and you were much more reactive. Yet, in ONLY two weeks, both have improved ENOUGH for you to recognize. THAT, my friend, IS PROGRESS. And REAL change happens by stacking one, small, seemingly unimportant achievement on top of another... NOT through some rapid breakthrough. SO... keep on stacking and recognizing those achievements. And the congratulate and celebrate yourself. Because you deserve it. PS - Even your badge is an achievement, and inspiration, to someone like me who's only 4 days in after being 2.5 years sober only a year ago. You're an inspiration to me. Thank you.

{"dnq74mr": {"text": "Hi there... two things are VERY clear in your post, and are why YOU WILL succeed/let go of alcohol:  (1) Awareness/Recognition: You're - VERY, even painfully - aware of your challenge. You are NOT: in the dark; lying to yourself; or wanting to continue. (2) Desire: It's VERY clear in your words that you - TRULY - want to heal and become healthy.So... my thoughts, now three days sober after a 2.5 year stretch of sobriety that ended about 14 months ago when I thought \"I can just have a few drinks socially\", are these:BE THE BEST POSSIBLE FRIEND YOU CAN BE TO YOURSELF. Be a good coach, to you. Be kind. Be compassionate. Be accepting.After YEARS of therapy, and ALL kinds of labels/diagnosis of what was 'wrong' with me, no docto EVER told me:  (1) what was 'RIGHT' about me; and (2) about practicing self-love, acceptance and compassion.RIGHT NOW, TODAY... THIS MOMENT... JUST THINK about how you would feel, and what you would say to a loved one or close friend, if s/he were in the same position? Or, if s/he had ANY type of serious illness, whether alcohol, cancer, MS, etc.YOU SURE AS HELL would not beat them up, judge them harshly, blame them, ostracize them, or, most importantly, withhold your love and acceptance. NO WAY!Instead, you'd hug them. You empathize and encourage them. And, most importantly, YOU WOULD LOVE THEM, AS THEY WERE.Today, right now... love and accept yourself. With your strengths, and with your challenges/supposed 'flaws'. You're human. But at your core, you're perfect. And, you're worth it. Just like we all are.Be kind and gentle to yourself, today. Be compassionate. Be accepting. GET THIS SOLID, and EVERYTHING might just change, instantly. And, EVEN IF it doesn't change immediately, it is STILL the loving thing to do for you.You're a good person. You mean A LOT to many people, I'm sure. You have talents/strengths. You have challenges/flaws. That just means you're human. And, at your core, you are PERFECT as you are. Realize that. Acknowledge that. And see what happens.Thinking of you from Seattle. - Thomas :-)", "link_id": "t3_73gwf2", "time": 1506800361}}
