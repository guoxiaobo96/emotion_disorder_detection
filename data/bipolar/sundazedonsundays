Capri sun method, just stabbed two holes in them with the syringe.I broke up the bags when they got to like 10-15% stiff ish and that sped up the growth a lot.Mixed the cakes with coco. The ones that were the highest cc\u2019s were ready within 2 weeks. The lower cc\u2019s took 3 weeks. I actually lost one bag with only 1 cc. It just didn\u2019t take. It was the first one we inoculated so maybe that was user error too.The first batch of higher cc\u2019s went into coco that wasn\u2019t quite damp enough: they colonized great at first, but the coco dried out into a brick and it started receding. Added more mist and it started to pin, but not as good as the box pictured, just like a few random really big pins. I\u2019m hoping the next flush once we rehydrate those boxes will yield better.The UB bags that were left to colonize for 3 weeks bc they weren\u2019t with the other ones went into really moist coco and pinned way better and more consistently: that\u2019s this pic. We have 4 boxes of nice pins bc they went into sufficiently damp coco. We live in a dry area so this made a big difference compared to the 3 boxes that were dried out more.So if I do it again, I\u2019d inject more cc\u2019s if I only do a Capri sun method to inoculate (2-2.5), or id hole punch the corners if doing a lower amount. Id also make sure the coco is properly moist.I didn\u2019t really understand the difference between fruiting conditions and just mixing the coco with the inoculated rice cakes so keeping conditions more stable would have made it quicker too I\u2019d bet.We keep them in a tiny closet that has a space heater and timer to keep it between 75-78 degrees, I used the same ones u/shroomscout uses. Don\u2019t have a way to put light directly above the boxes bc of the shelves, and some of the lids are not clear anyways, so we wrapped the inside of the door frame with those light strips you can get from ikea and we turn it on for half the day, and rotate the boxes so they don\u2019t keep leaning towards the light like they are in this pic.:)", "link_id": "t3_fqyjbe", "time": 1585456793}}

I\u2019m thinking of coming off of it but idk...the neuroatypical thing you describe is what I would have before, some days (or hours) id get super hyper motivated and the house would get cleaned, id exercise, eat healthy, also maybe spend too much, take up way too many hobbies and yes commitments too, and burn myself out, but that version of myself cleaned up after the depressed self that would follow. I haven\u2019t had that hyper experience in awhile now and shits a mess.Haven\u2019t found anything to help with the depression bc I responded terribly to Zoloft the one ssri I tried.I don\u2019t think ketamine infusion therapy has been very effective for depression either but I haven\u2019t had much of it yet to give a fair answer.I do have a lot of trauma. My childhood was full of it, so that\u2019s why the cptsd thing sounds interesting to me. I feel like I was conditioned in a way to have highs and lows with a mother who would boast me up and say I\u2019m going to change the world and the next minute shatter my existence and tell me how horrible of a person I am, and that\u2019s very much a hypomanic and depressed swing, if that can be socially induced.

Idk if there is a concrete way to tell and yea at the end of the day it\u2019s just a descriptive category like you\u2019re saying.All I want is to be at a functional level of \u201cok\u201d, not a depressed sack of potatoes who can\u2019t get up in the morning, do basic work, or take care of myself, and constantly thinks I should off myself to give my loved ones freedom.

I can't stop thinking about antinatalism, it preoccupies my mind, and its probably because I want to not believe in it but can't find a reason to escape it, ethically.2 - It feels isolating. I don't think any of my friends or family will find this view acceptable and I will be seem as insane. So I have to keep it to myself, which is probably why I think about it all the time, I feel inauthentic hiding feelings/beliefs to myself that I find important.3 - I already pretty much have my mind made up, I do not want to reproduce, especially being a woman.I don't think I have FOMO, I can adopt if I want to, and I do not believe a bio kid earns more love than an adopted kid...my adopted cats were not birthed by me and I love them with all my heart lol.

I don\u2019t think animals consider whether or not they should procreate, they are enslaved to their instincts that push them to do so.I could be totally over exaggerating but this is my take away - nature documentaries paint this picture too.

{"fgo2uh0": {"text": "I used to think that way. Then I reflected a little more on myself and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d honestly handle that intense of a caretaking commitment.Plenty of narcissistic parents don\u2019t start off abusive, some do for sure but for others it evolves over time and it becomes invisible to them since it\u2019s largely unconscious. The abuse continues to increase and their mind develops stronger denial coping mechanisms to shield them from seeing how hurtful they can be. They get caretaking burnout at some point and that\u2019s when it starts, from a place of resentment and self hate (I believe the self hate could be from their unconscious that knows they are abusive, but they can\u2019t accept that so they put the blame elsewhere and abuse others).It\u2019s also so hard to see your own blindspots. They are blindspots for a reason...verrrry hard to see no matter how reflective you are, your consciousness is designed to shield some things from you. I learned this after a psychedelic trip years ago. Blew my mind how much I discovered, I didn\u2019t see myself and tbh I\u2019ve doubted my sense to judge myself ever since.I\u2019m going to try fostering kids one day and if I can prove i can handle the stress of constantly looking after someone else before myself, then I will commit to adoption.

{"f9c3fbx": {"text": "Wowww I\u2019m so sorry those experiences are mad invalidating. I fortunately never knew a mental health provider who also knew my nmom prior to therapy. I did however constantly hear from other people (teachers, friends parents, neighbors, etc) how a  w e s o m e my nmom was, bla bla bla. That felt very invalidating too and is like a socially collective form of gaslighting - you must be the crazy one bc everyone else thinks that person is great. I think these feelings are pretty typical in this sub but def multiplied when it\u2019s a therapist telling you this! Especially since we see them with higher authority, they are \u201cqualified\u201d to make judgments about people, etc.It takes a lot of vulnerability and courage to see a therapist for help and a huge amount of trust, and when there is some sort of betrayal, it hits a lot deeper in my experience than in other types of relationships. I had several bad experiences with therapists and 1 psychiatrist over the last few years and I can replay the moments in my head when things went south. It stings real deep and extra painful bc they are supposed to be the experts on this yet they just did something harmful, so maybe you\u2019re overly sensitive? Maybe you really are shitty and even therapists can\u2019t like you? Or, maybe there are shitty healthcare providers and you got unlucky...I\u2019ve had to see a bunch of doctors for misc issues over the last few years and have received an eye opening dose on just how shitty some docs can be. There\u2019s no reason why mental health docs are exempt, we just hope that they are better, but that\u2019s not always the case.Trust your gut and in this case your experience bc it\u2019s pretty straightforward! The fact that the therapist decided he got to know your parent well enough playing basketball with him to rule out his faults is ridiculous and thankfully it\u2019s a pretty black and white situation where he is in the wrong. If you are nervous your local docs might know your family then I\u2019d look at trying to find someone online. The website Psychology Today lets you filter docs who do remote sessions. Might not be able to get a psychiatrist this way bc there\u2019s probably laws surrounding prescribing psychiatric meds online but you can def find a quality therapist. If you\u2019re looking for meds you can go to any regular doc and tell them how you\u2019re feeling and what you think might help if you\u2019ve done any research. They are usually pretty open to meds suggestions and although they aren\u2019t the gold standard for getting psych meds, they are fine if that\u2019s the only good option you\u2019ve got. Just make sure to read about the meds on your own some, don\u2019t go crazy, but familiarize yourself with side effects to look out for, the average efficacy of the meds, how long they take to work, etc. there\u2019s a psychiatry subreddit that I\u2019ve enjoyed reading to hear personal opinions from docs too.Good luck to you and stay strong!", "link_id": "t3_e4g3qv", "time": 1575218931}}

You don\u2019t want this stranger to be touching you or inside you.Every memory of the paps I\u2019ve had is seared into my brain. They weren\u2019t all bad, but I can recall them all.I much prefer a woman doctor and I don\u2019t think I will ever have a male doc again for paps. I had one years ago who made comments about my external appearance and ways feeling around internally with his fingers much more than he should have been. It felt very violating and I couldn\u2019t engage sexually with my partner for a solid two months afterwards. That memory still pops into my head from time to time.I\u2019ve also had the wand thing. I\u2019ve always found paps to be very painful, I think the wand was not as bad though if I recall.I don\u2019t want to scare you but I don\u2019t feel like many people are honest about how paps and pelvic exams can feel to some. Same way no one tells people how insane pregnancy can be. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to blow off your concerns and I think it\u2019s totally understandable to be uncomfortable getting these exams. Some people have no problems getting them and some women have panic attacks. I usually fall into the latter lol.To be fair I think most doctors realize a lot of women are nervous about these exams and don\u2019t want them. When I had the wand, it was a male doc and two female nurses in the room. I was unbelievably anxious, I don\u2019t exactly want a crowd, and I couldn\u2019t hold back tearing up. The nurse gave me a motherly kind of acknowledgment and it helped a lot, made me understand that she sees this often and I felt ok. So anyways. It\u2019s your own choice. It\u2019s good for your physical health to get checked out but don\u2019t neglect your mental health either if it is too distressing. I\u2019d suggest even talking to a therapist about this.

Slept an ungodly amount and felt like a zombie.I\u2019ve taken Xanax since May and I only developed a dependency then after taking it for a month (i had pneumonia and it was impossible to sleep). I tapered for a couple weeks and it was fine. Ssri and opioid (from a surgery) withdrawals were much worse.I might have a mild dependency now taking it around 4 - 5times a week, but it has still been very helpful. I\u2019m working on coming off of it now since I don\u2019t think I truly need it anymore. haven\u2019t had many panic attacks recently. It was extremely useful to take at night and stop panic/ptsd attacks that prevented me from sleeping.I largely just used xanax for sleep. 30 minutes before bed I\u2019d take it. It\u2019s just help me fall asleep. I wouldn\u2019t notice any sort of effects since I was asleep. I took it several times in the day too in low doses, .25mg, and I never got high off of it. To my knowledge you have to take around 2mg to feel a sort of high. I took 2mg multiple times when I had pneumonia and again, never felt high. It just made me calm and want to sleep.So, just info. I can\u2019t speak for the benzo you have now, but they can be helpful and are prescribed for a reason. If you have a propensity to addiction be careful obviously and make your own decisions. You can always ask for a very short script, like 5 pills, and give it a shot. So long as you don\u2019t take it everyday or in excess, you won\u2019t develop a chemical dependency to it. Like no more than 3x/wk but also I\u2019m not a dr. This is just what mine relayed. That\u2019s different from addiction, and I can\u2019t say whether or not you might feel high from it and love it. I\u2019m a petite and tiny person and it never made me high.If you don\u2019t like your doc though and don\u2019t feel like you can trust them, def see if you can find another one.

In saying one day humans might have a utopia, we don\u2019t have proof that\u2019d be the case, it\u2019s sort of like saying god has a plan, when there\u2019s no proof of that (I\u2019m agnostic/atheist).

I like the idea that our growth is scattered through time. That\u2019s frustrating as hell though lol. I totally agree we are all one consciousness divided into pieces and we don\u2019t see our connection. This idea also depresses me from time to time too, because it almost feels like our single consciousness was so bored in the universe prior to anything so it created the universe to distract itself and create simulations where it isn\u2019t alone, when in actuality this single sole consciousness is and will always be alone. I don\u2019t know about all of this obviously, but I do sometimes feel like that could be the case. And that sucks lol. That we can never truly die. We will eternally exist. That\u2019s tiring, to infinitely occupy ourself, alone. The only thing that keeps me from adhering to that idea is that I am essentially gone when I\u2019m asleep, I don\u2019t exist.

Mine was more than just personal suicide but I felt like suicide would be doing my part to end a sick species that is overwhelmingly prone to pain and suffering.Anyways...I am going to ask my doctor about going on an antipsychotic again. I have bipolar type 2 and I\u2019m on a mood stabilizer which is helpful but not enough. I think about suicide a lot. If you\u2019re still struggling I\u2019d suggest seeing a doctor to get a med to help, they have helped in my experience but they can be trial and error.Everyone has bad experiences with psychedelics from time to time, but if you had a psychosis type of event, and if you resonate with the symptoms of bipolar, it might be worth checking out. I suspect a lot of this sub has bipolar. Google the symptoms of bipolar type 1 and 2. If you do decide to check out medication (it can help with short term periods), and if you think you might have bipolar, be wary. Taking ssris sets off bipolar and it\u2019s actually one very common way to diagnose bipolar.For what it\u2019s worth, my first trip on mushrooms was very dreadful and scary. I went on to have many more eye opening and beautiful experiences with it again and with lsd which I tend to prefer. That said, there were bad trips here and there. I can\u2019t take these anymore bc I go into psychosis. To me, it feels like I\u2019ve \u201cseen too much\u201d or I\u2019ve gone \u201ctoo far down the rabbit hole\u201d. Hard to explain. So I don\u2019t advocate them unless you\u2019re mentally stable.For ptsd, I\u2019d HIGHLY recommend mdma. Make sure you actually get mdma though, they sell test kits to verify that\u2019s what you have. I took mda once and it was like a knock off version. Sucked and it\u2019s 5x as neurotoxic.Mdma is going through clinical trials to become a medication used in therapy sessions specifically for ptsd. Checkout the website maps.org if you haven\u2019t already. When I took it (a few times), SO much hidden trauma surfaced but in such a loving state of mind where I could process it without any pain. I never realized how much your mind can suppress and deny you in order to keep you feeling safe. Mdma connects different parts of the brain that allow it to reshape experiences and process them so that they aren\u2019t traumatic anymore. I never took it with the intention of healing so I could benefit from it more for sure, but I nonetheless gained a ton from mdma. Coming down is a bitch though so be mindful of that and the key is to not take a lot to avoid that depression of a hangover. You don\u2019t need to take a lot for it to be therapeutic.Keep hanging in there though. I am, it\u2019s hard and it seriously sucks. But just try your best.

That\u2019s how they hook you.I have the same feelings when I take painkillers, but we all know that\u2019s a very dangerous route to go down! Cocaine is worse from what I\u2019ve heard because your tolerance builds fast and when you start getting used to it you feel MORE agitated when you\u2019re not on it, so you use it more, thus a dependency and addiction has become established. Which drugs are worse is subjective but addiction is not.I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong taking these drugs a few times a year (like 3 - 4) with the understanding that it\u2019s solely recreational, it is NOT going to become a regular.

{"f0ouf5l": {"text": "First, I applaud for being vulnerable and discussing your feelings in a neutral and open way. It is always good to find a group where you feel supported but I think it\u2019s worth reconsidering the incel label you give yourself. There is one major difference between feminist groups and the incel groups being that feminists actively shun anyone (women included) who degrade men. The movement is not about taking down men, it\u2019s about creating equality. The vast majority of all feminists are in agreement that BOTH men and women need to find equal ground. Currently women are a lower class, objectively, so there\u2019s more to address to give women equality, but there are still many things women address to better the lives for men. I saw on a top post on  the other day a comment referring to the OPs video of two guys hugging saying something along the lines of \u201cthat\u2019s a great bro hug\u201d, and the comment that followed said I can\u2019t wait for the day we can just call it a hug. You don\u2019t say \u201cgirl hug\u201d, kinda weird. A hug for men has to be qualified with \u201cbro\u201d otherwise they are emasculated.So, I want to reiterate - the VAST majority of feminists are in favor of helping BOTH genders gain equality. It\u2019s targeted more towards helping women bc men do not experience a pay gap, they aren\u2019t told they need to smile more at work, or cat called anytime they go out, or stalked online and abused in person. OF COURSE these things DO happen to men, men can frequently be assaulted in relationships, but it happens much, much, much less than women. This is the premise for all women\u2019s issues right now. Men absolutely experience sexual assault - in the same way women should be believed when they say they were assaulted, men should too. Feminists believe this. The issue Burr and Trump both raised is that we should pay more attention to the 1% of false sexual assault allegations when it\u2019s essentially a moot issue, nearly nonexistent. You hear a few stories in the news a year about men who were falsely convicted when you just have to look to the women next to you and ask if one of them have been assaulted to usually find one. Trump and Burr both raised the idea that \u201cit\u2019s a scary time for men in this country\u201d when they are being falsely accused. If it\u2019s scary for the less than 1% of men being falsely accused, think of the 99% of women who ARE being sexually assaulted! Focusing on a minuscule amount of false allegations ignores the actual issue being that sexual assault is rampant and nearly every woman at some point in her life will experience some form of assault. It belittles the need to take that issue seriously. Burr did make fun of the Me Too, you\u2019ll have to rewatch if you don\u2019t recall it. He was very explicit saying he\u2019d like to yell at them. He suggested women don\u2019t believe in due process bc the Believe All Women movement. That\u2019s unfair considering everything aforementioned. It\u2019s truly ignorant to a systemic problem.It is always easy when life has got you down to pin your problems on someone else and blame people outwardly. It\u2019s a major form of projection. From what I\u2019ve seen, the incel community so openly hates women bc they likely hate themselves in some way but that\u2019s a hard feeling to recognize so it\u2019s easier to see the traits you don\u2019t like about yourself in others and then hate them instead. Perhaps this community tends to hate fake-feminists as I am going to call them (if someone believes women are superior to men, the people you reference, they are in the tiny minority of feminists - fake feminists bc they literally don\u2019t fit the definition of a feminist) because they see their similarities not their opposites. If your experience with feminists has led you to believe they are anti men, im sorry, they truly are a small minority of the movement. But they are loud - the crazy people in any movement are usually the loudest bc the sane people don\u2019t feel like shouting, so you\u2019re not going to recognize them. An example - I\u2019m in an online group with 4,000 vegans. There is ONE vegan who makes the group miserable, she\u2019s psychotic, and she also happens to be the moderator. Someone could walk out of that group saying vegans are insane (which people already do) after seeing what she\u2019s said and attributing her attitudes to everyone else when there are literally 3,999 other people in the group who are chill and just want to eat plants in peace. Reddit is nice in that a persons opinion is voted on so everyone doesn\u2019t get an equal voice (you could say that\u2019s also bad), but it gets to be more representative of the groups ideals. If you look through the top posts on the MGTOW vs Feminists, vs this group, you can spot an obvious difference. Fem groups are not going to trash men. Some women in the group feel jaded towards men the same as men feel in incel groups towards women as you mention, but their voices don\u2019t get to the top in the fem groups bc it goes against the group mentality and mission. In incel, you will see a lot of sad content that hates on women at the top. Even in dankmemes you will see sexist content with 50k on it.People want to be the victims in many ways. Trump supporters want to believe they lost their jobs to immigrants, not bc they were bad at it. They want to believe immigrants are also lazy bc they need to believe they themselves are hard working. They think immigrants are rapists and drug dealers bc they don\u2019t want to throw their neighbors or clergymen under the bus. People project and externalize like crazy. You see from time to time \u201cconversion therapist preacher comes out as gay\u201d. Men are victims in many ways but in contrast to all other groups in the world right now, white men have it best and have throughout basically all of history. I honestly was excited when Burr made the joke about white women and men sitting in the same hot tub referring to privilege not bc women get the same privilege as men but bc I thought he was going to bring up black women who are the most marginalized group in the US. I\u2019m a white woman and it frustrates me when I see people neglect black women\u2019s struggles. They do not receive the same privilege white women do and that should be recognized. Their struggle is greater.Neither men or women need to know what it feels like to be the other - their opinions just need to be heard and respect given when do - not the same as respecting all opinions, bc no opinion that oppresses others should be respected. When Burr and others try to push back against the feminist movements, I don\u2019t hear them necessarily hating on women. I hear them trying to distance themselves bc they feel defensive. In the same way no one alive today had any hand in slavery, it can make people uncomfortable when repercussions of slavery are brought up. It feels unfair, like hey we didn\u2019t do that, and it makes people defensive. But there ARE still rippling consequences there totally are. Men who aren\u2019t actively being sexist don\u2019t want to feel like they are responsible for gender inequality. Makes total sense. But defensiveness isn\u2019t the answer and tossing your hands up and saying it isn\u2019t me I\u2019m not the problem isn\u2019t going to get rid of inequalities. We all have to take accountability for our collective actions to change the system. If we all just said, I didn\u2019t do it that\u2019s not my fault, nothing would change. Our reality is rooted in our history and our history is sexist and racist af. Women have only been allowed to vote for 100yrs. Just bc laws changed doesn\u2019t mean attitudes have and that is where current oppression takes root - towards any minority group.My fianc\u00e9, straight while male, is also a feminist. He credits me to helping him see through the lens of women bc he was more or less in your shoes when we first met. I was his first GF, he was a quiet and shy guy growing up. There\u2019s a lot of history and so many layers to feminism that are ignored. He also hated Burrs whole women tirade and we talked about it for hours, literally, bc at first glance, oh it\u2019s just a joke, but when you really look at it, it\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s sexist and it fuels sexism simply put. That is different than making fun of women. My fianc\u00e9 was just as shocked as I was, he used to listen to Burrs podcast all the time so this seemed a bit random but nonetheless disheartening and troubling.", "link_id": "t3_d4onbq", "time": 1568820488}}
{"f0nnl89": {"text": "Neither feminist approach is right or wrong, they are just two different types. One might have more effective strategies but who is to say.Considering that women are constantly objectified, I think that is universally accepted at this time, I don\u2019t think it works in favor of feminism to share bikini/naked pics, but anyone is entitled to do so and they are not wrong for doing so. Women should feel safe to share their photos without worrying about predatory behavior being a potential consequence (whether directly towards them or fueling online creeps they won\u2019t ever meet). I think it may hurt the cause more than help, but my opinion isn\u2019t fact. I think self confidence and social acceptance/expectations can be confused. A woman posting a bikini pic will get many flattering responses that will boost her confidence, but it\u2019s external, she has taken value in placing her worth at the hands of others. She will want to post more pics and gain more approval and validation that she is confident and sexy.But the pic posted blindly to the public does perpetuate objectification. Women may see it as a personal choice and that it\u2019s what they like to do, but it is worth noting societies hands in shaping what a woman wants in life. One example - over 90% of women continue to take their husbands last name at marriage. Most will say it was a choice - she has always liked the idea of becoming Mrs Somebody Else since she was a little girl and the idea was bestowed upon her. But if the decision to take a mans last name is nearly unanimous among women when there are genuine objections to taking a mans last name and women are no longer legally required to take a mans last name, then it shows it is more than just a persons preference at play. Society plays a large part in what people think they want to choose or not, sort of in the free will realm of discussion.Hope this helps. It\u2019s a pretty big area for discussion, lots of different ways to interpret actions. It\u2019s worth noting too, women can perpetuate sexism. In the same way that women are indoctrinated from a young age to take a mans last name, they are also taught that their virginity is important, they need to be both sexy and pure, but also experienced, also still innocent. Moms returning to work are shamed, but stay at home moms are also shamed. There\u2019s a lot of conflict. So you can see how women might grow up with conflicting ideas of how they think other women should/shouldn\u2019t live life.", "link_id": "t3_d57wow", "time": 1568774919}}
