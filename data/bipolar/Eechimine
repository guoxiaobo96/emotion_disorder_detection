{"fqaca5k": {"text": "Are you saying every person who believes they didn\u2019t experience trauma as a child just forgot about it or doesn\u2019t remember it? That doesn\u2019t seem right. I had great parents, loving friends, the worst thing that happened to me before the age of 10 was someone calling me a name once, but it didn\u2019t upset me. You also have to remember that psychiatry is doing the best that it can, it\u2019s not like treatments and tests can be whipped up out of nowhere, neurobiological research is required to do that, which is what is being conducted every day and being fed back to medical students. Just because psychiatry doesn\u2019t have the end all be all holy grail of solutions doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a poor method of treatment all together. You are throwing out psychiatry as a whole while also completely ignoring the copious amounts of people who have benefited immensely from it. Are those people\u2019s experiences invalid to you? If there were such fatal flaws in psychiatry, it wouldn\u2019t be practiced anymore. The only way they could have tested you and know with certainty would likely be directly coming in contact with your brain tissue, which is costly, invasive, and less practical. It\u2019s the best we can do with the given technology and research. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. We are building up the science, and we cannot build accurate, more realistic testing measures until the science provides us with a safe and efficient way to do it. Just because there are no accessible tests that give you a certain answer, doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be, and if we make one, the first place it would be distributed through, would be psychiatry. Research is leaning us in the direction of genetics to do this. There has also been an increase in genetic correlates with mental diseases which likely are the way direct testing could be done. There is a relationship between mental illness and gene expression. I\u2019m not even going to get into that. Doctors are also using genetic testing to try and predict how certain medications may affect your body/brain, which is pushing psychiatry in the right direction towards testing. I was given a test called GeneSight. I received a large packet listing all the drugs I may have an over reactive response to, the ones I may need more of, and the ones that corresponded more directly to my specific cytosine based metabolites. This test is more frequently being distributed to those seeking psychiatric care, and I believe it is an attempt to mediate the more unpredictable aspects of adverse effects of medications. This overall, is one way in which the field of psychiatry is trying to stop people with similar opinions surrounding \u201ca lack of respect to patients\u201d. Epigenetics is also a method through which physical changes are seen in response to the environment around us.  In response to your second to last link:The first sentence of the paper? \u201cProgressive brain volume changes in schizophrenia are thought to be due principally to the disease. However, recent animal studies indicate that antipsychotics, the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia patients, may also contribute to brain tissue volume decrement.\u201d ...May also contribute. So while it can change the brain the paper admitted that primarily the brain structure abnormalities are due to the disease, so you disproved your own point about there not being physical differences. So yes, there seem to be some harmful affects from certain antipsychotics but how you are still trying to deny the physicality of mental illness doesn\u2019t make sense. In response to your last link: telling me the ways antipsychotics can negatively affect physical health doesn\u2019t tell me whether or not overall people taking them were worse off as a whole after taking them. A lot of people are aware of the effects it will have on their physical health but they continue the treatment because the benefits the drug has had mentally outweighs this risk. Expanding on your point with antipsychotics:This seems to be the one area of medication that you are providing sufficient evidence for being harmful physically. This I can agree with. While many people believe the mental improvement outweighs the physical effects of antipsychotics, it is one area where more research should be done. Antidepressants, mood stabilizers etc. have not been seen to possess physical effects as severe as antipsychotics.  So again, I do think antipsychotics should be improved on and researched more. This still doesn\u2019t mean psychiatry is worthless. Mood stabilizers such as Valproate have actually been seen to have neuroprotective effects:[on valproate](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2186352) [on lithium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4063497/#idm140382300923296title) Also here are a couple papers on the physical differences seen (genetic and structurally) [FXR1P is a GSK3\u03b2 substrate regulating mood and emotion processing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4547302/) [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178116311763](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178116311763) [On schizophrenia ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920996419302166) [On bipolar disorder ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5997869/) [more on bipolar disorder ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6727647/) [genetics and bipolar disorder ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6956732/) [ENIGMA and its contribution to biological correlates of mental illness ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7083923/) Some experimental evidence of physical aspects of mental illness:[experimental membrane protein treatments. shows physical relationship and new method of improvement on antidepressant treatment ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4438541/) Papers stating the benefits of psychiatric treatment: This one I have free access to the entire thing through my university so you may or may not be able to see the whole thing, apologies.

If the drug didn\u2019t work for a majority of people why was it even made and brought to the masses? It seems like this sub is primarily made up of hasty generalizations just because you guys  had poor experiences. Nothing is going to be perfect for everyone, with current technology that impossible. You are asking psychiatry to do the impossible at this current time in history.

I go to AA meetings every once and a while, and that helps a little. I\u2019m now a senior in college and I am 21(I live in the US) so I still struggle a lot due to having access to it whenever like you do. However, telling someone I trust about it has really really helped me. I recommend telling someone, ANYONE you trust, if not your parents. Having a person who knows the struggle you\u2019re going through allows you to have an outlet to talk about how you feel about it.  If the only person you have to tell is your parents, I would yell them. They will probably be concerned but they would also be happy that you told them because they will want to do anything to help you. As for whether you can keep drinking in the future or if you have to stop altogether, I don\u2019t know yet, I\u2019ve been pondering that as well. There are definitely sometimes I don\u2019t have it, because of similar situations to you like school/assignments/tests etc.  I totally understand the feeling of needing it and craving it, and I think that\u2019s enough for both of us to say clearly that we are likely high functioning alcoholics. In AA this was described to me. I was told it was alcoholism in the form of only not consuming it when other crucial responsibilities needed attending to.  I was also told it can very easily develop into full blown alcoholism. My father and his father and his father etc. we\u2019re all alcoholics, and because they all had quite successful careers, they were high functioning for a while, but not forever.

After undergrad it\u2019s pretty realistic to expect that you can do a lot with an undergraduate neuroscience degree if you get your masters/PhD. A lot of people go to undergrad with a different major than what they do in grad school.

Personally, I am going to get a PhD and hopefully do government research or industry research, and become a professor if that\u2019s even possible.

I think that saying \u201cwhat I\u2019ve become\u201d is the thing detracting from your self worth. You have not become anything you just changed, which in short, is inevitable. I eventually went vegan and my weight has stayed lower because of that, but it was a huge lifestyle change that a lot of people wouldn\u2019t see as worth it. It\u2019s too much to handle sometimes. I think that recognizing that you haven\u2019t \u201cbecome\u201d anything different than who you are would help. You are still you and the size of your body is going to change for the rest of your life. You\u2019ll probably lose a lot of weight someday in the future, and then it may go back up. You can\u2019t prevent that. Also remember that 80% of women hate their bodies, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one woman out there who doesn\u2019t sympathize with people who are unhappy with themselves physically. We all do this together unfortunately, and it\u2019s not our fault. It\u2019s just how the mass of society has pushed it, right or not, it\u2019s just the shitty state of society.
