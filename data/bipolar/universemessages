You need some help and there's nothing wrong with that, everyone needs help sometimes. And I know that talking to someone is expensive and it can also feel stupid and mundane. Maybe you could pick up a self help book or a work book. I personally use DBT work books to help me process emotions better.I am on this sub because my fiance has an addiction to weed and he's been sober from it for quite a few years now. I never had an addiction to that but I am an alcoholic and became addicted to cocaine as well. And I really like the advice in this sub because I can relate to it.Weed may not be *as bad* as other hard drugs, but the addiction is real and a lot of people do abuse it as an unhealthy coping mechanism for their anger or anxiety.

I usually eat some sourdough bread, have a glass of kefir, or just try to find whatever is around when this happens.Most of the time I'm totally fine with fried foods even though I have definitely eliminated a lot from my diet. I like to try new things and new ways to cook food, especially food that has a good track record with gastritis. But if I eat something bad I have the worst attacks ever. It's literally the worst pain I've ever felt. It's straight up piercing pain and it's super hard to breathe and move. It feels like my ribs are being crushed.Sometimes it is mild enough that I can cool it down with some Pepto Bismol chewables or kefir. But sometimes that doesn't help at all. I usually have to vomit and it's very violent and acidic (obviously). Sometimes I even have to purge my food and I'm scared I'm developing an eating disorder. It's mostly bile because I have no gallbladder now either.Different foods will do this to me but stress is my number 1 trigger. Sometimes I'm fine with certain foods and sometimes they'll trigger an attack. For example I was really depressed and hungry one day last week so I ordered some KFC. Didn't felt like cooking and really craved some greasy comfort food. Fucking worst decision of my life.

They said similar, if not the exact same things. If your husband has a traumatic brain injury, he should get professional help. And if he doesn't, that is not your problem. That's his problem. You're your own person and you don't deserve that stress, nor is it necessary to be around.In a marriage, they say it's through sickness and health, but they don't mention the people that refuse to get better when they're sick. You can't force anybody to do anything. But you are in control of your own safety, and your child's safety.It's very common for abusers to show their true colours YEARS into a marriage. At the beginning, it's called love bombing. Because they want to gain your trust and loyalty before they attempt to control you. It's very common for victims of abuse to be brainwashed and trapped in the relationship because of those past times that were so lovely and happy. This is all textbook abuse.I think the steps you need to take right now, considering how far this has gone (including the 7 day silent treatment threat), is get you and your child somewhere safe that isn't the same house as him. A lot of the time in situations like these, trying to communicate and talk it out can make it worse. He WILL convince you to trust him and that he has good intentions. He WILL convince you to stay.However, take all this with a grain of salt because I'm just a rando on the internet.

Trisha is very severe because she has impulse problems, trauma, and can't have stable relationships. She has all the energy in the world, I think if she had severe depression like me, she probably wouldn't have a job and be taken more seriously in the mental health system. But because she works so hard and can take care of herself, she's not viewed as severe in the eyes of a doctor.I've seen this in my grandma in the past, my grandma has bipolar and once picked up and threw a giant metal can/ashtray at a teller in a bank. She refused to be medicated because that was how the government put chips in our brains to listen to our thoughts. Yet she was highly functional and energetic most of the time, and could muddle through her depression, so she was never forced to get treatment. She also never thought anything was wrong with her. I feel like some people have insight and some don't. And I think Trisha is trying really hard and putting in effort.The mental health system here in Canada is free, and it's so hard to navigate.

All four are actually extremely connected, I'm not sure when you would have taken a psychology class, but this is all recent information and the most a university class would teach is that schizophrenia and bipolar are biological (I'm a psychology major). For example bipolar is extremely connected to gut flora, since the amygdala directly communicates with the gut. There has been research showing that fecal transplants is a potential treatment for bipolar. Schizophrenia also has the most proof of being biological, and this has been known for a while now. None of these illnesses are curable in the slightest, a lot of people with schizophrenia don't respond to meds, a lot don't even respond to electro shock therapy.

If there was more research, these personalities could become treatable and help with crime, amount of people in jail, and the consequences the actions have from people like this (because there would be less actions, and more treatment).

I'm not a doctor.Bipolar is similar to ADHD, autism, schizophrenia, etc because they're all pretty neurological/biological.Cigarettes have found to help treat sensory gating in schizophrenia (and autism and ADHD). The effects only last 30 minutes which is why people with schizophrenia are found chain smoking so much (there's some ridiculous statistic like 98% of people with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes).I think maybe this is connected. I know for me right now, I have been slowing down on smoking. It's cold outside and I don't smoke inside so I smoke only a few cigarettes a week. I have such a hard time quitting though, because I'm now clean and sober (2 years in October). Smoking is literally my only vice! I don't gamble, I refuse to take benzos. I play video games and have other coping mechanisms but when I'm really stressed, a cigarette is the only thing that helps me distract myself.I've found lately that cigarettes have been raising my blood pressure and causing anxiety. So that's another reason why I barely smoke. But I can definitely notice a difference now that I smoke less compared to when I used to smoke, like, a pack a day.So just keep this in mind if you want to quit smoking cigarettes.

If she does truly have it she's probably the most severe I've ever seen.When someone can't feel empathy, there's something going on neurologically. Empathy is a learned skill, and if you're completely unable to learn how to be empathetic, there's a lot a research that has proven there's something wrong with your brain.For example I don't think Kai has this problem. I think Kai can feel remorse and empathy. I think Kai could potentially be saved from this behaviour, he's young and has several decades of life ahead of him.Greg on the other hand is quite a bit older and shows no signs of being able to change. It's not about whether he went to therapy or not. Sometimes therapy is extremely damaging for people with NPD if they are undiagnosed because they can manipulate the therapist.

It's a choice to start doing drugs but you can die from withdrawals. We need better facilities and better quality care to treat people's addictions without enabling their addiction (i.e. benzos, methadone). Addiction is also very commonly paired up with mental illness, and one of the main causes of it is childhood sexual abuse.

I started reading heavily on the subject and found the Weyburn Mental Hospital here in Sask was also a very terrifying place. I wrote an article about it. You can read it if you want.

{"f7hbz3d": {"text": "I wear a 46DD/E, it's hard to find something that fits perfectly because not only do our boobs swell during that time of our cycles, but I find different bras even in the same brand will vary in band size. I am also between cup sizes a lot of the time, like what you're describing here, and it's annoying as hell.I shop at Additionelle/Penningtons. There's also a custom bra shop in my area called Bodacious Bustlines, they have AMAZING quality bras in every size and do custom work. The brand they sell is called FitFully Yours. I own 2 of these bras, they are fantastic.You need to try to find an upscale store to fit you properly, even if you aren't gonna buy anything. There are also certain ways to make a bra fit better. For example, never use the last hook holes on the band. The hooks are made like that so the bra can stretch with time. Fit for the last hook holes.Also, the bra cup should hold everything from under your armpit, so you need to bend down and scoop.There shouldn't be a gap between the shoulder straps and your upper chest, that means the cup is too big. Alternatively, boobs shouldn't overflow, even a little bit. Too small.Always get someone else to measure you to get the correct band and cup size. Sometimes people are inbetween cup sizes which makes it important to experiment with other brands and try on a LOT of bras.The band should be snug. Some people wear too tight of bras, but some think they shouldn't be tight at all. This is wrong, it has to be snug so that you get the proper support. The band at the back also can't be too high up. You want it to be around the same level as the front.There is also sister sizing. For example, you measured yourself as a 46C but found the cup to be too big. A 46C is also almost the exact same as a 48B, or a 44D. Do you see what I'm saying? It would be worth to check out sizes using this method.Hope this helps!

I do not appreciate this. I don't think any trans person would appreciate their genitals being called a girldick or manpussy by a random stranger on the internet? Does that make sense to you? If it doesn't, let me explain.Trans people go through a lot of hardship. A lot experience depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Statistics for suicide in their group is extremely high. As a cis person, I do not experience what they do. I do not experience being trapped in a different body. I do not experience gender dysphoria. Thus, I experience sympathy.Sympathy is acknowledgement that another person is sorrowful, and having the desire to help them. I experience sympathy for trans people. I also experience sympathy for OP, because clearly they have had a bad experience. But there is also something else I feel.Empathy is a shared feeling for someone else's feelings. For example, if you have never had a close family member die, and one of your friends' parents dies, you could feel sympathy for them because you know your friend is in pain, but it's very difficult for you to empathize because you lack the shared experience. On the other hand, if you had recently lost a parent and even a stranger you just met tells you they just lost a loved one, you can feel the shared sorrow because it's something you've experienced before and you feel the same grief, or a very similar feeling.I personally feel empathy for trans people because I experience depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. I have also attempted suicide multiple times. So a lot of their experiences are close to my heart. But I also feel empathy for OP, because I have also been lied to in the past, I have been angry, and I have vented online due to frustration in my private life. In fact, if you sensed some aggression in my other posts, it's because I was being a little abrasive. This was due to frustration. OP's thread has frustrated me, and I was trying to get my point across. OP did not show any sign of understanding my point, so I became even more frustrated.This is similar to OPs situation where they have experienced things with the trans community, gotten frustrated, and is now arguing with people in this thread.While OP has a very good point that they don't have to have sex with anyone they don't want, it is pretty out of line to call trans people's genitals girldick and manpussy. As well as say other hateful things in this thread. These specific actions I do not have empathy for because I don't think being frustrated is a good excuse to say such hateful things.

I don't wanna drag out the story so I'm just going to fast forward to the critical part. I ended up being with my best friend (who was also given shrooms) and his mom. She took us to the golf course in the valley, really pretty, lots of trees and wilderness. She gave me a whole joint to smoke to myself while she smoked as well...she knew we were on shrooms btw! (Mom of the year)I got back into the golf cart and blacked out. When I opened my eyes again, my brain was violently shaking back and forth in my head, there was a lot of static almost like my reality had SWITCHED channels, like a TV. My brain slowed down with the shaking until it felt more like a pendulum. I could see clearer. Everything around me had changed, physically. We were in the same valley but it was 100% not the same dimension. I honestly felt that I had died, or my soul was being ripped inside out, or I was in some kind of purgatory.Everything around me was not how life looks now, it was almost like computer video game animation. I always used to describe it as \"Candy Land\". The grass did not have blades, it was solid but liquid at the same time. I could hear colours and see sounds, but that's common for shrooms, so not necessarily an effect of being in a different dimension, but who knows. My friend and his mom PHYSICALLY turned into giant bears. One was pink and one was purple. They were NOT HUMANS anymore.I started to cry and I could hear them talking almost from a far away distance, like it was from the sky. Like I was stuck in another realm but could subtly hear what was happening outside of my REAL body. They said I must be having a bad trip and we should go home. So they took me to their place where I laid on the couch and closed my eyes. I could see myself laying on the couch but it was in an infinite space, SURROUNDED by fractals. Like I had a very intense out of body experience for quite a long time before I fell asleep.I resonate very much with your story. I've been trying to figure out what my experience means for years. I usually boil it down to drugs but a part of me always believes it was something more significant. I'm 26 now and this happened when I was 12. I would say I have pretty bad PTSD from it. I TRULY thought I was dead and in a purgatory for at least 2 years afterwards. I had to do a lot of therapy because of it and I still need to.", "link_id": "t3_d57sx1", "time": 1568941588}}

This gives us more energy, less inhibition, we get less of a filter, our thought process becomes more unorganized and frantic, etc etc. The amygdala is also very connected to the stomach and how the stomach and brain communicate. A lot of research shows that our gut bacteria is extremely connected to bipolar, to the point of maybe causing it.I 100% agree bipolar isn't necessarily a \"mood\" disorder because I feel mostly physical symptoms, especially in depression. I think it has a lot more to do with energy levels, our circadian rhythm, and possibly other things that haven't been proven yet.

Eugenia clearly cannot be independent since she is so codependent to her mom. As long as her mom is involved, nothing will stop. And Eugenia will continue to hold back from opening up fully.If Jaclyn never made the video, nothing would have been done. There is nothing she could have called the cops for because they would need evidence. And even if Jaclyn told the mental health professionals, there's nothing they can do about that without proof or confirmation from Eugenia.In this situation, I think raising the tension is a good thing. I think making the video was a good decision, despite it getting to such a large audience with irrelevant opinions (including me). I feel like it will send an effective message to Eugenia's mom.If you know anything about abusers, during times like this (being \"exposed\") is when they show their cracks. The mask starts to come off. More people in her life will see her true self more often. Something will give, she'll either break down, or do something drastic that gets her in trouble. Being quiet has not worked in this situation. So it's very important for Jaclyn, specifically, to get under her skin.Secrets are dangerous. Nobody should have to keep secrets.

The belief was that extra weight might help withstand infectious diseases.\u00a0During this era,\u00a0Rubens (1577\u20131640)\u00a0regularly portrayed full-bodied women in his pictures, which portrayed men and women considered beautiful then, but obese by today\u2019s standards.I think you should absolutely get a dress made and get measured. Do some research for reviews of seamstresses in your area so you can get measured and possible alterations. I think it would be awesome if you looked up renaissance art and completely blew everyone out of the water.I'm not into historical reenactment, but I am into history and I am into costumes (cosplay and Halloween). So I can 100% relate to how you're feeling about doing something where you feel it won't look right. But guess what. Cosplay is for everyone. Not just skinny people.

Cries about her bf running away because they had a fight. Then kinda walks away...I had an old car without automatic locks. She opens the passenger door and just sits beside me. She then puts a knife to my stomach and tells me to fucking drive to find her boyfriend. I was like...k! So we drove and found her bf on 33rd and Idylwyld. He gets in and starts freaking out on her for having a knife. They give me directions to their place. They invite me in, of course I don't say no because I'm a fucking idiot, but I was also really scared so I just did whatever they asked. I go to their place and they vent to me for 3 hours like I was their fucking marriage counselor. Then the girl started getting all close with me and sat on my lap, started giving me a hickey on my neck, I shoved her off me and said I had to go and bolted out of there. Went home and just laid there like WTF just happened.That's not the end though! Next couple weeks my car kept getting broken into. Windows smashed. Tons of graffiti on my building. The last time they ripped out my signal switch, literally ripped the whole thing off. All the damage these people did to my car, it was totaled. They also left a red, antique gas lamp in my back seat. They didn't even syphon my gas. I think they wanted to set my car on fire or something. My downstairs neighbor had had enough of that shit and felt terrible for me. He made me write down everything in full detail (he is a disabled ex Navy vet) and he called the cops for me and they came and he helped me give a statement while I cried. I then moved to another area ASAP.Cops were like \"We can't do much, we'll just have more presence in the area.\" I even told them where the girl with the knife lived but he didn't seem to care.

But from what I hear they are still together, have no idea how.Another friend's SO just bought a house for them and they seem very happy right now despite him cheating in the past.And of course it makes a difference when people have kids or have assets together. People stay together for many reasons and sometimes it works out. Sometimes it doesn't though and sometimes a couple stays together because it's an abusive dynamic or one person is codependent on the other. These are things I think you should look out for, especially with her saying she is so 'unsure' about everything. Yet she says she hates you sometimes.It could be the only reason she is unsure of continuing your relationship is because she is scared to leave. And she might be scared to leave because you have something, or things, that she considers a benefit. She might need you for reasons that aren't love.", "link_id": "t3_blk727", "time": 1557219364}}

I think hormones are definitely harsh on the body, but if a kid with ADHD needs adderall to function properly, they'll take it despite the side effects. Same with me, I need lithium. Maybe it would be better if people looked at transitioning more of a treatment than an escape. These things are cause way more by physical factors than we even know. It's not so \"psychological\" as we think it is. It's not some made up weird thing our brains come up with. There are huge reasons for having gender dysphoria and maybe a kid shouldn't have such a harsh medical treatment early on, but if the case is severe enough, I think it's up to the doctor's discretion whether they continue or not.

Then proceed to get completely obliterated at the casio and walk the streets drunk and fighting everyone. It's fucking madness, it's like the government wants them to do that.And then up north they have no schooling. Because they're afraid of being white washed with our school system. So families will move into the city from the reserve and put their kids in school when they don't know left from right. The school system doesn't know what to do so if the kid stays they'll get an automatic pity pass. Then go to university not knowing what Europe even looks like. They'll know how to skin a raccoon though! Because that's real useful knowledge when you're in the city. The government will give them no tax on cigarettes and their bands will help with post secondary education. But what fucking difference does that make when everyone is literally commiting suicide?And then they cry about the 60s scoop. Like yeah that shit actually happened and it was horrible. But they claim it's still happening to this day. It's not. I was literally kidnapped by a social worker from my home when I was a new born and was separated from my siblings. Why? Because my mom is schizophrenic and was completely dissociative for days and couldn't take care of us. What that social worker did was unethical, but we shouldn't have been with our mom in the first place! The reason why native kids are being taken away is for good reason. Because all the parents have their many addictions and cause an unsafe environment for the kids. You can look up the statistics, very very rarely do kids get taken away from native families if the parents are married. DUH. Because they've put effort into having a loving home and it shows.It just makes me feel bad for everyone involved. They make it impossible to help them. But the government goes about \"helping\" in a completely wrong way. Everything is so fucked. My fiance works in a city more north of here with a very large native population and he used to think very much the same as you. But you need to realize, these people didn't ask for drugs and poverty and crime. They were catapulted into this lifestyle because of racism. And once you're deep down the rabbit hole it's hard to get out, especially with the shitty mental health and addictions resources in our province (I would know, I had to fight for myself for over a decade with bipolar, and I got sober by myself because their resources are shit).The native people may be taking the government for a ride in your eyes.

So I don't see anything wrong with his content and when he does do anything wrong he mostly makes up for it by showing genuine remorse and apologizing as well as deleting the said video or videos that had the questionable content.A couple of people in the group are not the greatest though. I really don't like Jason and I don't care how much people say Trisha is toxic, Jason is a huge asshole. He also exploited a story about him having bipolar for BetterHelp (which is a scam) and then when he told the story, turns out the doctor diagnosed him with bipolar within 5 minutes. He also admitted he doesn't know what mania is. So a lot of people were pissed including me, and he deleted the video.Apparently Scott is kind of a dick as well and Zane is extremely arrogant. But that's all things you hear from the fan base.The shit with Brandon is just despicable if you have heard about that.The girls in the group are great, I think a couple of them are problematic like Corinna for example came out with merch that had the Webster definition of anxiety on t-shirts and sweaters. Kinda making \"anxiety\" a fashion statement. Which I personally didn't really care about, I even thought it was a neat idea (I have bipolar and generalized anxiety disorder) but I understand where people are coming from with the whole romanticising mental illness, which I agree with, I don't like that.I used to watch them, I've watched them since the Vine days and have been huge fans. Started with ScottySire on Vine and branched off from there. So I've been a fan for years. I just recently stopped watching though because of the Trisha drama. I know people hate Trisha but I relate with her on another level, I think she has a good heart and good intentions but can't control herself (poor impulse control due to mental illness). And the way Jason and, honestly, everyone, handled that situation was terrible. Idk what goes on behind the scenes and maybe it's all fine now but I felt so bad for Trisha. I don't subscribe to her anymore either, I will still watch her trolling videos, but I unsubbed from everyone except for Alex Ernst because I just couldn't bring myself to supporting them anymore.

Just be open to what the doctors say and what their opinions are, because some symptoms are very similar to others but they will be able to tell what it actually is.Side effects of lithium...I currently experience fatigue, weight gain, and dry mouth. But it's definitely not as intense as other meds. Lithium is made to be the med with the least side effects, but it can be the most toxic in high doses and it requires constant blood work to make sure things are level.Different meds include depakote, lamotrigine, topamax, and many others. A lot of these meds are also anticonvulsants (for epilepsy). They are referred to as mood stabilizers when used for bipolar.You can also have an antidepressant to bring you up and an antipsychotic to bring you down. This combination works just as effectively as a mood stabilizer.If you're not having severe mania or any kind of psychosis, I doubt they will get you on an antipsychotic or even a mood stabilizer. They will probably try an antidepressant first and see how that makes you feel. If it causes you to go up and down even more intensely, tell them. They usually use that as a method to test if you have bipolar.Like I said, it's a long progress. Bipolar is extremely biological and should be treated like any other kind of illness. It needs to be tested and made sure it's there first before you dive into harsh treatments.And honestly, don't be surprised if you aren't bipolar at all. Sometimes people have intense moods like that just because. It may be because of childhood abuse or trauma, and sometimes it can even be a person's thyroid.", "link_id": "t3_b8ceb7", "time": 1554218147}}

Horrible, violent depressions and rapid cycling.Then depakote helped a lot but it's not the greatest for women's reproductive health so I got off of it. Then I started lithium and I noticed a fog was lifted within a couple days. It was fantastic. I then got 100% sober after a couple months. I had suffered from alcoholism and substance abuse/addiction for years , since age 11. From then on my episodes were few and far between. It was incredible.I'm still going on strong with no hypomanic episodes (I have bipolar 2). I am currently in a depressive episode, though...but it's because of severe stress in my life at the moment. I've been dealing with it ok, have suicidal thoughts here and there, but mostly I've been pushing through. No matter how much I cry or how many days I spend in bed, I know there's light at the end of the tunnel.I also get really bad physical symptoms like heaviness and general pain all over my body.

You will do things that are so exhilarating you'll wait years to do again, and again. You'll create relationships, really close ones.

He obliged. Looked at my belly button and said there is probably an abscess and he'll book me another ultrasound. This will take a couple weeks to a couple months to get booked.

My grandma also has bipolar 1 so I've observed a lot of full blown manic episodes (assaulting nurses, bank tellers, buying 5 Cadillacs because she wants to \"start a dealership\", meds are the way the government reads our thoughts, etc).BPD can have some symptoms of psychosis if the person is sleep deprived or stressed enough. But I wouldn't call any kind of BPD mood swings \"mania\", mania is exclusive to bipolar and schizoaffective disorder. And in any other illness I would say the word is used as slang. Mania has pretty strict diagnostic criteria.From experiencing BPD and mania, I can say with full confidence that any symptom of BPD is nowhere near as bad as the biological lottery that bipolar mania or hypomania is. Some people have a harder time with BPD than others and it seems I've had a pretty easy time. I think due to being extra insightful from having a lot of mental illness in my family.

I was on it because apparently it's good to take while on depakote, so this was before I was diagnosed with PCOS. I'll ask about that too.My testosterone is also high, obviously because PCOS. I feel like it contributes to my issue of not being able to lose weight because I so easily gain muscle. I have horrid acne and hair growth. Etc etc all the typical symptoms. But I've gotten my blood sugar and insulin tested in the past and apparently it's totally fine! So it's really weird. I'm definitely excited to get this big test done today.I currently take a women's supplement that includes folic acid. Apparently people with PCOS metabolize folic acid differently and I should look for a different form of it. Haven't gotten around to doing that. I also just started taking 200mg of CoQ10 as I read a study of it helping several symptoms of PCOS including inflammation. I've already noticed a difference in energy level which is good.Thank you so much for taking the time and typing out everything in this thread. I'm very interested in this kind of stuff and it definitely helps since I'll be seeing my doctor today.Are there any other blood tests I should ask for today to put on my list?I hope you're having a good day (From Canada).

When working with psychiatric disorders and in psychology, therapists and doctors should have no other relationship with their patients other than in their office. A huge bias can prevent a perfectly amazing doctor from treating you the way you deserve and the way you need to be treated.Consistency is awesome. Even if a med isn't working for you, you should take it at the same time every day to really understand the way it's effecting you. I also recommend making some kind of diary or mood chart. I use the app Daylio and Clue together so that I can find patterns in my bipolar and my monthly cycle. This has helped me tons in harping at my doctors and showing them how bad I really am when they don't believe me because I'm in one piece when I walk through their door. Which means I must be totally fine and not a mess.Find a new doctor. It's time to be responsible for your own well being. Research doctor ratings in your area and find one looking for patients, and then ask for a psychiatrist. Whether you have bipolar 2 or something else, you won't regret it.

I always wake up tired and I don't think I've woken up feeling well rested in over a decade.A nurse told me something great this one time I was being hospitalized. I was really tired and I woke up from sleeping for about 15 hours. She told me that even if I sleep that long the next night, to just let myself sleep because obviously I need a good rest. What she meant was that I wasn't having a good REM sleep, from nightmares and my mental health and addictions (sober now!) So I needed to let myself rest as much as I could so I could at least have some good quality REM sleep.Hormones affect all of these things. They affect us more than we know.I suggest you force yourself to stay awake as much as you can during the day and do NOT nap. Napping can screw with several things like your circadian rhythm for example. Naps seem really nice but naps are for babies, they are not recommended for adults.

Bipolar makes Kanye West say he's Jesus, wear the MAGA hat, preach love, and then literally preach every Sunday. He literally hosts his own mass every Sunday. Mental illness does crazy things, please ignore the dude that says he knows how to not be a raging cunt waffle. He's one of the lucky ones that didn't become a raging cunt waffle from his mental illness.", "link_id": "t3_aw7a81", "time": 1551525863}}

My family and I have gone through hell and back from schizophrenia and bipolar, my mom and uncle are both completely dependent and cognitively disabled from the amount of ECT they gave them, and have been over medicated for 25 years. They even gave my mom ECT in North Battleford while she was pregnant with me. My bipolar started showing symptoms when I was a young child, I didn't start getting help until I was 12, and it took them a whole decade to figure out that maybe I'm bipolar and maybe I should be on lithium.Ketamine treatment is very new to our province, there is definitely not enough research for it to be full proof, and I would not trust the workers here to do it. We are underfunded, under educated, and under staffed. I know you may be having horrible uncontrollable mania, and I'm not trying to scare you. But some of these things may cause you to sacrifice a lot just to stop the mania. Just think about it, that's all I'm saying.If you're going to get the treatment, I recommend going out of province to do it. There are ways to get tax credits for travel for these things.

{"egma53r": {"text": "I've been sober for a year and four months from alcohol, hard drugs, and weed. I'm now working on coffee, going on a few weeks. I might be able to provide some insight.1) I found life to bring more colour into it after I got sober. Life is definitely not dull, it's just calmer. I like that, it makes me happy. My fiance is also sober, and because of this, we have more money to do things we truly want to do. Things like going to Ozzy and Iron Maiden. Getting an engagement ring. Going camping in the mountains. And saving for a wedding. With a band and a big party in my home town!! (Just because I'm sober doesn't mean I can't party lol) Etc.2) I don't think addictions replace addictions. What I did find was that while I was missing alcohol, I was also missing the sugar from alcohol and mixed drinks. I now drink quite a bit of pop, which isn't great, but it's better than being drunk. I don't think sugar replaced my alcohol addiction, I think it was already there and it's something I need to deal with on top of everything else.3) I use video games to escape as well, but I need to have the interest to do something else to balance my time. I'm in university right now, just in two classes, but the classes are really interesting and I have a passion for them. I want to do well in them. This helps me step away from Overwatch. I also want to point out that when I got sober, I had just started lithium a couple months prior. I think this medication change helped a lot in giving me the strength to get sober. I know lithium doesn't work for everyone, but finding the right med for me was a eureka moment. I have been on disability for years and I suddenly understood why. Getting sober and finally having a healthy mind helped me to have more discipline and finally go after my dream (a psychology degree).4) If you want to see how cutting down on or quitting weed could benefit your life, I suggest checking out / When it comes to video game addiction, there is actually recent research. An addiction to video games is now considered a disorder, kind of like alcohol use disorder. I would look at it like any other addiction, where if it's obviously causing harm to your life, it should be cut out. I hope this gives you some more information. It's your choice to make, this is your life and you're in control of it. If you enjoy playing video games and smoking weed, that's fine, but you need to make sure it isn't causing harm to the other aspects to your life. Especially the other people in your life. Addictions and your mental health can also affect everyone else around you, and you need to be mindful of that.", "link_id": "t3_aranhq", "time": 1550349773}}

I ended up abusing it and snorting it and selling it at parties. I took it for years without doctors finding out I was doing this or even thinking that maybe an antidepressant was causing me to be manic. It also made me kind of rapid cycle, I'm not sure how rapid cycling works because I've never had a doctor talk to me about it.

There's a lot more better minorities out there doing a whole lot more good while protesting in a more effective way, that's for sure.You never see aboriginals literally killing police officers because they don't want the government to put a fucking pipeline on their land.

And the government won't do shit about it. They just tube tie the women and throw cash at them and their reserves so they can enable the drug and addiction problems. What do they do? Try to set up appointments with our Prime Minister to communicate to solve problems. Justin Trudeau is fucking useless by the way he's basically the French, liberal Donald Trump. Either way, we don't harm people during our protests because we're not blind with rage, we have a goal and we want unity. We don't want more separation.

You can identify as anything you want and I'll have no problem with it. I will have a problem with it if you misrepresent science. I identified as \"both\" when I was a teen, and then I got older and matured and realized I was just a woman with hormonal issues that was trying to be edgy and unique. That is my own personal experience, I wasn't saying that my personal experience is an absolute.Blaire's political opinions are valid, and I may not agree with her about a couple things, but I find her to be way more open minded and well read than more left-leaning youtubers. I don't find her transphobic, \"boot-licking for cishets\" is a horrible term btw...what the fuck. And I've watched literally all of her videos and have never heard her say anything racist whatsoever.The \"blackface\" thing was a black beauty mask (lots of people wear them, have you ever seen this thing called an advertisement lol). She was also making a joke, specifically making a dig at BLM because black lives matter is absolutely horrible and is basically the love mother of Antifa, they are both disgusting, violent, horrible groups. Also, can you show me proof of Blaire saying that she \"only dates Aryans\" (even though she's engaged to an American Caucasian with brown hair and brown eyes). If she does say it, she's probably saying it to piss off people like you.You also have pretty baseless claims, the proof is in Riley's most popular videos. His ideas are dangerous and he is totally discriminatory to the LGBT community. It's really gross and disturbing.And even if Riley was legitimately trans (which he isn't), me \"misgendering\" him wouldn't be harmful.

My mom is schizophrenic and has thought our family is Chinese for the whole time I've been alive, we are very much white. She even used to speak fake Chinese when I was a kid. My grandma with Bipolar refuses to get treatment because she thinks meds are how the government listen to our thoughts, has episodes that last years, thinks cigarettes cure all kinds of diseases, and once bought 4 Caddilacs and said she was gonna start her own dealership hahaha.I have, fortunately, worked for years for my own recovery even though my depression is still pretty bad. But I've had my own insane political thoughts, religious ideas, and delusions of grandeur. I think I'm an alien princess trapped in a human body, Kanye West thinks he's the next messiah.I am a fan of Kanye, I have been for a long time. I knew for a long time that he had symptoms of this illness. I'm aware of the things that are reported about his life. I think he's a really messed up dude, I think he has a lot of issues. I think the people he surrounds himself with are horrible and will probably never give him the help and support he needs. I think the music industry is evil...I think they take advantage of and exploit their artists...I think his label and PR team made him be this egocentric character and his mom's death tipped him off the edge...I think there are things about the industry that we do not want to know.But that's just my opinion. I've thought about all of this a lot. And I know he's acting like a horrible person, he acts like my grandma honestly.

But I like to remember that when you're in a commitment with someone with any illness, you take on their struggles with them (not for them). In sickness and in health. Med reminders and doing bills, I wouldn't consider that being a caregiver. As a couple you are a team, if someone is better at one thing than the other then they pick up that slack. For instance I have the bipolar in my relationship but I pay all the bills and I make all the lists, and my fiance does all the heavy lifting like bringing in groceries and taking out the garbage. My fiance also counts my meds and checks my mood chart every week just to make sure things are okay.

I know some people are very afraid about disclosing that they have a mental illness because you never know when a person might take that information badly. But at the time, I had experienced a couple really bad relationships in the past, and I didn't wanna screw around. I basically had an unofficial policy of complete honesty. If he didn't respond well, then I could protect both of us by not continuing contact. My fiance ended up responding really well, he said it was completely fine. But (and this is important) he also said that if I stopped taking care of myself then it wouldn't work out. I was in the process of getting sober, so this mild pressure to take care of myself made me speed up the process. I had my last drop of alcohol a couple months after that and I never looked back. Boundaries combined with mutual respect and good timing helped a ton.I feel like this is a thing about bipolar that people don't talk enough about. Having such extreme contrasts in energy bring out different aspects of our personality to the point of identity crisis. It helped me to have periods of normalcy to find out who I really am. When I was hypomanic (or manic, induced by drugs) I was extroverted, adventurous, and goal driven. During depressive episodes I was an introverted, paranoid book worm. I had experience with depakote working well enough for me to become stable, but it felt so weird because I didn't feel like myself. Depakote started giving me issues with my PCOS (worsens symptoms) so I got off of it and started lithium. That's when I truly, truly got to know myself and feel comfortable while stable. Keep in mind I started meds at 12 years old, wasn't diagnosed with bipolar until age 21, and started lithium at age 23.

For some people it's way more obvious, especially when they're untreated or in denial. But I feel like having that non bias is important in this kind of situation. Because when something severe does happen you can look at it clearly and be like hey, maybe this person needs to go to the hospital. Or maybe this person needs to take a moment to sit down and talk. Imagine being in a relationship with a person diagnosed with bipolar but they don't actually have the illness, you would be analyzing everything they do to see if it's related to the illness.

So I took that seriously. I have a huge whiteboard in my kitchen that I use not only as a calendar, but I track my period religiously. My fiance also has a habit of counting my meds so he knows if I missed a day, which can also make me more irritable. I let him do this because it also benefits me (obviously). I have tons of pillows and blankets, always have good food in the pantry, supplies for a bubble bath, etc. Self care is always accessible to me. If I need to be comfy, I can be in an instant. My fiance and I don't live together yet, but we communicate a lot by text and phone when we're not together. Having him available at all times helps as well, obviously work is first priority, but he's able to text at work occasionally. And we have a strict routine of talking on the phone at the same time every day. I can always count on him.It gives us both confidence in a bad situation when we are prepared, which helps, too. For example, Thursday night I was driving to his place on the highway. I hit a deer and totaled my car.

Lots of research can back me up on that. If people find they don't have a problem, that's ok. It's just that statistics show that people with mental illness are more likely to become addicted, like huge huge chances. And also, alcohol and drugs cause episodes, and episodes cause wanting to drink and do drugs. So they feed off of each other and it's dangerous.Craziest statistic I ever read, apparently like a percentage in the high 90s of people with schizophrenia are addicted to cigarettes.

But I have no problem with that, I was once given codeine after a surgery and it made me feel too good so I just threw it the fuck out.Come up with a safety plan for yourself. And open up with your therapist  about your past! It will help them help you if they know you better. And it will help you to practice to open up.Some things are okay in moderation. People with mental illness should not use substances including alcohol and I'll beat that dead horse until I die, even though some people in the bipolar subs here may not agree with me. At least not use it if they want to feel better and prevent episodes. BUT everyone is different, and I think it's a good analogy for anything that may trigger you. If it makes it worse in any way, cut it out. If it's harmless and fun, not hurting anybody and not making you too UP or DOWN, then it's fine and you should embrace your individuality.

It also kind of sucked in a way, though, because when doctors and psychiatrists weren't diagnosing me fast enough and treating me wrong, I was seen as arrogant or that I was making things up. But I legitimately had problems and I wanted to know what was wrong with me. Wasn't sure if it was bipolar or if I just had bad anxiety and depression, I hoped to God I didn't have the family curse.

{"eabx0pq": {"text": "Ok I have some insight into shaving your head, I have done it twice. But both times weren't because of hair loss, I have an insane amount of hair so my hairloss doesn't really show, except for a shit ton of breakage around my hair line.First time I did it, I was 16 and I was having dreams about shaving my head. So I went to a party that weekend and just did it. And honestly, it wasn't that bad. Teachers let me wear wigs and hats in class. I got bullied by a few douche bag guys but I feel like it really made me in tune with who I am as a person, because we base our personalities so much around our hair.Second time I did it I was 19, I didn't go right to the scalp but close enough. Same thing. Always liked having short hair, always liked showering with a shaved head. And I loved leaving the house with a wig because I felt more confident, I felt like I was in a disguise so the social anxiety of being \"myself\" was helped by that a little bit.Now for the past 3 years I've had an undercut, so I shave the sides and back of my head regularly. Recently I've been beginning to grow it out because my top hair has been getting thinner, but I've managed to have this hairstyle effectively without people noticing because I have SO MUCH HAIR (seriously I wish it was long enough to donate).Women find shaving your head very taboo because we base our appearance on our hair and we pride ourselves on our hair. Nothing wrong with that! I do it too. But you can also pride yourself on a shaved head. Not to get too deep but it was seriously a very introspective time for me, very philosophical, and I learned a lot about myself. I feel like all women should do it at least once, it was liberating and I know lots of people really don't want to do it because the health reasons can be depressing. But it shouldn't be. Embrace yourself.If you really want to do it, I say just fucking do it. Get a few cheap wigs off Amazon to try out and then invest in a more expensive wig. It's worth it whether you have a syndrome or not, I say. And I'm lucky enough to have done it in the past, so if my hair ever gets bad enough I'd definitely shave my head again without question.I know everyone is different but these are just my thoughts and maybe they'll help!", "link_id": "t3_9zte1b", "time": 1543018487}}

Well that turned into longer than a few days. Everything internally imploded, no one was getting along, several people quit. And the mayor resigned, so there was no mayor for a while. There was also a lot of stuff going on with the new water park, like they raised a massive amount of money for this small little thing outside the aquatic centre fence. Which honestly makes sense to me, because that equipment is expensive. But apparently there was a whole ton of complaining.I don't know what's going on now, but this sort of stuff isn't out of the norm for Esterhazy. The whole town has a very high school mentality. The only good thing I'll say about it is the community based activities with the school, like the band concerts and Christmas concert at the hall every year. The people who own the theatre and cafe inside it are the most amazing people on Earth and I'm not exaggerating. But there's a fair bit of crime and drugs because of the contractors that come in and stay for work. I grew up there and worked at the motor hotel for a few years. I've seen things going on that you wouldn't believe, that shouldn't even be happening in the first place if the town even cared. But they need workers and need money coming from the mine so they will never do anything about it. The mine also has it's special kind of politics and you'll hear a lot of rumours while living there. A lot of them are true, the mine itself kind of freaks me out a bit because there is a lot of confidential stuff going on, for example the size of the underground which everyone will speculate on. I think it's bigger than we can imagine. There is even drama at the fucking grocery stores for fuck sakes lol. Implosion from staff members is apparently Hazy's favourite trend. (Support Fine Foods lol)That being said, if you weed out the bad people, there's a lot of good people there too that care deeply for their families and their friends, turning a lot of the town into a great community. It just takes a lot of will power and a good judge of character to survive in that town as drama free as possible. But it is possible!(Bonus tip: there is a lady at the trade show every year selling Mary Kay. AVOID HER LIKE THE PLAGUE.

That sort of thing. There was nothing do to, the food sucked, there was no private or group therapy. It was basically just a way for doctors to monitor a patient while they were put on meds, or put a person on 24 hour suicide watch. When I was diagnosed I stayed in the unit in my current city, and it was like staying at a resort. It is definitely the reason why I'm alive and stable today.I missed school from staying in that ward but missed at home as well. My principal knew my mom and our family situation so he had a lot of sympathy for me and let me stay in school despite the rules stating I should had been expelled way prior. I tried my hardest but I ended up dropping out the second month into grade 12. I didn't even have my grade 9 math at that point. I went ahead and got my GED, though. I actually got my diploma the same week I was supposed to graduate with my class, so my principal let me be a part of the grad celebrations, just not the ceremony itself. Got to go to the party for free and bring a guest as if I was a graduate. My principal was really fucking cool lol. I guess it was a small town thing.This year I applied to university as a mature student and I got in! So that's cool. Lots of stuff went on this term as well as a death in the family, so I had to withdraw. But I'm going back in January.

An underaged person can drink on private property under the supervision of their parents or other adults, like friend's parents. Regarding drinking in front of other people, it depends who you're with, what the group's values are. For instance my family would never allow someone under age to drink at a family gathering, that's unheard of. But other families might be more loose or laid back about it. If you're at a professional gathering, I definitely wouldn't recommend it. But if it's casual and you're with a lot of other people your own age, it wouldn't be that strange to see a 16 year old having one or two beer.Here in Saskatchewan, teenagers regularly binge drink every weekend until they puke and/or pass out.

Bipolar 2 is considered less \"severe\" than bipolar 1 because the thing that makes bipolar \"bipolar\" is the mania, otherwise it would just be unipolar depression lol. So doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, researchers, etc, are right in saying bipolar 2 is less \"severe\". It's because of the way they see it from an outside perspective. Of course the self perspective is a lot more different and other people experience everything differently, but for science they usually measure it that way. And it's usually because of length of time and statistically how much the disease truly effects the person's day to day life. And also because full blown mania has a higher chance of becoming psychotic, and the psychosis can persist.

I said sure, whatever will stop this fucking Satan flood is fine by me. I'm in Canada and usually we have some benefits for people of low income, I was told the price range of the Mirena and gasped but got the cash ready. Went to pay and it was free! I can't remember how but it was.I went to the hospital to get admitted so they could do the very minor procedure to insert it. I lay down on this table and they get everything ready and start to put it in and honestly, it hurt. No drugs or anything, I have a high pain tolerance though so I could handle it. It started to hurt a bit more the more they put it in, then my gyno told everyone to stop, basically they figured out that it was faulty and also not enough lube was being used so they had to take it out immediately. Well let me tell you, I've never experienced child birth but that was like giving birth to a baby made out of a million razor blades. It fucking HURT. And I felt WAY too much of what was happening inside me.My gyno rushed me out, told me to take ibuprofen, and said to come back next week to put a new one in. One of the nurses said he had to go make some phone calls about the faulty IUD. I'm guessing for legal matters because that was fucked.Anyway, I went back to get a new one inserted and it was fine. Normal procedure and I had bad cramps for about a week but wasn't the worst. I know some people can be in like severe pain afterwards so I was lucky.That was almost exactly 3 years ago. I still have it to this day. I get my period extremely irregularly, but at least it isn't like that scene in Carrie for me every single day anymore. I remember some days I'd be going through like 3 super plus tampons all in one afternoon. And I would regularly wear tampons and pads at the same time.I don't notice it at all and I don't get pain from it but my boyfriend does notice it during sex and sometimes can feel sharp on his head which kills the mood for him. Some doctors will say it's impossible for that to happen but they can go fuck themselves, my current gyno literally showed me my thread and cervix on a giant TV screen one day and I understood why it was sharp to him, because it's so thin and small.Anyway I have all of my other problems with my body and PCOS and menstrual cycle and hormones and whatever. But this was all about my IUD. Everyone has different experiences with it I find. It's helped me quite a bit I think.

Thus treating the person that doesn't feed into their egos like trash (DH, you). If ex-wife is dependent on them financially and they are more than willing to help her, I'd say that's more of a telling sign of your DH's family than her.Really complicated dynamic, but very common with borderlines/narcs.

And since everything is infinite and there is still a lot for us to discover, maybe our memories are a key to understanding alternate realities and timelines. Maybe consciousness is a lot more scientific than we think, maybe the experience of existence itself is a lot more complicated than we think. Maybe instead of thinking outwards, we should be thinking inwards and try to figure out what consciousness exactly is.There are of course alternate realities and timelines but it also makes me think of mental illness. My mom has severe schizophrenia and I suffer from bipolar, myself. Hallucinations and delusions come to mind, where maybe those are alternate realities but experienced in a merged way within our reality? Research has found a lot of mental disorders cause a repetition in DNA.

A lot of celebrities/political speakers have admitted they don't actually believe what they say to the public, they just say it because it keeps their fans around and their PR team tells them too. I highly doubt he is even in charge of his Twitter, I doubt he looks at his own profile more than once a week. This behaviour goes to the extent that a lot of political speakers even pay people to come and protest outside of their events. Think like Milo Yiannopoulos, Steven Crowder, etc. That's just the tip of the iceberg so if you want to learn more about it you are welcome to researching more about celebrities and their handlers, but I don't recommend it because it's a huge paranoia and manic trigger for me.I think the grandiosity has to do with his manic states, as the length of his episodes are similar to my grandmother's (months or years at a time).

{"e4yrlhn": {"text": "Okay actually I can tell you about depakote and lithium. Depakote was great for me and my moods except for the side effects. It made my PCOS symptoms so bad that a doctor finally diagnosed me with PCOS after several years of menstrual and hormonal hell. Depakote should not be prescribed to women patients, it raises androgen levels among other things. This causes the hair loss, anger, irregular periods, etc etc. If it works, it works. But with most women there are several studies that show that it should definitely not be prescribed to women. I have a friend with epilepsy that's been on it for a few months and it's also making her joints just horrible and honestly I wish doctors would stop playing around with that shit. Like come on. My pharmacist had to research depakote and went out of her way to tell my doctors it was no good.I stopped taking it last June. So just over a year ago. My psychiatrist weaned me off of it and then put me on lithium a month later. I literally felt a difference within a day, I've taken it every single day since, with little to no side effects.It's a very heavy med. You need to make sure to get your blood checked regularly, at least for the first 6 months. Make sure you drink a lot of water because it will make you feel dry and dehydrated. It can cause weight gain.Other than that, it's not bad and if it ends up working well for you, stick with it. If it doesn't work for you, make sure you tell the doc, try a higher dose. If that doesn't work then unfortunately it probably won't ever work.If it does work it's very worth it though. Give it a chance, the doc might tell you to wait a few weeks but lithium is the type of med that will take effect within a few hours to  a few days. You'll be able to tell. Especially if you've been on different meds before and can really see how they affect you.&amp;#x200B;Edit: I should also mention for you that lithium is designed for mania, but it also does help with depression. I have had ZERO suicidal thoughts while on lithium, and I use to attempt at least every 6 months. Personally I get a little moody and sad, really fatigued and depressed sometimes.

Make sure you shower, and not just wash your hair and face but wash and scrub your whole body. Moisturize with a good lotion afterwards. Eat a good meal and brush your teeth an hour after. Do whatever you gotta do the rest of the day to feel comfortable.The next day, have meals. Cut out the coke. NO MORE CAFFEINE. Wash your bed sheets. Do whatever you gotta do the rest of the day to make yourself comfortable.The next day. Go out for a walk. Attempt to fix sleep schedule by either waking up at 9am even if you have 1 hour of sleep or just not sleeping at all. If you end up not sleeping, get off all social media, distract yourself by binge watching something until you feel so tired you can't stay awake. Then sleep.Sleep for 20 hours if you have to. As long as you wake up around 9am. A nurse once told me if you slept for that long then you must have needed the sleep and may need another long one. So what.Anyway this is what I do when I'm in your shoes. I get like that every time I'm depressed. It sucks but it's so much easier to get out of the funk when everything is clean and orderly.

{"e3wkiqu": {"text": "Let me give you a run down on my drug use. I think you might be able to relate to some.I started when I was 15. Smoking weed, drinking a lot, MDMA, mushrooms, ritalin. I quit smoking weed that year because my school caught me and my parent was very upset. It made me feel really bad so I quit, after a year of smoking every day. After that every time I have smoked weed, it's given me bad trip flash backs and anxiety attacks. A lot of the time I green out.Then I did MDMA for a while. Until I was 19 and I tried cocaine for the first time. That snowballed, pun unintended. When there was no cocaine around I would crush up wellbutrin I was prescribed with at the time. I then moved to the city to live away from home and I started partying lots. When I was 21 I was at my peak of drug addiction, I was drinking every day, doing coke most days out of the week, I started abusing adderall. I was doing MDMA as well, this whole time.That year in April, I had my biggest manic episode. Ever. I barely slept or ate. Beer was calories. I was fighting and arguing with everyone. Then the euphoria came. Delusions of grandeur. I thought I was an alien princess trapped in this human body. A delusion that has never quite left me yet, I know the truth but the feeling lingers. That lasted a while until one night where I drank so heavily I blacked out. And let me tell you that took a lot of alcohol and drugs to accomplish. I'm not tall but I'm a very heavy girl. Not something I should brag about but I am a tank.I woke up in the worst part of the city in an apartment full of 5 different guys. I was the only one in a king size bed. I was fully clothed and in good condition physically. They said they all had to leave and go to work so I had to go. My phone was at 4%. Mass texted my location and where to pick me up. I sat for two hours at a bus stop and a friend finally came. I got home and I went into my medicine cabinet and just took everything. I had just refilled my meds and I was shovelling it down my throat.I slept for two days. Woke up. And immediately went to the ER. They said I should be dead like for sure with that amount of substances and pills. They had no room in the ward so I left on my merry way. The next week I was at the bar again working (I did nightlife photog for a magazine). Went outside for a smoke, saw a cop car and ran and waved it down like a god damn lunatic. I got escorted into the ward where I stayed for two weeks, was diagnosed with bipolar 1, and was told I need to quit all use of drugs and alcohol. I had to go to concurrent disorder meetings, which are kind of like AA but more about mental illness coinciding with addiction and way less churchy. There was a lot of GOOD information at those meetings that helped with the techniques I use to stay sober today. I also quit self harm for good at this time.I lasted one and a half months sober. Then my dad died very unexpectedly so I stopped taking my meds and moved out of the city and into a house in the bush in the middle of nowhere. I isolated myself for like a solid year. I drank alone a lot but had no access do drugs unless I went to the city for the odd weekend. Things started to get increasingly bad again so I moved back to the city with intentions to see a psychiatrist, get back on meds, and get sober.I immediately got back on meds. 6 months later I was switched to lithium to see if it was a good fit. It was. 3 months after that I became completely sober and I've been sober since then.That was October of last year.Life is going splendid now. My scarred arm is now covered with a beautiful wolf piece to celebrate my father. And I'm finally in a non abusive relationship, with someone that's extremely supportive and providing.

{"e3uhite": {"text": "Personally, I have a problem with this and have felt it since I was a child. Depersonalization and dissociation. Dissociation is the big word you wanna Google, here. It can happen with depression and can be a symptom of anything, really. But it's extremely characterized with short term anxiety like attacks, and long term anxiety like recovering from trauma. It's a natural defense mechanism the brain uses so that we are less affected by heavy feelings, thoughts, or even danger itself. The brain's way of shutting down and using less energy, if you will.Since I've dealt with it a long time I've tried a lot of different things to fix it. Different medications, switching doctors, therapists, etc. My discovery is that the best way to deal with this specific symptom is mindfulness. Meditate, practice being fully conscious, force yourself to be aware in a moment.5, 4, 3, 2, 1.5 things you can see. 4 you can hear. 3 you can touch. 2 you can smell. And 1 you can taste (good opportunity for a sip of water).As a whole, mindfulness takes practice and is a long term recovery from the symptom. Unfortunately. But it works and it's worth it. I suffered for a long time, going on forums, asking so many doctors about it. But you TRULY have to dig deep. Find out what the root is. Deal with that. Pratice mindfulness.

{"e13qz9b": {"text": "Negative self talk is extremely connected with the other symptoms that come with bipolar (fatigue, not leaving home, not showering, not eating, insomnia, etc). They also come from your subconscious and might not reflect how you actually feel but what you're scared of, kind of like how a dream can make you learn what your insecurities are. You can challenge these thoughts all you want, but they are not going to go away just because you consciously tell yourself you're pretty and smart. For some people that works and they can condition themselves, but when it comes to depression that happens because of imbalanced chemicals, it's different.Keep training yourself with good self talk, obviously, because it still helps. But if you really want to \"beat\" the bad self talk, just give yourself a break. Why do you think being ugly, broken, or dumb is a bad thing? Why does it have to be a bad thing? Why can't it be a neutral thing? Everyone is a \"mistake\" or \"lazy\" sometimes. All of these things you tell yourself you are, I do not see as a bad thing, I think it just makes you human.You don't have to love yourself. At least you don't have to love yourself 100% of the time. The emotions that come along with negative self talk are extremely intense, but you just gotta ride them out until you find a better way to fight it, or better medication.My therapist tells me that when I'm depressed I need to clean things in percentages of 5. So if I'm unclean, my apartment is crazy messy, all of my work is unorganized, my life is in shambles and I think I'm pathetic, ugly, disgusting, and useless. 5% of work. Relax, get some much needed sleep, and SHOWER for sure. And drink lots of water, as well. But other than that just sit there and distract yourself with dumb internet until the episode goes away. 5% of cleaning. Or 5% of answering emails. Or 5% of calling family. Whatever seems easier to you at the time. It helps, trust me.All of these adjectives you describe yourself with are just opinions anyway. So are things like \"pretty, smart, useful, talented, amazing\". Just opinions, there is no set AWESOME or HORRIBLE. Everyone is definitely human, though. Everything else is what you, your subconscious, or other people DECIDE to see you as. At the end of the day it doesn't matter if you're talented, smart, or broken because everyone will be the same amount of feet below the ground. But it DOES matter if you're healthy and fulfilling your needs and dreams, and you can't do that if you're unwell and telling yourself you're boring and defective. So I hope you are able to find a way to get out of your episode, and come up with a coping strategy for when it happens next time.I know where you're coming from. I don't have much self talk anymore, I used to a LOT, but now when I'm depressed I have very chronic day dreams about horrible things happening to me, like my boyfriend cheating or family members dying. The thought loop is maddening, no matter what the thought is. It's really intense, not fun, and I'd rather throw myself into a wood chipper.", "link_id": "t3_8sy5wf", "time": 1529670009}}

So these academics may be just very passionate about what they're saying. The thing with a delusion, especially with schizophrenia, is that there is absolutely no proof in what they believe. When it comes to academics, there is a lot of study involved. I can see maybe a similarity in studying philosophy, but if you're studying that you need to be extremely open minded to the fact that it may all be false, or all be true, depending on what you're theorizing.Or on the other hand, bipolar and schizophrenia both have reputations for being an illness where the person is extremely intelligent or creative.

Obviously not the euphoric or top feelings that went with it, but a more paranoid or distressed feeling. I've had psychosis with my depression, I've had masked depression where I've gone through life functioning as if I'm fine. And I've also had depression where I couldn't get out of bed for weeks. Either way, if this is how he thinks and acts all the time, there is no reason to think he definitely isn't suffering from mania.I feel bad for him, and even if he ends up not being diagnosed, I'm still going to talk about it because this is how I act while manic and I don't want people to be judgemental of that.

The sex escapades.My biggest episode was when I was still doing drugs. I was on a bender with alcohol, cocaine, MDMA, and adderall. At this point, I couldn't tell if I was already manic and needed the party to keep me going, or if the party induced the mania. It was probably both, but it's like what came first the chicken or the egg? When I look back, it might have been the mania first. But either way it did not end well.I thought I was a celestial princess, an alien trapped in a human body. I was go go go for a few weeks to be honest. I stole 800 worth of butter (THC) from my friend. I thought the container it was in was a bouncy ball. I gave it back a couple months later because I don't smoke weed, but it caused a lot of drama. I left his place that night with 4 guys and went to their apartment. I do not remember any of this, by the way. So I wake up in these dudes' apartment, in a king size bed, completely clothed. I look out to the living room and they're chillin. I ask them what happened and they said I was acting crazy and I was getting sick so they took care of me. Said I looked like I needed the rest so they let me have the king size bed all to myself. They said they needed to go to work so I had to leave. My phone was at 4% and I sent out a mass text of my location, then my phone died.Friend picked me up finally as I waited at the corner for an hour. I got home and right away took all of my meds which were just refilled the day before. And by all I mean I took everything that was in every bottle in the cupboard, including the advil, ibuprofen, and allergy pills. I fell asleep for 3 days, my roommate said I got up to puke at one point. When I woke up fully I went to the ER and told them what I did, and they said with the amount of alcohol, drugs, and then pills that were in my system, it's a complete miracle that I'm alive, let alone standing in front of them bringing myself there. I should have had extreme internal damage but I guess I was fine.I wasn't even admitted at that point. I was at the bar the weekend after, and started to have an anxiety attack outside. A police car was driving past so I ran up to it like a crazy person LOL, told them I was having an anxiety attack and wanted to kill myself.

Same with weed, you may not become \"physically addicted\" but an addiction is entirely possible and effects a person in a similar manner.

{"dwaysbl": {"text": "I have a real horror story. In my province in Canada, we had the Weyburn Mental Hospital. I wrote about it here: [Weyburn Mental Hospital](https://chelseadbleau.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/weyburn-mental-hospital-experiments/)Long story short, opened up in 1921. They used a lot of methods that would seem like torture to us today. LSD was a very popular treatment with everyone, including alcoholics. Insulin overdose. Lobotomies. It closed down in 2006 and was demolished in 2009.Since that hospital was deinstitutionalized, a lot of the doctors and their practices spread out throughout the province, so my mother had a lot of bad experiences in specific hospitals (A LOT of ECT). There's probably a lot I don't know about her treatment because her schizophrenia was so bad, she can barely follow a conversation now without trailing off about people that don't exist. Plus some of it was before I was born, she even got ECT while she was pregnant with me.I have bipolar and when I was a teenager I was very unstable, from ages 12 to 19 I was on 10 different antidepressants, 2 different antipsychotics, 2 different sleeping pills, 2 different mood stabilizers, and different combinations and doses of all of them. I was always changing meds, always told they weren't working. Clearly they weren't because I have bipolar and PCOS which highly affects my hormones, which I'm currently getting sorted out, so it's not just psychological anymore.The psych unit closest to my home town wasn't even a unit, it was a jail. It was a small building and everyone of all ages was combined in the unit. So you had 13 year olds that were there for a 30 day detox (lots of at risk kids, lots of poverty and indigenous reservations in the area). All the way up to 80 year olds with dementia. 40 year olds with schizophrenia, screaming all night. Made it hard to sleep. 20 year olds with drug and emotional problems. And me, I was in and out of there all the time because I used to attempt a lot.The food sucked. There was nothing to do. No therapists. Just a TV and board games. No phones allowed. Phone calls were made on pay phones and only 1 per day allowed. The whole unit was basically keeping a person locked up so they won't harm anyone. I was at risk for harming myself so I was on 24 watch the whole time I was there, I wasn't even able to go pee alone.Once I turned 18, my psychiatrist started taking me more seriously and started educating me on several things, said I might have bipolar but the symptoms just aren't adding up. Then he all of a sudden left and moved back to South Africa after treating me my whole life, without telling me.I've had really awesome treatment since then. The only bad experience I can think of was when my ex boyfriend got up and moved 10 hours away while I was sleeping so I was screwed over with my lease, the lease I was going to be getting, my job, etc etc. I had a mental breakdown so my parent took me to the hospital in that same city as the ward. The new psychiatrist there came after we waited for 4 hours. He kept insisting to speak with me privately but I said I wanted my parent there with me. He started yelling at us and forced my parent to leave the room so I ran out and had an anxiety attack in the hallway where I was blood curdling screaming for like 10 minutes. My parent took me home and consoled me and gave me every kind of comfort food she could think of. She made me safe, thank god.

Maybe when you're finished, or even as soon as possible, you could go to the doctor to see if you could get an actual diagnosis. Hypomania can be euphoric for some people, but most of the time it can be a mixture of things, including rage or irritability. Marijuana has psychoactive effects and can make a person feel pretty bad if it doesn't agree with them, but schizophrenia is on a whole other level.Imagine a scale, or in this case, a line. The line is called \"psychosis\". Psychosis isn't just being \"crazy\", it's actually just a degree in dopamine being released in our brains. So on the lowest level of the psychosis scale, there would be childhood imagination. Then I would say marijuana is somewhere in between that and dreaming. And then the state between sleep and dreaming, for example sleep paralysis. Then in the middle of the scale is sleep deprivation, and then right beside that is bipolar.

I have the opposite problem as you, I have too many voices as my internal dialogue. My advice is to go sober from here on out, it's a rocky path but it will help with your mental health. Drinking or even smoking weed will make it worse, trust me. This isn't a problem that medication can fix. You need to go to talk therapy. As well as that neurologist to see if there is any brain damage. If they don't find anything wrong, don't be scared - things like that always fix themselves with time.

It's beautiful and the staff there are amazing. It's really hard to get in though, I got in through police escorting me into the ER. I stayed for two weeks. They had a huge room with huge windows overlooking the river and downtown. There was a piano against one of the windows and they let me play piano every night for an hour, and put me on the schedule board incase anyone wanted to relax and listen...That was the best treatment I've ever gotten and was actually the way I got diagnosed with bipolar.

I can't believe one of the other myths would be 'no empathy'...That's just not the kind of person I am...I definitely feel for other people. I cry at everything. I have empathy. I FEEL. I feel a little too much, more than others I think.Edit: I would describe BPD as constantly having emotions on full volume. That is empathy, period.", "link_id": "t3_6jsise", "time": 1498586178}}

I'm not a doctor I'm just extremely interested in psychology. I think if there was more understanding to it, trans people might become more safe and instead of some trans people insisting on treating only the transition they would be willing to help their additional issues as well.

During the week I would have a couple shots when I woke up and then have some drinks with supper and possibly go out to party, depends if anyone wanted to deal with me. I was incredibly manic and annoying.This 'concurrent disorders' meetings were like AA/NA but without the religious stuff. It was more educational. It taught us that mental illness and addiction are extremely hand in hand and every week we would focus on different mental illnesses, and focus more on the ones that the people in the group had. There were a lot of people there with bipolar, but at the end of the day, an mental illness episode is a mental illness episode and using alcohol and/or drugs plays a huge role in having them.I have also found that when I drink too much, it will make me especially depressed because of my medication, so when I do get home from having a couple drinks now and I get into a bad mood, I know why and it's easier to deal with because of knowing.All in all, I don't think there's any problem with having a social drink and many people are able to be functional and normal while doing so, but for us it's a little bit more on the difficult side and we have to be careful. Especially when mixing with medication.
