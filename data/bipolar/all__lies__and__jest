But as you get to know them, they may talk with you about patterns they see that resemble the patterns of certain disorders.

Of course, some need medication and for that you\u2019ll see a psychiatrist too.3. There are some kind of \u201cuniversal\u201d red flags, I guess \u2014 things like being sexual with you in some way, or overreaching the typical boundaries of therapy in some way \u2014 talking mostly about themselves, telling you irrelevant information about friends or family, breaks confidentiality in some way. There are minor things I look for too \u2014 answering phones/texting in session, trying to convince me of things that don\u2019t make sense for me (generally kind of unrelated to my personality or therapy stuff), not feeling like I was heard or understood, they don\u2019t seem to be listening to me. But ultimately, it\u2019s kind of like a first date \u2014 you have to decide if it\u2019s a good fit. Do they mesh well with your personality and make you feel comfortable. Do you feel like you can trust them someday. 4. Be you! Whatever you need to talk about is game. Now therapist might sort of direct the conversation sometimes to figuring out a plan for the issue at hand. I write in a journal several times a week, noting feelings, thoughts, issues that pop up and take it with me to help me focus in on topics. If you want to make a list, do that. If you want to go in and see what pops up (I do that sometimes), do that. And sometimes you just won\u2019t know what to say. And that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s ok not to know the answer to a question \u2014 they\u2019ll help you try to figure it out \u2014 and it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t know what to talk about. Be you.

Everyone\u2019s chemistry is different.As far as my mixed episodes I have too much pent up anxiety and anger. I\u2019m quick tempered and easy to frustrate. I don\u2019t want to do anything but lay on the couch but I have too much...wiggly-ness to not move. It takes me forever to get up but when I do I move like lightening. I flit from task to task never finishing anything because everything reminds me of something else I need to do (that may be the ADHD). My thoughts fly around and I can\u2019t pin anything down but when I do it\u2019s all darkness and pain. I self-injure, I get suicidal, I have massive crying spells.

{"fju7zfk": {"text": "You wanted a story? Here\u2019s a story. TL;DR - smoked weed through half of college and all of grad school. Quit when I moved home after getting my Master\u2019s. Cold turkey. Weed did me no favors and my depression peaked. Suicide attempts and all. Traded that method of running away from life for another one and I still numb things and have no emotions.I started smoking weed in college. Just occasionally. Once every month or so. Then I started hanging out with some friends who knew a dealer. This meant I could buy it myself and so I started smoking in my dorm room, I went to class high as a kite, and I went to therapy high. I went to everything high. I\u2019m sure I missed out on some fun times because I would rather sit in my room and smoke. I was missing a lot of stuff - information for my classes, I was too high to really join in conversations. My filters were down so I said stuff I probably shouldn\u2019t have.Then I went to grad school (in New Orleans) and I had been instructed by my gp to see a psychiatrist because I took an antidepressant and went manic. So I was diagnosed with BP2. Wasn\u2019t smoking at this time because I didn\u2019t know anybody to get it from. So I took my meds properly and things were improving. Then I was introduced to a guy who could get me what I wanted.So I went back to smoking ALLLLLL the time. Went to work high, went to class high, taught classes high...then I was introduced to coke and molly eventually. So I\u2019m smoking weed and shooting up coke and molly. I tried to kill myself with coke so I was encouraged to quit that - I did. cold turkey. I\u2019m still high all the time...I was frequently too high to enjoy the Mardi Gras parades. Or Halloween on Frenchmen street. I was just kind of an empty rock. No feelings, no personality, no ability to join parties or going out with friends...I was totally flat. I eventually got really really depressed and attempted suicide several times (in part because I was high and not making good decisions). I finished grad school and moved home for a bit and eventually ran out of weed and didn\u2019t know anyone. Figured then would be as good a time as any. So again, cold turkey. I was depressed, felt like I lost a friend. I haven\u2019t smoked since. I married someone who would be in a lot of trouble if they found weed on his drug test so he doesn\u2019t want it in the house. I just traded one addiction for another and now I take opiates.I used weed to self medicate. I have serious insomnia that no drugs can fix. But weed could.
