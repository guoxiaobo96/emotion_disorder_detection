The risk is knowing that you have these feelings And letting them be, even if you are unsure why you have them in the first place.You don\u2019t have to leave someone because you can\u2019t figure it out, love is ineffable like that. You can stay and maybe still just like someone rather than love, it doesn\u2019t have to be intense for you to like the person and wanna be with them.

{"fon4wrl": {"text": "Okay, so this is super biased because I am a leftist.The hate for me comes from knowing that the assets rich people have could be distributed to entire communities who are in need.And sure, they might\u2019ve worked for it. But in my opinion, when you have that much money to the point that a billion dollars is nothing to you, I\u2019d expect a lot more direct action.Charities can only help so much, and some, if not most, of the money doesn\u2019t even go directly to the people. When I say direct action, it\u2019s beyond charity, it\u2019s about creating an equitable world where no one is hungry or homeless by doing things that directly affect the public. Charity can be a passive way of helping, but honestly if charities had already worked, there wouldn\u2019t be as many poor people. (It might not work exactly that way, that\u2019s just my opinion) To me, seeing a rich person donate to charity feels like they are doing the bare minimum when there\u2019s work to be done on the ground, if that makes any sense. You can\u2019t just throw money at every problem, because if that were the case then all of our problems would be solved with just one billionaire. And yet, those billionaires choose not to. This confuses me, and makes me angry, because I tend to think people are inherently good. Not saying billionaires are inherently bad, I just have high expectations for people who are living in the lap of luxury.I just don\u2019t really get how these people sleep at night knowing that they could help in more direct ways, and then they don\u2019t. To me, it shows apathy, or too much comfort with the way things are to the point that nobody really wants to change it. The way things are is that there are poor people, hungry people, and disenfranchised people out there, why wouldn\u2019t you want to change that directly if you have the facilities? Because that money is YOURS? What makes money YOURS, and why the compulsion to keep it to yourself just because you earned it, don\u2019t you want everyone to succeed too? Why not? Those are questions I would ask rich people.Not sure if that made any sense, in conclusion, I think that if you can give, you should give as much as you possibly can in a way that has practical and noticeable change. That\u2019s more important to me than any charity. Finally, if you\u2019ve made it this far, thanks for listening. My last point is that many rich people are born into their wealth, our system is only by merit on the surface. The reality, in my opinion, is is that nepotism runs rampant, that people are willing to stay at the top at the expense of others. Someone has to be down in order for their to be a top, which I personally think is really unfair.", "link_id": "t3_g8f7p6", "time": 1587912304}}

{"fn7wdvh": {"text": "This is for self reference as well, I\u2019ve been slacking on my DBT skills. In general: look up DBT SKILLS online, its a branch of knowledge that gives you literal and specific steps you can take to ease mental suffering, great for ADHD and reprogramming automatic thoughts like \u201ceveryone hates me\u201d.Here are my fave tips though, most straight from a DBT work group.1. Writing down positive affirmations, the repetition helps block out the brain chatter, keeps your hands busy, and these are easily customizable for any situation.2. Willing vs. Willful, this is one of my favorite DBT skills I learned. Willing is willing to think positive, willful is stewing in the negativity. At the risk of looking a little kooky, argue with that voice! Analyze when you are just stewing to stew, and get curious about that stubborn voice.3. Positive association, one of my favorite coping skills is using smell. Find a smell you like, store it somewhere easily accessible and sometimes if your feeling down, just having a comforting smell can Ground you. Grounding is super important, and it doesn\u2019t have to be just smell, use ALL your senses.4. CHECK THE FACTS. This one is a biggie, this one has really helped me with seeking outward validation. In DBT, there is Emotion mind and Wise mind, Wise mind knows what\u2019s up. Wise mind is that internal emotional logic; everyone has it. Your Wise mind is what will guide you through checking the facts. Questions to ask your self sequentially when checking facts: What is making me upset? How do I view this situation, positive or negative? What did I think happened? What literally happened? Does my reaction match the situation (oftentimes, not really)? What are my action steps? How will I feel once I complete them? Example: I hate myself, I forgot to take the trash out and now my mom hates me. This is negative. I view this as negative. I thought I saw my mom give me a nasty look. But, she is coming back from work and is tired, which could explain her mood and the face she made, which seems more neutral looking back on it. Do I need to hate myself for this, a small thing I\u2019ve done? Doesn\u2019t seem to match the situation. Action steps: set a reminder for trash, talk to mom in the morning.YOU give yourself these answers, YOU can trust yourself, and YOU KNOW you deserve better, it\u2019s just a matter of convincing yourself you do.5. Create a community. Here is a good start! Start opening up to friends, lay it ALL out (with permission of course, I always like to start the convo by saying \u201cCan I vent/Can I get personal for a second/Please talk to me, I\u2019m honestly having a bad day\u201d) even mention how sometimes RSD makes compliments feel fake (oof, I know that feeling HEAVY). Sometimes people really just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening, and when we isolate it makes things harder to explain. The more you can process everything outwardly, the more it will literally get out of your head.", "link_id": "t3_g01ivh", "time": 1586728975}}
{"fn3pwww": {"text": "Always ask questions, it shows you care to get to know someone.If you\u2019re stuck, a funny anecdote or a cool link tosomething could spice up convos.When I\u2019m texting, I try to make up some games to play over text like Two Truths and a Lie or something, just an idea! Also don\u2019t underestimate segues, this might be weird but pay attention to the flow of the convos. Getting shorter responses-&gt; change subject, getting longer responses-&gt; follow up questions and active listening (repeat what they write in your own words and maybe add another personal fact with that). The intention here is to keep momentum.Don\u2019t be afraid to double, triple, quadruple text! I find that speaking in person usually tends to be a lot lengthier than we realize, and you never know, that random detail you add in can actually be something you have in common or something that spikes the other persons interest. Also, the more you can push your voice through in your texting, the better the person can \u201chear\u201d you! Add an \u201cum\u201d or a \u201clike\u201d or use emojis if you\u2019re into that, just establish how you really sound if you want people to stay engaged. Texting is just writing, so pretend it\u2019s kinda like an assignment for class with the goal being to read actively and take mental notes of what is going on. The more present you seem and feel, the better.Also keep in mind confidence, I know that\u2019s such a clich\u00e9 but you definitely have space to fake it till you make it through text. My theater teacher used to explain that people don\u2019t come to watch plays to bring you down, audiences tend to be rooting for you. Try to apply this to dating, if you already got a match, no need to worry, they are interested already! So don\u2019t waste your time convincing, spend your time revealing who you are.Don\u2019t over or undersell yourself, digital identity is the new age and crafting one is important.Lastly, do whatever the hell you want as long as it\u2019s respectful. People get caught up in being a type of person through text, and then get spotted with red handed when that doesn\u2019t translate in real life.Weird someone out, or maybe say something out of line and apologize, but don\u2019t be afraid or put up a front and texting will get easier from there.Hope this helps in any way!", "link_id": "t3_fz5aaa", "time": 1586625614}}

Procrastination that felt impossible. Switching tasks and never getting anything actually done. A big factor was RSD, rejection sensitive dysphoria. People with ADHD face failure and rejection in a different and debilitating way due to compound trauma. It stops them from even trying anything anymore because it literally hurts to even consider trying. That really stuck with me.In terms of diagnosis, my first psych suggested I get medicated for the bipolar first and then look for testing resources. Once I was stable enough and checked with my insurance for a psychiatrist, I asked for a neuropsychological eval (which tests for many learning disabilities). I was taken to an ADHD therapist for an initial intake, then they referred me to a specialist who performed multiple tests. I waited 2-3 months for the results to come in.Then I was told to try adderall but to be careful, as some ADHD meds are stimulants and can make bipolar worse, but thankfully that didn\u2019t happen!Now I\u2019m on adderall and back in school! :) Sorry for babbling!", "link_id": "t3_f3ea5c", "time": 1581628499}}

{"fb1li2w": {"text": "So you\u2019ve got the first step down which is taking stock of your life and recollecting, as well as looking at symptoms.Print out or make a checklist of the symptoms so you\u2019ll be ready when professionals ask you why you\u2019re seeking the diagnosis.When I was seeking a diagnosis, my first thing I really had to do was check my insurance. The one I had previously wouldn\u2019t cover what I needed: therapist, psychiatrist and a primary care doctor that didn\u2019t believe ADHD was some silly excuse (I\u2019ve read some horror stories on here like you wouldn\u2019t believe, so make sure all your professionals are on the same page).So, check with your insurance, get on psychology today (or sometimes insurance companies will mail you a list of applicable professionals) and check for ADHD specific therapists and psychiatrists. I would even suggest these professionals have MORE than one speciality, as ADHD can be comorbid with other things that if they are treated, you ADHD treatment will benefit.Once you have everyone on deck, ask the psychiatrist for a neuropsychological evaluation or ADHD-related testing.It\u2019s gonna take a while for all of this to come together so be prepared (when I was looking for my diagnosis I left school to get better, do what you can go make yourself comfortable in this process).When I got my neuropsych, I first had to talk to a ADHD specialized therapist who then referred me to the testing place, separate from their office. I went there, took the test, and had to wait 2-3 months for results.  Then I showed my psychiatrist who finally got me medicated.Good luck.", "link_id": "t3_eb2r6o", "time": 1576438213}}
