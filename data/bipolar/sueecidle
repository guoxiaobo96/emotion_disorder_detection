Gonna be a long read.**2013-2015: High School**This was where the bulk of my self-harm occured. I had a few close friends who knew about me being moody and suicidal (I wasn\u2019t officially diagnosed or anything. Really thought it was just teenage angst lol). I started cutting a lot during this time and I knew my friends noticed. I would wear cardigans to school on a daily basis. Even had a collection of black ones because they only allowed those. On days where I forget, I try my best to hide them by moving my arms awkwardly and keeping them in awkward positions. They would say \u201chey, it\u2019s okay. We know.\u201d And that comforted me.I also started dating during this phase. One of the dudes I dated, was disgusting. He saw my scars and told me straight in the face, \u201cstop it or I will not be your friend anymore, let alone date you\u201d I cut him off ever since. Tried to reconnect with me but those attempts never lasted.Another dude I dated, was open about it. He asked me to talk about my ?depression and SH scars. Rather sweet. He was battling an addiction at the time too.Had a boyfriend soon after. Quite a stable relationship. I managed to open up about my ?depression (once again, not diagnosed at the time) and my self-harm scars. He asked if he could take a look. I was confused, but the look of concern on his face made me trust him enough to look at them. I rolled up my sleeves and he was silent, then teared up a little bit. He expressed his concerns, and promised to take care of me. Sadly, the relationship ended about 2 years later for various reasons.Parents saw my scars at this point. Told em it was the cat. Mom said, \u201cit looks like something a drug addict would do\u201d. I\u2019m glad she doesn\u2019t really have knowledge on SH so I was able to lie.. in her face.. that it was the cat. Dad didn\u2019t ask much.**2016-2018: College**?Depression and panic attacks got worse. Cut more on arms and thighs. Wasn\u2019t wearing shorts much at the time so that helped, but wore them during physical exercise classes we had. Noticed a classmate look at them, but he didn\u2019t say anything.Had a couple of good friends who noticed the SH scars and asked about them politely. Lied that it was because of the cat and they didn\u2019t buy it, of course. They were quite calm about it (also we were in a health-related course so we see lots of things). Fortunately, didn\u2019t meet much unpleasant people during these years.**2018-current: University**Got my first diagnosis (lol sounds like an award): MDD, GAD. My SH turned from cutting to scratch wounds (I thought they were better and less addicting, turns out I was wrong). I tend to scratch at easy-to-reach places eg. Hands and wrists, which didn\u2019t really help as they were visible. I started smoking at this point, and I deliberately burned myself with the cigarette butts as well.My friends were quick to notice, and questioned me about it. Most of them knew of my condition but treated me as the person I am, not as the diagnosis. (Something we learnt in psych too). We had a rather long discussion, heartfelt and insightful.

{"fs1hn4u": {"text": "Hey. I\u2019ve only been taking it for close to 4 weeks (7.5mg for one week then upped to 15mg - current dose). Definitely able to feel more than when I was on SSRIs aka Fluoxetine, which means I often feel down in the dumps more than ever. I didn\u2019t like the zombie feeling because I know I wanted to wallow in my hopelessness and cry, but I couldn\u2019t. The emotional blunting was real. Mirtazapine, however, didn\u2019t give me that. I feel like it gave me the liberty of feeling sad. Not much improvement on mood part yeah haha. But eh, my sleep\u2019s been a little better while I\u2019m on it. I used to take hours to fall asleep but now, just minutes. It took the anxiety off of me before sleeping. My appetite\u2019s been ok, better than before but not at baseline. I\u2019ve lost about 6-7kg before I was put on Mirt, now I\u2019ve gained about 4. Not too sure if I\u2019m happy about it but at least I\u2019m eating something.How\u2019s your experience with it? What\u2019s your current dose?", "link_id": "t3_grm5f7", "time": 1590628420}}

I had one in one of my Nursing classes, just ethics. We talked about legalising euthanasia and the like, but didn\u2019t come to a conclusion as it is still an ongoing debate.
