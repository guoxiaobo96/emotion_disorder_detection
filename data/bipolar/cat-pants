Likely, you can defer admissions for a year. This is a good reason to, and since it\u2019s health-related, it may even be admissible as an excuse for colleges that don\u2019t readily allow deferrals.If the college in question won\u2019t let you defer admission, you can ask about reapplying with the same GPA and SAT/ACT scores, and just be honest about why. Admissions should be up front with you about your chances of being readmitted with the same transcripts. Colleges want their students to be successful\u2014both for the student\u2019s wellbeing and to bolster their own stats (college and student both lose out if a student drops out).Either way, if you feel this is right for you, this break could set you up for greater achievement at the institution as long as you work on what you need to in that time.

I also love **Madness**, by Marya Hornbacher, which chronicles the author\u2019s intimate struggles with bipolar disorder. **The Perks of Being a Wallflower**, by Stephen Chbosky, is a very easy, enjoyable YA read that I think everyone should try at least once, and kind of delves into the difficulties of everyday life as a teen, a person, and an introvert.As far as action is concerned, you can\u2019t go wrong with **The Bourne Identity**, by Robert Ludlum. It\u2019s a very intense action novel off which the movie is based. If you want something a bit less dense than that, I\u2019d try **The Dinner**, by Herman Koch, or **The Girl on the Train**, by Paula Hawkins.And finally, though it *looks* daunting, it\u2019s absolutely amazingly well-written and full of adventure and intrigue: **The Count of Monte Cristo**, by Alexander Dumas.

The moving issue is that my SO and I are moving from one state to another, from a house to a teeny tiny apartment where almost none of our furniture will fit. We have to buy a bunch of new furniture and pay for movers (my friends are pregnant/have newborns, and we need movers due to the size of the hallways anyways), which is stressful because I\u2019m on disability and my continuing disability review is coming up in a month and I\u2019m freaking out about if they take it away from me without me having gotten better because it\u2019s not like disability makes you too rich :-/. But then I\u2019m almost 90% certain that I\u2019m not bipolar, just dealing with atypical depression plus GAD and my bipolar symptoms came about due to outside factors. I guess I do have cyclical aspects to my ange but I think that can be explained away. All this with no competent doctor or therapist to speak to. I go to a clinic where they try their absolute minimum.Whoa sorry for the ramble-wall.

That\u2019s just not fair and I can completely see why you\u2019d be in so much pain. I don\u2019t know if you came here just to vent or if you want advice. If you want, here are my two cents:Go to your school\u2019s one free therapy session. Maybe you\u2019ll get good advice and then they can talk to you about if they have a sliding scale or a payment program, or if they accept your insurance.See your family doctor. Be honest about what\u2019s going on. They might be able to help, or they could refer you to a psychiatrist.Email your professor to tell him as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Assure him you\u2019re taking steps to help yourself, and then ask if you can have an extension on the project.I really hope you do get help, because these stressful situations really do pass.
