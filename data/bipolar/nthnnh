Their whole journey up to the proposal was wonderful and so true to who they are as people, all my thoughts and feelings have been extensively covered already in this thread! 2. I also forgot to actually say yes when my fianc\u00e9 proposed so loved that moment, it all felt very real. 3. Did anyone else pick up that Stevie looked very childlike in a lot of the scenes like the way she was sitting and stuff? I think it showed how she sees Johnny as a father figure. She also smiled when Roland looked over at he programme which was cute, gave the impression she was proud of it. 4. Do we think Twyla's prediction is foreshadowing anything? If so what? Are they getting their money back? Or is it more emotional prosperity? 5. I still just don't think Alexis should go with Ted... I don't have anything more coherent to add really. It just feels like she's giving up her life and plans for a man after she's come so far becoming an actual person. ", "link_id": "t3_b8ryxe", "time": 1554315513}}
