I was stuck in that job because I felt like leaving it meant I'd be a failure at life. Eventually, things got so bad that the job ended up leaving me while on medical leave for my bipolar. It turned out to be another long, hard, but different struggle where I bounced around to 5 jobs in two years before finding a place that fits my mental needs. I honestly think that forcing oneself to struggle at a high stress job is probably not the best decision we can make. I went from a high stress leadership position I'd been at 10 years to now working as a shipping agent for a small online retailer where I work solo and don't have to talk to anyone. It's been such a blessing to find a place I feel I belong where people don't bother me and I can listen to my audiobooks while I work. My productivity is so excellent that I get praised all the time and feel good about going to work every day. The plus side is that I am getting paid MORE than I was at the job I felt I could never leave because I feared losing pay. Sometimes you just gotta take care of yourself and make tough decisions that work for you. Maybe for you it's staying at your current job and working through the stress by starting yoga, or maybe it's finding another position elsewhere with a change in role and responsibility. For me, my high stress job left me with a lot of anxiety and stress issues related to PTSD. Yeah, my job literally gave me PTSD and every time I've taken an office job, I have had to quit a few days in because of a total mental breakdown where I end up in the hospital. Take care of yourself. You're more important than a job because you can always find something better.", "link_id": "t3_fdf80r", "time": 1583346289}}

My concern is that on the surface, it sounds like your husband has reached a point where he's not capable of managing the frustrations that having a bipolar spouse can cause. He's blaming you because its easier to do that then accept that he might not be the most supportive. Dating/being married to a person like us is extremely difficult and has lots of ups and downs and its easy to get worn down, especially after 8 weeks of an episode. It seems to me like he recognizes that making a large, life-altering decision while you're in this kind of state is probably not the best idea and it makes sense to wait until it passes to see how you both feel. I think that before either of you continue on and make any decisions, you need to contact your doctor and explain everything. Everything. Not just how you feel, but how it's affecting your life and the life of your partner. Ask for a medication adjustment, ask for new meds, ask for a referral to a therapist that covers couple's counseling for people like us (my insurance covers it, yours might too). And although it's hard financially, it is very important that you guys try to find the money for him to start seeing a therapist or counselor as well... it really helps to have someone to talk to when trying to help a bipolar spouse.", "link_id": "t3_edkrp5", "time": 1576901264}}

Just because this creditor is calling and harassing you, doesn't mean that the world is going to end if you stop communicating with him. Have you tried talking to the hospital to work out payment arrangements or a reduced (hardship) bill? I would start there first and maybe even tell them that you'd rather work directly with them instead of some third party. As for how this guy has your medical history, I'm real curious to know that too. He shouldn't get anything other than the top level basics of your financial obligation. If the hospital shared your personal medical history, then they are at fault and need to face repercussions. I also want to share that I've been thousands and thousands of dollars in debt because of my medical issues, including involuntarily being taken to the ER in an ambulance then held for suicide watch. Yeah, it's hard to think about this debt hanging over you, but I found that it doesn't really cause as big of an impact to my life as I expected it to. Digging out of it takes time, years in most cases, but it isn't a life stopper. If you're worried about working with this guy who holds your debt now, then just don't. Whether you stop communicating or try to work with him, in the end its the same thing. I spent YEARS not answering debt collection calls (even for medical ones that never go away) and when I was ready to pay them off in one lump sum (I saved up on my end until I was ready), I contacted them and made arrangements to do so. Not once did one of them tell me no because I hadn't been responding to their calls or letters. And in most cases, I paid WAY LESS than what the original bill was for. Yeah, I sacrificed some credit scores (I've lived in the high 500s for years) but I don't plan to buy a house anytime soon. I even found that A LOT of companies will still extend credit, sell you vehicles, and let you rent an apartment with shit credit. There's a light at the end of the tunnel and you're going to be okay.

It sounds like other people close to your friend are enabling her behavior and making her situation worse. I think what you did was reasonable and out of concern for her well being. If she wants to blame you for her mental illness then so be it, but you do not have to continue putting up with the tirade of being blamed. It sounds to me like your friend is in desperate need of medical help. I have bipolar disorder and before I got help, I was also a nightmare to be around, especially when people tried to step in and force help on me.

{"dsxrzyu": {"text": "I have been struggling with this as well for the last few weeks. I thought it was me. I kept telling myself that I just needed to do it and stick with it because that's what \"normal\" people do right? Well, for me, it didn't work out like that and boy was I wrong about the situation. I ended up being let go from my previously held 10-year job after a bout with depression and anxiety that had me wanting to commit suicide daily. I spent a year out of working, getting better, and landed a job at the end of last year that I was looking forward to starting. Before starting, for several months, I was generally in a better place than I had been without any major depression or suicidal issues. Then, I started working again and after starting on my first day, I was hit with a wall of depression and anxiety that consumed my thoughts. All I thought about while being at work was ways to kill myself and how much of a failure I was to myself and my family. It was very, very frustrating. I couldn't figure out why I suddenly felt this way since I had felt completely okay prior to starting. The place wasn't terrible (but they were below average), the job was pretty basic and unchallenging (an easy ride for my experience level), and the people mostly left me alone which I prefer. I felt like it must be me, something was wrong with me but I didn't know what. After two and a half weeks of feeling unable to leave this job (because it wasn't their fault and I felt obligated to stay and work because they'd hired me), I was falling deeper and more dangerously into suicidal thoughts. I eventually started making plans to end my life. It was extremely hard to do but yesterday, I got up, emailed my resignation, left my employee badge, packed up my things, and walked out the door. I then drove straight to the emergency room for voluntary admittance for suicidal idealization. After spending the day in the mental health ward of the ER, I began to feel much better. It was like someone flipped a light switch and life suddenly felt more livable. I talked with a doctor and social worker about the situation and they suggested that because of what happened at my previous job and why I left, my problems with my new job could be because I was suffering from PTSD which was triggered by the environment I put myself back into. Being home for a year was a safe place, but being back in a call center, where a lot of my problems originally came from, put me back to where I'd been trapped before and my brain couldn't handle it so it reverted back to depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. The suggestion I got, besides going to therapy for the issue, was to seek employment in a different type of environment. I never would have thought that I had suffered trauma from the last place I worked, but looking back now, I can see that it could be true. Today, I'm looking for jobs in a new environment and applying for them. I'd rather try a hundred new jobs out to find the right fit than make myself stay at a job that's making me hate myself. Maybe a different job is going to help you more? Keep at the job you have now (if you need to), but keep applying for different once to see if you find a better fit. I don't think we should suffer at a job, the business doesn't care about you more than obligated to and they'll be able to replace you without much suffering.

When we tried to negotiate, we were treated as though we were too poor to live there. Money is not the problem, the issue I had was that the increase did not mirror the market rate increase for the area we were in. They charged us insane prices for cleaning and repairs when we moved out and refused to provide the detailed quotes from their service companies when we asked to see why it was so expensive. They pretty much remodeled that unit on our dime. We did not trash the apartment, it was what should have been considered normal wear and tear. We had several maintenance issues that were not addressed within the specified time frames. We had a neighbor on a Microsoft account housing contract who they refused to talk to about unneighborly situations, including nearly burning down the building at one point and smoking pot on their balcony. They refused to address the speeding issues through the complex, my kids were nearly hit twice while walking to their bus stop in the morning. We found dead, decaying rats in the hot tub and pool filter on multiple occasions. The garbage compactor constantly overfilled, trash got spread around the area, and it stank to high heaven in the summer. There's also not adequate parking if you ever want to have guests over. The maintenance man who is at my current place worked for them during the time we lived there and shared some horror stories about being told to 'nickle and dime' tenants when moving out. Our kids made friends with several families while we lived there and they also shared similar stories of crazy increases in rent at renewals, and having to pay exorbitant move out costs for repairs and replacing carpet that was in excellent condition. One friend was charged for breaking a window that was not broken when they moved out, but were shown photos of it being cracked several weeks after they asked for the proof. Overall, there are MUCH BETTER places to live, especially for the high costs in this area. We moved a half mile down the road and paid less than when we originally moved in with more space and privacy. Shop around. Even renting a house in the area would likely be a better experience.
