He\u2019s on his third marriage. He\u2019s getting divorced at the moment because of a bible verse about speaking in tongues, women being subservient to men and money. Same reason he divorced his other wives without that bible verse. He calls everyone fat, says my sister has a lard ass (even though she\u2019s the GC) though he\u2019s overweight himself.When he doesn\u2019t get enough attention, he has chest pains - aka heartburn - where we spend days at the hospital while they figure out what\u2019s wrong with him. The last time, I ended up being the one there because his wife kicked him out, and my sister was busy. The whole time he abused the nurses because the doctors only gave him morphine. He doesn\u2019t take morphine and he wanted HIS drugs. He keeps his pain pills in his pocket and he was popping them like mad. He also complained about everything else: church, where he lives, everyone was fat, I owed him money from 15 years ago, my daughter never speaks to him and so on. After 8 hours, I had enough. I left him there and have had very, very, very, very low contact with him. This was 5 months ago.  With the help of my therapist and EMDR, I\u2019ve processed some of the abuse from my childhood. I feel no guilt. And now I control contact. At first when he would call, I\u2019d have a panic attack.

She tried to steal drugs from my grandma\u2019s hospice nurse that were to be destroyed when my grandma died. And blamed it on my sister, who wasn\u2019t even there. And told everyone about it at the funeral.When I left my abusive ex, she told everyone it was because I cheated and had an STD. i didn\u2019t to either of those.She deliberately parks her car out so far out I can\u2019t get by in the drive and have to go knock on their door to move their car. Which takes 10 minutes or more to do because she can\u2019t \u201cfind\u201d her keys.A couple years ago, her dog came into my yard and killed one of my yorkie. She told everyone that my dog attacked her pit bull. He didn\u2019t. He was on leash and the pit bull came after me too.Her and my uncle had over 200 fighting roosters and moved them so they were right on our property line.  Crowing would start at 5 am and they had 5 acres or more to put the roosters on. They refused to move them even though my dad had cancer and chemo and needed his rest. She deliberately took a bunch of grans furniture (after she died) simply because my mom wanted it. She sat it in her yard and destroyed it.The stupidest gossip gets spread by her so much, that the people at the gas station stop me to ask what happened.

{"dms4y0y": {"text": "Not OP,  I have some recommendations based on your list!-take a day trip to a place you've never been. Get in the car and just drive, stop along the way at anything you see that's interesting. You can do this kinda cheap with a tank of gas and packing lunch/drinks. Or if you'd rather research and plan a trip do that instead. Most towns/cities have free stuff to do and most of it is really neat to experience. You can even explore your own town/city. Even my Tiny town has a crap ton of things I never knew about like an art center, museum and comedy/singing nights. -Flirt instead. At the grocery store, after class, wherever. See a cute guy, walk up to him and flirt a little. Be open to meeting new people in weird places. I met my college BFF in the bathroom after complimenting her earrings.-While you're day tripping or experiencing new things document with your cell phone camera. You can also sometimes find good cameras cheap at a pawn shop. Doesn't have to be fancy, a point and click is fine. Just document your experiences!-Volunteer at a shelter. Go take puppers on walks, help with foster events. Socialize the cats. Most shelters would love to have volunteers.Life is all about the experience, finding out who you are. You're 18 you have a lot of exploring to do. No one does it the same way and a lot of us fall into it and are older and still have no idea who the hell we are.You asked about overcoming fear. My experience may be completely different than others and I required therapy to help, but it boils down to just doing it.  Figuring out why you're scared and determining what's true and false about what you're scared about and just do it.Exploring - find things at college you're interested in. Join clubs, go to yoga or a karate lesson. Try painting, writing poems.  Learn to cook/bake. There are tons of stuff you can try. A lot of it depends on where you live.I'm 38 and my husband pointed out that he doesn't know what I like to do. He said he knows I like tv shows about lawyers and medical dramas and that I like to read and that's it. So I've started trying new things and getting out of my comfort zone. I was terrified of guns and live in the land of the rednecks, so I embraced that. Learned to shoot, bought a pistol and got my concealed carry permit. Now when I need to relax I go shoot targets. I'm terrified of flying, so I'm taking flying lessons. I learned to cook. The main thing is to keep and open mind and don't say no to opportunities. ", "link_id": "t3_6z2lst", "time": 1504981856}}

She taught me coping skills for anxiety and helped me, along with medication to deal with my depression. She moved out of state and I didn't find another therapist I liked.This past year I was diagnosed with high functioning depressive bipolar (type 2) and my psychiatrist recommended therapy. There is no one local and with my schedule I can't take the time to drive as far as needed to see someone face to face. I was randomly looking at my insurance and found that they cover online therapy. I signed up, gave my location and insurance. I read profiles of everyone and picked someone who seemed to be a fit for me.I got lucky that I hit it off with my pick on the very first visit. And I don't even have to leave the house for it, just laptop and hide out in the bedroom for 55 mins.With her help, I've been able to identify my triggers and modify my behavior. I've learned mindfulness, even though that's something I'm still working on. Last week I had surgery and woke up \"blind\" because of crap they put in my eyes, and using the techniques she taught me, I talked myself out of a panic attack in about three minutes. I'm a bit agoraphobic and with her help, leaving the house no longer makes me nauseous, nor takes hours for me to work up the courage to leave. She taught me how to work through the reasons I didn't want to leave, and no I able to hop up at any moment and just go without having to have three days advance notice that I need to pick up toilet paper.

{"djw9xlp": {"text": "There are days that getting out of bed is the worst thing in the world. It will sometimes take me hours to put one foot on the floor and thirty more minutes before the other foot follows. And it's not because I want to sleep or I'm being lazy. It's because the thought of getting up, interacting with people and pretending to be fine is too much for my brain to handle. It makes my depression worse, which kicks in my anxiety, which makes me want to stay in bed even more.My psychiatrist has diagnosed me as highly functional depressive bipolar with generalized anxiety disorder. That doesn't mean I'm crazy, it just means I'm depressed all of the time and have been for more than five years. It also means that I am able to fake the shit out of it and unless you are really close to me, you'd never know. It also means I'm very successful at my \"job.\"And my mind never stops - I worry and stress over everything. I have plans in my head to handle the stupidest shit, then I have back up plans and backup plans of my backup plans. Like I'm planning to make guacamole for dinner (if I can get out of bed), but I have no avocados. Which means someone has to go to the grocery store to pick them up. I make a plan for that, who goes to the store, what happens if there's a car accident, what if the car breaks down, what if they are out of avocados? What else could I make instead? Who is going to pick that up, which car should be used for the trip? What music should be playing? Is the spare tire okay if the car breaks down? Can I handle going to the store and risking a panic attack if I have to switch my meal plan? My mind never stops and I don't sleep more than 4 hours a night because of it, even with medication. And like I said, it's stupid shit that keeps me awake. I also have lists and systems to control every aspect of life to reduce the anxiety, but I get anxious if I can't remember if I've noted every possible contingency plan. I drive my assistant crazy with being anal retentive about notating everything because my medications make me forget stuff, then I get anxious that I'm driving my PA crazy with my crazy and what if I'm forgetting something. It's a vicious cycle and it's hard to break.

I kept going back, not saying a word until one day I was comfortable enough with the silence that words just started flowing. The first apt I talked was word vomit, everything came out. I cried. I talked. I cried some more and my therapist just let me lead. After that day, we found our flow and it helped so much. She taught me how to let out my emotions and most important see that I wasn't to blame. I eventually started believing her and I feel like it changed my life. But I only went when I was ready. Having someone I didn't know to confide in was the best thing. And like you, I had a SO who was there for me, but I could never say half the shit to him that I did in therapy.I felt... Dirty. Disgusting and like the whole situation was my fault. I felt like I wanted to be treated so horribly and abused, I deserved it because I wasn't good enough. It was shame I felt. Shame that I let someone control me, hurt me, rape me. Eventually I came to realize that it was not my fault. It was his. I'll admit, all these years later, I have moments of doubt and that shame creeps back in. But I look around me, see the way my life is now and shake it off. But it takes time.

Social media wasn't a thing back then, but I had to keep a log of everything I did - who I spoke to, about what, what I ate and when. My outfits, hair and makeup had to be approved. Every part of my life was controlled. If I was ever alone I had to stay with his mom or sister (he liked to take weekend guys out trips.) Took me until I was 21 to get out. Every time I tried to leave he'd threaten to commit suicide or my dad would send me back because he didn't believe in divorce, even when I came home black and blue from the beatings I took.This fucked my shit up. I ended up in therapy three times a week. It was intensive and hard and the best thing I ever did.

Keep in mind that he's been a Baptist preacher for almost thirty years, I spent most of my life in church and when I was old enough to make my own decisions, I opted to be agnostic and stay away from church. The talk with my dad touched on a lot of points and the one take away I took from it is that he has Faith. He truly, 100% believes that every piece of the bible, from the resurrection to Jonah and the Whale, is absolutely true. (Though he's a big fan of shellfish and says that's okay because it's in the Old Testament - still wrapping my head around that one.)For him, the bible doesn't teach morals by using stories, those stories are facts. They happened. God is real because he believes and has faith that he is real. No matter what question I threw at him, he did not waiver in his belief that everything in the bible is real. To him it's history and a code to live by. I learned a lot about him that day.I always knew he was very liberal and extremely smart, like genius smart.  He believes in a woman's right to choose, doesn't give a crap who marries who, believes in live and let live, and be a good person throughout life but before that day I never knew what he believed. It was an enlightening conversation. And since then I've had questions, weird questions about the bible, and if he doesn't know the answer he says, \"I don't know. I've never thought about it from that perspective. Let me read and study and I'll get back to you.\" And a few days later he will give me an answer after studying and forming an opinion.I'm still wrapping my head around how the man that raised me, is one of the smartest people I know, who is die-hard liberal, believes everything in the bible is fact.

It wasn't easy getting back to us and developing a new relationship with each other. And sure, we've had a couple of doozie fights since then, but we figured our crap out and are happier for it now.And as a bonus - My spawn is 12 now and we haven't fucked her up yet.

It took an hour or so rocking her before she would even fall asleep, and we'd have to practically beat her back and sing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star over and over without stopping for breath to get her to sleep (that lasted until she was about 11 months). It was the ONLY way she'd sleep for 2 hours straight. One night the magic mat died and we didn't sleep at all. We stocked up with several others when we finally found more of them so that wouldn't happen again.She was a terrible sleeper. I co-slept with her for the first few months since SO worked nights and I was home. She also had raging colic and ulcers and had to eat every 2 hours with rice cereal and zantac in every bottle so it was easier until my c-section healed completely. If we were 1 minute late for a feeding, she'd scream for hours.She didn't start sleeping through the night until she was over 1 but sometime before age 2 (lack of sleep makes that time fuzzy). She figured out how to climb out of her crib (over the rails - the first time she gave me a heart attack when she woke me up at 5am saying \"Hi momma\") and from then after we converted to a toddler bed until she was freaking SEVEN, she slept in bed with me and SO. Then one day we were going to bed and she finally said, \"Oh, BTW I'm going to my room to sleep. Goodnight.\" And I'll be damned if I didn't miss her kicking the crap out of me for months after that. She's 12 now. She still doesn't sleep well and is a total night owl. She homeschools for right now so she can still get around 8 hours a night if she sleeps when she just passes out sometime between 1 and 3 am.

My kiddo is 12 and her dad and I often have times when we disagree on how to raise her. To give you a recent example, she decided she wants her septum pierced. I have nothing against having piercings -- heck, I've had a few through the years -- but I do not want her to have a body piercing until she's older. Her dad would take her tomorrow to have it done and sign permission forms. Early in our relationship, he would have taken her and I would have been pissed. Now though, after close to 14 years together, we compromised after talking it out. She also mentioned having gauges put in her ears and we're letting her do that first, to see how she takes care of them and tolerates it. After that we'll reassess. And that example is a small one. There's so much more with parenting that you have to decide on and compromise WILL be required.  Reading between the lines of what you've said -- you mentioned you're not sure if you want kids. What I'm hearing is that you're not sure if you want to have kids with him. And I think you're latching onto your cat and being okay with having his child as a form of giving yourself a justification. Crying, second-guessing and PANIC are all perfectly normal reactions to finding out you're pregnant. Second guessing your relationship when you find out you're pregnant, in my opinion, is not.

Went back to an SSRI and nope.Doctor wanted me to try Brintrellix and it was way too expensive even with insurance (over $300/bottle), so now I'm on a mix of Cymbalta, tradazone, and xanax.Cymbalta I'm still on the low dose and it's working GREAT. The first week I was dizzy and nauseous but it evened out. Before I couldn't cope. I didn't want to get out of bed. I would take me being awake and talking myself into getting out of bed one step at a time for hours. I'd often make it to the bedroom door before I noped out and went back to bed and start the process again.Forget taking a shower, that would take me days to decide to do. And if I was forced to leave the house I was miserable and everyone knew it.I also work from home and some days it was so bad I'd drag out the laptop and my ipad and work from bed because I had shit to do and could not physically make myself get up. If I tried, I'd go into full on panic attacks and start puking after.About 3 1/2 weeks into the Cymbalta I did a complete turn around. I'd wake up, get up, do my work and I realized one day I was happy. My mood stabilized and even my family was like wow you're not so grumpy now. They were amazed when they saw me smile for the first time in a long time.My only issue with it was no matter the time of day I took it, I wouldn't sleep. More than an hour or two all night. Talked to the dr about that earlier this week and she added tradazone. I have weird med reactions so waiting until Friday night to try it, but I'm hoping it helps. If not, dr wants me to try seroquel.I still get panic attacks from time to time, so I have Xanax in case I need it, which I haven't had to use more than a handful of times.As a bonus I had an issue with stress incontenience (thanks loin spawn) and the Cymbalta has helped with that as well.

{"cvfzbgp": {"text": "Oh I like reading all of this, it's so very interesting to see what different women go through with pregnancy and delivery. Here's what happened to me:Morning sickness - all day, every day for the entire time I was pregnant. I couldn't keep down saltine crackers and ended up in the hospital 13 or 14 times for dehydration, with lovely IV's each time, always with an infusion of Potassium that burned like hell and made me whine. It was so bad that my doctor suggested I find someone with weed and smoke before I got out of bed. I didn't but that was mostly because I didn't know where to get weed. Doctor eventually had me take a vitamin b6 and a unisom around 6am every morning, then eat a cracker and drink gingerale before I got out of bed. It helped somewhat. Food cravings - nope. I had an aversion to ALL food. Though when I did eat (after the unisom/B6 kicked in), I really, really, really wanted my grandma's homemade meatloaf and FRESH green beans. My gran made me meatloaf a few times per week and my mom strung fresh green beans and made them for me everyday. Mom made the meatloaf once and I knew it immediately and couldn't eat it. Those women spoiled me rotten with what food I could eat when I was pregnant. Swelling - my feet swelled a bit during the last couple week of pregnancy. But I had preeclampsia and ended up having to be reduced at 37 1/2 weeks Sex - Nope. I was VERY high libido before getting pregnant and my sex drive nose dived after getting pregnant. We tried a few times and the nausea was just too much too handle. I remember one time my SO was like - I feel like I'm beating the baby, I can't do this! I was about 8 months along at that point and we both laughed and snuggled instead. Nesting - Kinda. I wanted the fridge cleaned out and the baby's room ready a few weeks before, but I was honestly so tired all the time I couldn't deal with it. Mom and gran came to my rescue and had me sit in a chair in whatever room they were in and tell them what to do, so the house was sparkling before I went to the hospital. Water breaking - I was induced, so dr. poked with something that looked like a very long crochet hook, I felt a warm splash and that was it. Hosptial - for me I knew I was being induced and the dr. sent me to the hospital the night before. When my mom had me, she had two contractions very close together and made it to the hospital 45 mins away in 30 minutes and had me 10 mins after arriving. So if my dad hadn't have drove like a manaic, I might have been born in the backseat of the car. Pain - I didn't scream. But boy-o, those contractions HURT. and with every single contraction I would puke and pee. It was horrible. And hour into them dr. decided to give me demerol and nubain oncer per hour and it did nothing to help with the pain or puking. I think I grabbed my SO by the collar and told him I hated his guts for doing this to me. My sister was in the room with us and I was apparently very angry and they couldn't speak - but they eventually worked out a system of watching the monitor and knowing when a contraction was going to hit. They had wash clothes on the a/c which I insisted had to be blasting (since I felt like I was burning alive) and one would throw a cool cloth on my forehead and the other on my lower back when I had a contraction. That helped. About 5 hours in, I finally dialted to 5 and the doctor let me have an eipdural. I was HAPPY after the epidural and apparently proposed to the anesthesiologist when he was done.After the doctor's office closed for the day, he came back to check on me (8 hours of labor at that poin) I ended up having to have an emergency c-section, so I have NO idea how the actual pushing out the mini-human feels and I'm personally glad of that. Though I still have issues with my c-section scar since I have a hernia that the dr. won't remove yet. I can't sneeze standing up or I end up in the floor from the pain still. The things they don't tell you about - the nipple pain, cracking, bleeding and leaky milk after the baby arrives. My nipples HURT and I didn't breast feed. Lanolin helped some but until my milk dried up, I hated my nipples. The hemorrhoids will just about drive you insane with the itching and burning and for me I still have issues with them now - almost 12 years later. My doctor insisted on a few enemas before he induced me. Those were not fun.For me the lack of sleep during pregnancy drove me crazy. I couldn't get comfortable and when I did the baby would kick and wake me up. I spent the whole 9 months a sleep deprived, puking mess. Pregnancy did not agree with my body at all. And then after the kiddo popped out, I still didn't sleep more than 2 hours at a time for about 2 and 1/2 years. Sleep depravation will turn a normally happy smiling person into a snarly, grouchy mess of a person who just wants to sleep damn it!I had decided to have a tubal early on in my pregnancy and I can remember during the c-section the doctor asking me (while I was high on morphine and vallum - I had a panic attack during the c-section) if I still wanted one. I remember yelling: \"Fuck yes. Tie them, clip them, burn them, remove it all. I'm never doing this again!\" And I don't regret that decision at all. ", "link_id": "t3_3mjk71", "time": 1443376976}}

Stepdad had been married before for like 15 years and was screwed over horribly by his ex. So both always said, and I do mean always, that they would never get married.They lived together for ten years. Then mom got hurt and had to have a major surgery. It was a worker comp claim and the dr professed her cured and sent her back to work. She was stressed and in more pain than before the surgery and her regular dr and therapist wanted her out of work. So she quit and went on short term disability.In doing so she lost her health insurance and would be placed on cobra, which she could not afford, especially with her massive copays for a couple of meds she has to take to live. I was helping her apply for marketplace coverage and my stepdad said \"Let's just get married, I'll put you on my insurance.\" A month later, we'd planned out a nice small church wedding for them.The day they got married my sister and I were in the back of the church with mom, waiting for the preacher and all of a sudden I hear, \"Where's my wife? Do I need to come back there and get her? I'm waiting to get married here.\" While we were having dinner afterward, stepdad and I got to talking. He told me that he loved my mom and could not imagine life without her. And that it was finally time for them to make it legal.When I asked mom why she said yes she said, \"Sissy, I love the man, I was already his wife and I needed the insurance.\"So for them, that was the right time.", "link_id": "t3_37u90l", "time": 1433045497}}
