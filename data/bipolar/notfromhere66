{"f242yvs": {"text": " 1. They help us breathe. 2. They're more than just trees.  Insects and worms work nutrients into soil, bees and birds spread pollen and seeds, and keystone species like wolves and big cats keep hungry herbivores in check. [Biodiversity is a big deal](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/blogs/why-biodiversity-big-deal), both for ecosystems and human economies, yet it's increasingly threatened around the world by deforestation.3.  People live there, too. Some 300 million people live in forests worldwide, including an estimated 60 million indigenous people whose survival depends almost entirely on native woodlands. Many millions more live along or near forest fringes, but even just a scattering of urban trees can raise property values and reduce crime, among other benefits. 4. They keep us cool. By growing a canopy to hog sunlight, trees also create vital [oases of shade](https://www.mnn.com/your-home/organic-farming-gardening/photos/cool-ways-cast-shade-garden/made-shade) on the ground. Urban trees help buildings stay cool, reducing the need for electric fans or air conditioners, while large forests can tackle daunting tasks like curbing a city's \"heat island\" effect or regulating regional temperatures. 5. They keep Earth cool. Trees also have another way to beat the heat: absorb CO2 that fuels global warming. Plants always need some CO2 for photosynthesis, but Earth's air is now so thick with extra emissions that [forests fight global warming](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/blogs/forest-restoration-slow-down-climate-change) just by breathing. CO2 is stored in wood, leaves and soil, often for centuries. 6. They make it rain. Large forests can influence regional weather patterns and even create their own microclimates. The Amazon rainforest, for example, generates atmospheric conditions that not only [promote regular rainfall](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/climate-weathe there and in nearby farmland, but potentially as far away as the Great Plains of North America. 7. They fight flooding. Tree roots are key allies in heavy rain, especially for low-lying areas like river plains. They help the ground absorb more of a flash flood, reducing soil loss and property damage by slowing the flow. 8. They pay it forward. On top of flood control, soaking up surface runoff also protects ecosystems downstream. Modern stormwater increasingly carries toxic chemicals, from gasoline and lawn fertilizer to pesticides and pig manure, that accumulate through watersheds and eventually create low-oxygen \"[dead zones](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/translating-uncle-sam/stories/what-is-the-gulf-of-mexico-dead-zone).\"9. They refill aquifers. Forests are like giant sponges, catching runoff rather than letting it roll across the surface, but they can't absorb all of it. Water that gets past their roots trickles down into aquifers, replenishing groundwater supplies that are important for drinking, sanitation and irrigation around the world.10. They block wind. Farming near a forest has lots of benefits, like bats and songbirds that eat insects or owls and foxes that eat rats. But groups of trees can also serve as a windbreak, providing a buffer for wind-sensitive crops. And beyond protecting those plants, less wind also makes it easier for bees to pollinate them.11. They keep dirt in its place. A forest's root network stabilizes huge amounts of soil, bracing the entire ecosystem's foundation against erosion by wind or water. Not only does deforestation disrupt all that, but the ensuing soil erosion can trigger new, life-threatening problems like landslides and dust storms.12. They clean up dirty soil. In addition to holding soil in place, forests may also use phytoremediation to clean out certain pollutants. Trees can either sequester the toxins away or degrade them to be less dangerous. This is a helpful skill, letting trees absorb sewage overflows, roadside spills or contaminated runoff.13. They clean up dirty air.  They can clean up air pollution on a much larger scale, and not just CO2. Trees absorb a wide range of airborne pollutants, including carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. In the U.S. alone, urban trees are estimated to [save 850 lives per year](https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/46102) and $6.8 billion in total health care costs just by removing pollutants from the air.  14. They muffle noise pollution. Sound fades in forests, making trees a popular natural noise barrier. The muffling effect is largely due to rustling leaves \u2014 plus other woodland white noise, like bird songs \u2014 and just a few well-placed trees can cut background sound by 5 to 10 decibels, or about 50% as heard by human ears.15. They feed us. Not only do trees produce fruits, nuts, seeds and sap, but they also enable a cornucopia near the forest floor, from edible mushrooms, berries and beetles to larger game like deer, turkeys, rabbits and fish.  16. They heal us. Forests give us many natural medications, and increasingly inspire synthetic spin-offs. The asthma drug theophylline comes from cacao trees, for one, while a compound in eastern red cedar needles fights drug-resistant bacteria. About 70% of known plants with cancer-fighting properties occur only in rainforests, yet fewer than 1% of tropical rainforest plants have been tested for medicinal effects.  Walking in the woods has [health benefits](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/blogs/how-biophilia-can-improve-your-life), too, including stress relief, reduced blood pressure and a stronger immune system. The latter may be partly due to trees releasing airborne compounds called [phytoncides](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08923970600809439?journalCode=iipi20&amp;), which prompt our bodies to boost the natural killer (NK) cells that attack infections and guard against tumors. 17. They help us make things.Where would humans be without timber and resin? We've long used these renewable resources to make everything from paper and furniture to homes and clothing, but we also have a history of getting carried away, leading to overuse and deforestation. Thanks to the growth of tree farming and sustainable forestry, though, it's becoming easier to find responsibly sourced tree products.18. They create jobs. More than 1.6 billion people rely on forests to some extent for their livelihoods, according to the U.N., and 10 million are directly employed in forest management or conservation.19. They create majesty.Natural beauty may be the most obvious and yet least tangible benefit a forest offers. The abstract blend of shade, greenery, activity and tranquility can yield concrete advantages for people, however, like convincing us to appreciate and preserve old-growth forests for future generations.20. They help us explore and relax. Our innate attraction to forests, part of a phenomenon known as [biophilia](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/blogs/how-biophilia-can-improve-your-life), is still in the relatively early stages of scientific explanation. 21. They're pillars of their communities. Like the famous rug in \"The Big Lebowski,\" forests really tie everything together \u2014 and we often don't appreciate them until they're gone.", "link_id": "t3_dbuo2d", "time": 1569943727}}

She defines the problem as follows: \u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power\u2026over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\u201d She notes that \u201cweak antitrust enforcement has led to a dramatic reduction in competition and innovation in the tech sector\u201d and that these companies don\u2019t have to worry about protecting people\u2019s privacy or policing the lies and incitements to violence that appear so frequently on their sites. What\u2019s more, they tend to \u201cbully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business, and can act, in the words of Mark Zuckerberg, \u2018[more like a government than a traditional company](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/19/facebooks-war-on-free-will).\u2019\u201d In calling for the breakup of these companies, Warren says it would be in keeping with America\u2019s long trust-busting tradition, especially during the previous Gilded Age.\\&gt;She proposes legislation to forbid what she calls massive \u201cplatform utilities\u201d\u2014those with annual global revenue over $25 billion\u2014from owning any participant on their respective platforms. They would also be prohibited from discriminating against users or [sharing or transferring data with third parties](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46618582). Smaller companies would have to meet the same \u201cstandard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users\u201d but would not need to be split apart from the participant assets they own. And to make sure this got done, she would empower federal regulators, state attorneys general, and injured private parties to sue any platform utility found to be in violation. It could also cost them a fine of 5 percent of annual revenue.", "link_id": "t3_bj7er0", "time": 1567529891}}

{"ew6sm2u": {"text": "I agree, you can't blame mental illness on all of this.  Especially since anyone can have a really bad day and loose there minds in just a few  seconds.  Boom now this person has an agenda and acts it out and no one hardly notices because he was normal for so long.  I like the call the police too.  However each state probably had different open carry laws.  Not sure if you call the cops when it is not a violation based on your states open carry policy, that the person calling will not become charged with some other stupid thing the cops and the states policy will enforce. For Example:FloridaFirearms regulations are uniform throughout Florida, and a carry license is valid everywhere other than in a few specially-defined areas. These prohibited places include any police station, prison, courthouse, polling place, government meeting place, airport, seaport, or tavern.[7] Concealed carry is also prohibited in any school, except for authorized security personnel, armed marshals, and, as of 2019, school employees and teachers who have received \"special training\".[8][9]Anyone lawfully carrying a firearm in a concealed manner, may briefly and openly display the firearm to the ordinary sight of another person, unless the firearm is intentionally displayed in an angry or threatening manner, not in necessary self-defense.[10]Currently, Florida's Concealed Weapon License is one of the most widely recognized, state-issued concealed weapon license. The resident Florida Concealed Weapon License is recognized in thirty-five different states, while the non-resident Florida Concealed Weapon License is recognized in thirty states.[11]\"Concealed firearm\" is defined in F.S.S.790.001(2) as \"any firearm, as defined in subsection (6), which is carried on or about a person in such a manner as to conceal the firearm from the ordinary sight of another person.\"[12]Unlicensed concealed carry is allowed during a mandatory evacuation as a result of a state of emergency for up to 48 hours, which may be further extended by the governor.[13]As of 2018, school employees other than classroom teachers may choose to receive special training in order to carry a firearm at school.[14] As of 2019, the program was expanded to include classroom teachers.[15]Open carryOpen carry when on foot in a public area is generally illegal, but is permitted in certain circumstances, as defined by Florida statute 790.25(3). For example, open carry is permitted while hunting, fishing, camping, gun shows, or while target shooting at a gun range, and while going to and from such activities.[16] The open carry ban statute was challenged in court[17] but the ban was upheld.[18]Vehicle carryVehicle carry without a license when the weapon is not immediately accessible/available for use is permitted.Handguns must be either \"securely encased\" -F.S.S.790.25(3)(l) Some cite this as a grey area or risky- or not immediately available for use.[19] \"Securely encased\" means in a glove compartment, whether or not locked; snapped in a holster; in a gun case, whether or not locked; in a zippered gun case; or in a closed box or container which requires a lid or cover to be opened for access.[20] Carry of a Handgun on one's person inside a vehicle without a license is not permitted (except in the case of open carry in accordance with the law outlined above). Once a handgun is securely encased, it can be stored anywhere inside the vehicle and is not limited to just the glove compartment/center console.Long guns may be anywhere in a private conveyance when such firearm is being carried for a lawful use.[21]As of July 1, 2008, Florida became a \"Take your gun to work\" state (F.S. 790.251). This law prohibits most businesses from firing any employee for keeping a legal firearm locked in his or her vehicle in the company parking lot. The purpose of the new law is to allow citizens to exercise their Second Amendment rights during their commutes to and from work. Exceptions listed in F.S. 790.251(7) include school property, correctional institutions, nuclear power plants, national defense facilities, facilities for explosives or combustible materials, or a motor vehicle owned, rented, or leased by a person's employer.A case was filed against Walt Disney World Resort by a former Disney security guard who was fired, despite having a CWL, for having a firearm locked in his car on July 1, in violation of Disney's pre-existing no weapons allowed policy. The case was later dropped by the plaintiff citing personal and financial reasons. Disney claims that they are exempt from the new state law, on the basis of their having a fireworks license for conducting nightly fireworks shows at Disney World.[22][23]Castle doctrine and \"stand your ground\"\"Castle doctrine\" refers to the generally accepted common-law principle that one is not required to retreat when in one's own dwelling. Eliminating the requirement to retreat outside the home (i.e. in public) is generally referred to as a \"stand your ground\" law. As of October 1, 2005, Florida became a \"No Duty to Retreat\" (i.e. Stand Your Ground) state. Florida Castle Doctrine law establishes that law-abiding residents and visitors may legally presume the threat of bodily harm or death from anyone who breaks into a residence or occupied vehicle and may use defensive force, including deadly force, against the intruder.With the passage of Florida's Stand Your Ground law, this principle now also applies in any other place where a person \"has a right to be.\" Essentially, that person has \"no duty to retreat\" if attacked and may \"meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony\". Note that all of the generally accepted common-law principles of self-defense must still be followed.[24]A person who uses force within the parameters of the law is immune from criminal prosecution or civil action and cannot be arrested unless a law enforcement agency determines there is probable cause that the force used was unlawful. If a civil action is brought and the court finds the defendant to be immune under the law, the defendant will be awarded all costs of defense.", "link_id": "t3_cmy7sm", "time": 1565179953}}

If so, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III could be fired directly by the president, and the status of many of the so-called independent agencies could be in doubt.&gt;Kavanaugh also wrote law review articles in 1998 and 2009 that questioned whether a president can be investigated while in office, except by Congress under its impeachment power. In the weeks ahead, Mueller could subpoena Trump and insist he answer questions under oath. If the president refused \u2014 or fired Mueller \u2014 the Supreme Court could be called upon to decide whether the Constitution shields the president from a criminal subpoena or from a special counsel\u2019s investigation.&gt;In 1974, the high court unanimously rejected President Nixon\u2019s claims of executive privilege and ruled he must turn over the Watergate tapes to the special prosecutor.

This, he said, meant the country had to stop the flow of unwanted immigrants, whether they came from Mexico, Canada, or Europe.\u201cIt makes no sense to tell the world you can\u2019t come here unless we invite you and then you have this frumpy old woman standing outside our country and telling people to come and stay as long as you want,\u201d Trump said during a press conference at the Trump Tower in New York City. \u201cDoes this make any sense?\u201dTrump said the words on the Statue of Liberty run contrary to everything his supporters believe \u2014 although, he admitted, he couldn\u2019t remember the words.\u201cWhat does the Statue of Liberty say? I don\u2019t know. To be honest, I\u2019ve lived in New York City my whole life and I\u2019ve never been there,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhy would anyone go? Nobody goes there.\u201dA reporter told him that the Statue of Liberty said, \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d\u201cIs that right? Really? Your tired? Your poor? Your wretched refuse? Homeless? So that\u2019s how they all got here? When Europe sends its people, they\u2019re not sending the best,\u201d Trump said, rolling his eyes. \u201cWho needs those people? It might as well say, `Give us your rapists, your criminals, your drug dealers .... your coddled terrorists.\u2019 \u201cTrump said the country had to secure its borders to prevent all undocumented immigrants from entering the country.\u201cLike Melania?\u201d asked one reporter, who was immediately handcuffed by New York City police officers and removed from the press conference.Questions remain about whether Trump\u2019s wife Melania followed U.S. immigration law when she came to the United States from her native Slovenia.Trump was then asked how he thought Americans would respond if he removed the Statue of Liberty, which has stood in the harbor as a symbol of freedom and hope for millions of immigrants who have come to the United States since the late 1800s.\u201cAmericans will thank me,\u201d Trump said.\u201cThe Statue of Liberty is an ugly statue. It is. She\u2019s an ugly woman, a very ugly woman. Certainly not a ten. She\u2019s got no chest. A flat chested woman can\u2019t be ten \u2014 Why did France send us a statue of a flat-chested woman?\u201dTrump was asked if he would consider having a statue in New York harbor if the statue was better looking.\u201cLike Melania,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cMaybe. Melania. Yes. She\u2019s an immigrant and she\u2019s opposed to other immigrants. So, yes. But if we put up a statue of Melania, and this is something we\u2019re thinking about, we wouldn\u2019t have her holding up a torch. We need something that tells immigrants we don\u2019t want them.\u201d\u201cWhat if the statue raises her middle finger?\u201d a reporter asked.\u201cGreat idea!\u201d Trump said. \u201cA statue of Melania raising her middle finger at Europe! I got to tell you, Americans will love it. Europe won\u2019t. Who cares what Europe thinks? Screw Europe.\u201d\"Follow Christopher Lamb on Twitter: www.twitter.com/16campaignbitesheadshotChristopher LambProfessor of Journalism, Indiana University-Indianapolis", "link_id": "t3_8v4yd0", "time": 1530392960}}

So they could advise there citizens of our lack of compassion and readiness to quote the bible on how babies if accompanied by an illegal should be ripped away from their parents to suffer horrific mental distress.  Anyone stopping to think what this mental distress will do to these children when they are adults?  Are we creating little terrorists by treating them this way.

{"dv4bqcw": {"text": "Hi Good Morning from South Florida,  I plan to start hopefully next Tuesday and go two times per week for 3 weeks 6 treatments total and then boosters if needed.  How do you feel it has helped your depression and feelings of failure if any?  My feeling of failure and ability to use prescriptions to help with my suicide ideation, plus social anxiety due to failure is why I have not been successful with therapy and meds make me worse though the med they have me on now helps my thoughts but the side effects are not worth long term use.  So, I guess what I want to know is did you have any of the same feelings before?  Have the treatments helped those feelings by repairing the brain, what hasn't improved since you feel the need for the booster.  If I am being too intrusive, please forgive me.  It is so expensive, I would hate to spend all this money and then not have at least a 50-60 increase in overall mood improvement and less feeling of failure and ability to cope with negative thoughts and negative environmental factors that I can't control, but hopefully these treatments would help deal and let go of things and not ruminate on negative feelings.  Plus I heard it makes you drowsy on the days you go, I have had chronic  insomnia for years, 2007 does it help beyond the day of the treatment with sleep?  I am afraid that I am expecting too much.  I want to go in with a decent expectation.  Sorry for rambling.  I so appreciate your feedback and anytime is fine since I have a few days before I get started, but of course the more I know the sooner I can feel grounded about what I am doing.  I have a place picked out.  Since your brought up places, the place I am going to made it sound like they are hurting for business since there are 3 in S Florida which to me doesn't seem like a lot, 2 very far up North from where I live and 1 very South from where I live.  I didn't ask on the phone if price was negotiable, if anything they wanted to charge extra if I spread out the payments 2 for $1K and then the other 4 for $1800 instead of all 6 for $2700, is that about what you paid?  You don't have to tell me where you live, I totally get that you don't want to your info on the web.  As far as PM is that through an email or through redditt but a different way of communicating?  Haven't done it before.  Again, thank you and I am so glad it is saving your life, just knowing that I am giving the chance, I already feel the same way as well:)", "link_id": "t3_81j3w3", "time": 1520085499}}

When you have that close density of teenager's going through puberty and people not properly trained with guns it will not end well.  Arming teachers is not the answer.  If you want to put ex military, police who are practicing during off shift then maybe.  They might be able to overcome a large student.
