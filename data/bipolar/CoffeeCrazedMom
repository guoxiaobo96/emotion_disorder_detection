Overthinking why I haven't been as productive - i need to be kind to myself.From my limited knowledge, I can say that CBT is changing how we think about things, and man is that a toxic therapy for me. But DBT, is more about accepting the problem exists and weighing the importance of the objective, the relationship, and self respect.So for the little things, I value my self respect. For my family, I value the relationship. And for my job, I value the objective. When it comes to the problems at your job, you are simply valuing your self respect more and that's okay. DBT also teaches us how to ask for what we need using the 3 examples.So in the future, ask for what you need based on your values, then make a decision based on your values. For me, it just makes it all more sensible and easier to understand how things are happening. You can find free DBT PDFs online with a Google search and there are people out there who are willing to go over the material with you for free.
