Only 10 more pounds until I reach my goal weight!2. Green tea/ coffee. Green tea is like my little date with myself every morning. It's my little ritual and something I look forward to. It's also an appetite suppressant! I used to binge-eat my feelings, to the point that sometimes I'd have to make myself throw up the food from the excessive intake, making my body physically uncomfortable.3. Eating healthy. When I was eating junk food, I felt like trash. Once I started eating a lot healthier, I notice a shift in my mood and energy. I love blueberries! I go through phases of health foods I enjoy. Right now, I'm obsessed with blueberries.4. GOOD friends. I had negative people in my life. Yeah, I've known them for a while, and it broke my heart to let them go, but I needed to for me.5. STAY AWAY FROM TOO MUCH SOCIAL MEDIA! It's stressful af tbh. Distance yourself from that drama and enjoy what's around you. Be present. Yeah, you get a bit of a complex, seeing everyone on their phones, but at least you're not a zombie, glued to your handheld.6. Hobbies. Find activities you enjoy, preferably by yourself. You do not want to rely on others to have a good time imo. Your friends get busy too.7. REMEMBER: IT'S OKAY TO BE SAD!!! When I get down, I try to do \"opposite action.\" Yes, I want to lay in my bed and wallow, but I'll call a friend, go for a run, or simply watch a stand up episode to make myself laugh away the sadness.

One with a short waiting list, is nearly impossible. It took me 3 years to get into 1 of 'em. Due to my episodes, I get kicked out often and cannot afford to find a place right away.Try to sign up for SSI, food stamps, and welfare. If you do get granted SSI, depending on what state (assuming you're in the U.S) you live in, you may or may not be eligible for food stamps. With SSI, you cannot have more than 2k in your account at all times, so it does get difficult to save money.Recycle cans, stay busy, coffee shops have wi-fi and are open at odd hours. If you can find a place to shower every now and then, I would suggest to use that. You'll see who your real friends are quickly, but try not to obsess over that. It will not help your situation.Call relatives n friends n see if you can stay a few nights. Maybe you could alternate. If you are male, because I would not recommend so if you are female, try the couch surfing app, if it still exists.Libraries waste time, and are a good, free, distraction. It's helpful to keep your mind active.If you are in the U.S., try to sign up for an Obsma phone. I don't remember the names of them, but you can get a free phone. This will cover service as well. There are kiosk stands and stores (not big-chain stores, like T-Mobile, or anything). You *can* get them online, but a friend of mine tried and his never showed up. Plus, you'd need a mailing address for them to send it to you.Speaking of mailing addresses, SSI will contact you through mail as well as their office. Shop around for a reliable and cheap post box. I found 1 for only $60 a year. That is *if* you require mail for applying for jobs, SSI, food stamps, welfare, etc.Before pizza stores and gas station close, they tend to dump out their food. Try to ask if you can have it and staff-shop (ask different employees) if 1 says no. Some are sticklers. Food banks give free food and some give free clothing.A nighttime part-time janitorial position might be a hood suggestion. You wont have to interact with others, you get paid for simple cleaning, and have somewhere safe to go at night.Message me or reply if you require any clarification, have any questions, or just need more advice.

I have not told him of my diagnosis, but it is pretty apparent while talking with me. I've showed him some of my writing and he was completely fascinated with it. I tend to write about my disdain for the human race, loneliness (due to being ostracized by society), drug use, and suicide/ suicidality.The guy that likes me, who again, does not know my diagnosis through me, said that he has a lot of hope for me and does want me to be an English teacher. That's what I wanted to be, but I do not think I function well enough to do so. I can barely hold a job or an apartment very long. I do recieve disability checks, however.Anyway, so the guy that likes me is super hopeful that if I can get a job teaching, I could afford meds. He mentioned \"the good kind, that could actually help you.\" I've been on a lot of meds and they've never helped me.Another random point is that I notice that my friends who have just depression and/or anxiety will say things like, \"I have to be high to have this conversation.\" What?

Jesus would cure them, an exorcism would be performed, or whatever. I do wonder that maybe science, corporate greed/ \"Big Pharma\", and the rise in popularity of Athiesm is causing us to stray away from a technique that may actually help.I was raised Catholic, but do not practice it anymore, but I often do believe that I am possessed.Also, when my hallucinations started, which I hadn't told anyone about, I would see the little grudge boy. He'd run down hallways naked, or just yell at me, naked. He was always naked and acting crazy. My ex, who claimed could see spirits and the like, said a boy was following me around. I hadn't told anyone about him. Also, I would draw him. I'd draw him cutting himself, drinking heavily, attempting suicide, etc. Do you know that demos try to harm you? They also want to separate you- which makes sense as to why I've been ostracized by society. All.lf the things I drew that boy doing, I was started doing.So, I rate myself as to how possessed I am, usually. I mean, if you wanna rate how \"schizo\" you are too, that's fine.

{"efxpzfd": {"text": "I've cut for almost half of my life. It's not a pretty addiction, I can tell you that. I've had to get stitches many times, and almost died from it once. I started due to childhood trauma that resurfaced when I was 12 years old, so that worries me about why he has started in the first place. Self-harm is inward, while violent outrages are the outward response. So, just because someone hurts themselves, doesn't mean they're prone to hurting you. I'm sick of getting stared at in public- people look at me like they're afraid of me.Parenting-wise, I'll give you examples of bad and good responses.My mom was awful about me cutting. She wouldn't ever talk about it with me. She'd go into my room while I was at school, and take all of my sharp shit. So, I resorted to stealing sharp shit. When she'd take that too, I found better places to hide it as well. When I went to the hospital for cutting, she picked me up, and didn't say a word to me while i was in the car. She had sent me to a treatment facility as well where they beat the shit out of us. Apparently that was supposed to help me stop, but instead just made me abuse pain killers for 8 years and cocaine for 1 to forget the events.I lived with my friend's mom for a while. She is a wonderful human being. I had started smoking cigarettes to try and replace my cutting addiction. I didn't want to cut in this woman's house. Eventually, without cutting, I started becoming aggressive- I was snapping at my friends. So, i decided to take the day off of work to cut all day. I ruined my uniform. Well, the mom was home- I had no idea. She knocks on my door, seeming concerned. I open it. She hugs me, without caring that blood is getting all over her, and she offers to take me to the bathroom. She cleaned my wounds, and hugs me again while I'm sobbing. She said, \"everyone hurts; some people just show it more than others.\" This woman will always be my hero. I had to go to the mental hospital when I lived with her. Once I got home, I just laid in my bed watching shows, being sad. She knows I love grocery shopping, and invited me. 1. to make sure I'll be safe and 2. to distract meSo, please talk to him about it. Do not shame him. Do not try to guilt him about it because then he'll feel the compulsion to continue. Be kind. Be gentle. Ask questions. Offer solutions. If you see him getting a bit anxious (I would look at my wrist, or rub/pinch it if I wanted to cut) you can openly, but gently ask if he feels he needs to cut. He won't know any other solution, because that's his resort. Try helping him come up with others. Don't *tell* him options, but just go do them. You can try to trick him into it if you want 'cause he's gonna wanna stay home/be in the room he cuts in. You could be like, \"well, I really wanted to try pokemon go today. Did you wanna come with me? I don't know what I'm doing.\" It doesn't have to be pokemon go. Make shit sound like errands, and offer him to come along. The mall, his favorite store, his favorite restaurant, w/e.Or, if he's having impulses, turn in a good show/movie, play a boardgame, whatever. Distraction techniques are helpful because by the time the distraction is done, it worked, you won't feel that way you were feeling.Anyway, I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense. My sleep meds are kicking in. I'm tired and everything seems blurry, so I'm sorry if there are tons of typos. Good luck and message me if you have any questions.My therapist says it isn't about quitting completely, but it's about \"harm reduction.\"", "link_id": "t3_anxmhi", "time": 1549537354}}

It would play so much that I wouldn't play video games or watch shows, because my thought were too entertaining. I couldn't concentrate to do homework, so I figured I just wouldn't show up to class anymore. I only ate once every 5 days because I didn't understand that my body required food. I would just lay in bed, thinking, with my cat. I wouldn't leave my apartment- there was no reason to. After around a month or more of being a hermit, I went to a support group. I made friends my first day! Later, they told me, when I was feeling better, that I showed up there physically shaking.

She ended up having a psychotic break from heroin withdrawals. I drove her to the ER at 6am. I had a few friends and exs addicted to drugs. I called a friend, while drunk in the ER to cry and say I was sick of watching my friends die in front of me. I went home and drank a half of a bottle of vodka.

I played with mine so much that I accidentally broke it. They gave me a new one, but I lost it. They were tiny, so I'd wrap 'em around my finger and fiddle with them since I couldn't jump in groups. I was raised religious but am not too religious now. Though, I like what helps people as long as they're not a dick about it.So, THE DAY I get released from the hospital, I drive to every walmart and target within, like, a 20 mile radius. I didn't find one and then it got too late; the stores closed. I call my parents, ranting about the ring I couldn't find, but that I'm still determined. I went on this long speech. Before I finish, my mom says, \"we can't understand you\" and hangs up on me. I didn't know what she meant, so I go back to my apartment and watch shows plus play with my kitty. I drove to the 24 hour Safeway too and this homeless guy gave me some weed.

{"eehebti": {"text": "My ex fiance was beating me. I am a live in nanny, and he lived with us as well. There's all women here, except for the 9 year old son, so they were hesitant about me bringing in my ex. They liked me, they said, so they accepted him. He started okay, but it got weird fast. Keep in mind I haven't even lived here a month yet. So, things with the son and I are going great! We get homework done fast, we play video games, nerf guns, card games, watch movies, and ride our bikes. Her son and I have the same interests; I'm basically a 9 year old boy lol. He was so excited because I have a ps4, a Nintendo switch, and built two computers. I'm a nerd.Well, my ex is maybe jealous of how I have to spend so much time with the child, so he began waking me up every morning, purposely. This would hinder my ability to play games and take care of her son. He would only allow me to sleep 1 - 4 hours every night. My landlord/roommate/the mom of the boy I watch , told me my ex would just stand around and sway in rooms and stuff after he woke me up. He wouldn't even be doing anything productive! He wasn't allowed to have drugs in the house. That was part of our contract. He was smoking weed IN THE HOUSE! THERE'S A 9 YEAR OLD HERE! My ex would hit me and was getting delusional. We had to drive to his home town for some important paperwork when he began yelling and insulting me in my own car. Then HE took MY phone and called the police on ME. When the police arrived, I showed them photos of my bruises. They made him return my phone and took him to his mom's.I thought that was the end of it. He showed up at the house the next day. Odd. The only day he was gone, was the day I got some sleep. I slept a whole 8 hours! He comes back and eventually starts threatening her son TO HER, saying, he's \"a little shit\" and \"will get what he deserves.\" He's a 9 year old child! My ex is 36! Wtf does that even mean, dude!? I already wanted it to end before all of this because I saw how he'd yell at the boy. That's not someone I'd ever wanna spend my life with. It got to the point where he'd ben so aggressive with everyone in the household that while the mom was at work, her son and I would have to lock ourselves in her room.My ex called the suicide hotline, so the mom feared he would kill her son, then me, then himself. He would walk around with a hammer. I have my cat in my room. He wouldn't allow me in the room, so every time I heard a thud, I thought she was dead. I already said goodbye to her just in case he would kill her.I am covered in bruises, he's putting a child in danger, he has a 7 day notice and already turned in his key, but was hanging around anyway We all decide to call the police. The police show up while her son is at school and were looking, at first, to evaluate if my ex needed to be put in a psych ward. They said no, so I told them I would like to press charges. They arrested him right then and there. This was yesterday. I had some amazing sleep. Also, my cat hasn't played in months, and last night she was playing again. I got a restraining order against him. I'm so glad he's fucking gone! I feel awful for putting my roommates through this, but I had no idea it was this bad because I was too focused on my migraines. The mom thinks he was deliberately making my migraines worse, so I would be more dependent on him. When the professional had to take photos of my bruises, he said it's the worst he's seen. I really didn't think it was this bad.Anyway, he's in jail. I had them serve his restraining order. This shit is done. I'm done. I love my roommates; they took me out to eat yesterday, and the mom even cooked me a huge lunch before. She makes the best Mexican rice I've ever had in my entire life, and she made me a huge batch of it because she knows it's my favorite.That horrible man is gone and I couldn't be more grateful.

So, I can call her if I can't sleep. She talks a lot, so that helps keep my mind focused on reality. I have another friend who has a difficult time sleeping, so he is usually awake. When I'm struggling with delusions I'll say, \"[friend], tell me something real. Anything.\" He'll spout out stuff like, \"I'm petting my cat. He is gray. The couch here is black. It has cat hair all over it...\" etc. He'll tell me short, factual sentences, and later throw in a funny one that makes me laugh to cheer me up. I'll thank him, and he tells me I'm his friend, he cares about me, and he hopes I sleep well.

{"ed7ofpe": {"text": "Heya. I have SSI. I was warned that it is extremely difficult to get, and that usually people get denied and/or one has to get lawyers. I had my psychiatrist help me. I was in an awful psychosis when I started applying, so my papers didn't really make sense. I was talking about people being NPCs and how I don't connect in this planet. Then, I hit a manic episode during the application process and got hospitalized twice - 6 days between one another. So, it was very easy for me.Basically, they're looking for how your mental illness impacts your daily life. Ask your trustworthy psychiatrist (just a professional who knows you and your illness well who has a doctorate and isn't a relative) to help you with your paperwork because I believe there's stuff they should fill out as well. It's good to have them fill the paperwork out too because apparently everyone fucking loves doctors. I've had this psychiatrist for 11 years. She was reading my papers, \"how long is the patient's attention span?\" She pauses, looks up at me, \"5 minutes,\" she says. Haha! Psychosis is awful.Anyway, so, yeah. I rambling, but again, they're just looking for how your illness impacts your daily life. If you are too ill to work, they will take that under consideration. Also, if you have any recent hospitalizations, I would get those records sent to the office as well. Those will also help win them over. When I'd show up to my appointments, I was weird and sleepy. I hadn't slept in 3 or 4 nights when I got there; I also rarely shower. I was a mess. Oh. They had asked if I lost or gained weight recently. Drastic weight change is usually a bad sign, if not done on purpose. I had lost 20 pounds in 3 months because I had forgotten food was necessary. I would only eat once every 5 days because that's when I'd remember since my body was too weak. So, that was my situation and that's what helped me get it.

In this experiment, a little boy was conditioned to fear an animal (supposedly causing lasting effects) due to the loud banging sound the experimenters made while showing him the animal. Due to condition, which is what gay conversion therapy was, I really do believe they conditioned me to like the opposite sex, or at least give it a try. I had only ever been with the same sex, and developed homosexual feelings at only 4 years old. I stuffed them for a long time because I knew my family wouldn't accept it. My family is very openly racist as well as homophobic. I was raised by Catholic Republican  parents, but (it's kind of too late) now they're both democratic atheists. You can still catch their hateful comments now and then, but it's a more subtle. They haven't changed much, lol.Anyway, so I was previously engaged as well to someone of the same sex, but my partner and I were both in high school. Before and after conversion therapy, we were together for a total of 5 years. At this place we were publicly shamed, given [unnecessary and in high volumes of] medication to the point we were zombies (we were all only in our teens, so this may cause permanent issues), I was manipulated by them to believe my high school sweet heart hated me, I was constantly told that I am not gay, and many more horrific events. People at this facility would attempt suicide and/or run away. There's actually someone still missing and their poster is still online. I do blame them for making me pansexual instead of 100% gay.

I'm tired of covering them up. I'm tired of it upsetting my fiance, because now it's hurting him, too.Instead, my friend, Idk if you know this, but sometimes our voices have meanings. I hallucinated my mom's voice, screaming that I'm pathetic. She did do this, so this wasn't random. I told myself that, yes, I'm pathetic, and I *should* cut. Now, if I had broke that apart and found the meaning, it could've gone okay. I find that when I do just chew on the meaning, I'm calmer and don't want to cut.So, what I typically do is try to trace why I heard this, because it must have to do with my inner feelings.\"Why do I think I'm pathetic?\"- I only think that because my mother told me so and am feeling very insecure right now.\"Why do I want to self-harm?\"- I want to cut because I was hurt by a situation today.\"What was that situation?\"-describes in a non-emotional, but factual, way- (no opinionated, negative self-talk here)\"What could I do next time, if this happens again?\"- I can do this process if it goes too far, because I am safe now, or I can...So, this exercise I tend to do with myself.

I moved into a messy person's house who I believe has NPD (narcasstic personality disorder). I have schizoaffective, BPD, and terrible anxiety. He's messy. I can't live in this filth! It's repulsive! I like to be somewhat clean in lifestyle because it keeps me in an orderly fashion in my head. He likes messy 'cause \"[he's] an artist!\" Ugh! So, my mind goes crazy in here and I gave up a while ago on fixing it. At first, I was excited for a project, but he's like a walking tornado. Everywhere he fucking goes, there's a goddamn mess attached to it. There was also a flea infestation IN HIS APARTMENT, FROM HIS BROTHER'S CAT, who moved OUT, STILL THERE. Like, who lets people move into a mess like this? He was just a guy who I met on Craigslist. But, I fell for the mask he wears to cover his NPD and understand that it's just reactionary from his background. I feel rather empathetic for his constant anxiety.Anyway, so we've racked up some lease violations because of my 8 year Vicodin abuse. I had 5 years of using nonstop, but the last 3 years have been on and off. The cops keep being called due to yelling matches. I've been up for days on end, and I'm in horrible detox/anxiety mode. We've been given the \"choice\" of leaving by giving them a 30- day notice, or us getting evicted and getting 60 days. I already have a place lined up. I need him for rent, and I think he's my best friend, but the detox has been confusing.

We both agree that the sex is amazing with one another, so we haven't fooled around with others much, tbh, but the option is there, and we don't feel trapped, which is the main thing. I sleep with both sexes, so it's nice for me because I tend to miss whatever I don't have. We had both agreed on this. One of us didn't just go, \"okay, fine.\" We both don't want to feel as if we own another person by not allowing them choices.Anyway, so what I'm saying is to keep that in mind, if you're not a jealous person. This way, you could do stuff with others, too. I mean, you guys probably won't see one another too often, so it'd be nice to have some fun, right? As long as you have one another in the end.

{"e4g4k2c": {"text": "The school reported me to my mom that I was holding hands with other girls, which is stupid 'cause I hold friends' hands, too. Anyway, so I get home, start doing homework. Whatever. My mom raced toward me. My dad and brother are behind her with their arms folded. My mom tells me that she knows about \"all of [my] little secrets.\" I had no idea what she was talking about, so I said that. Well, she decided to slap me across the face. Meanwhile, my brother and dad seem approving of her actions. Months later, I was sent to gay conversion therapy. Girls ran away, attempted suicide, or both. It was hard to sleep because sometimes I'd just hear girls screaming all night from the staff hurting them. This was in a place not where we're from, so their disciplinary rating was basically \"we can do whatever we want to you and get away with it.\" I was there for two years, simply because I would not \"comply with the program.\" Eventually, I got kicked out because they said they had no reason to keep me after I finished high school and that my focus was not on graduating the program. I was publicly shamed by them for being gay, I was told that my feelings developed for roommates were inappropriate, I was physically and mentally hurt, they convinced me that my fiancee would hate me when I returned, and they kept telling me that I DO like men. If I did develop feelings for other girls there, they would not let me speak to them. They would call it, \"no-contact.\" One gal that had a HUGE crush on me showed me a new Miley Cyrus CD that had just been released. I said that Miley looked really pretty on it, and got into trouble for that.My only suicide attempt, ever was at this hell hole. Every girl I still keep in contact with has developed PTSD from this place. I had constant reoccurring nightmares for 6 years after. If someone said the words \"frustrated\" or \"boundaries\" I would break down crying. I also could not look at fireplaces because I had a fling there with a girl, and she had disappeared one night after I had broke the \"no-contact\" rule with her. She was a cutter, and they led us to believe that she died. I searched for her for 8 years, and gave up. Her online accounts hadn't been active since months before she had gone there, so I blamed myself for her suicide and had to deal with that. We would typically hang out in the family room there, by the fireplace. Eventually, just a year ago, I did find her, and we met up and chatted, cooked some food, and she introduced me to her friends. We dated for a bit. It didn't work out, but I'm so glad to know she's alive. The owner, Jeff, told us she was \"in a better place.\" THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY WHEN SOMEONE DIES! Also, there was a girl that ran away and she's still missing. Her posters are still online.I was out for only a month, when I played tag with my cousin at a BBQ. My uncle got tagged, and ran after me, quick. I decided to get to the backyard. The glass door, which was open all day, had been shut. I ran through the glass and had to get stitches again (the other time was from my suicide attempt at the place). They prescribed me Vicodin and I decided to abuse them to forget about gay conversion therapy. I was addicted for 8 years. I have 3 months clean off 'em.Also, after the gay conversion therapy, I decided to date a man, in order to make my mom happy. He was physically abusive. I would come home with bruises all over, and my mom would say, \"at least it's with a man, now.\"I've had death threats, knives pulled on me, been ridiculed, etc., but that was by strangers. My mom did all of this. I used to be very involved in the gay community and was a very confident person. I'm now extremely anxious, shy, and hate myself for being homosexual.", "link_id": "t3_98e8w4", "time": 1534653193}}

No one knew I was popping Vico except for those who sold it to me. I decided to quit when I moved to the capital for college. I went into a drug-induced psychosis. I missed Vico, and wouldn't shut up about it. I wanted to hurt others and felt as though humans weren't real (NPCs). It got really dark, and I feared I'd hurt someone. I spent most of my time ditching my classes and just staring at my wall, thinking and crying because my thoughts scared/ saddened me. Eventually I dropped out to spare others of my presence. I got hospitalized twice.I felt like Vicodin helped me, so I did illegal favors (non sexual) to get more from strangers. Since moving, I lost my reg hook ups. I started using Norcos and kratom daily, but was very hostile and abnormally sick during the come downs. I'd throw up every time.As for coke, I can see why that shit is addictive as hell. I tried it for a day- my buddy and I doing lines every few hours. I came home and wouldn't stop thinking about it and would talk to anyone who would listen to me about it. After 3 days, I stopped thinking about it but then a friend and I got into a tiff. I drove to his house with a knife in my car to reason with him.

{"dt7m8wu": {"text": "An ex and I had been together for 3 years. We decided to move to the capitol. I had to change my intended college just to move with him. Well, he didn't end up going with me. I lived alone and hit the worst depression of my life. I didn't know anyone in this city.I only ate ramen once every 5 days. Occasionally I'd have an Oreo or 2. It took me 3 months to finish the container. I lost 20 pounds in those 3 months. I had to drop out of college because I lost it. I'd still go to campus, simply to be around others to hear them talk. Sometimes I'd watch stand up comedy, simply to hear myself laugh. I forgot what I had sounded like. My hygiene plummeted. *What's the point? I'm not going to see anyone anyway.* I developed social anxiety which quickly became agoraphobia. I would not leave my apartment, even when I'd run out of ramen.I was so desperate to make friends that I made friends with these homeless meth heads that I met in a mental hospital after a break down from the loneliness. They would smoke meth in my apartment, and I'd let them, just so I wouldn't be alone. I would do (nonsexual) favors for them and they'd pay me in norcos and give me gas money. I don't want to know where it came from. Eventually, when they'd come down, they'd get aggressive. Two of them wanted to kill me. One wanted my apartment and thought it was his. He would show up every two hours, threaten to kill me while banging on my door, and then would eventually leave. I couldn't sleep from the fear and the banging. Due to lack of sleep, I began hallucinating that my apartment was filled with bugs. I was too afraid to leave and get a bug bomb. The police refused to help me with the meth heads. They told me that I got myself into this mess.I decided to commit suicide to escape them. I had the pills and booze set up on my bathroom sink. Right before deciding to ingest this all, I received a call from this gal I barely knew. She was looking for a roommate. She called me right as I was getting ready to die. Odd coincidence. I moved to another place with her. That girl kicked me out once our 6 month lease was over because I drank every day to deal with the trauma of the meth heads. Being severely low income and only getting a one and a half week's notice, I decided to live in my car with my cat. That did not happen, luckily. I eventually moved in with my gay best friend. He, his mom, my cat, and I shared a one bedroom apartment.  I made this friend through a group, where I had met the gal that kicked me out. I was starting to make more friends! One day, at a party, my gay best friend got super fucked up. He asked me \"what realm are we in?\" Later he came by and asked me if we were in the past or the future. The next time he came back, he tried to rape me. With tears in my eyes, I was trying to shove him off of me. He ran away after a while and pulled the fire alarm. The police and fire men showed up. I called my parents crying, which I had been doing often, and they let me come back home, this time.Now that I'm back, I realize why my friends were so adamant about me trying to figure anything out, but move back. My parents are hostile people and I am very nervous around them. Everything I do is wrong. I'm their scape goat. I'm constantly yelled at and am on a contract. I pay them rent. I've showed this contract to others that say it seems as though I'm being set up for failure.The last time I talked to my ex it was through a text in which I wrote, \"I want you to know that I hate you. I really fucking hate you.\" Everyone told me to break up with him. He was an abusive piece of shit, though I stayed because my mom said, after she saw my bruises, \"at least you're with a man this time.\" I just wanted to make her happy.ANOTHER STORY:In high school, I was sent to a gay conversion therapy program where the staff beat us. No one had credentials, not even the man that owned the place. Girls were attempting suicide and running away. One gal never returned. She is still missing after 8 years. I was there for 1.5 years.From this, I now have reoccurring nightmares and flashbacks with a shit load of self-hatred. Before I went, I was practically in love with myself.Edit: I forgot to add how I could've fixed this one. My parents did a \"test\" on me before they sent me, and apparently I failed. I should've just lied, but I was working on being more honest at that time. Now I'm too honest!Edit2: added a sentence to clarify", "link_id": "t3_7sre4o", "time": 1516870571}}

{"dnzd10a": {"text": "An ex and I had been together for 3 years. We decided to move to the capitol. I had to change my intended college *just* to move with *him.* Well, he didn't end up going with me. I lived alone and hit the worst depression of my life. I didn't know anyone in this city.I only ate ramen once every 5 days. Occasionally I'd have an Oreo or 2. It took me 3 months to finish the container. I lost 20 pounds in those 3 months. I had to drop out of college because I lost it. I'd still go to campus, simply to be around others to hear them talk. Sometimes I'd watch comedy, simply to hear myself laugh. I forgot what I had sounded like. My hygiene plummeted. What's the point? I'm not going to see anyone anyway. I developed social anxiety which quickly became agoraphobia. I would not leave my apartment.I was so desperate to make friends that I made friends with these meth heads. They would smoke meth in my apartment, and I'd let them, just so I wouldn't be alone. Eventually, when they'd come down, they'd get aggressive. Two of them wanted to kill me. One wanted my apartment and thought it was his. He would show up every two hours, threaten to kill me while banging on my door, and then would eventually leave. I couldn't sleep from The fear and The banging. Due to lack of sleep, I began hallucinating that my apartment was filled with bugs. I was too afraid to leave and get a bug bomb. The police refused to help me with the meth heads. They told me that I got myself into this mess. I decided to commit suicide to escape them, when I got a call from this gal. She was looking for a roommate. She called me right as I was getting ready to die. I moved to another place with her. That girl kicked me out once our 6 month lease was over because I drank every day to deal with the trauma. I eventually moved with my gay best friend that I made through a group, where I had met the gal that kicked me out. I was starting to make friends. One day, at a party, my gay best friend got super fucked up. He asked me \"what realm are we in?\" Later he came by and asked me if we were in the present or the future. The next time he came back, he tried to rape me. With tears in my eyes, I was trying to shove him off of me. He ran away after a while and pulled the fire alarm. The police and fire men showed up. I called my parents crying, which I had been doing often, and they let me come back home.The last time I text my ex, I said, \"I want you to know that I hate you. I really fucking hate you.\" At least I'm back home now.Edit: wording", "link_id": "t3_74ltk6", "time": 1507272731}}

The worst job I had was at a gas station. I've asked gas station employees at other locations, and they've agreed with me how awful the customers treat us. One day, my assistant manager blew up. It was only her and I in the store. She went on this rant about how dudes come here all dressed up and get our cheap gas to go to their dead end job, but yell at us because they can't yell at their employers. I've had people come in and shout at me, personally insult me, and when I had to work alone, I've had men come in and touch all over me. I would get yelled at almost every single day. It's repulsive how people are treated at this job. I had never cried at any of my jobs, except for this one. I would cry while on shift. I quit only one month into the job because I was so emotional that I decided to jump off of a bridge to end it. Never has a job made me feel this awful.
