At the beginning of the film, the machines are already stopped, so the rushing takes about 50 seconds until the water flows into the compensation chamber. Approximate size of the chamber about 80m long 15m wide and at the end it is filled 2m.           &gt; This is the upper water closing chamber of a pumped storage power station. The water overflow of the vertical shaft which projects into the chamber is slightly higher than the highest dam of our upper reservoir. Here a video of the Staumauer and the lake behind it (https://youtu.be/t8lCLcQf944). The sloping shaft (at first comes water in the video) is the channel that leads directly to the turbines. The water closet chamber floor is, of course, also higher than the upper reservoir. If, in an extreme case, all three turbines (maximum power 300MW at 75m\u00b3 / sec of water flow) in the lower compensation basin, by a lightning strike into the high-voltage grid (overland line 380kV) into the emergency shutdown, the upper water still flows.

I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times. And I shan't recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can't concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don't think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. I can't fight it any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can't even write this properly. I can't read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that\u2014everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can't go on spoiling your life any longer. I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been. V             But also consider this quote from David Foster Wallace (not his suicide note, but he did kill himself):       &gt; The so-called \u2018psychotically depressed\u2019 person who tries to kill herself doesn\u2019t do so out of quote \u2018hopelessness\u2019 or any abstract conviction that life\u2019s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump.

Then read the Trello [API Introduction](https://developers.trello.com/docs/api-introduction). You will need to generate a token your app will use in your API calls to authenticate itself.               Next I recommend using the python with the `requests` [library](https://realpython.com/python-requests/) to script the API calls you tested with curl or Postman. You can also write a bash script using curl directly, but anything non-trivial bash scripts can get ugly.
