{"evmp0si": {"text": "Memories are sort of unreliable as your brain can fabricate something since, in a sense you when you remember a memory you\u2019re not recalling the actual event but rather the last time you remembered.

Especially if you\u2019re having dreams about something since that could possibly be a sign of PTSD but that\u2019s tricky as you say you don\u2019t have memory of it. The way the brain responds to trauma can be tricky. As for your actual question, it is possible that when the trauma was happening your body completely dissociated and now you are unable to recall anything. If it\u2019s repeated trauma and it happened a very young age, there\u2019s a possibility of DID as the trauma can be so heavy that your brain starts splitting into different parts that essentially hold those memories for you to \u201cprotect\u201d you or until your brain decides to feed you your trauma.
