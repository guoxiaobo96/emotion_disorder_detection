About a year after starting I moved to be a credit analyst, and about a year and a half after that another bank recruited me at a 33% pay increase (hoping banks every few years is the easiest way to build salary if you want to make a career out of it). After that a friend of mine asked me to come help them at their small business (by small I mean a few hundred employees, so not scary small) and from there I was recruited by another business in the same industry where I was able to really negotiate benefits, salary, hours, and commission structure.   I can't overstate the benefit of the mentorship programs. A lot of people come in with a negative attitude (especially in a call center environment) and want to do the minimum required. That's totally okay from the perspective of your actual duties for the job, but the programs they offer will help a LOT.

RE's generally need you to have been trying for 12 months, but its worth calling anyway because it may take 3-6 months to get an appointment and they may see you earlier based on the fact that you have PCOS.The reason that I mention RE's being better is because I honestly have had a great experience with mine, it's not just treating PCOS its 'We plan on getting you pregnant no matter what.' and they have been extremely thorough in looking at doing a LOT of bloodwork (everything from blood sugar to more horomones than i can name, vitamin levels, and even antibodies to ensure my childhood vaccines worked well enough), there was a lot of other testing as well to look at lining and fallopian tubes. It really is a fill picture, as opposed to a regular endo who would do a few things, and then an OBGYN that would do another.

Talk it over with your lender, but generally $10k off of the selling price does not really save you much from a monthly perspective, you'd likely need $30k or more off to really see a dramatic difference. There's also the chance that if something is found wrong during the inspection, the seller will have to either fix it or give you cash towards it. That's definitely a gamble, and really not predictable though.Edit to add my story: When I was trying to buy, I wanted 5% closing costs covered. The first seller refused, and even when we came in 5% above asking price, they still refused even though they were desperate to sell (supposedly). Some buyers get upset at the first offer,which is what happened in my case. The second house we put a bid on at asking price with 5% closing costs covered.

It all depends on the farm. My family is a bunch of farmers who genuinely care about their cows. They know each cow, see each cow every day. Their cows live happy lives. It does not hurt a cow to provide milk. As a matter of fact, baby cows will become aggressive and often injure their mothers as they grow and demand more milk. They honestly do better being weaned and seperated at an appropriate age.

The process would start with a bunch of testing, most REs will not proceed without it. Once all the testing has cleared, you would come in on CD1-5 for baseline testing (there's a lot of testing) and would prescribed something like Clomid or Letrozole to make you ovulate. After about a week you would come in for blood work and ultrasounds every 2-3 days until they see a good follicle has grown. Once they see that, you will take a trigger shot which will trigger ovulation. You will come back in 1-2 days with your SO for the IUI. He'll give a sample and they will filter and clean the sperm before injecting the best ones directly into your uterus.It is a bit of an extensive process (one of the reasons we have avoided it) and your insurance may or may not cover it.

Judging from the fact that she has done 7 rounds of IVF and has nieces and nephews, she's likely a bit more calloused now but I would just try to put more forethought into how she will take such news.You also have to understand that each couple processes TTC differently and that it takes time. You start out thinking it will be easy, and then it's not. You take one step and then another, and then another. I am sure they have thought of and talked about adoption, but it may not be something they want or are ready for at this time.As far as supporting her goes, I would just give her space and allow her to start any conversations related to babies or pregnancy.

This isn't often discussed in general public school education but I imagine very few who could afford slaves didn't have them. Farmers and estate owners would need them because if all of your competitors are using slave labor, you would have to too to keep up with production costs. The treatment of slaves varied a lot based on owner, and I have heard reports of slave owners being as nice as they could or buy slaves to assist in escape. I think it would look strange socially to not own slaves at that time, and it was a crime to help slaves escape (seen as stealing a persons property) so it may draw unwanted attention.To your second question... I have honestly never heard the topic discussed. The best answer I can give you is anecdotes from my grandfather. He was born in the 1920s and dropped out of school to work in the 1930s. He came from a very poor family and would often work for farmers along with black men. They weren't slaves, but this was at a time when jobs were hard to come by and racism and segregation were very much alive and well. He never harbored any ill-will for them, always said they were nice and hard working. That being said, he was a white child being paid the same rate as an adult black man to do similar work at less then what would be average wages for the time.

{"eh0okqz": {"text": "Hello! I was diagnosed with Hashimotos (which causes hypothyroidism) when I was 14 or so. You need to take your synthroid/levothroxyne in the morning, first thing, with a glass of water. Try to take it at the same time every day on an empty stomach. Try not to eat for at least 30min after and try to never take it with other pills. Check the paperwork from the pharmacy, it should outline all of that. The pill itself can be... Kind of finicky I guess. If you take it with food it may not work as well. I would seriously hope your doctor is weaning you into that dose, starting at 100mcg right out of the gates probably won't be fun. You HAVE to take it consistently. The worst thing you can do is take a day then miss a day and take a day. The back and forth is hard on your body and you'll likely have pretty bad side effects.They should test your TSH in a month and again in a few months. It's not uncommon for fluctuations, I am currently on 88mcg (last test was TSH of 6 on a dose of 50mcg) but have been anywhere from 25mcg to 125mcg. Once you're more regulated they should test every 6-12 months but after time you will likely start to realize if things have change. Anything from appetite, to hair growth, to sleep schedules, mood, how your body deals with temp, emotions/thought process,ect. Are all affected by thyroid. You'll feel different on and off of the meds and you'll start to recognize the symptoms.If your doctor did not mention to take it in the morning and isnt weaning you on a dose, you need to see an RE or at least an endo because your doctor isn't handling it appropriately. It's also important to note that your thyroid will likely need to be checked monthly once you conceive, and I highly recommend you see an RE for that. Best of luck!

After 12 months, having to wait another 3-4 months to actually see the RE... That wasn't a good time. Not being aware that 12 months and no baby mean infertility and hearing it casually mentioned by a doctor definitely resulted in a meltdown.

They want to pet the puppy and love on the puppy and all of that, which tells the puppy that they are reacting the right way. It enforces bad behavior.Once she gets good inside your home by not getting excited then you can try going out with treats and keeping her attention.

Regardless of who you talk to I highly recommend educating yourself and don't ever just take advice without knowing the full ramifications first.I'm not sure the type of business, but sometimes you can crowdfund or find investors in your area. If not, loans are definitely an option but the concern here for me is the number of them and that they're in your name. In a perfect world you'd get one or two large loans and the rest would be under the business name. If you are not the sole owner of the business, you need to understand that regardless of what happens to the business or the co-owners, this is YOUR debt. Regardless of any agreement with you and anyone else, you (and any co-signers on the loan) are responsible for the loans at the end of the day. If I were you, I'd make sure that any loans you signed on for the business are viewed as a contribution by you. For example, if you have a co-owner who contributed $10,000 and the total amount of the loans $100,000, then you should have 90% of the equity in the company as recourse. That may not be possible now, since everything has already been done, but that is how it should go. You are taking risks to your personal credit to fund the business and you should have recourse for that. I would look for small business groups in your area and try to find investors in your sector. Remember that it's often better to grow a little slower than all at once.

He figured he would rather pay the tickets out of his paycheck then continue making trips, but when he got the ticket he realized it was LESS MONEY then parking the van for the entire day (the deck charged hourly). So every day for a week or two that's what he did until the system was repaired. Some time after that he got called in to see his boss's boss who flipped out on him for not doing as directed because it \"gave the company a bad reputation.\" My dad was pretty tired of it and figured he was going to be fired anyway, so he got really angry and ranted about how much time he saved WHILE saving the company money.

For them this meant baked mac n cheese, kool aid, collard greens, corn bread, okra, beans and weanies, that kind of thing. To me it has always just been food, I was never taught a distinction. Some people I worked with took problem with this \"You can't say you like this. This is our food.\" Was the most outward thing I've ever heard, but that only happened once. I try to be pretty accepting of other opinions and I definitely understand the idea of preserving culture, but I was raised with it too.There are other things, like hair. For awhile my stepdad had dreads, and my mom would do his hair and my stepsisters. So I learned a bit about black hair, although I've never done it myself, I understand the concept and what's needed. Then there's privilege. I started to notice that if stepdad were by himself, like at a check out, he may be treated differently if my mom were there with him. If she walked up and hugged him and said \"is there a problem?\" the cashier's whole attitude would change. Sometimes I wouldn't always notice things, like women locking their car doors if stepdad walked by, but he would. Eventually we had a discussion about it, when I was old enough to understand.

We have marches and protests but they are easily ignored.  A lot of our working class cannot take time off paid, or sometimes at all. Which means that taking time off of work to protest is infeasible. Missing work isn't really an option, and a lot of us have 2 or more jobs.I would love to be a part of a revolution.

I also highly recommend you ask for a phone number to call directly to the department assisting you, so that if you have to call later you don't have to worry about the IVR.It is very important to note that even though you are removed from the account you may not see the trade disappear from your credit. It may just show as \"no longer associated\" which a lender would understand but it won't change your score. You should be able to request that they dispute the trade with the credit bureaus to remove the trade, they will not offer.As a general note, any changes made to the credit bureaus take 30-60 days before being actually updated.Hope this helps!", "link_id": "t3_a3e114", "time": 1544047246}}
