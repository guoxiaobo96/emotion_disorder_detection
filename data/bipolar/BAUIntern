{"egwhroz": {"text": "Don\u2019t wish for that, the key to loosing weight is to respect food, not hate it. Food is the fuel your body needs to function think and work, so don\u2019t hate it! Love food, respect food. I spent a year eating about 500 calories a day and I actually gained weight because I was eating a very small amount of junk with nothing else. Once I started eating 1200 calories a day with much healthier food, I felt SO much better. I had more energy, I was less depressed, I was much happier and my body looked better than ever. Treat your body like the machine it is. Give it the fuel it needs to function and eat raw foods like vegetables and fruits and don\u2019t forget to add lean protein to your diet like chicken and fish. Drink plenty of water and get plenty of sleep. The more you respect your body the more your body will give you the results you want. Be patient and take care of yourself love!", "link_id": "t3_asp9f0", "time": 1550694101}}
