I think all of us -- at least at one point have had moments where we feel like we're crazy because a medical professional along the way has invalidated our symptoms.  I went through 5 days before I found one who was worth anything and she referred me to my PT.   I've never once felt crazy while explaining my symptoms to her and she is thorough, but kind.  She is constantly checking in with me during exercises to ensure things are not causing me pain, etc.  She is truly a blessing.  In additional to my physical health, she has given me tips on how to handle my mental health too as stress is one of my biggest triggers.  I can already sense a slight improvement and I'm thrilled for more results.  I know that when you're in the frustration of dealing with these symptoms, it is annoying to think about finding another specialist.  But that may be your best option.  I know that everyone has bad days, but no one should make you feel inferior or crazy when you're trying to explain what is going on with you.  I'm sorry this happened to you.  Seeing as you will need to feel comfortable with your PF specialist during in-person appointments, I would personally look for someone who had less attitude.

I couldn't figure anything out.  Now that I'm not flaring, I'm trying certain foods again.  My physical therapist sent me several videos on gut health, etc. because I've been having digestive issues too.  From the videos, I've watch so far, it seems that a modified paleo-diet seems fairly safe.  Of course, every diet has cheerleaders and anecdotes.  For every vegan who is able to acheive remission from autoimmune disorders, there are also people on the carnivore diet achieving the same thing.  And if they achieve remission, then the diet will be credited -- regardless of the other factors to consider that may have contributed.  Diet isn't one size fits all, even when it includes a ethical lifestyle change like veganism does. We have to do what's best for our bodies.  I feel better drinking bone broth and having a relatively varied diet of fruits, vegetables, etc.  There's a few universal truths about food.  For example, lean meats and fresh vegetables/fruits are infinitely better than heavily processed foods.  Hot dogs and Twinkies are terrifying, and would probably survive a nuclear blast.  There's a few more.  But ultimately, I would recommend that you do more research and possibly try a few foods (like legumes) once you're feeling up to it.  That will give you a good baseline for how manageable a vegan diet will be for someone with IC.  Then, if it is attainable for you, you can start searching up recipes with your individual needs in mind.   But if you find that you do better keeping local chicken and fish in your diet, then keep those things in!  Try to listen to your body (even when it's screaming!)

Once the scope goes in, it's not bad.   After the fact, you may have some burning while you pee.  Personally, this only lasted a few hours for me, but everyone is different.  As soon as you get it done (if you do), take Azo or ask your doctor about Uribel and get it ahead of time.  Drink lots water to flush and use a squirt bottle to squirt water on yourself while you're peeing because this will help relieve any burning.   It shouldn't last very long. But as a person with interstitial cystitis and pelvic floor dysfunction, you do NOT need a cystoscopy to be diagnosed with either of those.  So if that is what your uro is checking for, then a cystoscopy is a not really going to be helpful.  There are things that can be diagnosed with a cystoscopy and it can check for ulcers (which only about 10% of IC patients have).  But be very open with your doctor and ask him/her why specifically this needs to be done.  Be honest.  It's your body.  You can decide whether or not it makes sense for you.

My niece was ten when my sister in law, without taking her to the doctor, decided that my niece had a gluten allergy.  Why?  She complained about a stomach ache.  My niece does not have a gluten allergy.  I watched her eating habits several times and saw a similar pattern.  She would get pasta, red sauce, have a few pieces of bread, and fruit.  That was it.  Meal after meal.  No protein no fat.  So of course, she was getting stomachaches.  Lots of sugar and no satiatiom will do that to you.  It's been two years and my niece will have bread without consequence at times now.  But she also eats better.   It's always made a big deal when she has bread.  In fact, whole restaurants are decided based on whether or not gluten-free options are on the menu.  And now, my niece, the quiet, middle child, has control over something that her two sisters do not all because she complained about stomachaches.  Similarly, when I was 15, my friend developed an allergy to a fruit.  I can't remember now what fruit it was, but at any rate, she mistook the \"tickle feeling in her throat\" as a similar sensation that you get when you eat pineapple -- a fruit that she was not allergic too.  She thought nothing of it and continued eating, until the event landed her in the hospital.  Both my niece and my old high school friend are sensors.  ISFJ and ISFP, respectively.   I get what you're saying, but I don't know that it directly misinterpreting physical sensations correlates with our misunderstanding of Se.  I think it's a communication issue that affects most children because kids respond to any form discomfort in extreme ways.  Heck, getting \"hangry\" is a real thing even for adults.  But adults are generally able to recognize their discomfort for what it is and manage in a practical way without a meltdown.  Key word being generally.

I took his advice and have since learned to let things roll off, for the most part.  But since she is a retired nurse, she is very, hmm, opinionated on medical issues.  Some of her information is sound, but lots of it is outdated.  She's never heard of IC nor will she take 20 seconds to Google it.

I assume I was just supposed to accept. She didn't refer me anywhere.  My brother in law works in a hospital.  He's the one who had to get me into my current urologist.  And thus far, all signs point to IC and possibly PFD.  Again, there are still things she needs to test for.  But having a direction when doctor after doctor has insisted there is nothing wrong with you gives people some hope.  So I don't know that it's terrible to suggest a direction because after I was told I had no kidney stones (since I have a history of them and the symptoms can be similar), I had no idea what to do after that.  It may not be something that can be eradicated with some antibiotics, but it's good to cover all the basis.  Every IC patient seems to be different and many people are early on in their diagnosis process when they arrive at this sub, so maybe that information can be useful to someone.

{"fs8qmfp": {"text": "I'm so sorry this happened!  I hope your son is feeling okay now.  Make sure the wound stays clean, but I would call the doctor in case a tetanus shot is needed if the wound is deep.  I can't tell from this angle. Please keep in mind that I am in no way blaming your son for the bite, but if he is afraid of the dog, he is sending all sorts of invisible signals to that dog that could trigger the dog.  Dogs can read stress and other emotions very well and will respond accordingly.   This may require a board-certified behaviorist because there's no telling what happened to the dog before he got to you.  I would ask your vet for recommendations or see if he can point you to a behaviorist because Valium, while effective, doesn't really address the issue.  But I will offer as much advice as I can from a layman's perspective.The first and most obvious change should be the console seat.  If your dog is possessive of you, then he shouldn't be allowed to be between you and your children.  Put him in the back seat where he won't have biting access to anyone.  Secondly, find a high value reward for your dog.  A treat that he absolutely goes berserk over.  A clicker is also an excellent tool.  Your Shih Tzu feels insecure in his standing.  Classical conditioning is an incredibly effective way to shape dog behavior and it may be helpful in getting your dog to change his mind about your kids.  And males in general.   Whenever your son walks into the room and the dog starts to bark, have him drop a treat and then sit down next to you.  The dog will get distracted by the treat.  Once your son is seated, he can use a clicker and give another treat.  Preferably after giving your dog a command like \"Sit\" dog sits *click* and immediately treat with a \"good boy.\"   As difficult as it may be for you, if you're the one primarily spending the most time with the dog, that should stop.  The dog needs to be able to cope without you, even if you're in the room.  So if you normally feed the dog, have one of your children feed the dog instead.   The same applies with walks.  Even if you go on the walk, have your children carry the leash and treats.  Rest assured, it will take several repetitions for you to break the behavior that is so deeply engrained in your dog and you may not be able to do it without professional help, but this is a good way to start.    Reward good behavior.  Practice obedience training with the click and treats.  Correct bad behavior (i.e. barking) and eliminate the possibility for more accidents to occur like the seat.  I don't know how well this will work if your kids don't want to be involved.  Their cooperation is key if you want to reshape the dog's view. Best of luck.

{"fs1ttcv": {"text": "If you are wanting to find a breeder, these are the questions that I ask.  Keep in mind that some of them are more crucial than others.  I put an asterisk by the ones that I personally think are must-haves. *Do you have health tests and health guarantees? This is a non-negotiable.  You need to know your dog's health history.  If the breeder is not willing to stand behind their dogs' health, run!  This is more important than AKC registration, which is nice to have but not crucial if you're not breeding.  Even backyard breeders with unhealthy dogs can get AKC registration if the dogs are purebred without the dogs being examined at all.  Though, if the parents have been shown and placed with the AKC, it's more relevant (because these dogs have been health-tested and are recognized as the breed standard).  *Do you have parents on sight and can I meet them? (At least one parent).Do you puppies live in your house or in a kennel?  *How have they been socialized?   *Do you have a contract?  A good breeder will because they want to know more about you before handing their dogs over.   They will take also take the dog back at any time and find it a suitable home, if you are unable to do so.  *Do your puppies live in a smoke-free home? Do you begin potty training the puppies?What are you feeding the puppies?  What do you provide with the puppies?  *Will you be available for questions as my puppy grows up?  &lt;-- the answer should be yes. **How many breeds do they focus on?  If they have more than one or possibly two, this is a red flag.  It makes it difficult to give the care and consideration needed to ensure each dog has what they need and are of standard.  A good breeder will answer these questions enthusiastically and has a desire to uphold breed integrity.   They will be involved in each stage of the process and will know each puppy; therefore, they will know which puppy will suit you.  If there are a bunch of puppies available, this is a red flag. ** Usually reputable breeders have a waiting list or maybe only one or two slots open.  I saw a woman who had 45 puppies available of different breeds.  Stay away.   Honestly, go with your gut.

I've never tried it personally, but I can say that once I cut out caffeine (reasons being that it made me anxious and it flares my autoimmune disorder), I was  much happier.  I was also considerably happier (i.e. less anxious) when I cut out processed sugars.

You can look at rescues in your area if you're not comfortable going through a breeder.  Don't feel bad about not knowing what imperial meant.  The marketing is brilliant and the puppies are so cute, they practically sell themselves.   But a good breeder can give you peace of mind in addition to that cute puppy.  If you are wanting to find a breeder, these are the questions that I ask.  Keep in mind that some of them are more crucial than others.  I put an asterisk by the ones that I personally think are must-haves. *Do you have health tests and health guarantees? This is a non-negotiable.  You need to know your dog's health history.  If the breeder is not willing to stand behind their dogs' health, run!  This is more important than AKC registration, which is nice to have but not crucial if you're not breeding.  Even backyard breeders with unhealthy dogs can get AKC registration if the dogs are purebred without the dogs being examined at all.  Though, if the parents have been shown and placed with the AKC, it's more relevant (because these dogs have been health-tested and are recognized as the breed standard) *Do you have parents on sight and can I meet them? (At least one parent).Do you puppies live in your house or in a kennel?  *How have they been socialized?   *Do you have a contract?  A good breeder will because they want to know more about you before handing their dogs over.   They will take also take the dog back at any time and find it a suitable home, if you are unable to do so.  *Do your puppies live in a smoke-free home? Do you begin potty training the puppies?What are you feeding the puppies?  What do you provide with the puppies?  *Will you be available for questions as my puppy grows up?  &lt;-- the answer should be yes. *For Shih Tzus, avoid any breeder who markets imperials or miniature Shih Tzus.  These Shih Tzus are below breed standard and implies an  irresponsible breeder.**How many breeds do they focus on?  If they have more than one or possibly two, this is a red flag.  It makes it difficult to give the care and consideration needed to ensure each dog has what they need and are of standard.  A good breeder will answer these questions enthusiastically and has a desire to uphold breed integrity.   They will be involved in each stage of the process and will know each puppy; therefore, they will know which puppy will suit you.  If there are a bunch of puppies available, this is a red flag. ** Usually reputable breeders have a waiting list or maybe only one or two slots open.  I saw a woman who had 45 puppies available of different breeds.  Stay away.   Honestly, go with your gut.  There are breeders who will have everything you're looking for on paper and they can be rude to you or not want to answer your questions.   Don't get sucked in by cute Tzu faces.

For your own peace of mind, it's worth it to carry some pepper spray in the event that a bear gets too close, but this is incredibly unlikely.  If you see a bear, don't approach it and make some noise.  The most common reason for an attack is surprise, so chat amongst yourselves while hiking so that any bears in the area will hear it.   I've been within touching distance of a black bear, though I was in a vehicle and had no interest in putting the window down to do so.  The poor thing had gotten trapped between the car and a rock ledge, but as soon as it could, it scrambled up the rock ledge up to higher ground.  Like most animals, black bears can get bolder in the pursuit of food, so if you're camping, keep food up high and away from your campsite.  Don't leave food in your tent or your car.  For grizzlies, it's pretty much similar.  I should note that I don't hike in grizzly country without a few other people and grizzlies, generally do not attack groups.  For as big as they are, their sense of self-preservation outweighs their desire to kill humans generally.   For grizzlies, I do take bear spray and stay vigilant, but I don't really fear an attack because I'm in a group and I'm aware of my surroundings.  As with the black bears, food can be an attractant, so I don't even leave an empty wrapper in the car because they can tear the doors off with no issue.   I've had one instance where my family was on a series of switchbacks coming down them and we heard someone yell up to us, \"There's a grizzly sow on the trail in front of you. She's heading up.\"  This certainly put us on alert.  I took out the bear spray and we kept walking.  While we walked, we called out to her, \"Hey Momma,\" \"Hey bear,\" \"We're not tasty, Momma,\"  etc.  We got to the end of the switchbacks without ever seeing her.   About an hour later, we were on a ferry ride and looked up on the side of a cliff.   There was momma bear in all of her glory and the cub.   If we ever got close to her on the trail, I never saw her.  Other experiences with grizzlies have been a fair distance away, so the grizzlies have all been too focused on their own task to pay me any attention.  I certainly don't get closer.

This is a non-negotiable.  You need to know your dog's health history.  If the breeder is not willing to stand behind their dogs' health, run!  This is more important than AKC registration, which is nice to have but not crucial if you're not breeding.  Even backyard breeders with unhealthy dogs can get AKC registration if the dogs are purebred.  Though, if the parents have been shown and placed with the AKC, it's more relevant.Do you have parents on sight and can I meet them?Do you puppies live in your house or in a kennel?  How have they been socialized?  Do you have a contract?  A good breeder will because they want to know more about you before handing their dogs over.   They will take the dog back at any time and find it a suitable home, if you are unable to do so.  Do your puppies live in a smoke-free home? Do you begin potty training the puppies?What are you feeding the puppies?  What do you provide with the puppies?  Will you be available for questions as my puppy grows up?  &lt;-- the answer should be yes. For Shih Tzus, avoid any breeder who markets imperials or miniature Shih Tzus.  These Shih Tzus are below breed standard and implies an  irresponsible breeder.How many breeds do they focus on?  If they have more than one or possibly two, this is a red flag.  It makes it difficult to give the care and consideration needed to ensure each dog has what they need and are of standard.  A good breeder will answer these questions enthusiastically and has a desire to uphold breed integrity.   They will be involved in each stage of the process and will know each puppy; therefore, they will know which puppy will suit you.  If there are a bunch of puppies available, this is a red flag.  Usually reputable breeders have a waiting list or maybe only one or two slots open.  I saw a woman who had 45 puppies available of different breeds.  Stay away.   Honestly, go with your gut.  There are breeders who will have everything you're looking for on paper and they can be rude to you or not want to answer your questions.   Don't get sucked in by cute Tzu faces.

That said, she loves to sprawl out on a cooling mat or even a wet towel.  The cooling mats specifically for dogs are sold online.  It gets hot here in Central Florida and she is solid black, so we definitely have to be careful with her.   We also make her \"Pupsicles\" that she can enjoy.  I make small ones in silicone molds.  You can use savory fillers (like dog-safe bone broth and carrots) or a sweet treat (plain green yogurt with some berries).  They can be a tasty way to help keep your baby cool.

And I can't speak to their intentions, tone, or your perception of it, but I don't see either of those things as a sacrifice or a betrayal.  On the first instance, you admitted that the group was no longer functioning efficiently and your INFJ friend brought this up to you.  Again, that's not sacrifice.  That's being honest.  She left.  And I don't know the situation, but the others may have felt the same and didn't know how to tell you.  That likely wasn't a personal attack, given my own view as an INFJ,  but we can be blunt and this can surprise people who view us as empathetic flower children all the time.  In terms of the second instance, what were you expecting?  She was supportive of your writing, until you wrote something that she disagreed with based on her personal beliefs.  Again, I can't speak to how far she went with her personal attacks, but if she disagreed, how was she supposed to react?  This may not have been the case with her, but I can debate beliefs without feeling any malice against the person who holds them.   It may have been another instance where the behavior shocked you, but an honest friend who may hurt your feelings is more valuable than one who lies to spare them.As far as gossiping goes, I wouldn't consider it an INFJ trait.  That said, I do like to read the room and notice people because it gives me information on how to interact with them. We can dwell on this too and try to plan out what can happen in personal interactions.  We like to stay ahead.  People can say all sorts of things with their body language, style of dress, etc.   In different circles, I react differently.  And so does everyone else.  This is not an exclusive INFJ quality.  I will say though that if I felt like you were guarded around me, I would naturally respond in turn.  We are naturally guarded anyway, so you putting on a mask is not going to make an INFJ feel \"safe\" to be vulnerable around you.  It takes time for us to develop lasting relationships.  Just be your authentic self around an INFJ and don't be surprised if it takes a while for them to warm up to you.   Believe me, we have analyzed the situation more than you have.  So just let it play out.  Healthy people of any type are capable of forming lasting relationships and deep connections. I tend not to waste my time with having lots of platonic friends.  I want deep, meaningful conversations with people who add value to my life.  Period.  I don't care what type they are.  One of the flaws I think the MBTI system has is that people tend to focus too much on their differences with others and therefore imagine conflict or a wall before one even exists.

{"fq9x13h": {"text": "It's not really that unpopular.  Tangled follows the classic fairy tale archetype (because it is one).  There's a reason why Disney uses that formula over and over again without too much deviation from the original content.  It works.  And it works incredibly well.  I don't hate Frozen.  In fact, I enjoy the songs and the visuals are stunning.  The characters, however,  are rather weak.  I wish they would have made Elsa the villian as originally planned because that would have made the story stronger.  In its current form, Anna is easily the better character overall even given her own life in the first film, but continuously gets overshadowed by Elsa's sparkly dresses and ice powers.  Without those qualities, Elsa is not particularly interesting.  Her sister is brave, funny, quirky, awkward, vulnerable -- everything that makes a good heroine.  And yet, Elsa is the favorite because she is more marketable...and became even more marketable in the second film whilst poor Anna gets more responsibility shoved on to her.   Kristoff could have been absent from the second film and I dont think people would have noticed.   The second film is very on the nose with its message too.  So much so that the message supercedes the story.   This is a problem in the first film too, but it's a little harder to recognize.  Tangled just checks off all of the boxes in terms of a good story.   Mother Gothel is a scarier and more compelling villian than surprise villian Hans.  Anyone who watched GOT can say enthusiastically that shock value is not the same as a good story.   The side characters in Tangled, to me, are more entertaining, including the pub thugs.  Sven didn't need to be given \"a voice\" as it clear with Pascal and Max that their expressions can communicate things completely.  Olaf has some funny lines, but he doesn't really add much to the story and it's clear he is also in there for marketing. Eugene is a thieving rogue in the beginning who is only out for himself and by the end of the story, he is willing to sacrifice his own life to save Rapunzel. Kristoff still sells ice, i think.  I realize that Frozen is more focused in the two sisters, but I still really feel bad that that dude had virtually no role.  The first Frozen film, Elsa learns not to shut herself away from her loved ones.  In the second film?  BYE ANNA, I'm going to be a sparkly ice fairy now.  You can rule for me, right?  K, thanks.  You're the best.  Another thing that I found concerning is Anna's dependency...It was first on a man she just met and in the second film, it was as though her ENTIRE purpose was Elsa.   I know that's not what was meant by it, but it certainly seemed like it.  Shoot, she couldn't even get proposed to without Elsa partially sharing in the moment.  Rapunzel was already a resourceful and strong character before she left the tower.   She was merely naive to the world around her because of Gothel's, but she still desired a life beyond the tower.  Once she figured out Gothel was lying, she rebelled.   She was willing to fight and save her own self.  She was kind, brave, artistic, and smart.   She's what they should have done with Anna (again, if they had kept Elsa the villian).  I think both are good, but to me, Tangled is a far stronger story on its own even without the series.", "link_id": "t3_ghhvxh", "time": 1589208710}}

We never lived together.  We never lived with a significant other at all until the day we got married.  We got married at the 2 year mark.  There is  a bit of a learning curve to be sure and we certainly have had fights (the first few months in particular can be rough), but we are stronger than ever now.  Our intimacy has been halted since I've been having some issues that are possibly linked to a chronic illnes, but I'm still going through testing.  We have been through hell.

Any grown man who still needs \"time to think to the point where he moves out after being with you for two years has issues.  This is high school bs.   I'm not saying love is easy, but both people need to desire to make it work.  You say his actions say that he loves you, but what about this?  He is willingly distancing from you in every way.  I get that after fights people need some time to cool off -- possibly even a few days, but at a certain point, you need to get over it and address things.   That's part of growing up.  I don't know this guy's history, but if he's holding grudges over things for weeks at a time, that's a personal issue he needs to sort out.   That is not your problem.    I say all of this, OP, because ultimately, you need to decide whether or not this relationship is valuable to you.  And whether or not you're willing to go through this emotional rollercoaster with a guy who isn't 100% positive that you're who he wants to be with.

In my experience, a general doctor just doesn't have the knowledge to treat mental health.  Keep in mind that psychiatrists are only interested in the clinical side of your diagnosis and medication.   If you want to talk about triggers, etc., then I recommend that you also find a therapist to help you there.  You need to do what's best for you.  This isn't just stress.  Mental health is another level entirely and hopefully as you go through your journey, your parents will be more open to it.   Medication is certainly trial and error, but the right medication will not turn you into a zombie and listening to the doctor will not turn you into an addict.  It will only manage your symptoms to help you live your life.   If it's easier to keep this to yourself, then do that until you're able to get handle on it.  You're an adult. You are in charge of your own life.  Don't feel like you need to volunteer every action to your parents if they are going to make cutting remarks throughout.  It may be better if you get to a good place with all of this before you lay it all out on the table.  Now, by all means, say \"I'm going to the doctor or I'm going to therapy,\" but you don't need to be open with all of the details right away.

Speaking from a completely unbiased view, Eugene was a wanted criminal many times over.   From a historical standpoint, the penalty for his first crime would have likely been to remove his hand.   But assuming that he has taken six, seven, eight things -- yeah, death seems to be reasonable.  The punishment would be reasonable if he wasn't the hero.  But he is.  \"Les Mis\" does this too.  Jean Valjean IS a fugitive.  Everything Javert does is completely justified.  But Jean Valjean is the protagonist of the story and Javert was the antagonist.  In reference to the rocks, did you forget that Quirin literally lied to the king about them after promising the villagers that he would tell him?  How is Frederick supposed to be blamed for that?  And Quirin told Varian not to touch the rocks.  He did.  Varian is the reason his father became encased in Amber and Rapunzel's broken promise was what caused Varian to become angry and rebel.  Upon Varian's capture, King Frederick vows to how Quirin and Varian, even though Varian literally committed treason which again points to the above paragraph.  Overall, Frederick is a pretty fair guy.   In reference to pulling up the flower and as such, creating the black rocks, the guy had an impossible choice to make.  If he didn't pull up the flower, his wife would have died and Rapunzel may have as well.  If he did, the rocks would appear.  He chose to save his wife and for a while at least (until Rapunzel returned) it didn't seem to be an issue.  It's not really fair to say that he made the wrong choice and people certainly can accuse him of being a terrible person for wanting to save the love of his life.  What would you do in that situation?As far as wanting to keep Rapunzel safe, that is also 100% understandable.  He was being an overprotective father because his child was taken from crib and kept away (and abused for 18 years).  It makes sense for him to be overly protective of Rapunzel.  That was a lesson for both of them to work through and they showed in the show beautifully.  Rapunzel needed to grow up and show responsibility, but Frederick also needed to step back and allow her to be her own person. They both had to work on their relationship and learn to trust one another.  All in all, Frederick made mistakes.  But we all do.  None of his actions came from a bad place and he admitted/learned from the mistakes he did make.   It honestly astounds me that people could call him a bad king and especially a bad father.  I don't see any evidence from what you've presented that he is horrible.  Fallible, sure.  But he was a great king and a loving father.

For Candida support, I prefer Kyolic which is on Amazon, but Now Candida Support should also be carried at vitamin shops and could be purchased today.  It's also helpful to include as many fermented or probiotic-rich foods in your diet as possible like kimchi, yogurt, kefir, or kombucha.  Avoid processed food for the next week and drink water like your life depends on it (because it does).   If you want some coffee in the morning, that's fine.  But water is best for the rest of the day. When you have to pee, use a squeeze bottle (or even a cup) of lukewarm to room temp water each time to help the sting.  It's annoying, but it's helpful.  As both a frequent UTI sufferer and multi-kidney stone girl, I'm no stranger to burning pee.   Drinking water will hopefully dilute the urine and help the burn, but it is mostly the raw skin.  Go commando whenever possible.  I like to wear loose-fitting cotton shorts and let her breath.

Fortunately, with my first go-around, I was able to get a CT and confirmation immediately.   This saga began in March for me. I first thought bad UTI or kidney infection since the pain is significantly more bearable this time.  Nothing in multiple cultures, but I was nevertheless treated with Cipro for the symptoms I did not have.   Cipro is terrible.  I'm by no means a spiteful person,  but I really want to have an \"I told you so\" moment with the gyno now.   It sounds so petty, but this isn't the first time that I've come to her office having a pretty good idea of what issues were only to have her completely invalidate them.  The worst was that the first time it was concerning an ovarian cyst -- an area that she should be familiar with considering her line of work.   I had all of the symptoms of a cyst rupturing.   Like the kidney stones, it had happened before.  So, a week after I had this happen, she ordered an ultrasound.  A week later.  The ultrasound reported that there was \"activity\" over my right ovary, but no visible cyst leading my doctor to tell me that I didn't have a cyst.  Well, no shit.  It passed a week ago.   Eventually I got back to normal from that.  And now this.  Perhaps I will try to call her tomorrow and ask for a prescription for flomax.  Maybe her ego will allow that much. In reference to the urologist, I honestly can't remember.  It would have been 6 years, two moves to  two different cities, and a marriage/name change ago since I've seen him last.   The only thing I can remember distinctly about him was that he walked in and the first thing he did was laugh about how small the stone was compared to the pain I had reported.  I subsequently asked him if he had ever passed a stone and when he said no, I told him to shut about about the pain associated with them.  To this day, it has been the worst pain I have ever experienced.  I know he prescribed me flomax and I believe, oxycodone.  So for a solid two days, I did nothing but sleep and pee.  Lol.

That's just simply not true and it doesn't help that these dogs have been overbred which leads to even more issues behaviorally (again, not just with pits) and then some idiots buy them who ignore all of this which causes problems.   Dogs, even little rat dogs like damned chihuahuas, were all bred for a specific purpose.  Whatever that purpose is, that is what the dog is going to excel at.   Lifestock Guardian dogs would make lousy hound dogs.  Hound dogs would make lousy sled dogs.  And so on and so forth.  There is a reason why Dalmatians tend to be bitey and \"aggressive\" in spite of how cute Disney made them seem.  There's a reason why Dobermans, Rotties, Malinois, and Shepherds excel in police work.  These are not accidental traits.  But I've never seen a group of people more egregiously deny the origins of a dog than the pro-pit bull people and it's because the origin story of these dogs is a brutal one.  They were used in bear baiting and bull biting before using them in dog fights was popular.  It doesn't really fit the nanny dog narrative.  I don't blame the breed.

He doesn't.  Uppa gets killed.  Leofric tells Uthred to go straight to Alfred.  Uhtred disagrees.  Odda takes the credit.  Later,  Uthred goes off and raids another area just because.  He is then sentenced to death, which is a fair considering he murdered an entire group of people.  Then he saves Alfred and they have their defining battle.   After that, Uthred is free to go his separate way and he spends it by getting stupid drunk.  He runs into Beocca who asks for his help with Guthred.  Uthred, then decides he will ally with him because it will get him closer to achieving his goal.  But Guthred has a weak and impressionable mind, unlike Alfred who is the master of his own decision-making, regardless of who disagrees with him (his wife does often, as do his advisors.)  Guthred sells Uthred.  And it is Alfred who dispatches the party to rescue Uthred.   Uthred makes yet another stupid decision when he kills Father Eadred.  There are consequences.  Alfred mentions punishing Ragnar, even though it's Uthred's fault and Uthred would never allow Ragnar to take the blame.  This is one of many examples where Uhtred's own decisions are what Alfred uses against him.  Alfred really shouldn't be blamed.   Uhtred is a brilliant warrior, but his decisions, right and wrong, are what guide his path.  Alfred just knows how to exploit both Uthred's strengths and weaknesses for his gain.  It's brilliant, really.  And ultimately, they care for each other in their own complicated way as seen in their last conversation.

{"fnwc8yk": {"text": "So whenever I chat with breeders, here are the questions I ask.  Keep in mind that some of them are more crucial than others. Do you have health tests and health guarantees? This is a non-negotiable.  You need to know your dog's health history.  If the breeder is not willing to stand behind their dogs' health, run!  This is more important than AKC registration, which is nice to have but not crucial if you're not breeding.  Even backyard breeders with unhealthy dogs can get AKC registration if the dogs are purebred.  Though, if the parents have been shown and placed, this is also a bonus.  Do you have parents on sight and can I meet them?Do you puppies live in your house or in a kennel?  How have they been socialized?  Do you have a contract?  A good breeder will because they want to know more about you before handing their dogs over.  Many of them want to add a promise that their dogs will never end up in shelters and can penalize whomever breaks this promise.  A good breeder will take the dog back at any time and find it a suitable home. Do your puppies live in a smoke-free home? Do you begin potty training the puppies?What are you feeding the puppies? What do you provide with the puppies?  Will you be available for questions as my puppy grows up?  &lt;-- the answer should be yes. For Shih Tzus, avoid any breeder who markets imperials or miniature Shih Tzus.  These Shih Tzus are below breed standard and implies irresponsible breeder.How many breeds do they focus on?  If they have more than one or possibly two, this is a red flag.  It makes it difficult to give the care and consideration needed to ensure each dog has what they need and are of standard.  A good breeder will answer these questions enthusiastically and has a desire to uphold breed integrity.   A good breeder will be involved in each stage of the process and will know each puppy; therefore, they will know which puppy will suit you.  If there are a bunch of puppies available, this is a red flag.  Usually reputable breeders have a waiting list or maybe only one or two slots open.  I saw a woman who had 45 puppies available of different breeds.  Stay away.   Honestly, go with your gut.  There are breeders who will have everything you're looking for on paper and they can be rude to you or not want to answer your questions.   Don't get sucked in by cute Tzu faces.

The power anonymity gives people can make some Redditors feel that they can be cruel without consequence. It's a shame, but it is one of the harsh realities behind platforms like Reddit or YouTube.  Many of these people would never say these things to your face, but they feel that they are at liberty to do so online.  Another thing to consider is that this platform and subreddits are not monitored very well.  They have mods, but generally anyone can comment and anyone can join in.  I've noticed on this subreddit that there are a number of people who are dismissive of mental health struggles and as such, they will make snide comments on a post where OP is obviously hurting.  But there's no way to police those comments.  Another thing to consider is that tone does not translate very well over text, especially among strangers.  This is in no way to invalidate what you're feeling, but speaking for myself, I know that I have misunderstood many comments on here that I took to be mean and they weren't.  There are going to miscommunications like that too because there are some genuinely nice people on Reddit who maybe didn't word something well and it came across as harmful.  I've been guilty of it myself.  Thankfully, I was able to clarify.  Reddit can be a good resource, but it will always come with many differing opinions.

She also hates when fetch is over.  But that doesn't mean she spends the rest of the day being mad about a game a fetch.   Your dog thinks in very simple A+B=C terms.   They have an associative memory.   For example, if you put on your shoes, grab your keys, and a leash every single day before a walk, your dog will associate you putting on your shoes and grabbing your keys as \"Woo-hoo, it's time for a walk.\"  This is classical conditioning.   Pavlov's dogs. This can also manifest as a negative which is what's happening here.  OP's dog is in a new situation with rambunctious kids and as such, his whole world has changed.  And these can form negative associations.  And each day those are being strengthened by the same stimulus over and over.   It doesn't mean that the dogs spends hours thinking about an exciting walk or thinking about the kids.   Associations are not the same thing as episodic memories like humans have.   You can remember a hurtful thing that was said to you. They don't remember a key point in time where they felt X.  A dog can't point to a specific day where it clicked that seeing the bell equaled food.  It just knows that the bell is a good thing and gets excited which is why clicker training is incredibly effective for dogs.  I think that negative associations can be replaced with positive associations with some work.  I agree with you there.  But applying complex emotions to dogs that, at this point, we haven't been able to prove that they have isn't going to help the situation.  I apologize if you perceived me as rude as that was not my intention, but throwing out terms like resentment and applying them to dogs can cause more harm than good.

There's also going to be a hormonal change when that happens and she may have not leveled out yet (by the time of that visit).  There are a lot of different factors that could have caused this incident.  Once the quarantine is lifted, try again.  But maybe do it on a weekend like I said and get her after an hour or so.   See how she does.  Then try a little longer. I imagine she will do well, but you can get feedback from the staff on how she does, which things to work on, etc.  And because she has been away, they will likely keep a better watch on her for her return.   In fact, they're going to likely watch all of the dogs more closely when they first get back to ensure that there aren't any issues from the time spent apart.  Good luck, but it honestly sounds like there will be a positive outcome because it starts with a proactive owner.", "link_id": "t3_g0kxl5", "time": 1586814045}}

{"fnb1fub": {"text": "Right off the bat, who runs the daycare?  Is it someone who has a good understanding of dog behavior (i.e. a certified trainer) or is it someone who just loves dogs and opened up a day care?  This matters.  Dog behavior is not black and white.  A dog running after a ball, growling at it, shaking it around, or ripping the stuffing out of a squeaky toy is not aggressive.   A dog wagging its tail is not always friendly.   The day that Layla was separated, was there a new dog at the daycare?   Did they see anything posturing or over-excited behavior in any of the dogs?  Was Layla being obnoxious? (She's a puppy, it happens).  Did they video it?  I ask because Layla didn't act out randomly.   I don't know what she did or if it was even truly aggression, but she wasn't just fine one minute and then reacted the next.  It's worth noting that Layla likely has a high prey drive because both of those breeds do and certain things like a small dog running across the grass may inspire that stalking behavior.   A simple redirect while you're walking with a \"leave it\" can be helpful.  Whenever her attention breaks from that object and she looks at you instead, give her a treat.   A clicker is incredibly beneficial because it gives the dog an audible signal that they did something correctly.   Without seeing a video of Layla, I don't know what she did, but lots of people misread dog behavior.   For example, my former dog (She's in heaven now) had a very stable temperament.  No issues whatsoever.  Our neighbors got a puppy and they were begging to introduce the puppy to our dog.  So we let them bring him over.   My dog was sitting in the grass and this little puppy was jumping all over her.  She got up quietly and started to walk off, the puppy followed her and bumped into her.   She emitted a low growl and kept walking away.   Unphased, the puppy continued to follow her and bumped into her again.  This time, she turned and snapped at the puppy.  She didn't hurt him. Just clicked her teeth close to his face.  And you know what?  He backed way off.  It was the first time I had ever seen her (she was 6 at the time) snap at anything.  But she was giving that puppy a very clear message, \"Back up, pup.\"  And he did.  Message received.  No hurt feelings.   Unfortunately, the neighbors took this as aggression and were horrified, so my dog was not able to give that unruly pup anymore valuable lessons about personal space and manners.   My dog wasn't aggressive.  She was rightfully establishing boundaries.  So...it may be worth trying to observe what Layla is doing.  Maybe she's just overly excited.  Maybe another dog's behavior made her nervous.   I wouldn't allow her to get saddled with the label of aggression until you have more information.   She may just be high energy with a high prey drive.   Here is a channel worth watching just to get some perspectives on dog behavior.  https://www.youtube.com/use guy owns a Bandog and a husky -- both dogs have stable temperaments.  Many of the videos are them at the dog park and various dog interactions.   The videos tend to be short and he doesn't really talk in them, but he does offer some commentary that can be read on the screen.  It is valuable information to pick up on certain behaviors and responses.  Regarding the resource (food and water guarding), I would work with her on that.   Here is part 1 of a series of articles on the topic, but generally this is an area where you need to gain Layla's trust and that you touching her food or water is okay.  Hand feeding her will help with this.   https://www.puppyleaks.com/resource-guarding-first-step/Continue her one on one training and continue to walk her while we are all in isolation.  She will still get loads of information through new smells and sounds as she walks down the street.  This things will only benefit her.  As far as throwing her back into doggy daycare right away, I would proceed with caution.  Maybe one on one playtimes with your parents' dog or the sister's day first to see how she does.    I would talk to the daycare staff and let them know about your apprehension.  Maybe put her back in, but only for an hour before going to get her.  She may get overstimulated or she may be a dog who is not cut out for doggy day care.  She can still be a well-balanced without it.   Just take baby steps and learn what her body language/behavior is telling you.  You're a good dog owner because you're reaching out and asking for help.   You've got this.

{"fl9tysz": {"text": "Yeah, and that's part of what I'm saying.  The moral should not be in the forefront.  Tell the story well and the moral will be obvious.  But instead they chose to brow beat us with the moral and the story was disjointed.  It felt like they didn't tie it to the first film at all.  A few things:-Elsa's parents seemed terrified in the first film about her magic, but in this one, both parents seemed to be a peace with it.  It didn't make sense, even after Anna got hurt, that they (especially the mom) would tell Elsa in the first film to control the magic. -You'd think that the marriage between the king and queen would be enough to lift the fog and bridge the gap between the two worlds, but apparently the elements are dicks and wanted to wait for decades.  -Why didn't the queen ever wonder what happened to her family? -Did the king really marry a girl on the basis that she saved him once when his own father died in her land? - In the first film Elsa realized she needed to embrace love and surround herself with people.  In this one, we see once again Elsa going off alone and getting even more powerful because Elsa (even though she's a boring character) has to be the special snowflake.  Anna is the better, more relatable character, though they really made her weirdly obsessed with protecting her sister in this film.   She had her own mind in the first one.  She was brave and awkward and funny.  In this one she was just, \"Is Elsa *insert random concern here*?\"  She is still the hero of this story as she was in the first, but now she has to share the spotlight with super saiyan Elsa just because.   Poor Kristoff could have been left out of this movie and no one would've noticed.  He deserved better than the Anna he was with in this film.  I did laugh in a few spots and I did like the music, but it was just a mindless cash grab (much like the remakes).  It served its purpose and made them tons of money, so they're not going to learn their lesson.  I really enjoyed the \"Tangled TV series.\"  That is an example of how to do a sequel right.  They had three seasons to flesh out the story and the characters.  They could've easily made Rapunzel a character who was good at everything, but instead the audience is constantly reminded that Rapunzel was locked away for 18 years.  That is handled exceptionally well.  Rapunzel has flashbacks and dreams about Gothel. She frequently misreads situations and how to handle people.  She even breaks a promise to a friend and doesn't see it as a big deal (until it is.)  Those are all things you would expect from her character.  Her father is initially very uptight and protective of her because he lost her.  This makes sense and it helps their relationship develop.  Eugene is supportive and loyal, but he is also allowed to develop his own character and find his own identity.  I can't rave about the series enough.  It was very well done.  And it's a shame because it's not going to get as much credit as the third (I'll assume they'll make a third Frozen) film will, but it's better developed.  It shows me that someone at Disney still has the capacity to write a decent story, so why those people  don't write the script of the films is beyond me.   I'm an adult and I can still watch classic Disney films with a smile.  I love them.  That is what Walt Disney intended.  They were never supposed to have an age cap.  But these new films are very simple, shallow, and obvious cash grabs.  Other than Tangled, I don't know of another film within the last decade that achieves the same goals as the original films did. Many of the films within the last decade have been sequels, remakes, or harmless (albeit boring one offs.)    Zootopia is praised for its brilliance, but it is also an aggressively-driven propoganda film that wanted fans to learn about racism at the expense of the story.  I could rant further about this film and the other evils Disney has committed, but the TLDR version is:  yeah, I agree with you.   Disney doesn't have heart anymore. \ud83d\ude0a", "link_id": "t3_fn3y0y", "time": 1584969201}}

My brother was initially looking into kingsnakes, but after learning how spastic and bitey they can be as babies, he decided against it.  I personally wouldn't call bioactives too difficult.  There is some trial and error as there is with all reptile keeping, but in general, they are virtually maintenance-free once established.  I did have to remove the plants from my enclosures.  It was a bummer, but the boys kept destroying them by uprooting, bulldozing, or burying them.  So I rescued the plants and put them in pots.  The boys don't seem to care.  The plants are mostly for aesthetics.   I will throw some veggies in the enclosures for the clean up crew from time to time.   My corn snake just shed out on Sat and they've already eaten the majority of the shed.  It's so cool watching them work.  I throw some more leaf litter in from time to time and will mist some of the leaves occasionally.  That's pretty much it (aside from food and water for the snake, obviously). There are pros and cons to both bioactive or aspen (for my two species) for sure.  I know some people with healthy snakes in racks too.  I actually know someone with a weirdo of a KSB.

My Western Hognose puts himself in brumation (I don't breed, but he's determined), so I usually just put a towel over him and crank his heat up a bit until he levels back out again in spring time.

As far as snakes never stretching out, that may be true for boids, but colubrids are constantly moving around.  Both of my boys regularly stretch out and use every inch of their enclosure.  My Western Hognose is a 20g long.  He's healthy, active, and eats like a champ.  But there's a lot of coverage.  Breeders swore up and down the he wouldn't eat if he was in anything larger than a shoebox.  That's not true.  My corn snake is 4 ft and is an 40g.  He's healthy, active, and eats like a champ.  Corn snakes aren't considered arboreal, but they will absolutely climb if given the opportunity, so height is good for them as well.  I have some wood in there for him to climb on.   Now obviously a ball python doesn't have the same needs, but the fact that snakes are given the bare minimum is sad to me.   Even Kenyan Sand Boas, though they likely won't use them, should be provided with at least one hide.   As a rule, I don't like rack systems.  Some are okay, but many (Brian Barczyk is the worst) are awful.  I prefer to create enriching environments for my snakes and I have found that they have benefited from it.  It's hard to achieve that in a rack system.  But the reptile world, as I'm sure you're aware, is riddled with different \"opinions.\"   I know racks make sense for breeders or those with large collections, but I'm generally not really a fan.  I would agree that an UTH would be a better form of heat for a BP.  Ps. OP, don't forget about a thermostat if you get an under tank heater.  UTHs should be 1/3 the size of your enclosure, so use that as your measurement.

That said, I've been living anxiety for over a decade.  I know my anxiety well and I've noted certain patterns.   Whenever I am sleep deprived and have something like my monthly cycle, it is an invitation for my anxiety to creep in.   Similarly, whenever I drink caffeine or eat processed foods, my anxiety got worse.   Like most people, I ate like crap in my early 20s, had virtually no workout routine, and was constantly stressed.  It's no coincidence no that my anxiety was also terrible at that time.   Nowadays, I maintain a strict workout routine.  No caffeine.  No processed food.  I meditate and I track my moods.  Whenever I'm feeling a little on edge and know that I'm going to be facing my triggers, I take steps to manage it or avoid it (whichever works).   Anxiety can be rather predictable if one pays attention to it.  It's been two years since my last panic attack.  But I would not have been able to recognize these patterns and triggers when I was at my worst.  Now that I've had time to reflect and get healthier, I can see it clearly.   You have two options.  You can worry about which will make it worse or you can do everything in your power to make it better.   This is your first step.  See what you can do to change in your own life and recognize areas that trigger you, then take steps to manage those area.   Find a professional to discuss these areas with and learn about the ways to manage them.   This isn't the end.  This is the beginning.  Don't let anxiety get the best of you.

He never had hobbies.  All he had was his work...And then he retired.  I just thought it was sad that he wasted his time and put his value into something that was quite literally gone like that.  While it is important to invest in your future by securing a stable job, you also need to prioritize other things like family, friends, hobbies, etc.   It is very doable.  You may just need to adjust.   And plan.   Remember that a paid position is different than an internship too.  It's more secure and less focused on maybe sure someone who works there gets their coffee on time.   So it will probably be less stressful in that sense. As far as your dreams go, you should have them!  Goals too.  And ways you're going to attain them.  That sounds like a great goal. I guess I was a little taken about by some of the comments though.  As someone who is both financially and emotionally (GAD flareups aside) stable, I do believe it is very possible to attain both.   It's a choice.   You can be a workaholic who doesn't make memories and is miserable.  Or you can be someone who works hard, but values their life outside of their job.   That goes for anyone in any position.  Work isn't a punishment or a reward.  It is simply a catalyst.  Not only can you move up in your current place of business, but it also opens you up to opportunities to try new things outside of work.   A lot of your sense of self will continue to develop throughout your 20s, so it's totally normal to feel overwhelmed.  Just take it one step at a time, don't be afraid to ask a million questions, and be thinking about where you want to be in five years.  If staying in the company for a  year works, great.

{"fg4q6ex": {"text": "First off, I should note that happiness is not the best sentiment to apply to your job.  You know what makes me happy? My hobbies.  My friends.  My family.  My job is a means to get to enjoy those things.   I don't hate my job.  I'm not miserable.  I am thankful for it.  Is it my dream job? Nope. But it's good money, it's flexible, and it's stable.  Yes, it is normal in your early 20s to have some anxious/insecure feelings fresh out of college.   But I got my first job temping in a corporate office at 18 and I've never regretted that experience.  Retail, on the other hand, made me want to use a cheese grater on my forehead.  That's just me and I recognize that some people have a passion for customer service.  That's great.  I'm glad they do.  But your anxieties about your new job sounds more like a self-esteem/insecurity issue more so than you actually hating the new job.   If that's the case, then no.  I do not think it would be wise to forgo this opportunity to return to what you know.  Retail may be a safe option now, but staying in your comfort zone will not help you grow.   And unless you're aiming to be a manager, then there's not much point in staying at a retail position.  I recommend, as someone who entertained corporate America at a very young age with a heavy dose of GAD and insecurities, that you stay in this new position for at least a year.   As you learn new skills, establish relationships and rapport, and grow within the company, you may find that your attitude has changed.  In fact, unless it's a toxic work environment, I can almost promise you that it will change.  You can grow into a competent, reliable employee and that will open up several doors for you in the future.   And say that after a year you find that it is still not for you, the good news is that retail positions are relatively easy to find if you choose to go back.  By contrast, these opportunities like the one you have now are NOT easy to find.   It would be smarter for you to do a job in a respected company for a year and have that on your resume than for you to continue to work in retail and try to break back into your current market.   Getting older is not a death sentence nor is taking on a more adult position.  You will still see your friends.  You will still go out.  You will still have hobbies.  And you will have better resources at your fingertips to do those things.  I'm 30 and I feel more optimistic and happy now than I ever did at 22 (even with GAD).  If I want to watch a Disney movie, I'll watch one.   I just watch it with a glass of wine now instead of a juice box.  Life is exciting. I don't know why you think that choosing this job is going to rob you of your youth.  If anything, it will give you more opportunities.

There's no since in comparing grades with anyone else but yourself.   If you get a bad grade, then focus on what you can do to improve it in the future.   Talk to your physics teacher about your struggles.  Any good teacher will take the time to help you and want you to succeed.   You can also talk to your guidance counselor for some advice/tips too.   Try to remember that while these season of your life is important, it also represents a very small portion of your life as a whole.   Five years from now, no one is going to care that you weren't able to solve a physics problem that your friend could.  It's hard to explain until you get there, but trying to keep perspective can be important.   A bad grade means there's room for improvement, it doesn't mean it's the end of the world or that you have no future.   Look at it as a new challenge rather than a set back.

{"fg0m2lg": {"text": "Yes.  You can.  I manage mine without medication now.  But it does take work.  In reference to the negative thoughts, it is extremely important to recognize your triggers.  Does spending too long on social media cause you to feel more anxious?  If so, it would be best to limit it.   Does being a particular situation make you feel panicky?  Recognize it ahead of time and plan accordingly -- even if you plan includes medication.  Many people think of anxiety as this unpredictable beast that drops onto us, but in truth, there are certainly patterns with it.   For example, I noticed that my anxiety can creep up if I'm lacking in sleep, close to my cycle (as a woman), and eating more processed food.  Any number of these combinations can make it more difficult for me to overcame the stuff in my brain.  So...I acknowledged it and addressed it.   I exercise, I eat healthier (sugar and processed food can increase anxiety), and I get my sleep back on track.  I focus on things I'm grateful for and I breathe deeply.  Sometimes I'll wrap up in a warm cozy blanket and sip some tea while I read.  When your anxiety is on the edge, you do not want to engage in a stressful activity (no social media or action-packed video games).  Turn on some classical music, take a walk, read a book, listen to a podcast -- do something that is good for your mind.   Something that will feed it and calm it down.  Hit pause.  Even if it's only for five minutes each day.  Pausing and meditating when you find the storm is beginning to build can be huge.  Track your mood, diet, and activity level for a few months and see what you find.   It doesn't have to be too detailed, just generally what you're noticing.  I'm betting that you will recognize a pattern to your anxiety too and then you can take steps to manage it, as needed.   It can be several steps, but it is doable!

I will walk three miles barefoot on hot coals to avoid it.  But there is a distinct difference is being argumentative and not being a pushover.   Not allowing your coworkers to boss you around isn't creating conflict, it's establishing that you are not a person who can be pushed around.  I don't know your exact scenario, but if one of your coworkers is trying to get you to do something just say, \"Hey, I'm actually really busy right now.  Can someone else do it?\" And leave it at that.   If you need to be more direct, then say,\" Nope.  I'm not going to do that.  I have my own stuff to finish.\"  Again, that's not creating conflict.  It's establishing a boundary.  If they tease you for standing up, laugh it off and make a joke at your own expense.  Something like, \"Yep, I'm finally finding my voice\" with a chuckle should be enough.  The worst thing you can do is get defensive.  If people know that you can take a joke, then you will not be a target.  Obviously if any of this passes over to actual bullying, then HR should get involved.  But hopefully you can get through it without too much tension. As for the argumentative friend, the next time she tries to stomp you out say *calmly* \"You've made a lot of good points that I want to think about.  Can we talk about this again later? \"  A few things can happen here.  If she agrees, you have time to process you thoughts and formulate a stronger argument.  If you find that either she disagrees and wants to continue or she agrees but wants to drown you out again, then stop the argument.  There's no sense in continuing.  It's not productive.  \"Well, I don't think we're going to get anywhere on this subject.  Can we talk about something else?\"   She might still be in a rage, but just continue to be calm.  There are going to be people in your life with whom you cannot have a healthy debate with and she may be one of them if she simply wants to bulldoze anyone who disagrees with her.

So it's been a long road of trying various SSRIs and hating them.  Then being taken off of them.  I changed my diet/ lifestyle, began recognizing my triggers, and read \"Dare: The New Way to End Anxiety and Stop Panic Attacks.\"  I tracked my mood and found that my anxiety spiked during certain instances.  While this was happening (2017- Sept 2019), I did have a prescription for Xanax which I would take when things got bad, but no SSRIs.   Honestly, I was tired of doctors seeing me as a prescription that needed filling.  When a psychiatrist wrote me a prescription for Lexapro after I told her numerous times that I didn't want it, I through it away and never went back to her.  Fast forward to Sept 2019 and I have some lab work ordered by a new doctor.  I get it done and find that there is a huge overgrowth of dysbiotic bacteria in my gut called citrobacter freundii.  If you're unaware, 90% of your seratonin is produced in your gut and the bad bacteria is strong enough to inhibit this and cause other issues.  I went through a powerful antibiotic to kill off said bacteria and then began taking a probiotic to rebuild the good bacteria.  The doctor's theory was that if the bad bacteria could be killed off, then perhaps my gut could began to produce its own normal levels of seratonin again.   It seems to be working.  I haven't had an attack since then and overall feel much better.  There are still things I'm figuring out, but overall I'm feeling very optimistic about things.  I still track my mood and didn't have the anxiety spikes like I usually do.  There are times where I got stressed, but it was manageable.  Progress has been great so far.

So when my husband and I began to go on our first few days, a rumor was spread around the office that she and him had slept together.   Now, anyone who knows my husband and the woman in question would immediately know this was just a dumb rumor.  But I was completely taken in by it.  We had to keep our relationship a secret because of HR policies, but this girl would stroll around the office talking about how she was going to move in with my husband, etc.  (We worked for the same company, but he was long distance in a satellite office.  We met before he moved).   It burned me up inside.  I would call him crying and angry about it.   Or send him a lengthy email about it because it's easier for me to convey my thoughts in writing.   I still have those emails.   In them, my husband was admittedly confused about why I was feeling the way that  I was because as far as he was concerned, she was just an attention-seeking coworker.   That said, he did everything he could possibly do to make me feel secure -- even as far as blocking her on social media,  etc.  Eventually, I left the office and later, so did he.

We were feeding her Acana at the time and shortly after that, the FDA released the information about DCM and Acana was the top food on their list.  It made me sick to learn that, after losing her, because I may have been able to prevent it with a simple food change.  She was, by all accounts, healthy.  She went to the vet in October and passed in January.  I have a video of us playing fetch with her the night before she passed.   I got her in high school and went through college, marriage, etc. with her.  When we decided to get a new puppy, I was paranoid about what to feed her.   I found a food that didn't contain any of the controversial ingredients, but she hated it.  I ended up having to add stuff to it and even then, she would leave some in her bowl.  It made more sense to make her own food.  Now I know exactly what she's getting and she absolutely loves it.", "link_id": "t3_erxy0d", "time": 1579808525}}

There's no question that Americans on average are incredibly privileged.   I personally don't love our tap water as it's incredibly chlorinated and use the refrigerator or a Brita pitcher.  Both of these things are readily available to me.  I don't turn my nose up at my tab water, but if I had my preference, I'd drink something different.  That's just the reality.  As a kid, I drank from the tab and even from the water hose because that's what we had.  That said, if I was in the middle of the desert and dying of thirst, I wouldn't care where the water came from because water is a basic need.   If she was desperate, the hun is this post would also cease to be picky.   On the flip side,  if the people who suffer now had water readily available over a long period of time and were given different kinds of water, they'd develop preferences too.

{"fefoj0t": {"text": "I've heard the \"You look tired\" comments before too.  As tempting as it is to tell them to shove it (though you should take it up with HR), there are steps you can take to look more alert.  As someone already suggested, a light peach corrector underneath your concealer may help to reduce darkness.  You can also use a highlight color on the inner corner of your eyes and line your waterline with a nude color pencil.   Mascara can also help your eyes look awake and alert. Rimmel has a great nude pencil.  I use it myself.  Colourpop also has an option.  NYX had a peach cream corrector. LA girl/Maybelline both have liquid peach corrector.  Out of curiosity, have you tried skipping the primer?  Some primers, in my opinion, do the opposite of what they claim.  I've spent way too much money buying primers only to have my makeup separate and break down.  Nowadays, I use a Korean sunscreen and my foundation.  That's it.  It sounds like the combination is causing the makeup to break down.  It's worth a shot to figure out a good combo for your skin.  I hope things get better for you.

Speaking from experience, Shih Tzus can be chameleons.  My first baby (RIP my sweet angel) was born a striking brindle and white pup with a pronounced white stripe on her forehead.   The forehead stripe disappeared first.  Then her coat changed from a muddled swirl of browns and blacks to an actual tiger stripe pattern.  As she grew even older, the stripes were gone completely and her coat (not the white part) could've been mistaken for solid black.  Our current Tzu was a solid black puppy at the time of birth, saved for a white mark on her chest.  She will be three this month and the white mark has been gone for years.  Also, additional shades of brown and white have been sprinkled in her fur.
