{"ftiuf4h": {"text": "Not exactly more relevant. More so that God spoke in bits and pieces at first and through the Hebrew Scriptures. The revelation of who God is and his relationship to humanity is slowly revealed rather than said all at once. In Jesus, God reveals himself fully and definitively. Specifically, God reveals himself through Jesus and the scriptures testify to him. Jesus himself is the revealed word of God. The bible (and the tradition) testify to Jesus. The bible testifies in an inspired and authoritative capacity but it isn\u2019t itself the revelation. Jesus is the means and content of God\u2019s message to humanity. Also, depending on your flavour, scripture and tradition witness of Jesus and so do philosophy and/or personal experience and/or saints &amp; mystics and/or non-Christian religion (in some capacity) and/or the theory of evolution and/or you get it.

{"fc16fpr": {"text": "Definitely a patch behind. They changed the attrition system significantly (and improved it in my view). Armies carry food with them. Units vary on their food storage and consumption but the gist of it is that they don\u2019t carry much.An army in a province will forage off the land if they are below supply cap and it won\u2019t lower their stored food. Whenever an army is above the supply cap of a province, they eat stored food rather than forage off the land. The rate of food consumption is based on the units and is modified by how far they are over supply cap. If an army is above supply cap and out of food, attrition kicks in and kicks in hard. The first point of significance is that a surging army will need stored food so it\u2019s possible for an army to run out of food and need to abandon a siege of they\u2019re there too long. Also, there\u2019s subtleties but the gist of it is that it\u2019s easier to load up on food in friendly territory and it does come out of the food supply of the province. A new unit has been added called a supply train (donkey). They\u2019re completely useless in combat but carry a huge amount of food. A garrison or defensive army could get away without donkeys but offensive operations would be difficult quickly. I really like the new system. It gives you the option of completely blowing past supply limits so long as you\u2019ve prepared adequately.

Things like the Grand Jury Report in Pennsylvania snow that the Church was well aware of what was happening, even keeping records, but did not engage civil authorities or allow things to come to light. There was a mentality of cover up and shut up. This all happened AFTER the Council tried to get the Church to engage with society as equal partners and be more self-reflective on her faults. The Church before the Council described itself as a \u201cPerfect Society\u201d (actual theological term). There is a centuries long history of the Church trying to be above secular laws and not subject to them. Divine things are more important than earthly things. Divine laws are more important than earthly laws. Something to keep on mind is that although the texts of the Mass could be changed overnight and we could renovate churches, it takes a lot longer for an institutional culture to shift. The bishops of the 70s and 80s (when most of the cover ups happened) had all been priests in the 40s and 50s (when their mentors instilled the mentality to cover up). We sometimes think of the sex abuse crisis as being something of the \u2018old, closed, pre-Council Church\u2019 but most of it (that we know about) happened in the less restrained, more open Church of the 70s and 80s. If the new, open, anti-clerical, dialogue-friendly Church tried to cover things up at all costs with total disregard to the victims, then the pre-Conciliar Church would have been worse. The Church has done tons of work to have policies for safe environments. (I work in a Church and will attest that they are thorough). A Catholic parish in 2018 is actually a very safe place for a child. A Catholic parish in 1978 was an unbelievable unsafe place.

{"e1q2tp8": {"text": "Looking for a Catholic wedding but haven't been to Mass in... forever? I'm your guy. Here's a few tips. This will likely be buried and nobody will read it but maybe someone will luck out.  Your first stop as far as churchy stuff goes is your local parish. By local, I mean whatever parish is nearest to where you live. Don't bother going to your old hometown or your parents parish or anything like that. You'll just get referred to your local parish. You are NOT required to have your wedding in that local parish but you do have to have all your paperwork and prep stuff done in that parish. Most priests prefer that you talk to the church before setting. Pretend that your date is tentative or plead ignorance that you should have gone to Father first. Admit to Father that you haven't read a church bulletin since 2002. Most priests aren't assholes so most priests will be fine. You are not required to have a Mass. A wedding Mass is about 90 minutes and a wedding without Mass is like 45. If you're not a regular at Mass, avoid having a Mass for your wedding because not knowing the responses and the like can be a downer on what deserves to be a great day. If your Catholic grandmother cannot fathom a wedding outside of Mass, she'll be even more out of sorts if everybody fumbles through the Mass because she's the only one who regularly attends. If your fiance is not Catholic, mention that early. It's not a big deal but its' a bit of paperwork so let Father get ahead on that one rather than have to rush it. If either of you have been married previously, tell Father right away. It's not a deal-breaker but there's a process and letting Father know early will help everything be in place in time for the 'tentative' date. Catholic wedding rituals can be pretty strict about what stuff is allowed and what stuff is not. It's easier not to fight with Father and make yourselves miserable. If there is a ritual which is deeply important to you but Father doesn't want it (sand ceremony, a particular song, etc), consider moving it to the reception to avoid the fight. Catholic weddings are pretty rigid but the reception is all yours. ", "link_id": "t3_8vpz83", "time": 1530633895}}

{"dxszt5h": {"text": "Some Christian philosophers make a distinction between natural evil and moral evil. Moral evil is rational beings doing evil things. Natural evil is the death and suffering which is just part of life on earth. Cancer, hurricanes, and animals eating each other is natural evil. It does not have a moral cause or consequence. It just happens. As for why God does not stop a child\u2019s cancer, there are different approaches to the question. If you presume that the child is morally innocent and after dying will have an endless experience of infinite pleasure and joy, then the pain of cancer is relatively so small that it\u2019s trivial. The bigger thing to say though is that depending on religious tradition, pain and evil are not the same thing. People do not suffer because they are evil and they are not spared from pain because they are good. The Bible is fairly aware of this (book of Job in particular). There\u2019s actually a strong current that physical and mental suffering can, if we respond right, lead us toward greater spiritual health ", "link_id": "t3_8e4tjp", "time": 1524443684}}

When you get into areas with more Episcopalians, Presbyterians, etc., there are more options for liberals so the Evangelical communities lost those people and reflect more the ones who are too conservative for the mainline churches. I\u2019ve noticed that effect with Catholics that when a very conservative/traditionalist parish starts in kind of sucks in the traditionalists from the whole surrounding area and they all become more liberal because of it.

{"duedrz2": {"text": "I spent 4 years in seminary but did not finish or get ordained. 3 years were graduate studies (with a few undergrad philosophy and language courses mixed in). 1 year was a spiritual retreat. In my studies we had 8 courses on the scriptures. In the synoptic gospels course we spent a fair amount of time on the synoptic problem and our professor presented a variety of hypotheses on them. I don\u2019t quite remember them all. The two source (Mark &amp; Q) had the most time but there were others suggesting Matthean priority. It\u2019s been a few years and I\u2019ve forgotten many details. The most \u2018interesting\u2019 was a hypothesis of Matthew and Luke being roughly contemporary and having many similar sources. Matthew and Luke had respective places with Jewish mad Gentile Christian communities and Mark being composed later as a merging of the two to relieve the Jewish-Gentile pressures in early Christian communities. Interesting for its novelty more than it\u2019s persuasiveness. It was never even discussed that the four gospels were written solely by the four persons they are named after in tradition. Similarly, with the Pentateuch we made passing reference to the idea that Moses wrote it and then got into JEPD. There were require counselling courses. I didn\u2019t get to them because I didn\u2019t finish so I don\u2019t feel like I can say much on it. I will say however that the general sentiment about counselling was to refer people to specialists whenever needed and not exceed your training or competence. My scriptures professor was quite clear about the project for seminary academics. I don\u2019t remember the exact phrasing but roughly, a person without faith will do religious studies as an outsider and that is a legitimate and important academic discipline. They cannot however do theology proper because they cannot engage it as a person of faith. In theology schools, students are expected to approach things from the vantage point of faith so they can only do theology and cannot do religious studies because they cannot have an academic neutrality toward the material. A serious theologian has an obligation to respond to and make use of every tool and insight available from religious studies and other fields because those fields are legitimate whether or not they approach with faith. Practically what that means is that a theology student should be exposed to everything a secular university would teach on those subjects and engage with them seriously and critically as legitimate conversation partners.

{"dsfbhmb": {"text": "This got crazy long. TL:DR 1) less old, white, European men2) Greek and Latin got swapped for more \u201crelevant\u201d languages3) Humanities shifted focus from preserving heritage to questioning heritageClassical education has a strong emphasis on European thought and experience. To put it more sharply, the vast majority of thinkers and authors in the classical curriculum are white European men. There have been various movements in universities to try to incorporate views from non-Europeans, from women, and from people of colour. Since curriculum is finite, that had all come at the expense of losing the classical authors. Trying to have \u2018diversity\u2019 in curricula had had various effects and evaluations of it differ sharply and passionately. I do not intent to pass judgment on this process one way or another, just to point out that the three goals of more women, more persons of colour, and more non-Europeans all reduced the classical content in universities. The major languages for classical education are Greek and Latin. Once there were fewer Greek and Latin authors in the curriculum, these were not perceived as having as much value. My own conjecture is that learning Latin is like having a fax machine: it\u2019s viable so long as everybody else has one too. As soon as some schools abandoned Latin it hit a tipping point and it was gone form 90% of the programs. Depending one how you define \u201cuseful\u201d in regard to languages, Latin can be far from useful. (Full disclosure, I studied Greek in my undergrad then Latin at seminary. Loved it. But I get the perspective of shifting away from it) A third trend is the shift away from Liberal Arts as cultivation of the Good in a person towards vocational training. Most universities lost all their aspiration to form good and refined people and shifted toward forming employable people. That is, except the humanities. The humanities used to be about preserving a cultural heritage. It transformed into being about questioning and rejecting every possible norm. That\u2019s at least what I understand of it. It\u2019s a mixed bag. Some good has come from the developments of the last 50 years but we\u2019ve collectively lost a great deal as well. I think it\u2019s possible to balance a classical education with incorporating some of the legitimate insights from feminism, Marxism, etc but I may be alone and crazy in that proposition.

In the mix of things I became Catholic and started slowly piecing together what faith is amid mental illness. A year or two ago I\u2019d run into something about the cilice and it instantly appealed to me.

I would even take those as optional due to illness for a few years until you\u2019re certain and comfortable that you\u2019re doing things with sincere intent.

A caveat should be made to a paradigm shift in revelation what with the coming of Jesus, but for revelation prior to the earthly life of Jesus, most Evangelicals I know are \u201cscripture or nothing\u201d. In that mindset, it\u2019s internally consistent in the theology to see the 400 years before Christ as divine silence and then explore the question of the significance of that silence.
