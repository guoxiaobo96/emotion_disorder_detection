Should I get over it? Of course, there's nothing I can do about it and we're all in this together. But should I not be able to even talk about it to my friends? That seems unfair. If you were my friend, I would be even more frustrated and feel even more isolated if you shut my venting down because- I have no room to talk when others are making such huge sacrifices.

It's very possible you've been experiencing hypo/ mania for a while over the years and just didn't recognize it. It's also possible you're being misdiagnosed right now. I'd definitely talk more with your pdoc about your doubts, but they ARE right that SSRI induced mania only happens in Bipolar patients.

{"fgfrjuo": {"text": "Yes, SSRI induced mania ONLY happens to Bipolar patients. To explaine this complicated issue VERY simplistically, think of it this way: let's say \"normal\" people operate at a level 5 (and 5 is ideal), depressed people at a level 0, and Bipolar people range from 0-10 (5+ being manic/ hypo). SSRI's bring depressed people up to 5, but for people with Bipolar, say you're, it would push you to 10. \"Normal\" people wouldn't take it because they're at the ideal 5, and depressed people can't go past 5, but someone with Bipolar can go from 0-10 NATURALLY, so the SSRI can cause the increase from 5-10 or 0-10. People with Bipolar should only take SSRI's if they have another medication to also treat the mania, as the SSRI ONLY treats the depression. If you \"remove\" the depression for a non-Bipolar person, they're just left with their \"normal\" self. If you \"remove\" the depression in a Bipolar patient, they're left with mania (as that's the other half of their \"normal\" self). Also serotonin syndrome causes mostly physical symptoms, NOT mania. My SSRI treatment caused me to be extremely manic: super high energy, racing thoughts, no sleep for days, impulsive trips, hypersexuality, and when I had a night of heavy drinking, I was plunged back into depression and tried to kill myself (this happened multiple times). I lost 60lbs in 3 months, because I had so much energy I was running 5 miles a day (after being overweight my whole life), along with basically starving myself, because I'd be too hyped to eat. I was very productive at my job and even got promoted. After several years of this almost constant state of mania (followed by huge drops back into depression, then bouncing right back up), I was finally hospitalized and diagnosed properly. I'm not a psychiatrist, so I can't tell you why yours diagnosed you with mania, and it's possible you were manic AND had serotonin syndrome. I know from my own experience it's really hard to tell when I'm manic (or sometimes even that I was manic), because I feel pretty fantastic during those times (like most people do when they're manic). Feeling awesome, but having impulsive, often detrimental  behaviors (that many of us write off), is a pretty solidly manic in a nut shell.", "link_id": "t3_ey8klt", "time": 1580746005}}

Even just saying, \"mom, I know this is scary for you, and I'm scared too, but I need help, and I can't do it alone\" could go a long ways in helping her see the truth. I know health care and finances are a hurtle when getting care, but I would say your number 1 priority right now is finding a GOOD therapist. And I highlight \"good\" meaning, someone that works for YOU. That was really hard for me, and discouraging, it took years, but once I found one, it made a HUGE difference. I had to go outside my insurance and it's expensive, but totally worth it. Of course that isn't always an option, but just don't stop until you find a good fit. Meds are hugely important, stay on them, even though they suck. You'll have bad side effects, and it may take several tries to find the right meds &amp; dosages. If you're experiencing really severe side effects, go to your doctor asap, but never stop cold turkey, that could make things infinitely worse. It will get better. Just remember that even though life is hard, and usually much harder for us than other people, there are people who support you and can relate to your struggle.

You should just remind her that you're still her amazing child, you're just struggling with a sickness. The best way for her to help you is to realize that you're NOT normal, that sometimes your thoughts, emotions and actions will be out of your control, but that doesn't change who you are. You need a good psychiatrist, a good therapist, and time and patience to find the right meds. You WILL have bad side effects, but stick with it and keep trying until you find something that works. Let her know that you need her in your corner, even if she doesn't get it. Honestly, I've been diagnosed for 11 years, and my parents are super supportive, and even they don't really understand. Going to family therapy really helps. My therapist is often able to articulate things that I can't in a way that makes sense to someone without any experience with mental illnesses. This is as scary and awful for her as it is for you, she loves you and doesn't want to see you struggling, especially when she feels helpless to assist you. The eggshell walking will (hopefully) pass in time, she needs to process and come to terms with your illness just like you do. My best advice overall is to find a good therapist, and don't go off your meds! It takes time, both to know if your meds are working, and to find a good therapist that you can relate to, but don't give up!

While BPD and Bipolar have lots of overlapping symptoms (and people can suffer from both) they're inherently different in both causes and treatment. People also don't realize that personality disorders are basically behaviors that are learned and ingrained based on their negative life experiences, so medication often doesn't help, where as mood disorders are chemical imbalances that can be improved with medication. There's just so many misconceptions out there! Many JustNo people probably suffer from different mental illnesses, but it took my Dr's 20 years to finally diagnose me, and another 5 to find the right meds, so I don't think random people are qualified to say definitively what someone has based on a few stories, especially if they don't understand the differences between different mental disorders. Even people who have the same disorder can require different treatments and reactive extremely differently to similar situations. I think the first step towards battling stigmas is knowledge.
