Finally for three months constant suicidal thoughts stopped. Even took up running for a month. It took me 10 years to acknowledge that something is wrong with me mentally.

I was physically abused by a  relative at a party around that time. I don't know  when the thought started but they might have been  a trigger. I treated them as normal seeing my father always saying those things. I was a very introverted and secretive as a child. My parents never knew what was going on in my mind my friends even less.  So I never told my parents about the abuse but it ate me up. I turned 17 failed to to get into medical school I tried to kill myself by  overdosing on my father's sleeping pills. A year later I tried again this time  it was to escape the debilitating suicidal thoughts, the mood swings, all that pain. I just wanted an escape . My parents and my brother were heartbroken and made me promise to never do it again .After that 10 years of pain ups and downs extreme suicidal thoughts . I spent months planning suicide treating suicide as a backup plan but never doing it just because I was scared to fail again and face my family. I researched percentage of suicide survival. Later on I just wanted to stop existing. It all went downhill last year I could not even get up from my bed.  I moved in with my parents spent 2  months lying in my bed not sleeping properly not eating at all. My parents dragged me to see the psychiatrist and he diagnosed me bipolar. I didn't believe him went to second one who said the same thing. I was against the meds I never took them seeing the side effects my father had.  My parents forced  this time to take meds. I am on them right now after years of constant suicidal thoughts my brain is silent now. I still doubt my diagnosis though.
