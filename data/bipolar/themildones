While all this was happening, I was staying with my aunt because I wasn't old enough to be in the ICU.

It was my nana, saying something like she was feeling better, she loved her (my mom), and to come up to the hospital to see her. My mom went to the hospital, and as soon as she got there the doctor told her my nana had passed away a few minutes before, without regaining consciousness or having any brain activity.

I saw on your comments that you have 2 kids, so it's going to be harder for you, but it is possible to start to like parenting. Setting up a schedule helped me a lot, and making sure you have time to yourself. After the kids go to bed, take an hour or two to say 'fuck housework, I'm going to relax'. Fuck folding laundry. If your 3 year old is still waking up at night for cuddles or anything other than bathroom trips, send her back to bed. Be strict about it and don't give in. If s/he's throwing food during mealtimes, make it clear that s/he isn't getting more food. Maybe start weaning your 8 month old--you've done great to make it that far, but now you need some separation or you're going to go nuts. If you have a partner, tell them you need them to step up. You work 24/7, so even if they work full-time outside the home they still need to pitch in. Have them do bedtime, or dinner, or the dishes. Just *something* to take some of the pressure off you. If you can, get a babysitter at least one day a week and use *at least* half of that time to do whatever it is you want to do--not housework or errands. Can you put the 3 year old in preschool? That would help with the load immensely, and give you some one-on-one time with the younger one.And maybe, since you know you're depressed, see a therapist. Maybe psych meds, if you and your doc think it's necessary. I've been exactly where you are (or almost exactly, since I only have 1 kid), but I promise it gets better.

I went back to school and am working from home, which is nice because I get to watch kiddo all day. My ideal Christmas is a day spent playing and relaxing. I like an easy dinner so there isn't a lot of cleanup and I can focus on family. I usually end up making a big breakfast-for-dinner or an easy crockpot meal.

I debated on saying what I'm about to say, because I don't want it to come across as crass or scare you even more. but I think it might help you, so here goes. I miscarried for the first time in December 2016 at about 5 weeks. I found out I was pregnant again in May. I was super excited, but yes, I was scared too. I was trying to avoid all thought of miscarrying or even any negative thoughts at all. My SO sat me down a few days later and told me I needed to face the fact that it was possible it might happen again, because if I didn't, it would hit me even harder (he's been through this multiple times with other partners, so he felt he was speaking from experience). I ended up miscarrying a few days later at about 7 weeks. and while it was awful, and I wanted my baby back, and I felt all the same feelings I had felt with the first miscarriage...it wasn't as bad. My SO was right: by addressing the fact that I might miscarry again, and thinking about how I would handle it, it didn't hit me like a ton of bricks or take me by surprise like it had the first time. I still grieved, but it wasn't a full-blown depression that left me unable to get out of bed for days at a time like the first one did. I was able to find some comfort in the fact that at least now the first baby wasn't alone, that she had a sibling with her now.So, I guess what I'm saying is...you need to face the fact that while not likely, it is possible that it could happen again. that being said, though, don't be expecting it to happen, because it *is* unlikely. According to the Mayo clinic, only 1% of women have two or more miscarriages. I hope this makes some kind of sense. Feel free to PM me if you want.", "link_id": "t3_78th1e", "time": 1509067281}}

He'd show me some steamy texts he'd been exchanging every now and then, and it was fine; I really wasn't jealous and I was glad he was having fun and was at least somewhat being satisfied when I couldn't help him.Then he came home and told me he was leaving me for someone else. He hadn't even had sex with her yet, but had met her while looking for a FWB. And now he's gone.I'm not at all saying that open marriages are bad. I think, if he had been happy with the rest of our marriage like I was (and maybe had been more mature, who knows), it could have worked. I really do believe 100% that I would have been okay with it; I am not at all a jealous person and I've had FWBs before.

A few hours later I went to the bathroom to pee and felt something come out. It didn't hurt much, just a twinge; mostly it just felt very strange. I looked down and saw what looked kind of like a little, tiny seahorse. I knew immediately what had happened, but kept doubting myself because I thought miscarriages always hurt and you always bled a ton first. I knew the hospital couldn't do anything for me if it was a miscarriage, but I wanted to know for sure if it was or not. I went the next day, and they tested me. My HCG was 6, and anything above a 5 is a pregnancy. I had started bleeding shortly after I passed the baby, and it continued for a little over a week (my periods are usually only about 3 days, so this was significant for me). It honestly really messes with me that I bled so little and it hadn't hurt nearly as bad as I've heard other women usually experience. I feel like it was too easy. I lost my baby and had hardly any physical sign of it. I should be grateful, but it makes me feel like when I tell people about it, they'll say it wasn't a big deal because I wasn't far along and it 'didn't even hurt' (which I have heard once already, and I haven't even told very many people).I hadn't announced I was pregnant yet because I was waiting for the first ultrasound. But once I miscarried, I felt like my baby was going to be forgotten, and that terrified me. I decided to name him/her something gender neutral and announced it. I immediately felt much better. I also got a few things to remember her (I have no idea if it was a boy or girl, but I choose to think of her as a girl) by, which helps a lot.", "link_id": "t3_602jcx", "time": 1489842053}}
