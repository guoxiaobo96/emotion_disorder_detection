Both awake and asleep (sleep paralysis.) during the day and at night. This went on until we were older teenagers. You can put this down to early development of mental illness, but only I developed anxiety and depression. My sister has had no problems. Both my parents also experienced paranormal events happening in the same house in the same time period. There is no history of mental illness in my mother\u2019s family. Things still happen now and again, and other people not related to my family have seen things in the same house too.So there has been no real, definitive connection in relation to mental health with everyone involved.I believe there are things in our world/universe we have yet to discover, or may never discover.OP, if your daughter believes this happened to her, please believe her and keep an eye on her.

Put my head under the covers nearly crying and peeked out maybe 5 seconds later and it was gone. It was like yours; as if it was startled by me waking up and just vanished.All my family have seen it in the same room at different times. That room had a different feeling to it though. Like it was a room full of energy and thick air. After my parents decorated, opened up the old fireplace (house is over 150 years old) I started hearing disembodied voices. Once it was all plastered up, it stopped. The room now feels light and airy like the other bedrooms. My point is, it\u2019s like these beings/spirits are attached to the building. It\u2019s usually negative energy they give out until someone or something does something to cleanse the place and/or make them move on.Keep talking about it because it seems to be the best way to understand what happened.", "link_id": "t3_ck25lj", "time": 1564571248}}
