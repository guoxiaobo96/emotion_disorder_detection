As far as I know, they cannot last forever or induce a heart attack in an otherwise healthy person. That being said, in the midst of one especially, my brain attaches to those thoughts and if I don\u2019t use coping mechanisms it worsens the attack. For me personally, I also have these worries sometimes in the form of very intrusive thoughts that I have trouble ignoring or getting under control. This unfortunately can lead to more panic attacks. I also struggle with anxiety around not being able to hide or escape so that others won\u2019t see my panic happening. These symptoms are definitely something you should speak with your doctor about, even if they are not a psych professional. I waited way too long to talk to a Dr about my problems and just did my best to hide them. I truly wish I had talked to a Dr years ago. After being diagnosed with Bipolar and more properly medicated, my panic (along with other symptoms) is much more manageable.

For example, Xanax does zero for me as a panic attack abortive, even though it is very helpful for most people.My GP said I had a mixed episode, the story follows, but feel free to skip it if that answers your question.I felt like I made a major mistake, which is a trigger for me. I got my kids to school on time for the first day of school, but not early enough to walk them to their classroom. I had told them I would, and we walk together on the first day every year. Sounds minor right? Well, my brain got really, really loud and overwhelming with disturbing, intrusive thoughts. Up until then, I was \u2018handling\u2019 those thoughts, and hadn\u2019t let on what I was dealing with. I had to pull over because intrusive thoughts quickly turned to the overwhelming urge to hurt myself. I started to have a panic attack and was getting very confused. Luckily, there was a gas station I could pull into.I sat there until the attack was over, and was terrified and horrified even after it was over. I vomited in their parking lot, and haven\u2019t been back since, because I\u2019m ashamed of having done that. Hopefully this isn\u2019t too figurative, and it was understandable. I have a lot of trouble explaining what my brain is doing when things go sideways, so I apologize if this sounds weird. I also feel guilty, even now, that something so minor threw me into this spiral. There were other stressors, but this was the straw for me, apparentlyAlso, if you need to go inpatient, then there is nothing wrong with that. I\u2019m not passing any judgment on that, and I hope my earlier comment didn\u2019t come across that way.", "link_id": "t3_d2ve17", "time": 1568232190}}
{"ezx2o02": {"text": "So, I was misdiagnosed as having Social Anxiety a long time ago, but after a horrible episode I nearly ended up inpatient. After going back through my history, and examining my current issues, I was diagnosed as bipolar. Looking back, I had a lot of symptoms that did not fit with SA alone. I either hid these, or downplayed them to the point that people either did not know or took weird stuff I did as eccentricity.After I was able to accept my diagnosis (this was insanely difficult at the time, and I initially thought the doctors were wrong), I did a lot of research. The more I researched the more I felt in control, and recognized myself and how I behaved in the literature. But, I was still all over the place throughout the first year after diagnosis. Lamictal has made a huge difference for me. I literally forget about some of my compulsions, that hasn\u2019t ever happened before this particular med.It took so long to get my meds right, but it was worth it. I know how hard it is to believe that the meds will actually help with anything, or that you\u2019ll ever get out of the hole you\u2019re in right now, but chances are, you can. My Doc insisted that I be very communicative about my meds, which was a God Send, because my meds got altered or changed when needed.You\u2019ll come through this, and things will get more manageable. I know it\u2019s so hard to believe right now but you are handling this and you will get it to a manageable place.

I also went off of it twice, once when I thought I didn\u2019t need it anymore, and once when I started trying to get pregnant. Boy was I wrong about not needing it that time. Going off of it was a horrible experience, the worst out of every SSRI I\u2019ve taken. I felt like I was losing my mind, and lost 40 lbs in three months.I only took Prozac for a few months, but it did nothing at all for me, though some people swear by it. Everyone is different, but if you go with Paxil, maybe take a look at general consensus online and see how you feel about it after weighing pros and cons. I\u2019m on three meds now, and doing much better on the mental health side, but none control the migraines.

Most of them were pretty intelligent, but we had a fair few that were very sweet but were on the shallow end of the gene pool where intelligence was concerned. At least one was hit by a car. Three disappeared (not at the same time), and my mother always assumed that Coyotes got them. When I moved out and adopted my own cat I decided that she would be indoor only. She was past her date at the pound when we got her (meaning closer to being put down). Though my Mother still thinks that it is mean to keep her inside, I feel like it is definitely a step up from being euthanized because our pound was overcrowded, and she is very loved and well cared for. My Mother still has outside cats (barn cats and inside/outside that come in at night), and I know many people who do. I made the decision to keep mine inside based on experience and I don\u2019t regret it. I just wanted to give my perspective on this choice, since TIL it seems to be a contentious issue.", "link_id": "t3_b2q4z9", "time": 1552999171}}

I was diagnosed with bipolar after I began having extremely intrusive thoughts especially while driving. Though, after discussing with the doctor, I had way more symptoms than I was comfortable admitting at the time. I normalized a lot of what was going on, especially my manic symptoms. This basically scared me enough that after a very bad panic attack, I called my doctor. I hid a lot of symptoms under the guise of \u2018keeping it together.\u2019 It was very hard to explain all this to my doctor, even though I trust her, but I honestly wish I had done it sooner. Things aren\u2019t perfect right now, but addressing this has made things a great deal better in my life. It helps if you are lucky enough to have a doctor you trust. They are still adjusting my medications but I have already seen a big improvement, and I\u2019m sorry that was so long or if it veered off track.

It hurt, but I thought I was fine, and kept cleaning out my car. Then, my eye closed and suddenly there was blood everywhere. A friend took me to the ER, where they did a CT scan, checked the area around my eye for fractures, and stitched up the wound. When I initially hit my head, I immediately put my hand up to my face ( where the impact happened) there was no broken skin, or blood. This is why, for a moment, I went back to cleaning out my car. The ER doctor told me that the area I hit filled with blood so quickly that the skin stretched, then tore apart. We also found out later that I have ITP. This causes me to have less blood platelets, and excessive bleeding. I didn\u2019t know of this condition until I was almost thirty years old, I know other people who didn\u2019t know they were at risk of excessive bleeding until they were in their fifties. So I wondered about this throughout the doc. But, I fully realize I\u2019m looking at it through my personal experience, which may have no bearing on this situation.I\u2019m not sure if I 100% believe he\u2019s guilty, and I wondered if these avenues were explored. I\u2019d be interested to know her medical history prior to the incident. Had she ever had blood work that was even slightly indicative of low platelet counts, or any other disorder.

{"e0jvf60": {"text": "I do really like tulip trees, my grandmother had a yard full of them. Currently, there is a maple tree of some sort, off to the side in the front yard. I\u2019m assuming that it was planted when the subdivision was built, because many of the houses have a single maple in the front yard. There is also a peach tree that I planted two years ago, because I mistakenly thought it might get large enough to provide some shade. I will definitely look into trying to grow a tulip tree though. That is a great suggestion, and I really appreciate the link you posted. I will definitely start researching on that site as well. Thank you so much for your response!", "link_id": "t3_8qj4zg", "time": 1528823190}}

I\u2019m hoping if the migraine vacates that maybe it will get a little easier. I\u2019m only at about two and a half days of having quit, so not as far as you. Good job on getting through to four days! That\u2019s awesome.  I have quit before, for about a year, and I will say that in that time, those feelings did get better, so I think we do have hope of it getting easier.", "link_id": "t3_8qc1mb", "time": 1528751672}}
