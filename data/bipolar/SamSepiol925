They said all they could give me was benadryl and nothing worked at all until one day I started to fall asleep again. I also had many panic attacks during this month. It was bad. I've had my blood pressure get extremely high due and dizzy due to the anxiety and lack of sleep. I was so sleep deprived I couldn't tell dreams or sleep from reality. Didn't even know if I've slept or not. My memory was really shot. It was terrible and it still is right now too. I had this happen last week to me. It's very scary to me when things don't work. But the times when I really think I need benzos for anxiety and sleep or the benadryl for sleep I take it. Try turning down the lights, using twilight app for getting rid of blue light. Read a book before sleep. If you've tried all this, I recommend trying to listen to a story or something soothing that an app can tell you. I use calm sometimes or YouTube for rain sounds or relaxing binaural sounds. If those don't work then maybe workout but that's hard I know. I know exactly how awful you feel when you haven't slept for a long time. Your body is so tired you don't even want to eat and get out of bed at all. They all tell me is psychiatric for me but I feel like I'm like the main character in the book called Brain On Fire. Where no one can figure out really what's wrong with you so they just say its psychological. It sucks. I'm sorry this is happening to you. Go to the hospital if you think it's worth a shot and you feel really really terrible. Maybe they'll be better then the docs I saw. Anyway, I hope some of the tips I gave you will help you.

However, I do know how to cook fish, rice, chicken, pasta. I know how to make mantu (dumplings). I know how clean. I'm not stupid. I help my mom clean the house every time we might have guests come over. But my point was, I'm not a servant. I don't cook on command or whatever. I'm not serving my husband. I don't want a man that will always want me to make him food. I don't want a man that will ask if I've made when he comes home from work. I'll be coming home from work as well and would be tired. I have to cook while being exhausted just for him every time. How is that fair? Also, I will not want a man who will be waiting at the dinner table for me to put a plate in front of him. Some of my family is like this. I don't want a man that can't get off of his butt and go into the kitchen and put some food on his plate even if I have cooked it. I am not made as a woman to serve a man. God did not make me for that purpose. I'm sorry to disappoint. I have a part time job right now and trying to figure my life out. If I'm honest, I've been stuck with changing majors and being confused and indecisive about many things in my life for a while. I'm trying to fix all of that though. I know how to take care of myself. Yeah, I live with my parents but that doesn't mean I can't take care of myself. I don't need a man to take care of me if that's what you're asking. I'm not a child as you like to so nonchalantly put it. I'm an independent and will never bow down or submit to a man. I will never be submissive.

They just ignore your physical ailments the minute you tell them about having anxiety or anything else that's not physical. It really sucks.

In my experience, I have never been tested for a psychiatric illness. They always ask me to tell them my issues but I could be wrong. I could be downplaying them or I could be overexaggerating about them. The only illness I've had tested was for ADHD and perhaps I don't have it even though I believed I did at the time. Could my belief of having it make the result of the test a false positive. I feel like we shouldn't really trust ourselves with what's actually going on because sometimes a person seems aware but maybe they aren't or maybe they are exaggerating it or downplaying it or just talking out of their ass. I think I may have been overexaggerating or lying my symptoms. I haven't reached a diagnosis yet really but a lot of people suggest I have schizphrenia. These people also don't really know me but from what I tell the from what I've seen heard and felt from some physical being that I cannot see, they assume this is what I have. You cannot and should not be diagnosed with a mental disorder after seeing a psychiatrist for the first time in one hour. I was told I have bipolar disorder with psychotic features but another psychiatrist says otherwise because it just doesn't seem like the right fit for me. I just hate the cat and mouse game of trying to figure it out and then them telling you to take all these medications that MAY work. So it is trial and error. These are also medications that have lots of side effects too. I understand your point of view in all this, I just believe their is no real way to figure out if someone has a diagnosis x or a diagnosis z. A lot of the times they tend to be misdiagnosed and take medications that dont really help them much or at all and make their situation even worse. They start presenting news symptoms all because of the 2-3 or 4 medications that were given to them. One thing I want to know is, will it benefit me if i get an fmri or pet scan done? I have not been diagnosed with anything as of yet but they keep suggesting medications and I'm not willing to take them unless they have an actual diagnosis that matches my issues. I want their to be real evidence like a brain scan or something of that sort. Is their any way, where we can take a medical test that can determine if we have a mental illness? Taking medications and finding the right diagnosis without any medical tests is trial and error. It's just based off of what the patient tells the psychiatrist and or the therapist. It's also based on certain tests that they might do but they aren't nearly as accurate then a medical test that can determine which illness they most likely have.", "link_id": "t3_dwgwky", "time": 1573773653}}

I also have had a hard time keeping jobs due to no motivation or just quitting on an impulse and looking for another job. I mentioned to her at the end that I've had suicidal thoughts in the past. I told her about the horrible anxiety that I have and worry about nothing or worry about everything and anything. I also told her how I went to the hospital twice because of that this week. I also told her about the burning I was having in my chest and the rest of my body. She said it was all related to having bipolar disorder.

I got to the ER and my bp was 145/115 and heart rate was increasing to 130's. Had chest pain that would come and go. They did an EKG and all I read out sinus tachycardia so I think it was normal. I was so anxious I could barely lay still on the cot for even a minute. I seriously thought I'm going to die here. Then, I got to a room and my anxiety was getting worse. It wacjust all around bad but in the end they told me it was all Anxiety but still gave me meds for anxiety and high blood pressure. I've had acid reflux too. Please see a pcp or general doctor. Also, try and get copies of your lab work, if you had it done and the ekg as well as anything else you had done. This is so you can give it to any doctor you go to and also just have copies for yourself, it's good to have copies of these things. But please see a doctor and get a referral for a heart doctor.

She said \"you look good to me\" and disregarded as well as had disbelief when I told her the therapist told me to come here if I get worse. She literally corrected me when I said haven't slept for 20 days. She was like you have difficulty sleeping not no sleep at all. She literally though I was seeking attention. I left after she was done taking my vitals. Told the staff what she said was unacceptable and Im not here trying to seek attention. I was going to go to a different hospital but didn't because fuck it. Got home and my sister said the same thing. That I'm being a baby and freak out over little things. To see a specialist. I keep my stuff secret. But I had to tell her since she kept telling my parents I need to see a specialist. I told her I'm seeing a therapist, a psychiatrist, and a sleep doctor. She doesn't know shit but always thinks she does. She called me not normal as well as my family. Said she's the only normal one in the family. She doesn't understand how much I'm afraid of drugs, don't like hospitals, and get super anxious there. When I told her I'm seeing the sleep doctor soon she said you should've seen then sooner. It takes a while to see one. It's not someone I can just see right away. Anyway, I'm just done with this. I'm done with everything. No one takes me seriously and no one gives two shits.

I have issues with my sister too.Apparently giving my opinion about everything is bad. My family also tends to talk about my faults and issues all the time and when i mention their's it's a WAY bigger deal than mine. Another thing they do is if i do or say something wrong they point it out very clearly that I'm wrong and disrespectful but when they do it to me it's as if their brain gets rid of that memory of them hurting me in some way. Them yelling at me or saying mean things is as if it never happened in theirs heads. Then they're like i don't know what the hell is wrong with her. I don't know why she's so mad at me. I didn't do anything. It's so damn frustrating and I hate it. &amp;#x200B;My entire life my family has never understood me or my emotions. I used to not be sensitive but over time I think I became oversensitive. Anything they say to me that's really triggering makes me explode. Sometimes, I think my sister uses my issue of not being done with school and 25 and just messed up in all aspects of life as a tool to push my buttons. She literally mentioned it to her coworkers and then came home and talked about it with my mom over dinner then she told me and said something that really triggered me and can't remember what it was tbh.

I can't be myself either because they always think I think everything is about me but its not true. Only reason it seems that way is because they always talk about my issues and faults and when i react they literally say your issues are bigger than ours.

However, I got used to it and had an amazing teacher that was super nice and kind of helped me transition. We are here for you if you face any difficulty on this great journey you're going through. Any questions you have, I will try my best to answer. You can pm me whenever you want with questions or concerns or even to vent sister. :) I also came here to give you advice. Make sure you don't overwhelm with learning how to do so many things about Islam as well as our sect. Take it one step at a time so you don't fall into sin as well as burn yourself out. Another piece of advice I would give you is to make sure you always remember Allah (sbw) in everything you do, he's watching. In addition, please don't listen to Haram music intentionally and go to any gatherings that includes music and dancing. You also need to figure out who your marja is (Shia high ranking cleric, every Shia will have one). However, as I said before please do not overwhelm yourself since you're new. I would also suggest that you learn how to read ayatul kursi because it keeps you safe at all times. You can read the English version too. It's in Arabic but written in English. Whenever, you feel like you can learn some new things that will not stress you out, please learn the above things I suggested. It will definitely help you in the long run. Being firm in religion isn't always easy, remember that. Every Muslim struggles with committing sin and we all have fallen into those traps. No one is perfect. The mercy of Allah (sbw) is great and he is very kind as well as caring. Sometimes, he does things in certain ways so that it will benefit us in the next world. I really hope I didn't take too much of your time and I hope I didn't overwhelm you with too much information. I'm here for you sister if you need anything. Peace and blessings be upon you, I'm very happy you have joined us. Alhamdulillah. \ud83d\ude0a\u2066\u2764\ufe0f\u2069 Ramadan Kareem!", "link_id": "t3_bvmbhp", "time": 1559412734}}
{"epkkspd": {"text": "Thank you for trying to help me out. Honestly, I really think I need to work on myself but their ate times where I feel like I need someone. I don't have friends or anyone to talk to really. The other reason is I'm not getting any younger ya know. Also, I really believe that no one has the capability to be around me. I'm a bit too much to handle cause im basically broken. I'm mostly looking for someone who does the major requirements of Islam but I also want to find someone who tries their best not to waste their time on materialistic things. I'm okay with doing leisurely things like watching movies and tv but not for long periods of time or everyday. I just feel like we need to remind ourselves that we are here for a purpose that is to please Allah (sbw) during this time that we have in this world. I just don't want them to be too distracted on materialistic things and remember that Allah (sbw) is watching you everyday of every second of your life. I'm trying my best to follow this way of thinking as well. I'm trying my best during this holy month and hopefully afterwards to stay on the right path, repent for the sins I've done, and seek nearness to Allah (sbw). I haven't been a good practicing Muslim for the past couple of years and I really want to go back to how I was years ago when I was still in high school. I used to be very religuous. I didn't listen to music, I was good to my parents, I'd pray nafilah prayers and read dua's as well. I'm trying to dress more modestly as well. Their have been times where family members have gone to gatherings that have music and dancing and I've gone. I feel like even with it being all female it's still wrong to do this unless it's with your significant other. Call me extreme but that's how I feel. I really truly am trying to better myself and I hope that Allah (sbw) sees that and is pleased with me. I forgot to mention that I'm mostly into Arab men however, my parents...don't agree because they think the barrier of language will cause problems. I prefer them to not be a seminary student but religious where they are aware of Allah (sbw). I just really want them to pious men who I will know I can trust and that he wont deceive me, will respect me, will be understanding, and have lots of patience. I really need a man with a lot of patience because I feel like the issues I have will need lots of it. For example, my family don't really have much patience for how I am. The mood swings I have (although I'm really trying to work on it) can be tiring for me as well as the significant other. Their are other things as well but I don't feel comfortable explaining it here. I hope you understand. I'm interested in knowing who those people are but I'm not sure if you are aware of the middle eastern/Asian culture. When a female seeks out a man is always looked down upon...so I'm not really sure how to go about finding those people out anyway. But I do appreciate the recommendation as well as advice you have given me. Thank you.", "link_id": "t3_bupcyv", "time": 1559276077}}

Made note cards and everything and studied for a day but then I didn't study the rest of the 15 hours I had left before the exam. I literally bs'ed the exam. I care so much about this class and my other ones but at the same time I guess I don't since I don't show that much effort at times. I currently had an A- for the class and will probably get a C now since I did horribly on my second exam. I haven't been attending one other class that's only one credit. I was hoping to get my associates degree this semester but it ain't gonna happen. I got kicked out of a 4-year school last semester and I cared a lot about my studies and still do. I guess I also don't but just didn't really realize that until now. I'm struggling so much with my anxiety as well as ADHD and depression or whatever it is. I've only been diagnosed for ADHD.

I'm 24 and got diagnosed last year I believe. I've gotten accommodations for school but it doesn't help as much. I'm thinking of taking meds but I'm too scared. They gave me a cocktail of drugs at the hospital once for headaches and Ritalin was one of them. I thought my heart was going to explode and I was going to die that's how bad it was.

If I delete it I\u2019m not gonna carry around my laptop everywhere just to check Reddit. What do you guys think about android and Apple phones? Which has better privacy and security? I wanted to go upgrade to an android but not sure if I should. I doubt that Linux has many security and privacy issues to be honest and although we don\u2019t know who controls the exit nodes, I feel like Linux is literally our best bet. I believe it\u2019s security as well as privacy is the strongest out of any other operating system such as windows and macOS. MacOS is a form of Linux anyway, isn\u2019t it?

It\u2019s not a cultural thing when I said that my family thinks it\u2019s best to marry my cousin for financial reasons. It was just my uncle who said that. He literally believes their is no one else for me but him. You can\u2019t force two people to marry each other. My dad knows that it is his duty to pay for us and even tells us we don\u2019t have to work but in all honesty it\u2019s the opposite. He wants us to work and wants us to even pay for our engagements\u2014 my sister and I. He might not tell it to my face but he\u2019s told my mother before. The financial help would be for my dad mostly I think but that\u2019s besides the point of all this.3. For my mom, it\u2019s a huge deal breaker as well as the rest of my family. People don\u2019t see it as something good when you marry someone outside of your culture. My dad prefers Afghan as well but is a bit more lenient toward marrying a non-Afghan. Sometimes he switched sides though. My mom has even said she wouldn\u2019t forgive me if I married a non-Afghan man. It\u2019s sad that they don\u2019t know it\u2019s the very reason why many of our Imams (a.s.) married non-Arabs. Men and women of different tribes are made for each other so that they get to know one another. 4. Yes, I know that. I\u2019m just very afraid of getting married to the wrong person and being unhappy for the rest of my life or divorcing them some time later. I also don\u2019t trust easily which is another issue. Marriage in general is scary in and of itself. If only Imam Zaman (a.s.) was here, he could pick who I should marry. Believe me I have prayed many many times for Allah (sbw) to grant me a good husband. I just feel rushed a bit because my whole family thinks I\u2019m not getting any younger which is true but they also think I won\u2019t be able to have children later on. I hope to have 3-4 children when I am married but that will be hard since I\u2019m not even finished with college.
