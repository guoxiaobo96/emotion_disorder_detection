I know you may see your confession as a weakness, but let me tell you, That\u2019s one of the toughest parts of the whole issue.I went my whole life refusing to see anyone or get a diagnosis. I thought what I felt was normal. But, I also had that weight on my back when it came to staying tough. My mom is Bipolar and my dad had an insanely inconsistent work schedule, meaning I would,most the time, be stuck at home with my mom. (Who I love dearly). But she was very on or off with things, some weeks I would be running around the house while she would be rampaging and getting onto me about small issues and others she would stay asleep for days at a time and never leave her room. So having to \u201cbe strong\u201d took a toll on me. It lead to most of my development in life being surrounded by anxiety and depression. It took me a decade before I saw anyone about it. But once I did, things got so much better. I had the energy to do things and be around people. To watch my little cousins on my days off from work. I had the ability to live.

For example, Ever since the Shield debuted and I watched some of Dean Ambrose/Jon Moxley promos, I resonated with him when it came to certain aspects of life and personality. I loved Dean as a character, because the unpredictable behavior he displayed. Finally, The whole point about Mauro is absolutely dumb. The guy understands it to be an entertainment medium, and has used that platform to reach others when it comes to Mental Illness.

{"eh7tvo2": {"text": "Around the age of 10, My great uncle passed away after being in and out of the hospital for about 3 years. Every day he was in the hospital, I was so afraid to come home and possibly have to hear he had passed,my last week of 5th grade,I got home and that fear came true. After that, I became very fearful about many things,such as friendships falling apart and people passing away that I would lose my mind emotionally if given the slightest bit of bad news. I saw a psychiatrist and we worked through it. This was the end of my battle... or so I thought.My sophomore year of high school, I tried to call my grandad (mom\u2019s side),who I had built a relationship with over the course of a year. When it went to voicemail, I just decided to wait. We eventually got a call telling us he had a heart attack and passed away in his bathroom. This really effected me, to a point where I began pushing people away,for fear of dealing with these issues again.In the mean time,we moved my Grandmother (Dad\u2019s side) into our house,so she wouldn\u2019t be lonely. When she moved in,it was a bit of a toxic environment that began brewing. There were arguments about many different things almost weekly, to a point,I began to isolate myself from my family. So I graduated high school and got my first job. I was scheduled to work a 4 day stint from Friday to Monday,well Thursday I get a call asking me to come in and cover for one of my co-workers. I agreed to take his shift. That day,my grandmother was hospitalized and she passed away Sunday night. I never got to say goodbye.When I found out she had passed, I lost my mind. I broke the foot board of my bed in half and had a mental breakdown, this was the first time I had ever called the national suicide hotline. I went to work less than 12 hours after she passed and was mocked and ridiculed like most other days. The next day (Tuesday), I talked with my family about setting up my first appointment with my old psychiatrist, and then the date was set.I was mortified about my appointment,to the point, I tried to avoid it in any way possible. But when I got back to the office, it was like when I was a kid,before my life came crashing down. We had a good chat and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I remember her saying those words and not knowing what to think. Was I crazy? How would it affect me? Was this something that I should keep secret? I had to figure out the answers and soon. So from May to September of last year, I went and saw my psychiatrist on a biweekly basis. I took medication to help. I felt like things would be okay, and then she retired. I thought there would be a referral to someone else,but there wasn\u2019t, I was just put out to pasture with a few pill bottles. In October, I had another bad mental breakdown, I couldn\u2019t find any will to move forward with life, so I set up an appointment with a therapist.When it came to therapy, I wondered a lot about what it entailed. What would I do if it didn\u2019t work? What comes after it? Any more pills? So,I went to the first session with an open mind. I found that it helped a good bit, but I needed to find a psychiatrist, so after months of looking, I found one and I have an appointment set for the 19th of next month. But,how am I doing now?In short, depends on the day. Some are great and I love them,but most are unfortunately ,challenging to get through. The way my brain is set, I hate myself with an immense passion, and I\u2019m trying to fight back against it. I am fighting, which can be considered a victory in it\u2019s own right.If you make it to the end of this, I just want to say, that YOU ARE WORTH IT.

With this being an anonymous forum, I will let you know as someone who deals with diagnosed GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and severe Depression, this battle is quite normal. Be willing to open up about these thoughts and things that trouble you. If you see someone, their main goal is to try and help you get better. In my first meeting with both my therapist and psychiatrist, I was as vague as possible and It did nothing to move us forward in conversation and treatment. Long story short: be as open as you feel comfortable being. Just know that they want you to get better. Doctors understand that people have intrusive thoughts, they work around them all the time. You just need to be open with them about the problems you feel as though you are having. If you have anything else you would like to ask, feel free and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt, if you give life the time to continue, it will get better. When I was 15, I dealt with a life that was one in which I had no friends to talk to, and my family wouldn\u2019t listen until things reached a head. Listen when I tell you that the best years of life are ahead of you. Through my problem, I felt as though there was no reason to go on, but fast forward a few years and here I am, with some friends that genuinely care about me and I care about them. I have had the opportunity to move forward in life. I am able to take care of myself and these thoughts, though they appear every once and a while, do not phase me like they used to. All of that is not because life got better, it was because I got better. You need to give yourself a shot at life, because if you do, you will realize that you progress through and become better. I know that the therapy thing is a subject that you are not inclined to, however, since I started going, I learned many ways to cope and I can continue my life as normal. I hate that you have to deal with all this, especially at your age, however, if you can push yourself through all of the shit you may have on your plate, then You will begin to see life improve like I did.

So I would wake up every morning after PPVS for the whole year of 2008 and hear that he hadn't won the belt. As a kid who dealt with mental health issues growing up, I would sink myself into it, and I would be crushed to hear that Jeff hadn't won. But then he would get another shot, time and time again until Armaggedon 2008. I remember being so elated by the fact that after a year of fighting, he had finally got to the top. I even look at that when I have a hard time with things nowaday. Even though the reign was short, I still look back at him winning the title and get goosebumps thinking about it all.
