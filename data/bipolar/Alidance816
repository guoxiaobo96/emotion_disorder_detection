{"efmfeza": {"text": "I was diagnosed with social anxiety in 8th grade, was on Celexa for a while. Therapy helped but I ended up developing depression. I was hospitalized twice in high school for being suicidal and harming myself, the first time they put me on Effexor and three weeks later I went fuckin insane (I tried to get run over by other cars and my father, I lost like four hours from my memory) and I was back in the hospital. They put me on Zoloft which made me feel numb. I was on that for like four or five years. I was failing college classes, absolutely miserable. It came to a head when I told my friends I felt like they had stopped including me in things despite the fact that we live together (had been friends for three and a half years, living together for two and a half. They knew full well I was depressed and fucked up. One of them also had anxiety and depression and was a psych major but she did nothing to stop the others from saying this. Her father was even bipolar so she knows mental illness very well) and my friends told me they were sick of me and that I should leave school and essentially kill myself. Obviously i was emotionally destroyed. Packed my shit up and left school immediately. Driving home from school was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It took so much willpower to not drive into the median on the highway. To not just drive off the side of the road going 90 mph.I was at a therapist appointment a couple weeks later and mentioned my impulsive sexual tendencies, having threesomes with my boyfriend and whatnot as well as my anger and sleeplessness. She said I should look into getting tested for bipolar. Within a month of leaving school I was sent to Sierra Tucson in AZ and stayed for a month. They did testing and diagnosed me. They did genetic testing a to see how my body processes different medications. Effexor was listed as red because my body couldn\u2019t metabolize it, no wonder it fucked me up so bad. They put me on abilify. I left there (this place was wonderful, expensive as all hell but super helpful and therapeutic) and ended up not being able to get a psychiatrist appointment at home and had to stop taking the meds, they hadn\u2019t done much and fucked with my memory a LOT so I didn\u2019t really care. Almost six months later I find a woman who will take me and I get on Lamictal (still on it, works wonders for me). When I first started on this medication I had an angry outburst, my mom blamed it on the medication saying she didn\u2019t believe I was bipolar anyway. I had been on Lamictal for a whopping FIVE days. You don\u2019t get side effects that fast. My mother is a nurse, at a school for kids with emotional and mental issues (literally anxiety, depression, bipolar, ADD) and yet she refused to believe I was bipolar. After a couple months on the meds I was improving and she FINALLY accepted my diagnosis. And here I am, I just graduated college in December and plan to get a job and hopefully move in with my BF of almost four years soon. I know compared to others stories mine doesn\u2019t sound all that bad but god it was fucking torture. I can\u2019t even imagine having it worse. Gentle reminder that emotional states are transitory. They might feel like they will last forever but it won\u2019t. Emotions (and episodes) come and go. You just have to wait it out and let them pass as hard as that is.

I was at a residential inpatient facility for a month and took psychological testing (literal multiple choice) to figure it out.

I think it really flipped a switch in his mind because suddenly he started dieting and lost all of the weight and then some (obviously took some time but I was more than willing to wait because I was totally in love with him). He told me afterward that if I hadn\u2019t sat him down and told him, he would\u2019ve just kept going down that path.

The pain on my lower left side just got worse and worse. I was shaking and dripping with sweat. I used my cellphone to call my mom who was just down the hall because I thought my intestine was going to rip open from the pain. My mom is a nurse, worked in the ICU for years and you could tell she was freaking out but holding it together as best she could. I begged her to call an ambulance. Right after she did, I vomited from the pain. The force of my stomach contracting from the puke forced a hard chunk shit out my other end. So there I was, dripping sweaty, vomiting shit and blowing it out my ass too. I kept shitting but the pain didn\u2019t stop. Eventually my mom cleaned up my vomit off the floor and I just curled over and got on my knees, I couldn\u2019t move so she wiped my ass for me (thanks mom). When the paramedics got there I still couldn\u2019t move. They lifted me on the stretcher and going down the stairs and the whole drive to the hospital was EXCRUCIATING. I got some X-rays and was told I was still full of shit so they gave me laxatives. I shit for days I swear to god. That was even worse than surprise anal. That hurt so bad I stopped breathing for a good thirty seconds. Nothing compared to the at least two hours of pain from this though. ", "link_id": "t3_adpxi9", "time": 1546948587}}

It\u2019s a small room so there was only about a foot and a half between our beds. At the foot of my bed, there was the door.One night I woke up, paralyzed. I know this is going to sound like sleep paralysis but it wasn\u2019t. I was frozen, terrified. I opened my eyes and my bedroom door was open (as it usually was) but there was this orb, maybe the size of a quarter, that was floating right in front of the door about a foot up from the level of my bed. I was frozen in panic, sweating. I couldn\u2019t move my body or make any noise no matter how hard I tried. I laid there for what felt like an hour but was maybe ten minutes. Eventually I managed to move and I grabbed my moms foot and said \u201cthere\u2019s something at the foot of my bed, you have to get up\u201d. She begrudgingly got up and walked over to the door, she moved her arm in front of it, blocking it from my view. She moved her arm back and it was still there. She turned on the light and I couldn\u2019t see it but when she shut the light off it was there again. She moved the door, it stayed where it was, couldn\u2019t have been a light reflection. She turned the light on one more time and when she shut it off it was gone. There was no sort of reflection of light that could\u2019ve been on that part of the door to make it look like a greenish glowing orb. There was no light coming from the hallway whatsoever and we live in a suburb with no light pollution. No explanation.It happened a second time, same paralyzing fear. Finally managing to get my mom awake to turn on the light. She thought I was just scared of the dark. It never happened again but for the next maybe seven year, I had to sleep with a nightlight.
