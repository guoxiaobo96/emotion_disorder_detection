The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoris (clitoridectomy).Type 4:\u00a0This includes all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area.Deinfibulation refers to the practice of cutting open the sealed vaginal opening in a woman who has been infibulated, which is often necessary for improving health and well-being as well as to allow intercourse or to facilitate childbirth.***https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation  Altering the genitals of any minor is horrific and should be 100% illegal world wide. However male circumcision is  far less damaging ( in comparison) to fgm where a girls clitoris is removed and she is seen shut.

I remember my high school was trying to keep things quiet for the younger kids, but i was a senior and our teachers just let us watch the news all day because they said we are old enough to know. There was a odd quietness in school for the next few days, because everything had changed but we didn't know what to do with hat yet.   At home my mother was stuck to the news, I think looking back she may have been in mild shock due to having watched it happen live. About 2/3 of our TV stations are American so it was unavoidable, and the Canadian stations had news all day as well. The only escape was the cartoon channel.    As a teenager I was very confused of what it meant? Would there be war? Would Canada as part of the u.n , and a American allie be going to war too? Where would that take place? Was I safe? I admit my response may have been a bit selfish but at that age i did t have a full understanding of what it meant. My friends had similar reactions, we didn't know what it would mean and asking adults was met with blank stares.   Looking back as an adult now, it was when a lot of things changed. Security got stricter, people seemed on edge and it was a very clear  b.c a.d time point.     We, ( we are the same age I believe) were the last kids to come of age before all of the war on terror mess started. I work with people in their early 20s who were either not alive or not old enough to remember pre 911, they don't have a memory of pre terrorism times . They don't know what it was like to go to a show and not have to go through a metal detector and be patted down. Pre 911 you didn't need a passport or to even really show Id when crossing the boarder by car. Now you need a passport to cross, and are much more likely to be pulled aside and questioned. As a kid my parents, grandpa, brother and myself would cross the boarder all in one car, and the only thing checked would be my dad's license and a quick \" where are you headed\" then have a nice trip. Now it is the opposite, but I have not gone to the USA since 2000 I do not feel safe going there.  I am a white woman so my experience is much different then what the many Muslim, hindu, and sikh people experienced post 911 due to \" looking like terrorists\" , but it changed our countries a lot", "link_id": "t3_bvemg1", "time": 1559436168}}
