(ED+PE)Adding to the frustration was the fact that even though there are usually a thousand ways to skin a cat she (my ex) could only orgasm via penis to g-spot stimulation.  She wasn't able to feel comfortable with a vibrator and my hand was too impersonal as well.That frustration is real.  I lived through the tears.  So many tears.I'm so sorry that this is happening to you.I miss my ex dearly.There was a lot of shame in our break up.  I could not dismiss the responsibility I felt for the tears.  Could she have learned to be more flexible with our intimacy?  Maybe with some serious counseling but neither of us felt comfortable going to those sessions.  I should have talked to a doctor sooner.  That is one truth I cannot ignore, but with the other issues in the relationship we stood before a hill too big to climb.I'm in a new relationship now.  The sex is MUCH better.  For one I've managed to time our encounters to match the activation time of the sildenifil tablets my doctor prescribed.  Yes, taking boner pills is less than ideal but it does allow the deed to happen.  For the PE I've begun to finish myself off a few hours prior to taking the pills. It's not a perfect science but it works well enough.  I've also switched head meds.  Also, my new love is EXTREMELY patient and can cum if I go down on her or if I use my hand - both of which I do enthusiastically, and always before she finishes me off.At the end of the day intimacy shouldn't be about getting off but that's an idealistic viewpoint to have.

Game challenges include collecting 43 different types of plants and hunting rabbits for their pelts (which will be ruined if you don't use the right ammo and have a perfect headshot).  Other challenges include winning multiple games of dominoes, poker and blackjack.  Press L on the d-pad to see the challenges.   In the hundreds of hours I've played since I've killed hundreds of people by running over them with my horse.  Especially in towns and cities.  Again, these touches are for authenticity and immersion.  While much of the west was lawless this was also a time in history when moral codes began to be implemented for the greater good of society.If you're into blasting your weapon for hours you may find the novelty wears off quickly in this game but if you like simulators, classic wagering games, scavenger hunts AND blasting people RDR2 really delivers.", "link_id": "t3_gegd97", "time": 1588767678}}

{"fn0cb9a": {"text": "\\[LONG\\]Your first step would be to consult with a Social Security lawyer to learn more about the process. It's not necessary but it is helpful as the process is daunting and having someone to hold your hand isn't going to hurt. Many lawyers won't charge a fee until your case is settled and then they will take their cut out of the back-pay you are awarded at your settlement. Back pay is based on your lifetime earnings and is retroactive to the date that you claim to have become disabled.You can fill out the SSDI application on line. I think it took me somewhere close to an hour. You'll have to list your medications, doctors names/addresses/phone numbers, your work history, diagnosis, hospital visits (with dates), education history etc. Your lawyer may offer to help with the application and there are some social service organizations that can help as well if you get overwhelmed.Your application will likely be denied. The Social Security Administration (SSA) says that nearly 85% of applicants are denied on the first try.You can then file an appeal. Again, some legal counsel can be beneficial but not necessary.You'll likely be denied again.On your third appeal it's generally advised that you get some legal help if you don't already have it. Your third appeal will be a request for a hearing with a judge where your medical records and doctor\u2019s recommendations will be used to strengthen your case. With any luck you get a good judge and start collecting your benefit.Hope this helps and good luck to you.PS: A lot of people want to know if they can work while they are on disability or if they can work while they are waiting for a determination. There are two answers for that. Yes, you can work while you are collecting an SSDI check but you are limited to an amount predetermined by the SSA. In 2019 this amount was $1200/mo. As far as working while you wait it is generally advised that you don't try to work much as you are trying to convince a judge that you are \\*dis\\*abled and if you are pulling 30 hours a week at a job it's hard to make that case.PPS: \\*Should\\* you apply is relative. To determine whether you \\*should\\* I think it's best to ask yourself, \"will my well-being be jeopardized if I continue trying work?\".Few people \\*want\\* to go on disability.Not only do you have to reconcile with yourself that you are \"less than able\" you also must reconcile your position with a culture that frowns on freeloaders and stigmatizes people with mental illness. Plus, the benefit checks are generally at or below poverty level.For most applicants the monthly check is relative to lifetime earnings while employed. There are calculators at ssa.gov ([https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/AnypiaApplet.html](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/AnypiaApplet.html)) to help you figure out what your benefit will be but you will first need to give a detailed history of your earnings ([https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/)).There is also something known as a Trial Work Period (TWP) but I'm not clear on how that fits in.

{"fmgl0la": {"text": "Heya, below is my (long) response for people who are considering SSDI but since you asked some specific questions I'll address those first.1)   It can be extremely hard.  Not always but often. I have been trying to get SSDI for 16 months. Some people get it in 3 months bu for many the process takes a year or more.2) Yes, pdoc support is recommended.3) The application is available online ([https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html))  Some workloads have been suspended due to COVID 19 outbreak and so your application processing time will likely be delayed.Your first step would be to consult with a Social Security lawyer to learn more about the process. It's not necessary but it is helpful as the process is daunting and having someone to hold your hand isn't going to hurt. Many lawyers won't charge a fee until your case is settled and then they will take their cut out of the back-pay you are awarded at your settlement. Back pay is based on your lifetime earnings and is retroactive to the date that you claim to have become disabled.You can fill out the SSDI application on line. I think it took me somewhere close to an hour. You'll have to list your medications, doctors names/addresses/phone numbers, your work history, diagnosis, hospital visits (with dates), education history etc. Your lawyer may offer to help with the application and there are some social service organizations that can help as well if you get overwhelmed.Your application will likely be denied. The Social Security Administration (SSA) says that nearly 85% of applicants are denied on the first try.You can then file an appeal. Again, some legal counsel can be beneficial but not necessary.You'll likely be denied again.On your third appeal it's generally advised that you get some legal help if you don't already have it. Your third appeal will be a request for a hearing with a judge where your medical records and doctor\u2019s recommendations will be used to strengthen your case. With any luck you get a good judge and start collecting your benefit.Hope this helps and good luck to you.PS: A lot of people want to know if they can work while they are on disability or if they can work while they are waiting for a determination. There are two answers for that. Yes, you can work while you are collecting an SSDI check but you are limited to an amount predetermined by the SSA. In 2019 this amount was $1200/mo. As far as working while you wait it is generally advised that you don't try to work much as you are trying to convince a judge that you are \\*dis\\*abled and if you are pulling 30 hours a week at a job it's hard to make that case.PPS: \\*Should\\* you apply is relative. To determine whether you \\*should\\* I think it's best to ask yourself, \"will my well-being be jeopardized if I continue trying work?\".Few people \\*want\\* to go on disability.Not only do you have to reconcile with yourself that you are \"less than able\" you also must reconcile your position with a culture that frowns on freeloaders and stigmatizes people with mental illness. Plus, the benefit checks are generally at or below poverty level.For most applicants the monthly check is relative to lifetime earnings while employed. There are calculators at ssa.gov ([https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/AnypiaApplet.html](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/AnypiaApplet.html)) to help you figure out what your benefit will be but you will first need to give a detailed history of your earnings ([https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/)).&amp;#x200B;Good Luck!", "link_id": "t3_fv1b4r", "time": 1586051372}}

His mood swings came and went fast which I know isn't everyone's experience but it has been mine so I gave him a pass.  He has a fair amount of rage - which isn't my experience, but has been for people I know.  Him being obsessed about protecting truth and simultaneously  sweet to his girlfriend seemed realistic. If I had any gripes with the portrayal it's that the bipolar character wasn't shown overcoming the hardships associated with the illness.

{"fm1aahk": {"text": "I'm not a musician but for a long time I was a performer.I started a career in radio broadcasting at when I was 16.  Over the years I honed my delivery and timing so that I could perform as a voiceover acto  I had some moderate success performing in a film that was featured at ComiCon in San Diego and for a nationally syndicated cable sports program on the MLB network.  I wrote, directed, produced and voiced thousands of regional radio commercials and hosted the nations only commercial radio game show in San Francisco.  I interviewed Dave Grohl and Tom Morello, Chris Cornell and countless others. But then the week before I turned 40 I went into inpatient psychiatric care and the wind left my sails.It's been two years now and my bank ledger indicates that my freelance efforts are in the red.  I no longer have a career.  I have a hobby.As I look back on all that I had produced I realize that I felt like a fraud just as often as I felt like I was making something worthwhile.  I can still tell you the names of other people who worked in my field that I felt were outperforming me at almost every turn.  I can still feel the inferiority and the inadequacy.For me, chasing my dreams eventually turned out to not be worth the effort.  Working in my trade became less about the product that I was making and more about trying to realize my ambitions to be recognized and rewarded.  At some point my work became a gimmick instead of a project.From where I'm sitting now it seems like you've got one foot in and one foot out.  It's not surprising.  Living with a mental illness changes one's perspective on what is important.  And getting older will compound those effects.  If you choose to pursue a career in music I think you're going to have to go all in; writing, producing, performing, marketing etc.  It's gotta be  full time job and you have to become your own boss and make your own schedule and keep focused on your own goals.

That can happen in the TT itself (like yours), or in an outboard unit (often called a phono stage) or inside the receiver. Since this receiver doesn't have a phono-pre amp in it you gotta use one of the other two options and since my TT doesn't have a preamp in it I have to use an outboard unit. Basically the TT hooks into the pre amp (phono stage) via RCA cables and then RCA cables run out of the pre amp into any available input on the back of the receiver.  I've chosen the \"Media Player\" input which can be selected on the left hand knob or via remote control.As for feeling weird about having it to turn it to such a high number to get the sound you want, I will admit, I thought that was weird too.

In other words I dodged the side effect bullet. No tremors, no acne, etc.I don't think it's unreasonable to protest in your doctor's office if you have side effect concerns.  This is not to say you should protest everything because unfortunately not a single drug on the market is labeled 100% effective or safe.

{"fifztsd": {"text": "Hey brother.  I abused substances for a long time and while my experience is going to be different from the next guys I have found a few truths have held up for me over time.First of all \"thinking straight\" is something that I had to look deep to find.  The first point on the line was knowing that I needed to get sober.  So in that respect I think you're on the right track.  \"Thinking straight\" while sober took time but more importantly I had to live straight (please let's not start a sexual orientation discussion here I'm just putting this in OP's terms).  Living straight meant being honest with healthcare providers about the symptoms I was experiencing and committing to responsible prescription drug use.  Bipolar medicine is remarkably effective in stabilizing erratic moods once it's been properly dialed in and the foundation for living (and thinking) straight is built on good medicine.Other things I found helpful for living and thinking straight included regular therapy sessions.  I meet weekly with a counselor.  I also attend a bi-weekly support group. Light exercise (walking hiking, jogging, lifting weights...) is also important for thinking straight while sober.At the end of the day the biggest lesson I learned from my days as a user is that self medicating works remarkably well... until it doesn't and there's no reason things have to become critical to make a change.  In my case things got bad.  Real bad.  Razorblades through my wrists bad and alcohol specifically was a great coping mechanism BUT it was doing the job of four healthier ones that were less volatile, dangerous and unhealthy.If you can make the choice now to live straight you will start thinking straight and be in a position to create a life that you feel good about living.Stick to it.

The fact that you have an awareness of your paranoia is an important step towards wellness.Sometimes I think of my delusional/paranoid episodes as being like an IBS flare up.  Or a flare up for someone who has Chron's Disease.  There is an underlying illness and the symptoms aren't always present but sometimes for unknown reasons -with or without treatment- life suddenly becomes really painful and messy.Honestly I don't know the defining characteristics that warrant a delusional thinking diagnosis.  My hunch is that an individual who believes untrue things to be true without a basis in reality would be considered to be delusional.  That would include the fearful mechanics of paranoid thought.With that said the main distinguishing characteristic of a schizoaffective disorder diagnosis is that the psychotic symptoms (including but not limited to hallucinations, paranoia, or delusions) become present when no other bipolar symptoms (mania or depression) are present.In other words if you have been up all night rearranging your junk drawer and color coding your boxer shorts to find that you are afraid the upstairs neighbor is a hitman you may get a bipolar diagnosis whereas if you think your upstairs neighbor is a hitman and it's an otherwise normal Tuesday you may get SZA.Paranoid thinking is considered a positive symptom of both conditions and is treated similarly regardless of diagnosis.I experience \"little p\" paranoia and \"big P\" Paranoia with the latter being a far more fearful and dreadful type of thinking.  I can relate to feeling \"stable\" while paranoid in two different ways.  In one way I will experience \"little p\" paranoia wherein I will miss a call from my SO and begin to grow concerned that she has gotten into a car accident or been rushed to the hospital with inoperable cancer.  These thoughts are with me on a daily basis and I am able to still make my appointments, follow a regular sleep and hygiene routine and complete my work.  I also remember feeling stable\" during my last psychotic episode of \"big P\" Paranoia.  In this state I was lucid for maybe ten or fifteen minutes each hour.  Just long enough to put on a kettle but forget about it minutes later when my mind was racing with terrified images of being pursued by the CIA or FBI.  While I suppose those lucid moments could be considered \"stable\" the big picture was suggesting that I needed an intervention.I have had tremendous success keeping the volume of my paranoia down through a regular practice of taking medication, going to therapy appointments, exercising, socializing with other afflicted peers, playing my music loud, journaling and working part time.Best of luck to you.", "link_id": "t3_ez7ku2", "time": 1580943489}}

This is called anosognosia and it's often confused with denial.  When your dealing with anosognosia you literally have no idea that you are out of sorts.  You're totally lost in your mind.Good luck to you.  You've got this.", "link_id": "t3_eqy2li", "time": 1579450418}}

If you're looking for something fun and casual the discussion surrounding tell/don't tell is very different than if you're looking for something that will demand more of your time and energy.  In a fun and casual relationship you may be able to hide your symptoms or idiosyncratic methods of self care.  But those things are going to be unavoidable in a long term situation and hiding them may come at a price. Personally, I'm a commitment whore and have some experience to share.Here's my story:I made it a point to withhold my diagnosis from my ex.  Two years into our fragile relationship one of my family members -assuming my SO knew- let it loose that I had been in a psych ward. It was a reveal that colored our relationship from that point forward.  It was so impactful that she (my SO) once said during a fight, \"I feel like I got a bait and switch, if I had known \\[you were bipolar\\] I probably wouldn't have dated you\".As it turned out my ex had lost her previous bf to mental illness.We dated for three and a half more years and she became one of my greatest allies after two hospitalizations in 2018.What I take away:Mental illness affects people in different ways.  For those of us who own it s who own (which I didn't during my last relationship) there are no two ways to negotiate intimacy when it comes to tolerance.  It simply has to be known.  If your new interest has any experience with mental illness it may be beneficial to your relationship.  His experience can be included in meaningful dialogue on why you feel the way you feel and act the way you act.  Coming out to another person puts us in a position of vulnerability but that is the only way to strength.  Openness is a jewel.  If he (your beaux) doesn't know what bipolar is all about you can share some resources with him (show him that episode of Modern Family, pass along the Bipolar Survival Guide etc.)  Since I'm not in a 12 step program I can't speak to the ways in which that population handles new relationships but I imagine the same is true with regard to self identification and vulnerability.In my current relationship I put all the tough stuff into a long text message knowing that I wouldn't be able to spill the depth of my being in person to someone who I didn't know all that well in person.  I made sure to include affirmations of my attraction as well and we were able to later discuss details (turns out this one is bipolar as well).Good Luck.

I can go a week or two without thinking about my financial situation but inevitably feelings of inadequacy will come washing over me again.  This seems to be a situation that is exacerbated by being with my bipolar girlfriend who works 37 hours a week on top of parenting two school age children.  I think,\"if she can pull it off why can't I?\".  Not a productive position to hold.Unlike you I have chosen to pursue an SSDI judgement.  After crunching numbers I found that my income with SSDI plus a part time job would be close to or better than what I was making as a full time employee and could be had without the risk of a stress related trigger at work.  I figure I have paid into the system specifically for a situation like this and it's a program that was designed to help people specifically like me so why feel shame in pursuing it.Finding the right part time job took time.  For about 8 months after my last hospitalization I didn't feel capable of working.  I was having medication issues and didn't have good family or peer support.  Eventually I found an entry level position working a the local gym to occupy 8 hours a week of my time.

{"fc3k3kj": {"text": " Your first step would be to consult with a Social Security lawyer to learn more about the process. It's not necessary but it is helpful as the process is daunting and having someone to hold your hand isn't going to hurt. Many lawyers won't charge a fee until your case is settled and then they will take their cut out of the back-pay you are awarded at your settlement. Back pay is based on your lifetime earnings and is retroactive to the date that you claim to have become disabled.Wait times for judgements vary from a few months to two years.You can fill out the SSDI application on line ([https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html)) . I think it took me somewhere close to an hour. You'll have to list your medications, doctors names/addresses/phone numbers, your work history, diagnosis, hospital visits (with dates), education history etc. Your lawyer may offer to help with the application and there are some social service organizations that can help as well if you get overwhelmed.Your application will likely be denied. The Social Security Administration (SSA) says that nearly 85% of applicants are denied on the first try.You can then file an appeal. Again, some legal counsel can be beneficial but not necessary.You'll likely be denied again.On your third appeal it's generally advised that you get some legal help if you don't already have it. Your third appeal will be a request for a hearing with a judge where your medical records and doctor\u2019s recommendations will be used to strengthen your case. With any luck you get a good judge and start collecting your benefit.Hope this helps and good luck to you.PS: A lot of people want to know if they can work while they are on disability or if they can work while they are waiting for a determination. There are two answers for that. Yes, you can work while you are collecting an SSDI check but you are limited to an amount predetermined by the SSA. In 2019 this amount was $1200/mo. As far as working while you wait it is generally advised that you don't try to work much as you are trying to convince a judge that you are \\*dis\\*abled and if you are pulling 30 hours a week at a job it's hard to make that case.PPS: \\*Should\\* you apply is relative. To determine whether you \\*should\\* I think it's best to ask yourself, \"will my well-being be jeopardized if I continue trying work?\".Few people \\*want\\* to go on disability.Not only do you have to reconcile with yourself that you are \"less than able\" you also must reconcile your position with a culture that frowns on freeloaders and stigmatizes people with mental illness. Plus, the benefit checks are generally at or below poverty level.For most applicants the monthly check is relative to lifetime earnings while employed. There are calculators at ssa.gov ([https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/AnypiaApplet.html](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/AnypiaApplet.html)) to help you figure out what your benefit will be but you will first need to give a detailed history of your earnings ([https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/)).", "link_id": "t3_efyelo", "time": 1577391541}}

It's also worth noting that recovery isn't an event.  Recovery is an ongoing process.  None of us \"have\" Scozoaffective Disorder we are \"living with\" Schizoaffective Disorder.  Your diagnosis can never define you it can only explain why you feel the way you feel and act the way you act.Get a second opinion if you feel like the diagnosis doesn't fit, but you've got this either way.PS - If you feel like you don't need the meds they are probably working as designed.", "link_id": "t3_eetnu4", "time": 1577150812}}

With that said there are a few things that may be helpful to know.1) Medication break in periods can be long.  Like months long.  It's uncommon to experience immediate and long last stability after starting a new med and it's possible that side effects will appear and disappear over the course of treatment.2) There are literally thousands of combinations to try and in many cases it's rare to find an effective cocktail on the first, second, or even third try.3) There is a test ([https://genesight.com/](https://genesight.com/)) that can help steer you away from drugs that have a low probability of working. Through gene research the test identifies medications that can be easily metabolized by your system thus decreasing the amount of time you spend in the trial and error phase of med management.4) Medications can quit working with no advance notice.  You can be stable for years only to wake up one day on a plane to Las Vegas with no recollection of how you got there.5) When you find the right mix it could keep you symptom free for the rest of your life.&amp;#x200B;Good luck.

You know... the stuff that comes up in this subreddit.2) I like being able to ask questions about hardships I'm enduring to a room full of people who actually might have some experience with said hardships instead of a group of friends who generally relate to each other about things on TV or shopping malls.3) I like being able to offer support to someone else who is struggling.4) I like having something on my schedule that serves no purpose but to increase my chances at wellness.5) I like doing a 180 while I'm there and leave feeling more energized, refreshed, and enlightened than I felt going in.What I Don't Like:1) I don't like that our group is open to local nursing students who attend for class credit.  Sometimes it feels like they are just coming to see a circus and I have to work extra hard with my time to talk to hammer home mutual points of understanding with their otherwise neurotypical lifestyles.2) I don't like that our group has a couple of people who tend to monopolize the time when they speak.  It's not uncommon for five or ten minutes to go by while they monologue and the discussion falls flat3) I don't like that sometimes people leave feeling no better than when I walked in.

After dragging razor blades through my wrists and ending up in the hospital last year I finally resigned myself to the fact that I needed ongoing and permanent medical treatment for my disorder.  It was my third hospitalization and the third time my mom flew across the country to visit me in the psych ward.  I simply couldn't stand to interrupt her life like that anymore.  Now I realize that not everyone has this kind of relationship with their mom but perhaps a brother, sister, father, family remember, or clergy person could be the catalyst for change.  Hell, I take meds for my friends now so that I don't put them through unwarranted worry and trouble.  This isn't to say that every time you see him you should ask him if he's taking his meds but rather engage in thoughtful discussions surrounding mental health in general.  Turn him on to this subreddit.  Get involved with peer support groups, counseling and community.  The more people that are talking about ways to be well the more likely he is to make some positive change.  There are loads of people take anti anxiety medication or anti depressants and while his symptoms may be more dramatic than your corner store depressive they are no doubt going to share some vocabulary.  Better living through chemistry is possible and the more we can find examples of people thriving through use of science the more likely we are to create a healthy population.  Remember this journey is about wellness.  Medication alone can't provide stability but it can play a supporting role.Working is a challenge all in itself.  There is a large part of the schizo population that is unable to work.  Managing emotional challenges and psychotic episodes can be a full time job!  Someone who is suffering with schizoaffective disorder has a different set of priorities than someone who is neurotypical and often times symptoms are triggered by stress.  Very often work environments can contribute to that triggering stress.  While it is possible for many folks to keep a routine and some vocational engagement it's also possible that your BF's brother may be a good candidate for disability benefits (known as SSI or SSDI in the U.S.).  There are also federally funded programs such as Vocational Rehabilitation that can assist is finding a work environment that has the accommodations that he may need.Historically there has been a very high comorbidity rate between smokers and schizos.

{"f6zfzif": {"text": "Your first step would be to consult with a lawyer to learn more about the process. It's not necessary but it is helpful as the process is daunting and having someone to hold your hand isn't going to hurt. Many lawyers won't charge a fee until your case is settled and then they will take their cut out of the back-pay you are awarded at your settlement. Back pay is based on your lifetime earnings and is retroactive to the date that you claim to have become disabled.You can fill out the SSDI application on line. I think it took me somewhere close to an hour. Your lawyer may offer to help with the application and there are some social service organizations that can help as well if you get overwhelmed.You're application will likely be denied. The Social Security Administration (SSA) says that nearly 85% of applicants are denied on the first try.You can then file an appeal. Again, some legal council can be beneficial but not necessary.You'll likely be denied again.On your third appeal it's generally advised that you get some legal help if you don't already have it. Your third appeal will be a request for a hearing with a judge where your medical records and doctor\u2019s recommendations will be used to strengthen your case. With any luck you get a good judge and start collecting your benefit.Hope this helps and good luck to you.PS: A lot of people want to know if they can work while they are on disability or if they can work while they are waiting for a determination. There are two answers for that. Yes, you an work while you are collecting an SSDI check but you are limited to an amount predetermined by the SSA. In 2019 this amount was $1200/mo. As far as working while you wait it is generally advised that you don't try to work much as you are trying to convince a judge that you are \\*dis\\*abed and if you are pulling 30 hours a week at a job it's hard to make that case. PPS:   \\*Should\\* you apply is relative. To determine whether you \\*should\\* I think it's best to ask yourself, \"will my well being be jeopardized if I continue trying work?\".Few people \\*want\\* to go on disability.Not only do you have to reconcile with yourself that you are \"less than able\" you also must reconcile your position with a culture that frowns on freeloaders and stigmatizes people with mental illness.Oh, and the amount of money you receive as a benefit is a pittance. For most applicants the monthly check is relative to lifetime earnings while employed. There are calculators at ssa.gov (https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/AnypiaApplet.html) to help you figure out what your benefit will be but you will first need to give a detailed history of your earnings (https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/).", "link_id": "t3_dtpj92", "time": 1573316189}}

I live in constant fear of my next breakdown.I've made friends with people at the bipolar support group.  We go on hikes, cook dinner for each other.  I have three appointments each week to treat my condition (therapy / health coaching).  I have a part time job. I write poetry and fiction.13 months ago I had razorblades in my wrists.I play music at high volume.  I scroll through reddit looking for things that make me laugh.  I binge watch television programs.I sleep on a regular schedule, I take my medications, I remember that I am enough.  Without food, without shelter, without a friend, I am still enough to be worthy of love and kindness and the opportunity to take another breath.You never know when luck will turn towards you and waiting for it sucks sometimes but it \\*will\\* happen if you let it.", "link_id": "t3_dnf7w6", "time": 1572105842}}

Prior to my diagnosis most of my mania was controlled by excessive drinking and THC use (not recommended BTW).  That's not to say that over the years I haven't had bouts of unadulterated mania, glimpses of paranoia and hypersexuality, it just means that mania didn't drive my work performance.Instead, my work mode was a perpetual mix of riding hypomanic mountaintops while grinding through valleys of depression. I'm certain I haven't lost any creativity due to being in treatment but I would likely not have achieved so much so quickly if I hadn't been racing about with my work.  My \"crazy\" personality was considered to be a marketable trait by my mentors and supervisors and they exploited that personality which eventually lead to my success.  I am also somewhat talented it seems and rubbed up against a fair amount of luck.  For the last seven years I was medicated and managed to keep up pretty well.  I was admired and respected by my co-workers and I produced a fair amount of work that I'm proud of even today.  If I hadn't dropped my meds I might still be producing.At the end of the day I'd bet dollars to donuts that your talents and gifts aren't a product of your mania.  It's possible that your output my increase with the adrenaline that comes during a manic episode, and it's possible that you may change gears more quickly to keep up with a hypomanic surge but life isn't a race and if you can feel satisfied at the end of the day knowing that you achieved to the best of your ability under healthy circumstances you will be rewarded.

I had heard the process could take up to two years but I had been hopeful that I would be one of the lucky few who were accepted into the program early.After being denied I contacted a law firm in my area who specializes in SS law and they helped me file an appeal and asked for permission to access my medical records to start building a case in the even that my case would go to a hearing.Two months after my first denial I was denied a second time.Another discouraging day.At this point my legal council filed a second appeal (this time for a hearing) and I was told I could expect to wait approximately 18 more months.  If I wait the expected 18 months I will have given 2 years of my life to this process.A few things to consider.1) The wait time for a hearing varies from state to state based on the number of cases and the number of available judges.  More info here: [https://www.ssa.gov/appeals/DataSets/01\\_NetStat\\_Report.html](https://www.ssa.gov/appeals/DataSets/01_NetStat_Report.html)2) in extreme situations (acute suicide risk, perpetual homelessness, extenuating family circumstances i.e. children at home) the hearing process can be expedited although those situations are rare.3) It is advised that the applicant not work during their waiting period although obviously that is difficult to manage for many people.  In cases where one must work it is advised that the number of hours be limited and income received less than $1200.  Remember you are trying to convince the court that you are \\*dis\\*abled and so if you are working 30 hours a week that's not going to look too good.Good luck to you.

The sun is out, the season is changing, I've got five projects at work that are taking up the majority of my attention.  My romantic relationship has been causing me grief and we are talking about splitting up after seven years of cohabitation. Then I get news that a close friend has just had a fatal stroke.  My manager calls me in to tell me he is being promoted and that another colleague with whom I've had strained relations is going to be taking his role.  It's a stress storm and my normal coping mechanism (half a litre of vodka and several beers) stops working.My mind kicks into hyper drive.  The volume on my inner monologue becomes deafening.  I drive through red lights because my attention is on the inside.  I leave a burner on the stove on high as I walk into the other room to browse facebook.My mind twists into a triple helix of thoughts. My career is in jeopardy.  Everyone I know is involved in a conspiracy to have me lose my job.  There are warring factions of friends and acquaintances, family members and civilians.  Everyone is in on it.  I'm reading between the lines of facebook posts.  People with brown eyes in their profile pictures are aligned against those with blue eyes.  Now my career is off the table.  I am wanted dead.  My upstairs neighbor is a hitman, the convenient store clerk is signaling to the person behind me in line to follow me home.  The person behind me in line is wearing a blue shirt. So is the homeless man outside asking for change.  The two of them share words I cannot hear.  They are accomplices.Fear.Fight or flight kicks in.  I run.I'll never know what the man who killed your father was thinking or feeling but I would guess that it wasn't a malicious act that held any intention outside of the mad story between his ears.They say that people who are mentally ill are more likely than neurotypical people to be the victims of violence.

Assuming you haven't engaged in Substantial Gainful Activity since you were 21 (making more than $1200/mo) then you might get back pay to that date.  Otherwise you would get back pay from the day you note on your second application.  Again, IANAL.  You'll certainly benefit from obtaining council this time around. Many lawyers won't charge a fee until your case is settled and then they will take their cut out of the back-pay you are awarded at your settlement. You can fill out the SSDI application on line. ANd I would guess there is a statue of limitations or term on how long you can wait to file your first appeal.  6 years seems like a stretch but again you should ask a lawyer.  The on-line application took me somewhere close to an hour. Your lawyer may offer to help with the application and there are some social service organizations that can help as well if you get overwhelmed.You're application will likely be denied. The Social Security Administration (SSA) says that nearly 85% of applicants are denied on the first try.You can then file an appeal. Again, some legal council can be beneficial but not necessary.You'll likely be denied again.On your third appeal it's generally advised that you get some legal help if you don't already have it. Your third appeal will be a request for a hearing with a judge where your medical records and doctor\u2019s recommendations will be used to strengthen your case. With any luck you get a good judge and start collecting your benefit.Hope this helps and good luck to you.EDIT: A lot of people want to know if they can work while they are on disability or if they can work while they are waiting for a determination. There are two answers for that. Yes, you an work while you are collecting an SSDI check but you are limited to an amount predetermined by the SSA. In 2019 this amount was $1200/mo.

Why did I make it seven years with my diagnosis and without stress on my relationships or work?I think because my condition caused me to become incredibly introspective.  I downloaded a mood tracking app.  I wrote religiously in a journal.

Businesses are not required to pay their employees during this period (generally up to 12 weeks per year) and the employee must submit paperwork to maintain their position.

I had been in my industry for nearly 20 years and managed to cope with the daily stresses via medication and a lot of alcohol. Right now I'm on month 10 of my disability process (U.S.).  My first application was denied (as expected) after about 3 months.  I appealed and was denied a second time about 4 months later.  At this point I sought out legal counsel to help with my second appeal.  This appeal will put me in front of an Administrative Law Judge sometime in the next 18 months.  At my hearing my lawyers will use to my medical records (three hospitalizations) and my psychiatrists notes to make the case that I am unfit to work.  If it hadn't been for some wise investing and a small inheritance I wouldn't have the luxury to wait 2 years.  Others will lean on their family and friends to help them financially through the waiting process.Announcing to the world (and myself) that I am no longer able has been a difficult pill to swallow.  Much harder than the mood stabilizer and AP that I take to control my symptoms.  In our culture one's job is a measure of their value in society.  Polite conversations almost always start with, \"So what do you do for work?\".  I've managed to navigate this discomfort by keeping a very part time job and some freelance work as a means to a little bit of income.  NOTE:  It is not recommended that you work while you are applying for disability because you are after all trying to convince the gov't that you are \\*dis\\*abled.I constantly wonder if I should throw caution to the wind and try to return to a full time position because I know that my disability income (assuming that I get a favorable judgment) is going to be a pittance.  I also know that our society has such a stigma against people who are thought to be \"leeching\" off the system.  These thoughts/feelings aren't overwhelming because I combat them with my own process of building value into my life.  I write short stories (and poetry) and I work on maintaining relationships that are important to me.  I have a gratitude journal that I work on everyday and am focused on being stable.At the end of the day I can say that while navigating the disability process has been financially and emotionally challenging I am much better off for pursuing it.  I have been stable and symptom free for six months and I am certain that if I had continued to pursue full time work I would have been triggered to the point of potentially fatal consequences.", "link_id": "t3_d8leg2", "time": 1569338243}}

There are some rare cases of people getting approved for the program within a matter of months but for most applicants the process takes years.  Some states have shorter wait times than others but unless you are chronically homeless or a perpetual danger to yourself you're going to wind up waiting.

I'm not one to say that medication is a sliver bullet here but in my situation (as well as the situations of people in my bipolar support group) medication is a key ingredient for being well.  And I'm not just talking about a sleeping pill.  I mean medications such as a mood stabilizer and anti-psychotic.This is not to diminish the importance of sleep. As you have learned sleep is also a key ingredient for being well.  People with bipolar disorder often have to work really hard to maintain good sleep hygiene.  I would suspect that your GF is going to collapse into a deep sleep at some point during this episode and when she comes out of it she may or may not continue to cycle through the chaotic emotions you are experiencing.Here in the U.S. many hospitals have on site psychiatric care facilities for people in crisis.  It sounds like a place like this would be good for your GF.The first time I was hospitalized my family tricked me into going to the hospital.  They told me I was going to apply for a job.  I have heard that other people who suffer from psychotic delusions have instructed their close friends to do something similar.As far as you taking care of you is concerned.  Just do it.  Make sure \\*you\\* are getting good sleep and nourishment.  Keep reaching out to people and institutions that may be able to help.

{"ezqnh9e": {"text": "Someone more eloquent than me might be able to breakdown the emotional aspects of applying for disability.On one hand it seems like the label and designation may cause you to capitulate toward your disease.  What happens when you begin to identify with being \"less than\" in some way?  How will it feel to be in polite company when someone asks you, \"So what do you do for work?\"Going on the rolls is your way of announcing to yourself and the world \"I am not able\".  This may or may not be a big deal to you but it is worth some consideration as it puts you in a small percentage of the population that is stigmatized and denounced.Here's what I can tell you about my experience with SSDI1. The process can take up to 2 years (U.S).  It sucks.  It's an excruciatingly long time to wait for something so monumental.  There are some states where wait times are less than others but you're likely in process for \\*at least\\* 10 months and more realistically 18-24.2. The SSA doesn't \\*want\\* to pay you.  Your application will likely be denied the first time you submit.  You can appeal this decision and you will likely be denied again.  According to the SSA most mental illnesses can be effectively treated with medication and therapy and -even if you have copious medical records and hospital reports to submit- you will likely need to (or at least benefit from ) obtaining legal council to help with your third appeal.  This third appeal will be a request for a hearing in front of a judge.  This hearing will likely be your best chance at getting a favorable judgment.3. If you choose to work (or are forced to work for financial reasons) you may be hurting your case.  Remember: You are going through this process to demonstrate the Gov't that you are unable to work.  If you show up to the hearing and the judge sees that you have been working 30 hours a week it's going to be hard to convince them that you are truly \\*dis\\*abled.4.  Unless you've worked for very high salaries for a very long time prior to your application the amount of money you will receive each month is a pittance.  This calculator :[https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/index.html](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/index.html) can give you a rough estimate of where you will be if you are granted the benefit.  You are allowed to make a small amount of money on top of your SSDI income but if you make too much you can be kicked out of the program.Looking back on all that I've just written makes me feel like a negative Nancy.  That was not my intention.Good luck to you.

{"eyzbt5n": {"text": "If I have any advice to give it would be to go easy on yourself.  I am nearly certain that you haven't lost your ability to draw.  Manic energy is a fire of tinders.  It burns fast and hot.  Mania (or hypomania) is a time thief and medications add more time to your life.  Time that can be used for other things that are fulfilling like building new relationships or tending to your physical well being.Without any guarantees I would say that when the wind blows again the flames of your creativity will be reignited with more intensity and a stronger fuel.  Down the line you'll knock out some beautiful art.Really, I insist.  It's your skill and talent is not gone you're just in a period of your life when refilling the well ( I know I've mixed metaphors here).  The lull may last months, or even years but you've still \"got it\".Recently, I had a similar problem.  I was a creative audio producer for most of my life (I'm 40 now) and after my last break I found it difficult to go back to work.  Before my episode and hospitalization I created everyday.  I wrote, performed, and acted in a recording studio and loved every minute of it (except for some unsavory relations with co-workers - but I digress).After recovering for a few months on FMLA  I felt like I couldn't \"turn it on\" any more.  An NP told me that I hadn't lost any skills because of my medications but it was clear to me something was missing.Several weeks later I realized that almost every bit of creative work that I produced was the result of hypomanic energy.  I had been lit up every day and was unwinding with half a litre of vodka and or a six pack of beers every night.I decided I would rather be stable and medicated than return to that lifestyle and I haven't tried to produce since.An interesting side note is that I haven't lost my creativity at all.  After a long (eight month break) from letting my imagination leak outside my mind I have engaged in a writing challenge with one of my ex's.  Each week we send each other a topic to write about and trade stories on Sundays. I sometimes wonder if I could go back to my old job but have grown in new directions since stepping away.

What I mean by this is that instead of telling new friends \"yeah so I survived a suicide attempt and have been hospitalized three times\", I might say something along the lines of, \"this activity is really good for keeping my mental health stable\" or \"when we hang out I don't feel but a fraction of the anxiety/depression I feel when I'm alone driving in my car\".

If someone hears your tease and replies, \"anxiety is for wimps or pussies\" you can pretty much be sure that relationship has a different course of development.Opening up to people is really hard and if you can I'd suggest going to a bipolar support group where you'll immediately have at least one thing in common with some other folks.Congrats on lining up new work and getting your meds dialed in.

I like tactile things even if they only give the illusion of actually being mechanical.  The Accord was a great car.  It had Android Auto, a nice khaki leather interior and a 6cyl option.  The Accord also has reliability ratings that are stupid good.  That said the Accord was $4k more than the Mazda and was only half as fun in the curves as the 6.At the end of the day my three complaints about the car are that, 1) I miss the power of the 6cyl (I've been in two road rage incidents because I forgot that I can't keep ahead of 70mph traffic when merging), 2) the GT leather seems flimsy, and 3) The elbow rests aren't ergonomically perfect.I've had mud guards installed, all weather mats and a remote starter.  I'm expecting to have this car 20 years.EDIT: added some complaints", "link_id": "t3_6d3hvv", "time": 1495654511}}

For three years I was a radio show host in the Roaring Fork Valley (with studios not five miles away from this location).

We would get all types of customers in that place.  Day laborers picking up Budlight w/ Calamato, flight attendants stocking the bev. cart with mini bottles, x-games wannabes hoping not to get carded... All in all a decent gig.  One night, late, a woman walks in asking for a recommendation on Rum.  It's not a popular choice in the southwest or most of Clolorado and quite frankly I didn't have a lot of experience with it.  I tell the lady here's a nice bottle (something off the middle of the shelf)... Goslings maybe... and she asks, \"what does it go with?\"  I suggest a dark and stormy and she reaches for the top shelf.  A $105 bottle.  \"Okay\", I think, \"maybe don't want to mix that with cornsyrup but whatever.  Can I see your I.D. ?\" She's middle aged but I don't take chances.  I look at it, she walks out.

I suspect that if you reset it, took one drive and went directly back to the pump they would match up.  Kinda dumb. And yeah, as for the infotainment graph, I've found it to be utterly frustrating.  The graph itself is displaying some sort of gas -&gt; minutes of driving -&gt; distance ratio using some newfangled proprietary system of units that simply makes no sense to me.  That said, there is a display of MPG / trip that is somewhat helpful insomuch that it will give you and idea of how often your car sips vs. how often it guzzles which can then be related to the \"Avg\" displayed on the gauge cluster. EDIT:  I can't stop thinking about this and have made several edits, but I'm starting to think that the readout on the gauge cluster isn't based on the # of drives (as stated above) but rather the amount of time spent driving at specific efficiencies. This would give the display on the infotainment graph a little more merit since that graph incorporates time into its readout.

If you found a Program Director AMA you'd probably find that they rely on research (Auditorium Testing Sessions and Phone Call Research) to find out which songs people in their target demographics are responding favorably to.  There is also the issue of record label involvement (giving away promo items such as tickets and dinners) to encourage Program Directors to choose certain songs over others.
