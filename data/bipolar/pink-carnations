I mean he survived the Battle of Winterfell but he didn\u2019t really do anything important. I think Dany blasts him with dragon fire for whatever reason and then we get a shot reminiscent of the Night King where he is unharmed. Drogon turns on his mother and shakes her off of him. Dany somehow survives this fall and Jon kills kills her with Longclaw and he emerges as Azor Ahai reborn. Ok tinfoil hat being removed now....", "link_id": "t3_bone4p", "time": 1557864002}}

Melisandre would tie herself to the tree and burn it, killing her in the process. Somehow through the magic of the children of the forest this would stop the Night King. The spiral symbol associated with the Night King being brought up a couple times in the last two seasons was meant to support this theory as the origin of this symbol comes from the big ass weirwood tree.
