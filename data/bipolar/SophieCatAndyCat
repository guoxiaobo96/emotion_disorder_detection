{"fk0y57x": {"text": "I never grew up in the hood , but i know a man that did. He grew up in a rough are of L.A. He was gifted and was at the top of his class, then his family moved when he was in high school to a white lower middle class neighborhood. The new school in this district was far superior to his old school. He started getting Bs because of how fast paced and rigorous it was compared to his old school. He ended up catching up and got into Berkeley - barely. All those years he wasnt challenged had an effect on his performance and ability to take tests like the SAT and GRE. So, the schools in the hood are worse than in white middle class neighborhoods. These kids are not even getting a chance at a good education that preps for college. So, it seems like if you do grow up in an area with higher poverty the education system forgets about you. So, there is at least a little reason why these people in the \"hood\" feel trapped and devalued because in a way they are. I dont think its racism in particular but the history of racism, red-lining and segregation, set up these neighborhoods and income inequality solidified them. Today, the greener you are the more valuable you are and in turn the more opportunities at power building you are granted. In the past the rascist system was predicated on the fear of poc getting too green, getting too much power.So, these poor neighborhoods are like a vortex and its not entirely its inhabitants fault. I think crime exasperats their situation, but if these people genuinely do not have access to legal opportunities  to gain power, college. They gain elsewhere. Just like how you can feel being ostracized even if no one explicitly tells you that you are, people can feel veing oppressed. You get looked down apon, you get followed, and you get profiled. Just the way you carry yourself and your speech, even if your dessed with expensive clothing and drive a nice car, gives away your upbringing which has a stigma against it.People are masters at adapting and they are not stupid.

{"eisnm4t": {"text": "I'm mostly curious about how many people actually enjoy hurting others enough that they are compelled to murder even though the consequences of getting caught are very steep. I know most serial killers are psychopaths since they arent deterred by punishment of any kind. But I'm more puzzled as to why some people really enjoy hurting others. I am an average person who's skin crawls when I see others (including animals) getting hurt, especially badly hurt, so, I cant really get into their shoes and fully understand. I'm not afraid of possible serial killers around me; I am motivated by statistics.To me serial killers are like a puzzle I cant figure out, which makes me want to understand them even more.

This may sound funny, but I've been watching some of the big youtubers stories on their personal struggles and it feels good knowing that all sorts of people deal with bad shit. I hate that we have to deal with it, but it's very motivating knowing that others have gone through tough stuff, too. It puts my life into perspective and drives home what my therapist says about life. At times I feel like authority figures are lying to me, probably due to depression, so I wont take their optimistic words to heart.

Unfortunately, no one acknowledged or gave credence to my experience. My dad would hoard and had this delusion that he was going to be the next Steve Jobs. He wouldn't care for my sister and I because it got in the way of his dreams, he couldn't become Steve Jobs if he was a dad. My grandparents enabled him and let us be subjected to his antics. When I watched the watermelon scene in Russian Doll, I was transported to the time when I had to stay up till 3-4am on school nights because my dad was on the precipice of a world changing idea that I had to help him solidify. He would scream at me if I didnt record every thought that he had on a collection of memo cards he handed to me. I was expected to record until he was done having his flight of ideas which sometimes would last until early in the morning.On top if this, he thought the government was out to get him, so, he refused to sign any important documentation. My first year at college was paid in full by my grandparents because my father refused to fill out the FASFA. I'm still haunted by the powerlessness I felt growing up.
