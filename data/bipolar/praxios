I hid it very well from everyone, even my friends. I was just miserable and unhappy with my life and I honestly wanted it to be over. One day my sophomore year I had a really bad breakdown one night and my parents and brothers had gone to a party so I figured I was safe to do my thing without getting caught. I was wrong.My parents came home early that night and my dad caught me red handed with my razor on my arm. He completely flipped out. When he grabbed my razor, he grabbed it so roughly he actually cut into my arm more, and he grabbed me and threw me to the floor. Then the verbal abuse started, saying I was selfish, and that I was immature to hurt myself when we had \u201csuch a great life\u201d (we were actually living with my grandparents at the time because my dad was unemployed for 2 years, so \u201cgreat\u201d). All I could do was cry, and well he didn\u2019t like that. So he grabbed me by my face and screamed at me that if I hate my life so much I should stop being a coward and just do it rather than making everyone else around me suffer. I wasn\u2019t allowed to see my friends for a month after that. It was by far the worst grounding I had as a kid. I had to have food brought to me, I couldn\u2019t leave my room except for bathroom or to go to school. I had all my electronics taken away so I had nothing to do but sit in my room and cry for a month. After that I never made myself vulnerable around my parents again in fear of that happening again. I attempted killing myself for the first time a few years later and was hospitalized for the first of many times. My parents never believed in mental illness until my youngest brother began to struggle with depression due to a traumatic brain injury he had when he was younger. It took my parents 5 years and group therapy with my brother to finally start realizing I might have a problem. I finally got diagnosed with bipolar last year, which finally made my mom accept my issues because my grandma and uncle both have bipolar as well. My dad still has his doubts, and does still occasionally lose patience with me, but my mom keeps him in check most of the time now. I do love my parents despite the shit they have put me through, but I\u2019ll never have the same relationship with my parents any of my friends have because they weren\u2019t there for me when I needed them the most.", "link_id": "t3_gncojw", "time": 1590000131}}

My brother being the pushover he was at the time just let her steamroll him and get her way.

At one point you did share those belongings with him, but when he made the decision to break up, he also made the decision to break up with all of your belongings. He is not entitled to anything he didn't buy himself, and I can tell you from experience that having to rebuy things that you once owned sucks. I know this is the hardest part of a breakup, but surround yourself with friends, keep yourself busy with your favorite hobbies, and most importantly go get what's rightfully yours.

To be specific I only smoke dabs only, I absolutely refuse to use dab pens (black market dab pens are EXTREMELY dangerous). Dabs will actually get me high, relax my anxiety (yes somehow a sativa does that don't ask me how lol), they keep me asleep through the night, I can actually eat without feeling the need to barf right after.

While sativas help my mania, they could make yours worse. Which is why it's important to try a sativa and indica separately and determine which strain type improves your symptoms best. THC affects everyone differently; some bodies metabolize it quicker while some slower. For example my body metabolizes THC at a very fast rate so lower potency strains aren't nearly as effective for me, whereas my friend who is the same height and weight as me can smoke a bowl of low potency bud and be sky high for hours. Potency and strains work differently for everyone, and it's especially important to be aware of how it affects us since bipolar can make smoking weed very helpful or very dangerous if not properly informed.I'd recommend trying a sativa to start with, Jack Herer and Sour Diesel are staple sativa strains, and common in black markets of illegal states. My personal favorite for indica's is Blue Dream, also another common black market strain. Once you've tried each respectively I'd try out a hybrid. Then compare notes on them all and decide which worked best for you. I also recommend surfing through Leafly and reading up on all the information they have on there.

{"f5rr0bq": {"text": "It's hard trying to smoke in an illegal state (my state is illegal until next year), so it's near impossible to pick and choose strains that work best. Personally I stuck with sativas and hybrids, I also smoked concentrates only (oil not bud) so the potency was considerably higher than smoking regular bud. Everyone is different so it will take some experimenting with different types of strains to see what works best. Sativas and hybrids work best for me because it makes my mania considerably more manageable and it does a great deal for my energy during horrible depressive episodes. Personally from what I've experienced and others with our illness, I've found that higher strain potencies work best for tackling the worst symptoms of bipolar, but once again it's subjective to each person and their body chemistry. Most black market bud will range anywhere from 5-15% whereas black market concentrates (NOT DAB PENS) will range from 50-80% thc potency. Availability will be your biggest roadblock, but if you can find a dealer who cares enough to know what strains they are selling you can look them up on Leafly and keep track of the strains you try in a notebook to narrow down what works best for you :)", "link_id": "t3_dovrhs", "time": 1572400874}}

{"f4v5clw": {"text": "I actually answered your question at the beginning of that post lol. Sansa was SCARED. Here she had yet another contender for the throne before her, and a Targaryen at that. Regardless of how much Daenerys saved their asses in the Great War, it still doesn't change the fact that Sansa and Arya were right about her. She lived up to her name and completely wiped out ALL of King's Landing. And why? Oh yeah cuz Cersei is a cunt (big surprise there lol) and killed Missandei while Daenerys was still grieving about her dragons. Are you possibly suggesting that Daenerys was in the right for wiping out King's Landing? Sansa, Ayra, and Varys are the only ones who see Daenerys for what she is in season 8. Everyone else was too terrified of her to even defy her (ie. Tyrion who later betrays Varys due to this fear). I'm not sure how you can even suggest that Sansa is stupid because she saw through Daenerys false \"liberator\" guise. Sansa knows what a monster looks like almost better than everyone else, so she was right to be stubborn about what her feelings were about Daenerys. If Daenerys followed in Aegon's footsteps (which she already did by burning everyone in King's Landing), she would have murdered Sansa and Arya before she left Winterfell. How likely do you think it would have been for Jon to continue following Daenerys after she just murdered his sisters? I'm gonna take a gander here and say not very likely lol. As a matter of fact, even just the suggestion that Daenerys makes after wiping out the capital, where she plans to \"liberate\" all those who defy her was alarming enough for Jon to commit treason. Sansa had every right to call out Daenerys for what she was. She already had her family wiped out once by monstrous dictators, you really think she was willing to let that happen again with what little family she had left? Seriously, this is a little ridiculous fiercely protecting Daenerys when  she did worse damage than anybody else in the entire series lol.

While that's not a situation you can avoid with any tank, a pack of 3 coils having 1 dud every pack is just costing you more in the long run. My recommendation is that when you buy your next pack of these coils, clean your tank THOROUGHLY. Rinse it in some hot water and make sure it's bone dry before you install the new coil. Make sure the new coil is prepped well and let it sit in the juice for 30 minutes before you hit it.

We are conditioned to wade through days upon days of hellish mania and depression, so if I would rather have had a doctor with experience with the illness (the psych that actually diagnosed me properly had a son with bipolar 1).Society likes to shun anyone they deem as weak, but one thing that's absolutely NOT acceptable is your workplace discriminating against you for your illness. That is not only ILLEGAL, but a direct violation of the Disability Act. If you are required to report any illnesses before taking a job as a psychologist, they have no power to act as if you're any less qualified because of your disability. Bipolar is no different than a life debilitating physical disorder. If this kind of discrimination continues I recommend shopping around for a new job that will actually appreciate the experience you have to offer to your job.

Taking a lot of it, and frequently may not present negative side affects right away (although he already is experiencing symptoms of lack of serotonin), but the longer this continues, the more irreversible the damage is. MDMA can be extremely neurotoxic, and when it's abused like that, it can cause lifetime mental health problems because it wears down a lot on your serotonin receptors. You can always take more and force your brain to release the serotonin, but after a while your brain will have nothing left and he will lose the magic. I know people sound like broken records saying to follow the 3 month rule for taking MDMA, but it's honestly the safest bet for avoiding any long term damage to your brain.

I highly encourage connecting with your doctor about alternative ADHD medications to try. I usually wait the minimum of 3 weeks on a new medication before I decide to switch unless it's causing severe complications, and in your case these complications are severe. I would also try connecting with your doctor about non-medicinal routes for treating your ADHD if you are showing a sensitivity to the amphetamines.

While I understand this can be an uncomfortable situation, it's also pretty selfish of you to let this affect your sex live. People do strange things during times of grief, and while getting a tattoo of a loved one's face isn't unheard of, it's not in the best taste to get it on a central point of the body. You need to understand how difficult it is for him to lose a family member he was extremely close with. He wanted to make a grand gesture to honor his brother's memory, and getting the chest tattoo, in his mind was the best way to commemorate that memory. He probably feels that getting it in such a central point (and over his heart) is the best way for him to keep his brother close to him forever. I think that before you talk to him about it you need to consider why it makes you so uncomfortable when it's just a tattoo. I understand it's large and lifelike, but to him it's a beautiful homage to somebody he loved very deeply. I think that if you tell him it's affecting your sex life with him, it will really hurt his feelings so you need to evaluate how you can remedy this issue yourself before you speak to him about it. Try fixating on the task of sex itself rather than fixating on something that makes you uncomfortable. No sex partner is perfect and they will have imperfections in your eyes, but in their eyes those imperfections can be something they are proud of. If you truly love him, you will find a way to get past this and work things out. Over time it will get easier to look at and you will even come to appreciate it just as much as he does. You just need to try and put yourself in his shoes with this situation.", "link_id": "t3_b6fd8u", "time": 1553804245}}

Get. A. Wagon.Prepare for ALL weather. Like I said, one year it stormed, last year it was unbearably hot. Scamp is also notorious for being a dust storm or a mud pit. Pack warm clothes, pack light, bring a bandana, and pack extra sets of clothes for each day. Also pack boots and shoes in case it rains or nice shoes for walking. Canopies are a must, they are great shelter from all of the elements. Stakes are completely necessary too as the storms can get really brutal and unstaked tents and canopies will fly their way to the graveyard. I also recommend camping in the woods for extra shade and shelter from weather. Get there early as woods spots fill up early. Hammocks are nice too if it gets hot like last year because you will just end up boiling in your tent and not get sleep. Since you won't be camping by your car your valuables should go with you everywhere as thievery is unfortunately common at Scamp. I recommend making friends with your neighbors as well so you have extra eyes on your campsite when you're out partying. Stay hydrated, don't take too much, and most importantly, check out new music!

However at the beginning of this year my grandpa passed away. He had been sick for a while and was the first major death I had ever experienced. I also lived with my grandparents at the time so this hit me especially hard as I was incredibly close with him. I requested an emergency personal day the days he passed away, for his wake and the funeral. I received quite a bit of pushback for the first 2 days I requested off but I got them anyways. But when the day came for his funeral the owner called me and threatened that if I didn't show up for work that day then I was fired. I was absolutely blown away they held this ultimatum over my head on one of the hardest days I've ever had to face. So I told the owner to go fuck himself over the phone and that he just lost one of his best employees because of his incompetence and greed. My advice?

{"deu0f7o": {"text": "My first two times I only dropped 100ugThen my impatient ass scrambled to get a hold of some for a show and ended up getting blown off this planet by 600ug of liquid LSD.The first thing I noticed with the jump (although it's slightly larger than your increase) would be the visuals. The fractals are fucking nuts and colors are shockingly beautiful. The next thing I noticed was that the body load intensified quite a bit. I got a super heavy, muscle-locked feeling throughout my body and I'd get waves of the \"foot fell asleep pins and needles\" throughout my body. And finally, ego death. Death is a scary word, but ego death is nothing to be afraid of :) Mine occurred right before I peaked. I wrapped myself in a blanket, put on my favorite tripping playlist, laid in bed, and rode it out. It was definitely uncomfortable, but one of the most worthwhile introspective experiences I've ever had on psychedelics. Although 100ug to 600ug was an unexpected jump, I realized that I actually enjoy higher doses more than lower doses now. (Those visuals alone!!) Make sure you're in a safe and comfortable environment when you trip and happy tripping!! \u2764\ufe0f", "link_id": "t3_5yy0wo", "time": 1489333860}}

I've become distant, drained, mildly irritable, (due to insomnia particularly) etc ...But in all this discomfort you know what I've realized? LSD has only ever helped me when it comes to my mental health, so next time I'd just suggest to space out your trips. I also highly recommend at bare minimum a month long break and taking extra care of yourself (eat a little healthier than normal, get good sleep, etc).HPPD will not permanently affect you, but at least now you know what happens if you trip too much too often! I'd call that a lesson learned (I definitely learnt mine) c:", "link_id": "t3_5yvezl", "time": 1489281952}}

{"de4rd4l": {"text": "Tincture will \"burn\" a bit, but personally I always dropped it directly on my tongue instead of underneath. It burns less since it's much more sensitive under your tongue.As for the high you get, it's more of a body high than a head high. You can take as many drops as you want, but it's not a noticeable high compared to if you smoked or ate an edible. Tincture is primarily used for medicinal purposes since the high isn't as intense, so if you're looking for a more intense high from ingesting marijuana I suggest edibles or making reclaim edibles (I use oil reclaim and pop it in gel caps which is better than eating weed flavored brownies imo) Sorry you didn't get what you expected for the tincture but I'd save the rest for a day you're super sore or sick.

{"ddhps4x": {"text": "I did two drops of pure liquid LSD on some sugar in a capsule. I took it for a show because my dealer said it was /probably/ equal to a tab (lmao). Blasted off about an hour in, ended up having to leave because I was tripping too hard. When I made it home the peak knocked me on my ass and the visuals became so overwhelming I went to lay in bed upstairs. I closed my eyes and I \"woke up\" to find myself looking at myself laying in bed. The world around me was absolutely saturated in colorful fractals and the body high was so intense it resembled the feeling you get after your foot falls asleep. I faintly remember sitting in the middle of my room and watching everything melt around me. When I finally came around my friend who was trip sitting me that night said I was \"asleep\" for about an hour. This is the hardest I've ever tripped in my life and before this moment the most acid I had ever tripped on was 150ug.
