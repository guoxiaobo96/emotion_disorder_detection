And if for some reason I don\u2019t feel like running the dungeon, I can just buy the set from another player because a game economy exists. Where as with destiny it can take months, if not longer to get the gun/armour with the roll your looking for. It\u2019s an artificial grind that was barely rewarding as it was. And this is without going into the massive skill and passive ability trees you can unlock and rank up, essentially making your character and play style exactly how you want it. Destiny has the grind of an mmo but not the pay off nor the sheer amount of content and loot. (Tho it claims to have all that and more) It took me three seasons to build 3 sets of armour in destiny. 1 for raids, 1 for crucible and 1 general set. I switch out pieces as I come across new ones with better stats. I have zero interest to do that intense grind once again to make even one set relevant to my play style. This isn\u2019t even touching on the subject of my favorite weapon, subtle calamity, that took me over a year to get the roll I wanted. (And pinnacle weapons... I\u2019ll stay off that soapbox) I get sun setting. But maybe leave our armour and pinnacle weapons out of it. And if armour HAS to be sunsetted than maybe a better system overall. Let us pick where the armour stats go. We earn points by doing something and we can plunk those points into that armour piece up to a maximum for each stat. Mods take us the rest of the way. And a much better masterwork economy would be amazing too. I play destiny a lot, but I barely managed to get two characters into master worked armour for 1 set each.

So maybe I\u2019ve answered my own questions here, I\u2019m just worried I\u2019m seeing what I want to see. I guess I\u2019m looking for guidance from people who have more experience. Not answers, those are for me to figure out. Does that make sense? Thank you again for taking the time.", "link_id": "t3_f51svt", "time": 1582052554}}

On this board and several other boards (one such being  many have mentioned that they work with Gods and Godesses from multiple pantheons. If you even look at it through a historical eye, the vast majority of Gods and Godesses weave and flow their way through religions through the ages. Anubis became Hermes, Bast became Artemis. (I am using Egyptian gods and Roman Gods simply because I studied Classics and they are the first to come to mind)I never said the cat *was* Freya but it stands that Freya is strongly associated with cats. Can one not interpret something as a possible sign but instead it has to be that God or Goddess in the flesh? As for it being a stray cat, our cats are strictly indoor only, we lived in a small condo at the time. Having a random, tangible fourth cat randomly show up at odd times for years would have been noticed at minimum by food consumption, mess, other cat\u2019s behaviour and increase litter usage.

I am so all over the place while I try to figure this out. Thankfully the gods are patient with those still learning. Do you happen to also worship Freya? Would you be ok with me asking you questions? Bast and Freya seem to cover a lot of the same ground, with the main differences (that I have come across so far) being that the warrior aspect of Bast was split into Sekhemet, and that Bast was worshiped for fertility, down to worshipers having statues showing kittens in the number of kids they wanted. While Freya isn\u2019t so much about kids, more sexuality and children being a byproduct of it. If you worshipped both did you find a duality in them? Could signs from one come across as signs from the other? Both Freya and Bast can take on a mother and protector role.

I am also drawn to the fact that She represents sexuality but fertility as a by product but is not required. I am child free by choice and for a goddess like Bast, it seemed strange? As she is worshiped for fertility, down to worshipers having statues of Her with kittens representing the amount of children they wished to have.

{"fhpcj2x": {"text": "1200 is way too low for loosing weight, I know this sounds counter productive, but hear me out. So your body needs a base amount of calories to function (ie: breathing, digestion, brain function, being alive in general, etc) this is called your base metabolic rate (BMR). Your BMR does not take into account anything other than you pretending to be a potato, aka no willing movement. Dipping below your BMR may seem like a solid weight loss idea, but it will actually have the opposite effect. Our bodies are built to survive, if food is scarce (less calories available than our BMR) our bodies will alter our metabolism to compensate for this. Aka slow your metabolism right down so that it can conserve as much energy as possible making its base functions still viable. Hence the weight not  budge or dropping very very very slowly. For me, being a 165 pound, 5\u201910\u201d, 37 year old female, my BMR is just under 1500. Now I take into account how many calories I need to maintain where my weight currently is while working out 1-3 times a week, I need roughly 2057 calories to stay at 165 pounds. So I can cut about 500 calories a day and still have enough to function. Now the big thing that a lot of people miss is that they think of *gross* calories and not *net*. If you are currently eating 1,500 calories a day and you burn 400 working out (go you!) you need to replace those calories used. Yes I know it sounds counter productive, trust me I know. But if those calories aren\u2019t replaced, the energy needed to do the working out is taken away from the calories needed for your BMR, thus slowing your metabolism down. Ive had several friends who were stuck on the not loosing weight problem and the above helped them (and me. I was 204 pounds and maintained 145 for 5 years. I had surgery and was bed ridden for a couple months so I\u2019ve gained 20 pounds back) You can find BMR calculators very easily via google, but I personally prefer the one from [bodybuilding.com](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bmr_calculator.htm) as they give a breakdown of what the numbers mean and have a lot of other resources on the site.

Consider this article from Harvard:https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drug-expiration-dates-do-they-mean-anything\u2018It turns out that the expiration date on a drug does stand for something, but probably not what you think it does. Since a law was passed in 1979, drug manufacturers are required to stamp an expiration date on their products. This is the date at which the manufacturer can still guarantee the full potency and safety of the drug.Most of what is known about drug expiration dates comes from a study conducted by the Food and Drug Administration at the request of the military. With a large and expensive stockpile of drugs, the military faced tossing out and replacing its drugs every few years. What they found from the study is 90% of more than 100 drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter, were perfectly good to use even 15 years after the expiration date.\u2019As long as the epipen is stored correctly it should remain potent for awhile past expiration. HOWEVER, it\u2019s recommended that you carry your epipen everywhere with you, so that means it is being exposed to less than ideal storing conditions. So loss of potency can be expected.

Oh and for us to pay for the fence and got all the quotes themselves without consulting us, included areas of their fence that aren\u2019t on the shared property line and mysteriously dropped the subject and haven\u2019t heard a peep for 6 years after we mentioned that we own the equipment and know how to repair a fence and can salvage most if not all the wood and have it good as new in a weekend.

We have a strong focus on clan based activities such as raiding, crucible, nightfalls, gambit, etc. with our main group activities being raiding (when enough members are interested we will do as many raids a night/week that we can). We actively teach all raids and will regularly post asking if anyone would like to join. If you have raid experience and feel comfortable taking a Sherpa roll? You are more than welcome!Want that nightfall exclusive? We will grind that nightfall with you until you get it. Don\u2019t have Whisper or Wishender? We will help you bust those missions out. What we are looking for: Active players who want to do group activities and help out clan mates. Communication is key, so discord use is highly encouraged to help members find fireteams.

{"ex5kqiv": {"text": "Alright, lots of stories here. I\u2019m regularly trying to take myself out. I was in physio for my right shoulder (which I had dislocated by slipping in dog pee in the hallway and ping ponged off the walls and required surgery to repair, this was my second surgery on that shoulder.) and I was visiting my parents and as I was heading out the door to head to my appointment I slipped on the stairs and slammed my left forearm onto the top of a pony wall. My physio clinic was in the hospital that I was now in the ER for my arm. That was a fun call to cancel my appointment. My physio therapist came to the waiting area to see what the hell had happened. Couple months later I biffed it on the stairs and was a sprawled mess on the landing with my right arm completely vertical behind me (fun fact, shoulders aren\u2019t suppose to do this) woke my roommate up who sleeps like the dead. Back to the same ER. That\u2019s when I got the pulled aside into a room separate from my husband to ask if he was harming me. Nope, I\u2019m just trying to take myself out. Specifically my right shoulder. Fuck that guy. Another time I was getting socks out of the top drawer of my dresser. I dropped the socks, reached down to pick them up, slipped on god knows what, and slammed the corner of my eye into the corner of the pulled out drawer. My eye is fine, had a fun bruise.  Third time my nose broke... my husband and I were fighting over the light switch. He left a room and out of habit turned the light off. I got up and turned the light. He turned it off. I turned it on. This ensued a wrestling match over a light switch that ended with his head hitting me in the nose. And finally when I cracked my ribs. We had been renovating the bathroom and the old large bathroom mirror (about 6\u2019 long) was propped up outside against the wall we have our bedroom window in. Middle of the night, window open, husband asleep far side of the bed, me on the side by the window, we wake up to the sound of smashing glass. Husband thinks someone is breaking in (spoiler: wind cause the mirror to move, smashing it) So he grabs the bat he keeps beside the bed and does this knee first launch thing across the bed. Into my torso. He then continues this knee first launch off the bed using the springing of my ribs for extra momentum. He\u2019s at the window ready to do whatever, I\u2019m dying from the wind being knock out of me. He felt super bad once he fully woke up and realized what he did while in his half asleep protect mode.I have more but this is what I remember from the top of my head. TL:DRSlipped in dog pee and wrecked my right shoulder. After surgery I fell down stairs twice. Once smashing my left forearm into a pony wall, other time ending up with my right arm vertical behind me. Nearly took out my eye by dropping my socks. Broke my nose with my husbands head during a strobe light fight. Husband used my ribs as a spring board in the middle of the night so he could beat the shit out of the wind that had broken our mirror.", "link_id": "t3_crc4n7", "time": 1566025977}}

{"ejpwswo": {"text": "Late to the party, but here goesThree months after shoulder surgery and I was just cleared for physical activity. Went for a light jog and proceeded to slip and land on my outstretch arm... the one I had the surgery on. I undid everything. Had surgery again. Lots to repair. After surgery my surgeon came to talk to me because he wanted to know when I partially dislocated my shoulder as it hadent been on my contrast dye images or mri. I had slipped on dog pee in the hallway at home and bounced off the hallways walls and, you guessed it, landed on the shoulder. My shoulder was so screwed up that I didn\u2019t notice the additional damage from a partial dislocation just hanging out. Couple years after second surgery I\u2019m heading out for a workout. Take the stairs from the second floor to my first floor. I went down the fast way and ended up bending my arm a way it isn\u2019t suppose to bend. It was almost straight up behind me. Same arm as all my surgeries. Undid every thing once again and more than likely added in some new damage to spice things up, I tore the posterior horn of my meniscus of my left knee when I was moving two cats in carriers (one in each hand) and I turned to the side. Sewed my thumb and discovered that while my sewing machine can go through 4 layers of oiled leather... it won\u2019t go through bone. Put a pin through my thumb (through the nail bed) when I was fitting a leather vest for my husband. Bent down to pick up a pair of socks that I dropped after taking them out of the drawer, slipped on air and hit the corner of my eye on the open drawer.   Got a concussion when I was looking at new cars with my family and my dad closed the hatch on my head. Changing the blade of a super sharp exacto blade (bought the extra extra sharp replacement blades) and two blades were sticking together. So used my thumb nail to separate them. Yeah stitches through the nail bed suck. No amount of numbing helps there. Stood up on the bus because my stop was coming up. Kid ran out into the street and the bus driver slammed on the breaks, I flew forward and hit a barrier with my knee, a bolt went under my knee cap and my knee hyper extended. Was limping home and slipped on ice. Cleaning the closet and watched as a wooden dowel with an eye screw fell from the top rack and landed eye screw side down on the top of my foot. I was fully aware of the trajectory of the rod, I just decided to watch it instead of moving it. As a kid I was popping bubbles at a small local park. Jumped to pop one that was getting away and slammed my chin onto a low fence. But though my tongue. So much blood. Didn\u2019t tell my parents cuz I thought I would be in trouble. At the hairdressers with my mom and the hairdresser was letting me look through her wheels tower thing of stuff. Found the straight razor. Wanted to see how sharp it was. Hour later in the bathroom yelling to my concerned mom that I was just sick while franticly putting toilet paper on the cut to get it to stop bleeding. Again thought I would be in trouble. Babysitting kids and I\u2019m opening up these popsicles that are in thick plastic tubes where you have to cut off the tip to open them. I hold it on my mouth and when I go to cut it the scissors slip and cut about half way through my bottom lip. These were the ones I could remember off the top of my head. Family joke is that I have a private room at the hospital and an assigned parking spot, friends also joke that I need to live in bubble rap. To be honest I would still find a way to injure myself.

{"ee6mk3p": {"text": "So I played New Vegas to almost the end..... almost. Now I played New Vegas so long ago that some of this story is fuzzy but I\u2019ll try to remember it as best as I can with help from my hubby. I didn\u2019t know that there were areas you couldn\u2019t go to at low level because they were high level areas and that the enemy\u2019s didn\u2019t level with you. I wandered into deathclaw central. And I don\u2019t mean the quarry. Just random open area with some train tracks and every god damn death claw that ever existed in that game and it\u2019s babies. I made it to about center of this open area, it was quite large so it probably took me about a minute or so to get to that point. Didn\u2019t see anything on my radar or in sight so I thought I was good to explore. Then deathclaw. I managed to kill it but man it took a lot of ammo. Ok. Let\u2019s keep exploring. Another deathclaw but this ones an alpha and has babies with it. Ok, start back peddling and using everything I have to stay alive, including land mines.... all the land mines. My back peddling led me into a cave with a mother deathclaw with her babies. By this time I was out of everything I could use to hurt the deathclaw and anything I could use to heal me. I just started screaming \u2018FUCK YOU BETHESDA!!! while trying (and failing) to run away from inevitable death. Next I somehow found a keycard who knows where and somehow managed to kill Benny before I even made it to Lucky 38. Now your aren\u2019t technically suppose to do those things before you have a chance to see Mr. House, but the game doesn\u2019t really stop you, so I didn\u2019t know that. So once I wandered into lucky 38 YesMan didn\u2019t really interact with me much and I just explored what I could and I found this door that I somehow had a key for and I went in and interacted with a pod and had to make a bunch of choices. I figured it was something that involved a quest so I back out of the convo. But me being me I also decided to see what would happen if I shot the pod (not sure why I decided to do this, but I did) aaaannnnddd it killed him. Oops. I didn\u2019t know that killing Mr. House was an actual quest line where you have to make the choice to either follow through or let him be... yeah. Fast forward a bit and I get to the big battle between Cesar\u2019s legion and the NCR. I somehow managed to fall off the Hover Dam to the water and docks below. No matter what I tried, I couldn\u2019t get back to the gameplay area. I was off the damn map.

It was during the winter 2010, I don\u2019t quite remember what month but there was a lot of snow on the ground, almost knee deep in fields and such. It was about 11 at night and I was taking my dog for a walk in the nearby school field that had a small wooded area in it. I walked her their many times a day so knew the area quite well. The school has flood lights in certain areas on its permitter. So we walked through the small wooded area and into the open field, the snow had a thin layer of ice on it, so when you go off path it makes a loud cracking noise before you break through and end up mid shin to almost knee deep in snow. I didn\u2019t see anyone in the field at all, and I had a clear view of most of the field.  Naturally my dog wanted to go off path to smell all the interesting smells and I had no problem with it. So I\u2019m standing in knee high snow while my dog does it\u2019s business. My back is to the school and my dog starts growling, hackles raised and everything looking toward the school. I turn around and a person shaped black mass just standing there. I couldn\u2019t see any features, no mouth or eyes, etc. and it was in an area with no paths so it was standing in knee high snow. I didn\u2019t hear any of the crunching noise that happens when someone is walking trough that type of snow and sounds travels quite far in the stillness of winter air. So my dog is standing in front of me hackles up and growing just starting at this thing. She is normally very friendly and expects all people to give her butt scratches. And the thing starts moving towards me, no sound in the footsteps. And my dog books it back the way we came. Naturally I\u2019m holding the leash so she clothesline\u2019s herself. This snaps me out of my stupor and I start running with her. Her dragging me along. Running in deep snow is hard enough and made all the harder when your in a panic.

I would often drive my friend home after a visit and we would end up talking while I just drove aimlessly for several hours. Weird shit always happened to my friend (doors slamming, banging on walls, seeing people that shouldn\u2019t be there, stuff like that) The course we typically took while randomly driving along would meander by her duplex several times, so that if we decided to actually call it a night I could drop her off. You had to drive up a small lane to get to the duplex as there was a field between her complex and the road. During this one particular night, as we drove past her complex for the x most time that night, we got the impression that there was a very big nope in the field and now was not the time to drop her off. So we kept driving. So we come to an intersection that we both know well, lived in that area my entire life and the T part of the intersection ran along the parking lot for the neighborhoods only mall. We are sitting at the intersection waiting to turn left (it is about 2am at this point, so the roads are deserted) and I look down the street to my left and there are zero street lights. They weren\u2019t off, they just didn\u2019t exist. And I started to become aware that the street lights on the roads I was on were on my left hand side. I could have sworn they were suppose to be on the right side. I mention this to my friend and she said she was feeling super creeped out about the road with no lights. So when the light turns green I turn right instead of the planned left. As we pass her place again we now feel there is something running along side the car in that field. So again we keep going. At around 3ish am I\u2019m finally able to drop her off and I hightail it home. The next day we go for a walk and we are headed down the street towards the T intersection. As we reach the corner I just kinda stood there in shock as I say that the road to the left indeed has street lights on it and the lights on the roads we were on had its lights on the right hand side and not the left like we saw the night before. It was the weirdest feeling. I have other stories that I\u2019ll share as a separate comment thread. Edit: added a word", "link_id": "t3_9j1sr3", "time": 1537990448}}

(Specifically if the ADHD med is SSR1 based)While studying for my exams in anatomy, development, and other heavy load courses I always did a couple things. A lot of these things are your standard recommend things... because they work :pI always listen to video game music. It\u2019s designed to make people focus on the game. And this in turn can help you focus on other tasks. I just search up playlists on Spotify or similar where there aren\u2019t ads to interrupt and distract me. I took frequent study breaks. Study for a half hour then go take a brief walk, stand outside, do the dishes, do anything that doesn\u2019t require a whole lot of critical thinking and let\u2019s you just zone out and be but also let\u2019s you get some energetic out. Bonus when you do some house work.. less likely to procrastinate by cleaning the whole place instead of studying. Go to the gym or however working out works for you. It increases blood flow and burns off excess energy so your more likely to focus. Just don\u2019t over do it to the point that you want to nap instead. Speaking of that nap, remember to sleep. You may think that you will do better if you get more studying crammed in but when it comes at the cost of sleep... you aren\u2019t doing yourself any favors. Not only is sleep when your brain sorta and store all that you have been studying, but you are risking mania if you don\u2019t get enough. If you do get distracted... it happens. Have a plan in place for when it does. I had friends watch to see if I logged into Facebook and send me messages telling me to get off and study. Also had friends who knew nothing about what I was learning ask me questions so I had to teach it to them. Really made things stick. As for the PTSD angle. I never really had it interfere with my school work until we came to my last semester about mental health and we talked about trauma (rape, abuse, etc) I just made sure to let my prof know, had a friend in class who I could study the material with and who could watch me for signs of being triggered and would tell me when I had done enough on that topic for the day, here\u2019s a cat video. Use your supports. They are a valuable life line.  Find a better group if you feel yours is no good. I stopped going to my therapist as she frequently was falling a sleeping in our sessions. (Never actually fell asleep, but she often came close... head bobbing, eyes half closed) and if you don\u2019t feel supported, it can take you back instead of helping you forward. But you have already recognized that :) hopefully you find a better fit for you soon. Edit: after reading other people\u2019s responses I realized you were probably meaning the disassociation and such of PTSD not just/only the triggered part.

Typically it has to do with one of you quad muscles being weaker than the others and not keeping the kneecap in place with movement. If that is the cause then it can be treated but any damage done (ie: arthritis) is there to stay. General info about [Patellofemoral pain syndrome ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellofemoral_pain_syndrome)  Personally my rectus femoris was very tight and pulled my kneecap up, so it had to be extensively stretched and my vastus medialis had wasted quite a bit due to injury causing it to also deviate laterally. So I have a bunch of excercises prescribed to target and rebuild it. Those include step downs (similar to pistol squats but done only for the beginning of the movement to about the depth of a stair and you concentrate on making sure the knee tracks straight), sitting leg lifts (leg straight out in front of you while sitting on floor, flex quads and lift the leg as high off the floor as you can. Do till failure) knee extensions but do not put the pad across the top of your thigh, it restricts you leg and can damage your knee, box squats with a band around my lower thighs and hip adductions as glute med. tends to weaken if someone has been limping for an amount of time. [Taping](https://youtu.be/AAqU0mu3-ic) the kneecap in place with kinesiology tape is also helpful. You can buy precut strips of the tape at shoppers drug mart where I am.., so you should be able to get it in stores where you are. I would recommend at least being checked by a PT if you can. If you can't, have a friend who is good at proportions look very carefully at both your knees while you stand naturally (wear shorts). Have them note any differences between the affected and unaffected leg. When sitting put you hand over you knee cap and bend and straighten your knee and if it grinds that means it is deviating.

It can send me into a depressive cycle or a rage in a hurry. )So No. I don't think you over reacted. Over reacting would have been the strangling from the Christmas before, yelling at each other, calling your dad a fuck head while you flipped the coffee table and then stomped out. You felt attacked, and instead of reacting to the stressor (your dad) you tried to express why it upset you and then when that didn't work you removed yourself from the situation. Once you calmed down you called your family to reconnect and figure out the plans for the next day. Isn't that what our therapies and therapists try to teach us?

This site explains it alot better than i canhttps://woundcareadvisor.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-transparent-film-dressings-vol3-no4/Ever since i started using this stuff, my tattoos heal better, faster and with little to no touch ups. The bandages can breath, but outside contaminants cant get in. So great for germ filled environments like the gym :)It does take a bit of practice to learn how to put the bandages on. essentially cut the size of bandage you need (mine comes in a roll) and peel the backing off a small area at the top or bottom (or one of the sides. your choice) And place it on undamaged skin next to the tattoo, then slowly pull the backing while slightly stretching the film over the tattooed area. gently pat down once down. Only change when you notice fluid pooling in the bandage (for me i noticed it was every other day or so) the bandage doesnt stick to damaged areas, only healthy skin. So taking it off is fine. clean as normal, then air dry and apply a new bandage.My tattooist shop was selling these bandages by the roll and another friend got them from the hospital where she works for her tattoos. I HIGHLY recommend this :)edit: For reference I have 23 tattoos and ive used this type of bandage on 4 of them. Wish I had come across it sooner.Second edit: read more of the other responses. They are all correct in that you should take a couple days off the gym after a tattoo. It counts as major trauma and your body will respond as such. ", "link_id": "t3_5bumx7", "time": 1478930191}}

I emailed her today mentioning that in accordance with my accommodation letter written by the university she is to work with me when it comes to missed time if grading is giving based on class participation. (I worded it ALOT better) I mentioned that I was trying really hard to try to not let my disabilities impact my studies but that was not a realistic expectation and if there was anything we could do for future missed classes. Her response was that it was only 2%. So it wasent a big deal. Ummmm. I have surgery in 2 weeks. I could miss a week of classes. 4% there. And we haven't even hit mid terms yet. So already down 6%. So now my disability is impacting me academically. This class is suppose to be all about communication. Yeah. I think she chose the wrong field. ", "link_id": "t3_53y12d", "time": 1474615914}}
