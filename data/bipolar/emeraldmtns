My dog Toby got attacked at the dog park and his ear was slit open. He was the type of dog that wasn't traumatized from it and recovered well. However, my girl Rosie who witnessed the attack was so traumatized because she tried to help him and couldn't stop it She was abused in the past before we got her and is very sensitive. Now she is reactive to certain dogs. I have to be careful now. What helps is hanging out with family and friends dogs. Letting them greet each other slowly and carefully. Walk alongside each other for first meeting on leashes. Rosie is a lot better now since we have been spending time with her close dog friends.

{"dze68th": {"text": "Bipolar 2 here. I'm a 24 year old female. During my childhood there was signs... depression, anxiety, paranoia, manic states. I remember being 7 years old and hiding under my window because I was convinced my neighbors were watching me. I remember amazing feelings of joy and connectedness...maybe mania.... As a preteen/teen I spent a lot of time crying myself to sleep. I also would stay awake for days on end, doing art, creating things. Around 16 my depression was so bad I told my mom I needed help. Saw a psychiatrist who was kind of a money hungry Quack.He prescribed me antidepressants and adhd meds immediately...the added \"positives\" ended up pushing me up, and I ended up in a state of mania for weeks. I never ate, I looked like a tweaker, I lost my virginity in a foursome, I was doing drugs and fucking random men from the internet. Self harming, having periods of psychosis...i remember driving and the lights felt like they were blurry and moving ....I disassociated often, feeling like I wasn't real. The mania slowed down, and then I ended up attempting suicide. Meds are a horrible experience because it's like a cocktail of chemicals where you don't know how it will effect you. Some have nasty side effects. Also being told you have bipolar disorder is a very hard reality to cope with. It makes sense so it's kind of a relief, but then again I was 17 so the first thing  \"wow I am a crazy person, I will have this the rest of my life, This hopeless\"I guess what I would want someone to know about bipolar disorder is those effected by it are your coworkers, your community members, your banker, your kids teacher. It is something that we keep to ourselves because you don't want to be judged. I will wake up one day and feel an overwhelming feeling to want to kill myself. That I am worthless, ugly, stupid and the world is better off without me. I may know these things are true, but my brain is doing a hell of a job to make me feel like it's true. The emotional pain is so large and encompassing. It feels like you are in the end of a hole you can't get out of.If someone ever confides in you and tells you they have bipolar disorder, hug them.

But thanks for calling that out for what it is. Because I *do* trust him, we have a great relationship and we see ourselves marrying someday. In the past Ive accepted that she might have some feelings for him but his hearts with me and umtimately human relationships are complex and they mean a lot to eachother as friends, and I'm grateful he has her as a friend because she is a great friend to him. I care about her too because he loves her and I love her too. She's a good person and has been really kind to me. Rather than holding onto fear and my insecurities I should act with love and trust him because he's trust worthy, and just love him.

{"dqcl07r": {"text": "Thank you so much for replying Thomas. I will definitely look up NAC and I actually just bought some vitamin D!In terms of my weekly routine: M-Thursday I work as a nanny from 2pm to 9pm. Sometimes I do overnights and my schedule is always different. I struggle to sleep during overnights and actually just last Tuesday I did a 14 hour day, and then stayed up with insomnia during the overnight which brought on a manic episode, I didn't fall asleep until 11:30pm Wednesday night. Its a LONG story but I have come to the decision that it would be the best for me if I left this job. I have been with this family for a year and a half. Working with children is my gift and my joy. It is very hard work. I manage all her activities, coordinate with the family, do school pickup and drop off sometimes, overnights,  cook meals etc. This family is a single Dad and a 10 year old girl who have been through a lot. I love them but I only work 20 hours a week and it's not enough for me financially. Also, there is ALOT of family drama and it is heavy. The girl is very difficult and it is emotionally exhausting. I love them and I have had great times with her. I love her. Hiwever, they have been through a lot with her mom and it shows in her behavior. She struggled with extreme anger, disrespect, managing her emotions in a healthy way and boundaries. She can be a spoiled brat and she pretty much runs the show. Her dad is a great dad and does his best but he works all the time and I feel like it must be difficult being a single parent pretty much and dealing with her crazy mom and his kid who suffers for it, so he feels guilty and has a hard time saying no and spoils her which makes it worse. This makes my job very difficult. I do my best and her dad has told me that she is so much happier and doing so much better since I've worked with her. She has learned how to swim, how to play piano which has healed her crooked finger. That is why it is so hard for me to leave. This makes me feel sad and scared. Sad because I love this family and I worry about what would happen to the kid after I leave , and I was hoping for more time with this job and for it to end more positively. Scared because I worry that because I have bipolar I question all my decisions and worry I will regret them. However , my intuition tells me this is right financially and for my health. I have to trust they will be okay and I know they will. In the times I don't work I spend time cleaning, reading, writing, doing art, hiking, going to the beach, and spending time in the forest or mountains. In the mornings before work I spend time with my boyfriend reading or hanging out. He is very supportive,understanding, and we have a really healthy relationship. I love him dearly and we plan on marrying in the future. Now that you have asked , my weekly routine has changed in these past months I have been depressed. I used to work out more, hike more and socialize way more. I have isolated myself these past few months and although I already have few friends here I see them even less lately. I also have been spending more time watching Netflix or staying inside then I used to. In the summer I would be at the river, camping, or hiking a lot more. I have gained weight these past three months which has been hard. I just haven't wanted to see anyone or go anywhere.Basically I have been depressed for months, June I'd say. It's November now.  I got out of an abusive relationship three years ago that was traumatizing and I haven't seen a therapist since way before then. I feel like I need more healing to do. I have a wonderful boyfriend,  I love my rural town, my cat, and our cozy house. Yet I am still struggling. This has made me realize that it is my illness which is why I am this way and I need to adress it. I have been white knuckling it for months now and I am at the end of my rope. I am stressed about possibly quitting my job and maybe even going out of town. I used to be against medication because I had horrible experiences with it but now I am ready.  Now that I have explained everything(sorry for the novel haha) Thank you for the last paragraph you wrote. I actually have been considering this for weeks. My family lives in an urban area and my family is really supportive about my bipolar. My best friends live down there and I have no-one I am really close to up where I live now besides my boyfriend. I miss my best friends who are girls who unconditionally love me and support me and understand me. I miss My grandparents,my cousins, my family. I miss my whole small town that knows me, my entire support system is down there. Also, my old psychiatrist who is awesome is there.That is why I have considered going home for a couple months to get stable. See my therapist and psychiatrist who already know me and I trust, be with my whole family and best friends, be in my hometown I love so much, focus on getting well. However, I definitely don't want to move home permanently because I do love the place I live now, I love the country and living in the woods. Also, my boyfriend is finishing his degree and I can't break up with him. He knows me better then anyone in my life and is just the best guy ever. He's my soulmate and my best friend. He has helped me heal in a lot of ways. We plan on marrying. But I could see how going home for 3 months would be the best thing to do. My boyfriend can always visit and 3 months away from eachother is nothing compared to us spending our lives together. I've mentioned this idea to him and he said he would miss me but he would support me and knows it may be good for me. He even mentioned how he wants me to spend some quality time with my family because he knows it would be good for me. I just worry about doing that because I don't want to abandon him and I worry I will miss him to much. I also was planning on going to school in January , going back to community college. That is why my other plan was to find a new job, then quit my current one, and go to school, while also finding a new therapist and psychiatrist .  However last time I went to school while depressed I failed. And I have tried to see a therapist or psychiatrist here but it is so difficult and stressful. And when I think about doing that plan, it gives me anxiety. Pushing through, finding a new job then quitting my old one, finding a new psychiatrist And going to school.... And it kinda feels like what I've already bean doing. \"Doing the same thing over and over while expecting the same result is the definition of insanity\" When I think of going home and staying with family and seeing my old psychiatrist who I trust and being home for three months I feel a feeling of huge relief. I just worry that it would be me being irresponsible and abandoning my partner and I may be embarrassed to be home, why can't I just fix myself here?But then again going away for a while, in a comforting loving place with a strong support system and a great doctor sounds like the right plan. Right now I have to decide asap. Thank you so much for your reply. I have thought so much about this these past couple months and have moved more and more towards acveptance about my diagnoses. Responding to your questions kind of just reminded me of what I already know. Thank you, and hugs\u2661", "link_id": "t3_7fil07", "time": 1511674133}}

I had always struggled my whole life, and around 15 is when I got worse as well. I also had 2 other friends who were dealing with depression. At 17 I had mental breakdown after a manic episode and tried to commit suicide, ended up in the hospital for weeks. I got better, moved away, went back to school but then the past couple years have been so hard. I'm 24 now. I've been trying to see a therapist but I live in a rural area and it's so hard to find a good doctor with availability. I've been unmedicated for a couple years and I was in so much denial. But now I have been left with myself and have accepted that this illness rules my life. I feel like I've been white knuckling it for weeks, doing my best at work, every day being a hard struggle, moving forward when Holland then only to take 3 steps back when the depression comes back. I have been thinking of going back home for a couple months and focusing on getting well, and seeing my old psychiatrist who was great. I really loved how you talked about acceptance. Accepting yourself and accepting this illness. I've been fighting this illness trying to keep it to myself and function the best I can but it's tiring. I just want to get better.

Plaza grill has great choices. Simmer down Jamaican food truck in Arcata is yummy. Cafe Phoenix is delicious wholesome brunch/lunch and it is SUCH great quality and so yummy!!!! Wildflower cafe is vegetarian food and sosososo goood. They are open late nights. In Eureka Siam Orchid has delicious Thai Food. Annie's Cambodian is best asian food in the county in my opinion. Then there is Cafe Nooner which is delicous. Annie's Asian Subs is drive thru and has bbq pulled pork sandwhiches, tofu sandwich, chicken sandwhiches and is really delicious. Esmerelda's has good mexican food. Lost Coast Brewery. Humboldt Soup Company. 6th &amp; E. Golden Harvest. 101 BBQ Steakhouse right on the 101. AJ Ichiban has soup and good japanese bento boxes as well as sushi. There are so many options! Not worth it to go to chain places.

She trusts you and you don't want to lose that trust. If she wants to be mature and grown up, then level up with her and tell her how you really feel about what she is doing. Try not to shame her. Just get real. Drinking and smoking and partying at a young age puts you in dangerous positions. I Partied at a young age and subsequently experienced bad situations I wish I would forget. I also ended up neglecting school because of it. Talk to her about it and share your own experiences and how you know her actions have consequences .  Talk to her about trust with her parents and how she shouldn't want to lose their trust. And how partying is bad for her body. And how the sex part of a young highschoolers life these days is pretty messed up and many of us women feel pressured to have sex at young age and especially when partying. She probably also is struggling with some emotional stuff so try to talk to her about thay and see if she's been keeping painful feelings inside.Also be real with her and tell her that it puts you in an uncomfortable position when she tells you these things and you are going to have to tell her parents. Girls get raped and taken advantage of when drinking underage and people get hurt and it just adds to depression.

Tell him that you can see he is depressed and feeling cold. And that you miss being loving with him and having fun with him. But you understand that he is depressed right now. So if he needs anything you are here.Then go about your business and focus on yourself.I definitely know what your talking about though. Granted, everyones experience is different and I would make sure to ask yourself if you feel like your needs are being met and that you feel like he isn't taking you emotionally hostage.Sometimes, I'll wake up feeling really cold and depressed. I am extremely down and self harsh on myself during those times. I am not good enough for myself. I have a boyfriend, 32/M.

Lately, I truly feel sick in my head. Every day my mind state is different, and although I am nowhere as near as bad as I was at 17/18, these days im starting to unravel. Before I could blame it on my ex(abusive relationship), or I'm feeling like this because of my shitty living situation, or the fact I had no friends or being lonely. Now I have a great boyfriend of 1 year, good place(we live togeyhet) great job(I'm a nanny)...and so all that I'm left with is myself. I have all these goals that I keep trying to achieve but I feel like I'm just running in circles. Nobody understands really. I feel like I alienate myself from any friends I might have and I'm starting to ruin my relationship. I'm afraid I do be 30 and have no accomplishments.

I'm 24 and have been smoking marijuana since 16 off and on. I've never experienced a marijuana induced psychosis, especially with those extreme delusions.

{"dmzo29k": {"text": "i was diagnosed at 17 with bipolar disorder. I felt exactly how you do- hopeless. I still feel hopless about my diagnosis sometimes and that i want to push everyone away. But I have grown a lot since my my diagnosis. It has been 6 years. I still have suicidal thoughts and get depressed sometimes. But nothing like before. There's an inner strength inside I can stand on and provide me stability. There is strength inside of you, believe me, even if you can't feel it it's there. You are strong. At 17 right after my attempt, I was incredibly depressed and kept it all inside. I  was hospitalized for two weeks, and it's scary to be at the hospital. Then I'm having these unempthetic doctors saying \"yep you have bipolar disorder and your brain is going to be like this forever\". I felt the same way...well I'm fucked. It was dehumanizing and scary. In this age once I got home of course I fucking googled bipolar disorder. And everything you read is \"people who attempt are more likely to die in another attempt\" \"people with bipolar turn to drug abuse, self harm, eating disorders and have trouble keeping relationship\" The information that is immediately available is the opposite of empowering. I felt hopeless.The therapist I had at the time wasn't good and recommended me to go this clinic called Amen Clinics. A rich Newport doctor who many called a quak science...but he was rich and successful. Looking back, it wasn't right and it felt like a money scheme.  My mom was scared so she listened to the doctor and borrowed money so I could do treatment at his clinics. They injected me with isotope and it lit  up my brain. They scanned it. They made a book of pictures of my brain and their analysis. You know what the type of brain they labeled me with having?Ring of Fire. Yep. Their official name for my type of brain was Ring of Fire. What the fuck? Is that supposed to make me feel better about myself? No, it made me feel worse.The years following I was in a dark hole. I used drugs, self harmed, had dark sexual encounters in sketchy places which were a different form of self harm, I was miserable to be around, and attempted a few times, and I remember lying in bed feeling the most unimaginable emotional pain and truly seeing my future and seeing just no hope.Well guess what? There was hope.Somehow, along the way, I had a breakthrough. Around 19 years old(3 years later) I began to pull myself out of that dark hole. I cut off toxic friendships. I hung out with people who loved me and supported me and were true friends. They were there for me and understanding about my bipolar disorder. I had a great therapist who really helped me. She was really educated and also had a more holistic view on healing. I spent time outdoors more doing things I loved. I took care of myself. I faced things I was in denial about and I also began to hold myself accountable for my own wrong doings. I started to feel really connected to my spirituality. I spent time with family and understood my roots. I sought out wisdom and light and happiness. It got better. I was happy and stable. Developed tools to manage my moods and take care of myself.I remember crying tears of happiness because I had hope again.At 21 I went backwards and a friend of mine developed a romantic relationship with me. He is a sociopathic, psychotic, abusive person. There were red flags but he was very controlling and abused me physically, emotionally, and psychologically. We moved to northern California together. I left him after 2 years of abuse. I was living alone in a wonderful place , and it was hard and I was lonely. But I grew a lot after the breakup. I made friends. I had adventures. I started school, and I cried afyer my first day because at one point i looked into my future and truly believed i wouldnt make it to 22. Yeah, I still went through hard times and depression and mania and fuck ups. But I also had some really meaningful, beautiful memories. I fell in love a year ago with a man who treats me so amazing and our relationship has been amazing, we are a great partnership. This past year with him has been the best year of my life and I've done amazing things- traveled, gone to shows, made friends, had adventures, learned a lot. I work as a nanny and I've helped a lot of children. Im a nanny, and I always get insecure and My self worth is low but just today my boss of one year told me how much he appreciates me and how amazing I am at my job because I've helped his daughter so much.Her mom isnt in the picture, she is 9 years old and struggles with some heavy issues and depression, and because of my own issues I've overcome I help her and empathize with her, I unxerstand her. \u2661Basically, my point is, dont give up yet. You were just diagnosed. Yes you are going through rough emotions and yes life is going to be tricky for us but we are not hopeless. We have this gift of life- a whole world to discover, places to go, people to meet. Just because you have a mood disorder it doesnt mean that you deserve pain and to die. Have fun! Live and explore the world. Why not? It's there for us to experience. We have a gift of life and it is precious, to wake every day and see the great dawn that fills the world. And also we have this remarkable ability to help others. even if you can barely help yourself, you can be of service to others and make their life a little easier. :) You got this. Dont give up. Take care of yourself. Go into nature. Be gentle and nonjudgemental of yourself as you would a child...Tell your family. They will love and accept you. You don't have to be perfect and these days people are more and more accepting and understanding about bipolar disorder.:) You have to revel in the darkest corners of your soul in order to dance unapologetically in the light.

My mom gave me this advise that has really helped me this past year with showing up for commitments. \"80% of life is just showing up\" and it's true. Its hard to show up for ourselves when noone is holding us accountable. I hope you figure it out because I'm currently going through rough time right now and everything you said I relate too, and it's super relevant in my life right now.I'm new to bipolar reddit. So it's a huge relief to see how I'm not alone in these crazy emotional inner struggles I've been dealing with (or putting myself through).I have all these things I want to do and write down in to do lists to do and feel inspired to do to accomplish my dreams and be happier and healthier...yet I avoid them. It feels like I'm trapped in myself and paralyzed.Today, I saw something that reminded me of my situation. My front doorway is french doors that are made of glass. One door was left open, the other one closed.As I'm walking by, I hear this buzzing sound. A wasp was in front of the closed glass door , repeatedly hitting itself on the glass trying to get outside. He accidently flew into the house, and in his attempt to fly back into the sunny day he hit the glass door.  He kept trying different areas but kept hitting the door. He could see outside clearly...the trees, grass, fresh air and sunshine. But he kept hitting the glass while trying to fly there.  The pathetic part was that two inches away from the wasp was the open doorway, because the other door was left open. He couldn't see it though and was struggling. This frantic struggle reminded me of myself. I can see my dreams, my future, my accomplishments,health and happiness. I can clearly see the path to get there. I know. But every time I try to go full speed ahead in that direction, I hit an invisible wall before I barely even start.I feel like I'm the wasp, and my own brain is the glass door.", "link_id": "t3_6zp4ti", "time": 1505388680}}
