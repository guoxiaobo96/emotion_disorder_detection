Keep in mind to not put folders within folders or the CC won't show up. If your game is crashing on startup it means a mod is broken in which case take out sections of your mods folder until you narrow down which file it is.Some CC will require meshes to work so pay attention to posts! An easy way to find and delete CC with missing meshes is by downloading Sims 4 Studio and going into the My CC option and clicking through all of your CC clothing items with missing meshes will be pretty obvious in game and in S4S.
