I frequently think \u201cwhy do something if I can\u2019t do it perfectly the first time around?\u201d Sucks when trying to learn something that takes a lot of practice. Bipolar and adhd go hand in hand so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you get a positive diagnosis. I\u2019ve been diagnosed bipolar since I was 19 and five years later finally diagnosed with adhd. I\u2019m not sure if you can relate but when I am doing well in the bipolar realm, that\u2019s when I struggle the most with adhd. Sometimes it gets overridden with anxiety/mania/depression, but when everything else is in check, my adhd comes out to play hardcore.

Im perpetually exhausted (have been since I was a kid) but Ive noticed that when I do more to take care of myself (exercise more, eat healthier, get in a strict routine) I am SO MUCH BETTER. The problem is the 'action' aspect of this, which is where my ADHD comes in. Logically I know how to feel better, but its so hard to just DO IT. Its truly a never-ending battle.I recently got a job (before all this corona shit) and worked for two weeks and the routine boosted my mood and energy so much. I could say I was actually happy for once. Now, I am in quarantine and have no real routine (except a little sleep routine) and I feel so down, lethargic, and depressed. Taking care of myself has gotten harder and I desperately need social interaction. With ADHD, I am horrible at giving myself structure, but when it is provided to me (IE: a job, or an outside responsibility) I do much better and am able to construct a routine. When I have a routine, I cycle less and am so much more stable with my moods. I truly believe that bipolar people NEED a routine to be their best self. My only problem with Latuda is the nausea. I have to take anti nausea meds no matter how much I eat with it.

Usually his response is along the lines of 'that makes sense. I noticed you were acting a bit off. is there anything I can do?'. It is a lifesaver to have someone who supports you and doesn't stigmatize the things you go through. Its also important to note that your bipolar does not define you.

Knowing exactly what you have will help you get the right medication. Some of the things you described seem to be symptoms of ADHD too, though I am no doctor. Worth a shot to get tested.As I am sensitive to medication, I know when a medication not working within the first few weeks.

A gradual and soft approach is always good if you are able to handle it (aka, not needing to be hospitalized).

When episodes happen unmedicated, its like your brain gets a little more fried each time, leading to eventual crappiness in your head.Obviously meds aren't for everyone, but if you are suffering and unable to cope on your own, I highly suggest going that route (gradually of course).

{"evecov0": {"text": "Turbo tax is the easiest and user-friendly I have found. I don't actually know what I am doing or why when I do my taxes but I haven't had any issues yet. If you have that paper that your work gives you at the beginning of the year (W2), you should be good to go. As for the car stuff, it probably won't be as bad as you think. People at the DMV are used pretty much everyone not knowing what they need to do. Car mechanics are something else though. Ask around for friends or family to see if they have a good one that they trust. Sometimes mechanics will give you higher prices if they can see you don't know about pricing.Good luck!", "link_id": "t3_cjd3aj", "time": 1564462731}}
{"ev9sr7b": {"text": "This hit home for me. I've been through the same thing. I was diagnosed at 19 and am almost 23 now. I have moved cities about 4 times since then (do not recommend). Lots of medication changes and therapy. I haven't been able to finish my degree since dropping out around the time I was diagnosed, much to my parent's frustration. Currently I am unemployed, living off my significant other's parents (dwindling) money in a city we randomly moved to, and I am struggling worse that I have ever have. I would love to tell you it gets easier but I would be lying. I do see people on this sub that are older and successful that have been dealing with this illness for their whole life, so I always hope that one day I will get there too. I have been trying to keep track of the things that I like and what makes me happy in the moment. (media, music, etc) It helps to write down what you enjoy, so when you are in one of those moods where you don't remember your old self, you can look and maybe remember and enjoy some things again.Just know that you aren't alone.", "link_id": "t3_civ7ri", "time": 1564330317}}

{"ev1lmof": {"text": "If you are really wanting to go to work, I suggest prepping as much as possible the night before. I find in my depressive episodes mornings are the worst for me. If you can manage, make your meals, set out your clothes, and shower in the evening so mornings are quick if you decide to sleep in till the last minute like I do. Music also helps me a lot when I am very depressed. On your way to work listen to your favorite music. Maybe bring some headphones to listen on your lunch break if you have one. Also, humor has gotten me through some really tough times. At night maybe watch a stand up comedy bit on netflix if you can. If you don't have netflix, youtube usually has 'funny moments' compilations that will make you smile and maybe laugh a bit which helps tremendously! All in all, don't forget that the way you are feeling isn't forever. I always seem to forget this bit when I am depressed. You will eventually come out of it and keep on going. Good luck &lt;3", "link_id": "t3_ci0t3h", "time": 1564160877}}
