At this point I knew whatever it was was following me through the house. I started crying and my Dad kept urging me to go outside to my car and drive over. I made it to the first floor just in time for a tap to sound on one of the lower windows. I ran hysterical into the bathroom, my dog going insane while my Dad told me to make a run for it. I agreed, as I came out of the bathroom I found my front door was open but before I could react my dog bolted outside. On instinct I chased him out the door and came face to face with an ex boyfriend of mine.

CONS: Not great for underdeveloped brains. Cocaine: Starts natural but is processed with gasoline to get the powder most enjoy. Considered completely recreational as far as I know. Did you wanna be awake? Cause guess what you're awake! CONS: Seems to be extremely addictive to some. Will cut the fuck out of your nose after snorting for a while and doesn't taste good.Molly/MDMA: Made completely in a lab (if you're lucky). Great colors. Best colors. No one's ever seen better colors. Very warm, warmest actually. Trailing lights? We got trailing lights! CONS: Will cut up your nose, tastes awful and can lead to chemical brain imbalances.LSD: Again made in a lab. I've done between half a hit to 3 1/3 hits and I've never once regretted it. Visuals are quite dramatic and the effect lasts 8+ hours. CONS: You can easily regret who you are with or where you are when taking it, \"good vibes\" ain't no joke. Hard to find and not great for young brains.Pills: Just don't. Really, honestly, don't. CONS: Take one too many or mix the wrong thing and that's your last party bud. Highly addictive. Expensive. Heroin: Now a days can be cut with deadly fentanyl. Finding it pure is close to impossible I imagine though I don't have personal experience. Massive depressant. Highly addictive. CONS: Deadly.Meth: You hope this was lab made and not from Jim-Bob down the road. Cocaine X 25. Been told it tastes awful but feels amazing. No personal experience. CONS: Everyone can tell you're on meth. Did you want to be awake for 4 days with bees in your teeth and the thought the FBI are waiting outside? Highly addictive, visibly deteriorates the body.Drugs are a journey that everyone has to decide on their own. When you're of age and ready I'd start with marijuana and see how you feel. It may really be all you need to feel satisfied. My personal motto has always been no heroin or meth and I'd suggest that to anyone.

What you're describing sound like you could possibly benefit from medicine which trust me I don't say lightly.

Funny enough I'm only about 5 miles from an airport and we had a crash last October but no plan could be seen in the clouds. The whole situation lasted a solid 20 minutes at least and at one point my hair stood on end as the sound escalated to such a level I expected something to fall from the sky.", "link_id": "t3_f0e4ui", "time": 1581098906}}
