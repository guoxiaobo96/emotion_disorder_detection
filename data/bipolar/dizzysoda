Brujeria is often looked down on by the church and religious Latinos because Brujas are often associated with the devil. Brujas can choose to do \u201cdark\u201d magic but many choose not to.

I\u2019m aiming at eventually getting my Ph.D and teaching English at the college level, though I\u2019m still at a community college, so I have a long way to go.I don\u2019t have a job. Last time I had a job, I seriously felt like killing myself every day I was there. I\u2019d curl up in bed and sob my eyes out whenever I got home. I\u2019m only 20, so I don\u2019t have a lot of experience though. I\u2019ve decided to only focus on school, and go full time with 12 units a semester.I go to therapy weekly and see my psychiatrist once a month at least. Sometimes I see her once every 2 weeks, which I\u2019m doing right now because I\u2019m switching meds. I\u2019ve been on 8 psych meds total, and after 4.5 years, I\u2019m still trying to find the right med combo. Some meds have really worked for me, but the side effects caused me and my psychiatrist to agree to try something else. I have tardive dyskinesia because of antipsychotics, it might be permanent but we\u2019re not sure yet. I\u2019m on Lamictal, Trazodone, and Abilify right now. Lamictal has saved my life, the only thing we\u2019re working on right now is finding a good antipsychotic, so I hope Abilify works.Although we\u2019re not the closest, I do have friends. I see them every once in a while and we have fun. I have issues with moderation when it comes to drugs and alcohol (I don\u2019t touch any of it anymore), so I\u2019m lucky that they don\u2019t partake around me. None of them know that I\u2019m schizoaffective, but they\u2019re supportive of my sexuality and gender identity so I feel lucky. I also have a wonderful boyfriend who supports me to the moon and back, and is the sweetest in the world when it comes to my symptoms. He accepts me wholeheartedly and I\u2019ve never felt that before, he makes me very happy.My family is really supportive. When my symptoms get really bad, my mom stays with me the entire time and watches movies with me to help me calm down and get distracted. She listens to me and takes me to my appointments when I\u2019m too tired to drive, or when I\u2019m experiencing hallucinations. My dad and siblings don\u2019t totally understand but they support me too. My extended family doesn\u2019t know and I intent to keep it that way, or else I\u2019ll be gossiped about forever.Overall I think my life is pretty okay. I haven\u2019t felt depressed in a whole year because of Lamictal, so I can apply the skills I learn in therapy without depression getting in the way. My therapist is very proud of me for how far I\u2019ve come- she said I don\u2019t really need constant therapy anymore but we\u2019re gonna finish up DBT anyway. I feel fulfilled in my relationships. School keeps me busy and provides a routine for me, which keeps me on track. I think I\u2019m okay because I have a lot of support in my life.

Thinking things like, \u201cAm I willing to break hundreds of years of tradition to do something to reflect my values?\u201d.. I was under the impression that veganism is white. When I first started, I cooked a lot of American dishes, but I\u2019ve been trying to modify my mother\u2019s recipes so that I could still eat them. I still celebrate my culture, but I\u2019ve modified it slightly to accommodate my needs. It\u2019s a very difficult thing to wrestle with, but looking up to people of color in the vegan community made it easier.

You can always make smoothie bowls or nice cream with fruits and veggies as well. Not so healthy, but I occasionally make cauliflower wings and they taste really good and have a great texture. Pairing fruits and veggies with other things might help too (apples with peanut butter, bananas dipped in melted dark chocolate and put in the fridge to harden, vegetable chips baked with salt, sweet potato fries covered in cajun seasoning, throwing/blending fruit into coconut yogurt, crackers or carrots with hummus, etc). There\u2019s also brands of pasta that are made out of spinach or lentils or other vegetables/legumes instead of wheat. I get all my ideas from Pinterest, and occasionally I look at lunchbox ideas for vegan kids to find foods that are easy to make, simple, and yummy.

To start T and get approved for surgeries, you have to go to their gender orientation (basically a one hour class telling you what being trans means... lol), go to a gender therapist through Kaiser, and attend a trans support group weekly if possible (also through Kaiser). Also, all of your surgeries have to be done from surgeons within Kaiser, and I\u2019ve heard that none of their surgeons are allowed to post pictures of results online...
