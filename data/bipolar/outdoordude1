{"ff611km": {"text": "Exercise is extremely useful. It allows you to stop your conscious thoughts in the moment, and releases endorphins which makes you feel good. However, from a personal perspective. When i hadnt a clue what was going on, going from feeling amazing to unable to deal with life every few days, even when i went on a run, i would feel good during and about 5 minutes after it and then went back to feeling the heavy, apathetic feeling which overtook both my body and mind. I am in no way denying that CBT can be a very useful tool in tackling mental health issues. I in fact have used it myself to correct some of my faulty thinking patterns surrounding how i relate to people and deal with some anxiety. I feel like ive always had quite a rational conscious mind that could recognize these thoughts and try to consciously correct them.However, no amount of these two strategies could correct that oscillation of mood that happened without rhyme or reason. When i went on medication it was like night and day and i cant even begin to imagine what life would be like without them.I absolutely agree that a routine schedule and being in touch with what makes you feel comfortable and positive is absolutely vital in grounding yourself and is a great beginning.  I realised that i needed to par my life back and simplify it, stop trying to be the social extrovert in 3 friendship groups (which the hypomania made me feel like) and just accept that a few good friends and chilling at home a lot of the time is definitely more and thats absolutely fine.I'm glad things are working for you!

They are just held in place with some spring tabs. Pull the old wick out as much as possible but some will stick. You can burn this off with a jet lighter if you have one. When replacing the wick make the end into a little point so that you can thread it through easier. When it's properly in place you can trim it to the size you want. When replacing the chimney bend the tabs outwards slightly so you almost have to apply a bit of pressure to get them back into the housing. This will ensure they slot back in.

When the music is melodic and euphoric in its own right, people seems to gain energy from that and are largely there for the music.

But I took it at 9pm and I only took another little dose at 5am the next morning because the music just gave me all the euphoria I needed. It was amazing. I judge a night on how good it is by how little drugs I take. The euphoria should come from the music and people. I just need a little drugs to keep my energy levels up if the music is good enough.

I started looking around trying to decide what one would be best and reading all the t-Rex comments about stronglifts. In the end this is what I thought. I was quite nervous so I didn't want to be messing about with loads of different complex exercises. So i got the stronglifts app which makes it super simple and it only consists of 3 lifts in one workout.  To start with I can complete it in 30 - 45mins so it makes it nice and easy to start off with. Then in like 3 - 6months you can look at changing it up when you're more confident at the gym. Best thing you can do is just get your ass to the gym. Hope this helps :)", "link_id": "t3_4f1xed", "time": 1460814971}}

When I measure them the waist measured 36 even though they're labeled as a 32. Would anybody be able to explain why this is. I did message the seller to ask the measurments but he said they were already packed up so he couldn't but he assured me that if I was a regular 32 then they would fit fine.
