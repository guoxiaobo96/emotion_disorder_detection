I grew up in the Lutheran faith (but in the Missouri Synod church, not the Evangelical Lutheran church that Noah\u2019s congregation is a part of) and I have memories of my home pastor talking about the \u201cevils\u201d of homosexuality. It really messed me up for a long time.I remember laying in bed at night thinking about how I was planning on forcing myself to find a man and settle down and ignore any lesbian feelings, all for the sake of this religion I grew up in. I believed that people should be able to openly love whoever they love, but i felt that didn\u2019t apply to me because of my faith. Thankfully, in my last two years of college I found an Evangelical Lutheran church in town and I thought I\u2019d give it a try since I had assumed it was pretty much all the same teachings I grew up in. Omg I was wrong. Where my home church had preached fire and brimstone if we sinned, this evangelical church preached love and forgiveness. There were rainbow banners inside, references in sermons to marriage between all genders, and openly gay couples in the pews. I\u2019m not lying when I say I cried twice during that first service out of happiness - first when I read a statement in the bulletin how this church was accepting of all people, friends, and family of all genders, gender expression, and sexualities; and second during a prayer when we were giving thanks for the quick healing a woman\u2019s wife after a surgery. Watching this episode of Queer Eye brought so many memories back of my struggle with the intersection of my faith and sexuality. But it also helped me feel even more at home in the Evangelical Lutheran church. I\u2019m partial out of the closet now (mainly just to friends, not family) and I\u2019ve never felt happier.", "link_id": "t3_gzo0yy", "time": 1591719783}}

{"fr0ewe1": {"text": "I had this exact same problem with an ex-friend. She was very toxic, manipulative and mean to me and our mutual friends. I stayed because we had experienced a very unique experience together and she made me feel connected to that amazing time in my life. Eventually the toxicity got to a point where she implied that she would kill herself without me. Something about that (and somehow not any of the 1000 previous red flags) sent alarms off in my head for the first time.The people in my group therapy were very supportive and helped me gradually remove her. Im someone who hates leaving people in need (she too was not completely mentally stable) so it was really difficult for me, but i knew it was best for me, and her too, ultimately. Group helped me figure a plan and here\u2019s a rough outline of what I did:1. I started by not responding to texts for many hours. I\u2019d usually wait til right before bed to respond and then if she asked to FaceTime I had the bed excuse2. Gradually picked up less and less calls and i would then text her an hour or two later saying I was dealing with studying/family emergency/a different crisis/whatever I believed would work. If it was needed, I would ask if we could reschedule the call for later in the week (but never be specific and just act vague and unsure of when you can talk next)(For 1 and 2 you have to be firm and can\u2019t give into guilt tripping. If you tell them you are busy and can\u2019t talk, and they say they are having a crisis and you don\u2019t care, either don\u2019t respond at all or find a way to deflect, just don\u2019t cave. I found that by going to hang out with my non-toxic friends, whenever she was trying to contact me, helped because I didn\u2019t want to leave my nice friends to talk to someone mean.)(Also just load yourself up with a library of possible excuses to give at any time)3. What few calls I did decide to pick up, I made them few and far between and kept them short. At the beginning of the call i would say something like \u201chey, I\u2019d love to help but I have to be off the this call in 15mins because I have to run an errand/call my great aunt/have a doc apt\u201d it gave us both a time limit and an excuse to leave the call.4. If the first couple things help to lessen the contact, then when you are ready you can do a full sweeping block one day. Make sure to block all of their public and private social media accounts, emails, work cell and home phone numbers, messaging apps, everything you can think of. It took me a couple months to be able to do the last one but honestly I was so happy when I did. In the past, any time she would text me my anxiety would get so horrible that i would feel sick and if I got a text in public it would mentally pull me completely out of whatever I was doing. It\u2019s been 3 months now, and I\u2019m happy that I don\u2019t have to worry about her. I have my own mental health struggles and I\u2019m not responsible for her. I\u2019ll be honest, I have had a few nightmares about her actually contacting me. And i felt sick for half a day when I thought I saw her on my college campus (she lives multiple states away) but it was just a look-a-like. Overall though, I\u2019d rather have a couple bad dreams and a scare over feeling responsible for someone else\u2019s mental stability and life.Sorry this was super long, Idk if this even applies for your specific situation, but I hope at least some of it helps.", "link_id": "t3_glt1zu", "time": 1589793159}}

Asking yourself and sorting these smaller chunks about who you are and what you want can help you limit any jumping to conclusions.

You can be hanging with straight friends all day and still hold the great feeling you have for your cuddle buddy in your heart and they would not know.

All of these decisions are on you, and while it may seem very daunting, and it can be, it also means that you are in total control and can do want best suits your wants and needs. And please at least consider your needs and wants first before others.I have every bit of confidence in you that you will figure all this out about yourself.

I did the same thing for yearsssss. I had a small inkling that I may not be straight but I refused to let myself even consider the possibility because of A) the religion I was born and raised in B) my VERY straight home and school environment and C) I could see nothing good coming from me exploring or even thinking about my sexuality. So I shoved that shit waaaay deep down until I got to college. At that point I had legit forgotten my own questionable sexuality existed and I just stuck with the \u201cstraight\u201d label and didn\u2019t think about what it meant. It seems impossible, but man if there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way.Unfortunately, I made great friends in college who clocked the definitely-not-straight-ness in me and they would make jokes about me being a secret lesbian all the time. Of course if i wasn\u2019t even letting myself question my sexuality, i was certainly not going to share those thoughts with even my closest friends, half of who were gay themselves. I\u2019ll admit, it took me two years to allow myself the space to explore, think, and label my sexuality because I got so overwhelmed every time I slightly thought about it. I understand that it is super difficult to have to think so much about something that you had assumed you already understood about yourself from birth. It takes a lot of energy. And it can be upsetting when you already aren\u2019t in a great situation when these feelings/questions came up. I saw some of your other responses to people who told you to just kiss him and see what happens, which seemed to upset you because it\u2019s \u201cnot that simple\u201d. And while they are all well meaning, i agree with you, because those people aren\u2019t you. It\u2019s one thing to just be in the moment and kiss a dude. It\u2019s another when you are stuck in self isolation for weeks and have plenty of time to overthink, rethink, analyze and repeatedly question about something you thought you already knew. And unlike an incorrect fact in a history book, you can\u2019t google this answer. You have to talk to yourself and find out where you are, which is not always an easy task.It takes a lot to go through these emotions and I know what it feels like to have to face your sexuality. I\u2019m not going to give you advice on whether you should kiss him or not because there are a lot of people here telling you that. But in terms of sexuality, some questions that helped me were \u201cCould I see myself going on dates with this person and WOULD I BE HAPPY ON THOSE DATES?\u201d \u201cWould I be happy if this person kissed me? (this was a more comfortable thought to sit with early on rather than me kissing them)\u201d \u201cAs i am questioning, would I be comfortable with a sexuality label or would I rather not identify as anything and just date who I want? (this also helped take some pressure off)\u201d \u201cEverything else set aside, could I see even a small possibility of there being a future where I am long term living/married with this person/a person of this gender?\u201dI just want you to know that it doesn\u2019t matter if people are telling you \u201cBro you are gay, just kiss him already.\u201d What matters, is that it matters to you to understand this part of yourself.

Of course, none of them posted anything about my grandpa\u2019s passing, out of respect for my grandma and they all unfriended me just in case. Except for my mom\u2019s sister, my Aunt. 2 days after my grandpa passed, I noticed that I had not seen some relatives on my Facebook feed recently when they were all very active. That\u2019s when I noticed that everyone unfriended me, except for my aunt. And on her page I saw multiple messages from the day before, giving her condolences on the passing of her dad. I cried myself to sleep that night alone in my bedroom. I went into school the next day and the only person i told was a teacher who i was close to. My family did not know that I knew and I felt that since they went to all these lengths to try to protect me, I was going to protect them by not allowing them to worry about me.The point is - fuck your SIL.

They don\u2019t want to have to deal with Aunt Karen crying in the corner about her latest failed marriage. Aunt Karen at least can come to the ceremony but anyone would bet Karen doesn\u2019t even know the middle name of her niece getting married and one extra seat is a lot cheaper than all the alcohol she can drink at the bar.Maybe this is a generational thing? I know a lot more people now doing smaller ceremonies than what my parents and aunts did. And receptions are getting smaller too. It\u2019s your day. And PLEASE when anyone asks why they couldn\u2019t come to the reception PLEASE ask that \u201cwhen did you last wish me happy birthday\u201d because that is gold.

{"ff257dw": {"text": "NTA - this is scary because I had a very similar childhood experience, everything from the forced to eat when I was full, right down to the anxiety disorder. As a result I had an extremely hard time identifying my emotions for years because any time I expressed them, my parents told me I was wrong and everything I did was either \u201cfor attention\u201d or I was \u201cbeing dramatic\u201d. Additionally - PLEASE talk to your friend. My dad was a horrible sports parent. He yelled, was irrational in our abilities, called us embarrassments, the whole works. My brother and his friend, who also had a dad very similar to ours, coached a little league team when they were in high school. One game his friend had a bad day and was kind of taking it out on the kids playing, nothing horrible, but he was being harsher on the kids than needed. After the game my brother pointed out to his friend that he was acting like his dad out there, and not in a good way. The friend took a step back and realized that my brother was right and he was a lot better coach after that. The point is, sometimes we are so wrapped up in our own world we don\u2019t see how we are affecting others. Ask your friend to take a step back and remind him about your personal experience with parents like him. Also tell him to put himself in his kids shoes, and he really has to remember what it\u2019s like to be a kid. If he says \u201cI would hate my parents for being tough on me but I would appreciate it when I\u2019m older\u201d he ain\u2019t getting the point and you got to try again.", "link_id": "t3_er2g3x", "time": 1579494133}}

{"ff1zrb2": {"text": "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH. I see the separate account as like having $500 stashed away in your sock drawer. Some people think that you having a separate account is deceitful/theft/untrustworthy etc... However, I know some women and some men who have had their own stash of cash that their SO never knew about. Some women keep a secret account as a safety net, especially if they are financially dependent on another person. They may love and trust this person with their life but they know we live in a shit show world. They usually have these accounts (usually $500-$1000 USD) only for emergencies (i.e. their husband is verbally abusive and so they want to give their kids money to get away for a while, their husband abuses them/has an addiction of some kind that affects the family and this is their cash for their escape plan, they don\u2019t want to be caught off guard if their husband cheated on them/lost all their money/runs off). Even my grandpa had cash hidden from my grandma. My grandpa was born March 1929 - a hell of time to come into the world. He stashed all his extra cash (even during the few years my grandma was the sole earner when my grandpa was laid off) in corners of the house because he was afraid that at any moment the banks could fail and the government won\u2019t bail them all out quick enough. He didn\u2019t tell my grandma because he believed the less people who knew about the hidden money, the safer it was. So if you get the account, it could just be because you want a safety net, personally or financially. It can be terrifying realizing you are entirely financially dependent on someone. You can love them and trust them with your life, but that can still be scary. You can fill it with loose change and when you get cash as a gift or whenever you sell like old furniture or stuff online. Yes, if your partner finds out you will have some explaining to do. Personally if my SO told me they had a secret account filled with $320 of pocket money I had given them over the years and it was there in case I was stupid and made a mistake, I wouldn\u2019t blame them. Everyone makes mistakes at some point, but we can protect ourselves from other people\u2019s mistakes. Sorry this was so long, if you read it all - thank you. I just know that this is a practice I know quiet a few people in my life have. Some people think this is an outdated idea but frankly I\u2019m 22 and half of my friends have divorced parents and half of the ones that divorced had a rough separation. This is when spare money comes in handy.", "link_id": "t3_er2mhk", "time": 1579490008}}
