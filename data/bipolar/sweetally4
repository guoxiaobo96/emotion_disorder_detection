So it doesn\u2019t confirm your diagnosis, it\u2019s not quite that advanced. It told me things like how my body metabolizes things like opioids which is interesting. I learned I have a tolerance to them that\u2019s higher than a normal person based on my genes. It tells you what types of medications based on class so SSRI, SNRI, MAOI, Stimulants, Typical/Atypical Antipsychotics, Mood stabilizers, Anxiolytics, Pain medications that would either be \u201cuse as directed\u201d (so, would be fine to use with no horrible side effects would work as normal.), \u201ctherapeutic\u201d meaning that would be the BEST option for you based on your genes. Probably yield best results, minimal side effects etc, and then \u201cuse with caution\u201d meaning you\u2019ll probably have all the negative side effects and won\u2019t work well (which in my case explained SO MUCH - a bunch of the medications under that category made me SO SICK and did nothing.). It also told me that I\u2019m at a genetic predisposition to gain excessive amounts of weight from antipsychotics (even weight neutral ones - which would explain why I gained 40lbs even taking just 2mg of abilify.) and suggested that if I had to be on them to also put me on something like Metformin to mitigate weight gain.I\u2019m also at a genetic predisposition to have severe negative side effects and INTOLERANCE to SSRIs so it\u2019s suggested that I\u2019m not prescribed them.Learned that based on my genes, I\u2019d apparently greatly benefit from TMS.Overall, it was SO interesting. It really helped my doctor and inform a game plan. It\u2019s going to help doctors and anesthesiologists even if I need surgery. We\u2019ve tried some of the \u201ctherapeutic\u201d medications and they\u2019ve been pretty side effect free.Overall, pretty cool. Not sure if it\u2019s going to fix everything of course, it\u2019s still pretty new in the world of psychiatry and I think over the years it will get a lot better. I don\u2019t think there is going to be a \u201ccure all\u201d but it may help point your doctor in a better direction and take out some of the \u201cmedication roulette\u201d as I call it. If you can get some help paying for it through insurance for example (I did) I\u2019d say go for it. Apparently it\u2019s a lot less expensive here than it is in the states. (According to my psych)I hope that helps! Let me know if you have anymore questions!", "link_id": "t3_c667f4", "time": 1561648081}}

I was on cloud 9, killing it at work, getting so much shit done, I got a giant raise, was really impressing everyone around me. Honestly, I felt absolutely unstoppable. I was just go go go go. Always shopping, always redecorating my house. Playing video games all night then working 10 hour days. Waking up in the middle of the night to craft for hours.I didn\u2019t think much of it, I was totally blinded by it. Mine was induced by increases to Zoloft that my doctor gave me for my depression, and my god, we though it worked! Little did we know, it was going to ruin some of my life. All of a sudden, I crashed. I crashed and burned SOOOOOO hard. I started tanking at work, I slept 15 hours a day on my days off. I could barely get to work, I was getting nothing done. Crying all the time. Stopped eating, started getting so sick. We had no idea why, then when I started getting suicidal my doctor sent me to the psychiatric ER in my city and after reviewing the last year of my life I got my diagnosis. My boss urged me to take time off work, I was off for a few months and came back. Went off again for 6. Came back, nope. Ended up in the psych ward for 5 days, then now I\u2019ve been off for almost a year again. Finding stability after that hypomania episode has been the hardest thing I have EVER done. It seems never ending. Looking back though, this diagnosis explains so much. I\u2019ve had episodes since I was a teenager. Bipolar Disorder runs on my biological fathers side of the family and depression on my moms side. It\u2019s been a hell of a ride I\u2019ll tell you.

I lived in a condo too, and because of my depression and the fact that I worked from home I didn\u2019t leave very often. I also liked the idea of having an emotional support animal. So I got my first one for that reason. He\u2019s task trained with a few things to help me with my mental health now at home which is cool but he\u2019s not an actual service dog. I then started working outside the home so he was alone from 7-5 for a bit, but he\u2019s a Goldendoodle and super chill so he didn\u2019t seem phased as long as he got his run time in the morning and run time and final walks at night.Anyways, got a bit off track there. November of 2018 I adopted my first rescue from the Dominican. I was very nervous, but we always had more than one dog growing up so it\u2019s something I always wanted. Now I suffer from anxiety so I was freaking out about my decision until the moment we got him off the plane that day. We got him home, for the first few days I was like \u201cwtf have I done\u201d but once he settled in it was all fine.Then a few months ago we got another from the Dominican. The organization wanted her to go to a home with multiple dogs and she was super skittish and needed very patient and experienced adopters. I knew she would be hard to adopt out, so I knew I had to take her. Now I have three. Lol. I love dogs. I also worked in a vet clinic for awhile, fun fact.I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re doing it for the wrong reasons.

He licks my tears when I cry and can apply deep pressure therapy. He also helps me brace when I\u2019m dizzy from panic attacks. I never pursued him as a service dog because he loves everyone too much that I think he\u2019d just be miserable to be surrounded by people who couldn\u2019t pet him. ANYWAYS. I\u2019ll never get a puppy again. Never. Too stressful when your mental health is volatile. I got him before I was dx as bipolar.Since then, I have rescued two dogs, rescues have their own pile of issues but they are usually partially trained when you get them. In my case they were.They all sleep with me, give me a sense of purpose and seeing them run brings me joy like none other. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d get up in the morning if it wasn\u2019t for them. They also get me out a few times a week outside of their 3 walks a day for dog park adventures.Sometimes I need help with them. Just something to remember if you get one, that even in your bad days they need you and you can\u2019t let them suffer because of it.All I can say is make an informed decision. I\u2019ve worked with animals my whole life (including in a vet clinic) so I\u2019m an experienced animal caretaker which makes it a bit easier on me. If you\u2019ve never had a dog before, so a ton of research before you commit. Cats are great too though. Don\u2019t have to walk them, most just are happy to cuddle and sit in a window.

I haven\u2019t quite found stability yet, but there are a lot of us who have.If your therapist isn\u2019t giving you what you need, you need to find another one. She won\u2019t take it personally (hopefully, she shouldn\u2019t), it\u2019s just part of the profession.I\u2019ve done one on one DBT, I\u2019ve done one on one CBT, Group CBT, Art therapy (when I was hospitalized just for something to do during the day), and occupational therapy (OT). Of all of those things, DBT and OT are what I have found most helpful. DBT gave me practical coping techniques and ways to try and rewire my backwards thinking. OT helps me with trying to function on the day to day (routine making, etc) and then we also work on improving my cognitive function. Group therapy wasn\u2019t horrible, but I was the only person with BP and even though it was nice to have more people to talk too, none of them really quite understood what I was going through with BP. It was more so just geared towards generalized depression and anxiety. Art Therapy was just an excuse to colour with other people instead of alone in my room, because not many of the patients were social outside of it. It\u2019s a long battle. Keep surrounding yourself with people who don\u2019t tear you down and who try to understand. Get a lawyer to help with SSI if you haven\u2019t already. I\u2019m not in the US but I hear from a lot of people with BP that are that having a lawyer can greatly reduce the amount of times you get denied for it.

If you feel like you can\u2019t tolerate it, talk to your pdoc or pharmacist for tips on things you may be able to do to help get through the withdrawal. You can do it! I had no issues getting on to Lamotrigine, so hopefully you won\u2019t have any added side effects while you start it. I tolerate it very well apparently, and made it up to 200mg with virtually no side effects. I hope it gets better for you. Know you aren\u2019t alone. ", "link_id": "t3_b6r9xp", "time": 1553824136}}
