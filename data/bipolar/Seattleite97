Once you feel yourself falling back, even if your life depended on it, you wouldn't be able to stop it from happening. Its not like shrooms or acid. MY DMT EXPERIENCE - I was with my boyfriend at that time laying on the bed back against the wall, after the second hit, I fell back and I guess kept my eyes open but I felt like they were closed. All of a sudden I see my boyfriend trying to 'snap me out of it'. He looks panicked, shaking me, kinda slapping my cheeks and looks like hes watching me not come back from my trip. He calls 911 and medics came and started yelling 'check her pulse!' and started throwing me on a stretcher and moving me into an ambulance. While in the ambulance, it felt like I was chewing and swallowing shards of glass?!?? Before I know it, Im in a hospital room (I dont have my site I can hear the monitors and doctors). Then I hear my Dads voice (whos super against this stuff) and he's sobbing, telling me 'Everything is going to be ok'.
