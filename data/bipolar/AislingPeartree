{"fqnehf9": {"text": "That is so sad, I\u2019m so sorry. The best lesson I ever learned was that grief is like a river, you have to let it flow, which means feel it when you need to, cry when you need to. If we don\u2019t allow ourselves to feel our grief in a safe space, we develop emotional blockages that compound our grief and make it even harder to recover from. There are lessons and deeper meanings to be found within your grief, but you have to let yourself feel it. I\u2019m here if you need to talk. Also, Tapping (Emotional Freedom Technique) helped me tremendously in coping with the grief around my loss. Sending you lots of love.", "link_id": "t3_gjk11f", "time": 1589493408}}
{"fqayzap": {"text": "Whenever I\u2019m obsessing about something, and playing it over and over in my head, I use tapping (emotional freedom technique) to clear it up. It works wonders. There are different systems to try and lots of online resources available (I\u2019m also a mental health coach and teach tapping.) Once you\u2019re no longer obsessing, it\u2019s so much easier to think clearly about how you want to resolve things. In some cases you might want to talk to the person, in other cases you might not, but once you\u2019ve stopped obsessing, you can tap into your intuition much more easily and allow it to guide you to make the best decision for yourself.", "link_id": "t3_ghmx04", "time": 1589227704}}

It\u2019s so important to create your own community of supportive, understanding people, which might not include your family and friends, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll find another kind of family in people who understand and have experienced depression. I highly recommend Emotional Freedom Technique (Tapping), it is hugely effective for depression and anxiety. Lots of online resources available.

{"fodblwd": {"text": "I would suggest trying holistic healing methods that work with your whole system to heal. Meds are shown to be inconsistent for many people, but when you find the right healing tools they can be life changing, and you can use them safely to handle your mental health issues for as long as you need to, as opposed to meds that can cause other symptoms and stop working over time. I would suggest trying therapy or coaching, Tapping (Emotional Freedom Technique - lots of free videos online), yoga, meditation, exercise, and starting a gratitude list - all of these, in any combination are really helpful. Speaking from personal experience, Tapping has saved my life and made the biggest impact, but I also do the others as well.", "link_id": "t3_g6weem", "time": 1587682634}}

For much of the day I\u2019m repeating positive affirmations, so much so that they\u2019ve become my new mental soundtrack and help me to feel good about myself and manifest the things I want in my life.", "link_id": "t3_g0b1mg", "time": 1586808245}}

Whatever the reason, you can turn your life around and be happy! I was suicidal too. I\u2019m copying and pasting what I wrote in the original post, and I\u2019m sending the same to you. Without even knowing you, I care a lot about you. I\u2019m here any time.Please, please don\u2019t kill yourself! You have so much beautiful life left to live, so much value to add to this world, so many gifts to offer. It might not seem that way right now. Sometimes the pain feels like it\u2019s too much to bear, but healing is absolutely possible. I was suicidal for many years. I hated myself. I finally healed and now I love myself, and I love my life. What has helped me the most has been Tapping (Emotional Freedom Technique), there are a lot of free videos and resources online, I also teach it and am here to help. Please give life a chance. There are amazing people to meet, incredible experiences to have, new and exciting places to see. The pain that suicide inflicts on our loved ones, even people who aren\u2019t that close to us, is unimaginable. It\u2019s excruciating. I also believe that our spirit continues to suffer until we\u2019ve made peace with our pain, so killing ourselves doesn\u2019t put an end to our suffering, it only prolongs it.

{"fn3fhbb": {"text": "I totally understand. One thing I think might help is to be so proud of yourself for following your instincts! You listened to your intuition about this guy, and it kept you safe! So try to be glad and grateful that you have a strong connection with your inner voice, and that you trusted yourself, and kept yourself safe. Sometimes when we give our fears so much of our energy, we manifest those things that we fear most into our realities. We attract them to us. So if this has been a fear for you, and you\u2019ve been worried about it a lot, it makes perfect sense that you would manifest an experience that reflects that fear. Thankfully you listened to your instincts and nothing bad happened. Moving forward, we can\u2019t let our fears keep us from having the healthy, happy lives we want, including relationships and positive sexual experiences. When it comes to the OCD, I also had OCD for many years and what finally helped me was Tapping (Emotional Freedom Technique.) Doing the work made me feel like I got a brain transplant! I very rarely obsess anymore. If I do have a spike in obsessive thoughts and compulsions, I just get back to work tapping regularly and I\u2019m fine again.
