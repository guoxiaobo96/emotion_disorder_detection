My dad certainly fucked up trying to help me many times, but guess what? It doesn't matter! He was being my dad the best he knew how and there's no manual to this shit. I'm glad he helped me get better even though I don't tell him that all the time. You're allowed to fuck up and don't feel guilty about trying. Maybe a counselo could help you along handling this.
