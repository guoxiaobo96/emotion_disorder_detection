I have also been on most of the other SSRIs on the market at some point in my life. I didn't have any real side effects, but I also wasn't getting anywhere in my life.  I developed agoraphobic symptoms, and couldn't hold a job, or even do my own grocery shopping.  Basically all I was really doing was the absolute basics to survive.I am I believe 1 or possibly 2 weeks away from ending my Neurostar treatment.  I started noticing changes after about 2-3 weeks.  I did have a dip (and a ton of other crap going on when I started!) for a couple of days, but as soon as that went away I felt like I was starting to see doors open for the first time.

I wish I could see the whole article, because I bet it would be an interesting read.First off, I make no claims to know what actually happened, I'm just trying to point out things that don't make sense with the story as I've read it.I guess my thinking with the DNA evidence from Adam goes a few ways.  The way he describes cutting her down he would have had to have a hand on the rope and one on the knife in order to lower her to the ground.  (He could have had a hand around her body I suppose, but that would even be more surface contact)  Anyone who has ever gotten a rope burn can tell you rope is not kind on skin and to me personally that seems like a big place where DNA evidence may have been found.The second part is that he was doing CPR on her.  Now anyone who knows CPR knows that it's a very taxing task.  Many people break ribs while performing CPR.  (Unfortunately youtube is acting up and I can't find the 911 recording I listened to)  He was already out of breath when he made the call.  Between that and the force used in CPR, I'm surprised there was no sweat found.I also originally considered any DNA from doing mouth to mouth on her during CPR, but found that mouth to mouth is no longer required as of 2008.

It's easy to look back and see the things you feel like you're failing at, but sometimes it can help to remember the things that you're doing well too!  What about those days when you made it through work when every fiber of your being wanted to stay in bed?  I know you're a lot stronger than you're giving yourself credit for, and I am so proud of how far you HAVE gotten.It's ok to need help.  I just started online therapy a couple of weeks ago and it's been pretty good for me.  I was able to sign up for financial assistance which brought it down to $182 a month, which is considerably less than I would pay to see a therapist face to face.  I get to talk to someone usually once a day, and I do feel like it's been helping me, so if that's in your price range, it might be worth giving it a shot!But the big picture here is that you're stronger than you think.  Everyone needs help sometimes, and that doesn't make you a weaker person for needing it. I love you sis, and if you ever wanna talk, send me a message. &lt;3", "link_id": "t3_9tzmp1", "time": 1541391500}}

(they used to not suck)  One of the tangents that I've seen be tested as far as branching out in that area in breeding and genetics.  This was done first I believe in Dogz/Catz 5, but absolutely best in the Creature series, which went so far as to have an actual DNA pattern for each creature born in your world.  Because of this, each creature was different and unique, and it allowed for either a more emotional or a more scientific playstyle.  Unfortunately after the third iteration, the developer was bought out and the games were not continued, though there is still a cult fanbase.  Recently Fishing Cactus, I believe has been developing Creatures 4 as a freemium game, but from what I've seen, it looks like it is devolving some (though not completely) in complexity in lieu of the more childlike simulators seen these days.  Something like the original Creatures games, I feel, would open up more options in playstyle and do a lot for the genre.", "link_id": "t3_21nzn0", "time": 1396135234}}
