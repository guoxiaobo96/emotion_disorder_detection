I'm not going to speak to the specifics of the whole debacle, but I'm going to speak about the emotions of all of this from the perspective of an Albertan who recently returned from living and working in Vancouver.Personally, I 100% support moving away from fossil fuels to renewable. I'd also love to see the world do away with plastics.But, the only reasonable way to do it , is  to transition away from fossil fuels. Any province including BC would see devastating effects to their economy if they tried to \"flip the switch\" away from fossil fuels. There must be a deliberate balance to ensure the transition happens as quickly as possible without devastating  economies.Now, onto Albertans and our anger.I feel British Columbians (and Quebecers too) need to understand our fear and outrage.We are sitting in an economy that has been in a deep recession since late 2014. And although our government is doing the best it can to both diversify and to get us out of the recession it's extremely slow, difficult and painful. That is difficult enough for the ordinary Albertan to deal with, but wait! There's more!For the past couple years, we have had Quebec shut down Energy east, Saskatchewan fighting with us for what seems to be some kind of grudge against the NDP,  OPEC and the USA playing games with the price of oil, a federal government that seems to be doing nothing except paying lip service, and now our BC neighbours seemingly trying to stall the project until Kinder Morgan is fed up and cancels it all.We feel like despite the fact that Alberta never receives more equalization than we pay out, and that historically we've always tried our best to have great trade relations with the rest of Canada, we are now being attacked for reasons which are no fault of our own.And then, we get hit right in our hearts:there's the massive amount of schadenfreude all over social media against Albertans. I've seen numerous comments where they are over the moon that Albertans are suffering. I've seen comments wishing complete economic and social devastation to Alberta.Alberta is not a bunch of rednecks/roughnecks/and oil execs full of greed, bigotry and disdain for the environment. Most of us are just people. People who are trying to fill our fridges, pay our mortgages/rent, and hopefully save enough to get ahead a little bit. And most of us care deeply about the environment, climate change and our neighbours and our country. Canada as a whole is more important than any single province, and we should be striving to work together for the betterment of everyone instead of stifling investment with interprovincial politicking and trade wars.I love BC, I love Alberta, and most of all I love Canada.
