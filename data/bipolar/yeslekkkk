When I was first diagnosed, I was super open about it with  friends. I was shocked at how many people I trusted sucked with that information. I honestly had A LOT of people who ended up using it against me, judging me, or assuming things. As human beings, we have all kinds of feelings--many which aren't related to bipolar disorder.  However, any emotion I felt was interpreted as a part of bipolar disorder.  People judged me and didn't allow me to feel that way as a human. It wasn't because they did something bad; it was because I was bipolar.  It was terrible.  It's pretty complicated to explain, and I am not explaining it well.  In other words, people viewed my reactions through a bipolar lens, thereby removing my capability to have any sort of normal human emotion.  I changed course relatively quickly.&amp;#x200B;I would like to say that people can be cool and mature, but I don't actually believe that's the case after my experiences. There are those few that I share it with. Otherwise, I keep it completely hidden from those around me. I wish I didn't have to live with this secret, but being open about it went so horribly. Also, with my profession, I would have a lot of people second guessing my judgment. It wouldn't go well. Unfortunately, I live with this secret. Being gay doesn't seem so bad. and being out as a gay person where I live is fine. &amp;#x200B;Also, I was 25 when I was diagnosed. I can't imagine if I was in high school.

I guess I'm different from you because it sounds like you had this stable life until you were 17.  I didn't have that.  I just silently suffered undiagnosed.  I'm incredibly bitter that I \"lost\" those 25 years.  I wish I had been able to be who I really was.  It's 2.5 years from my diagnosis, and I'm just now finding out who I am and how to feel things \"normally. \" I'm incredibly thankful to be able to feel like this now.  But I've had to grieve/continue to grieve the life I never got.  I don't think I can ever forgive bipolar disorder.  The only way that I can get past my bitterness is focusing on how great my brain is in other ways-- all the things it allows me to do and makes me me.  Then, I tell myself that those great things about me come with bipolar.  Who knows if they could exist independently?  One comes with the other.  I am who I am because of it.  I know how to feel so much stronger than 95% of the people I know.  I have the ability to compare my current and past self and understand how things can change, how differently people can feel.  I can emphathize with other people's great pain because I know how bad it feels.  It is with this that I make having bipolar okay.  But, I would be lying if I said it wasn't incredibly difficult.  The other hard thing is walking around with this and having to hide it from the people around you.  It's really hard to show up to work when you haven't slept, or when you're depressed, or when your brain stops working, and you have to keep plugging on in order to survive.  It is a burden.&amp;#x200B;What I can tell you is that things get better. In fact, things are better now for me than they've ever been.  You might be looking at those 17 years through rose colored glasses, but I wouldn't be surprised if you experienced symptoms before then that affected your quality of life.  I haven't lived your life, so I can't actually comment on what those 17 years were like.  Maybe one day, you'll find that you can live in a way that is better than those 17 years.  &amp;#x200B;You're starting at -5000 but you can get to 5000.  You really can.  I promise.  I know because I have.  I graduated from law school with honors, got a well-respected job, and passed an incredibly hard bar exam.  I have a dog, my own apartment, and healthy relationships.  I stopped abusing substances.  I don't cry anymore and rarely feel depressed.  And while I'm not where I want to be yet, I'm slowly working on myself to make up for those 25 years.   I am just learning now about who I am and what I want.  I am no longer just grabbing onto anything just to survive.  I'm bitter nevertheless, but I can't do anything about it now.  All I can do is look forward.  &amp;#x200B;All is not lost.  Take this burden and do something wonderful.  When you see people without bipolar disorder around you sucking at life, being mean, being in denial, etc., you can joke, \"WHAT'S THEIR F\\*\\*KING EXCUSE FOR BEING SHITTY PEOPLE?\"  And they don't have one.

When I used a facial cleanser and benzyl peroxide, my face went nuts. I finally started a new routine in early February, and I have one pimple right now. My face has made drastic improvements. I was too rough on my skin before. The secret I learned was to wash it with a cleanser (a gentle! cleanser, not an acne wash) once a day and put on lotion after.

If you haven't gone to the bipolar page, you should head over there and talk with us there.  drinking/eating three times a day, sleeping with your mom, get on some meds and stay patient.

I would recommend hiding from triggering situations and people, reading, watching funny tv shows, doing things that you find calming (I would go to the ocean), and not drinking. I guess my point is that you have to put yourself in the best situation you can before you can forgive yourself. You have to let time pass. You have to discover that you're not a bad person and that the future going forward can be different.The guilt is overwhelming... and you have to take your time with processing it. It stops with time. Medication and therapy will help you deal with that. You have to make it until then and until the medication kicks in.The book \"Anger\" by Thich Nhat Hahn was helpful at the time. He's a buddhist monk. It's been awhile since I've read it, but it really helped put the idea of suffering and anger in perspective. Plently of people haven't forgiven me, and I still have to live with it. Those people actually suck at the end of the day. If they didn't suck, they would have forgiven you (even if they couldn't necessarily be completely okay). Your ex probably won't TBH.

This happened a couple times a minute. I couldn't go to certain places without having panic attacks. This was in addition to my intense irritability, no sleeping, etc. I started medication and made a lot of lifestyle changes to minimize stress and put myself in a situation that I wanted to be in. One day, the self-harm thoughts stopped. I realized that I could stop anticipating my intense emotions. I didn't have to worry about what emotion was going to pop up. I could just live without trying to protect myself.

{"dfq2b8u": {"text": "Don't be afraid of losing weight on paleo. People can lose weight, but you won't lose more weight if you're at a healthy weight (from my experience). One of the reasons I actually started paleo was because I didn't seem to be holding onto weight. It kept shedding off of me. I randomly lost 20 pounds in a span of three months. I have been skinny my whole life but that random loss made me underweight. So I went on paleo when I was (1) underweight or close to teetering toward underweight and (2) when I had no money. Actually, paleo might make your weight stable and make your body into a much stronger version while still staying the same weight. I gained back a couple pounds (not the same as before), but my body iis so much stronger and I'm more vibrant. I had life come back into my eyes.As to money, I find paleo actually to be quite affordable. You're buying a lot of whole ingredients which tend to be cheaper than processed foods. You just have to find the right place to buy them. If you live near a store like Sprouts or Trader Joe's, it's not too expensive. I don't have much money still. I opt to buy non-free range meats much of the time because I can't afford the grass-fed, free-range versions. WHen they're on sale or reasonably priced I will. Staying within your means while still doing Paleo is WAY better than just throwing in the towel and resigning yourself to processed food products. I still struggle with mood problems, but they're nothing like before. BUT it helps so much. I recommend the books Practical Paleo by Diane Sanfillipo and The Paleo Solution by Robb Wolf. Robb Wolf recently published another book, but I think going with the traditional Paleo diet is likely more helpful first. Also, going Paleo can be really hard at first. Sometimes, the body will respond with flu-like symptoms or some other not feeling well in the beginning. Keep going for the whole 30 days. Your body has to retrain intself.Hope this helps!", "link_id": "t3_62vi7h", "time": 1491127185}}

Without it I cannot function. There is also research out there about ketogenic diets. These sorts of dietary changes have not seemingly been embraced by the medical community but some doctors at a well known teaching facility near me have mentioned them. I also know from my own life what paleo does for me. If you're looking for another approach I urge you to give this a try for a month. It's not easy at first.

Unfortunately, my school doesn't do night classes. I can't (or don't want to) really take a semester off. I have a job lined up and would lose my scholly for school. If it gets bad, I will. Nothing is worth it. Thanks for the ideas though!I'm so glad to hear from someone who gets it with law school!", "link_id": "t3_5omym3", "time": 1484720370}}

Sometimes, I try to change the subject when people go to far into all the talk about medical treatment and counseling, etc. Yeah, I have to keep track of the crazy. The last couple months I was in a super good place, so none of these points really mattered. I didn't have to think about any of this. But now, my circumstances have changed a bit, so I need to work out a new plan. When things are better, these things won't seem as difficult. I always remember the good days to try to make the bad seem temporary. Super difficult though.", "link_id": "t3_5ohn2k", "time": 1484719261}}

{"dcko3su": {"text": "Does the friend who you have been unintentionally avoiding know you are bipolar? Do you want to tell him? What do you hope to achieve? I don't think you really have to explain why you've been MIA. I think if he asks, you can be like, \"I was having a hard time.\"I would think like asking him to hang out and do something and maybe then you can bring it up. I made a good new friend somewhat recently and I just casually brought it up during brunch because I wanted to be open with her, not because it was an emotional experience for me. I obviously do not have the answers, but that went over well recently. I am, though, afraid of her witnessing too much crazy and then calling it off. But I also don't know what too much crazy is.

{"dcknonr": {"text": "About two weeks before my exams for a semester (law school), I was completely non-functioning. I would lie in my bed, drink mimosas, and watch One Tree Hill. I thought for sure that I would not make it through the end of the semester. I had a friend tell me that sometimes we just have to keep going and we can't always do as well as we want to do. I was lying in bed, in a brain fog, and was faced with several exams where I was not able to attend class regularly, take notes, etc. I literally didn't have notes of the material. But I simply got up and did what I could. Sometimes, I could only do work for 2-3 hours per day (which is really little for law school). But that's all I could do. Literally do anything. See what you can achieve. Instead of saying, \"I should have been furiously studying for 16 hours,\" just see if you can study some. Sometimes you have to crawl. I crawled that one semester. And my crawling was enough. I stopped looking at what I \"should\" be doing and just went with what I could do at the time. It totally worked out for me. And the weirdest thing is that I actually did better with my reduced study plan than before. So you never know what you can achieve when push comes to shove!Step 1: Start studying/doing work. Any amount of it. Do you have a safe place to study? At one point, I drove to another city to my friend's house and sat with her while she worked on something else.Step 2: Don't think about the grand scheme of your life at this very moment. You can totally think about your university journey later.Also, victory tastes soooooo much sweeter when you come out the other side and you're like, \"DAMN. I DID THIS and I DID IT IN SPITE OF THIS.\"I hear your struggles, but I also want you to know that you CAN do this.", "link_id": "t3_5on2j6", "time": 1484716545}}
{"dckknzc": {"text": "YOU HAVE JUST SAID EVERYTHING I HAVE BEEN THINKING.I've been very open with friends in the past and not even about bipolar disorder, but just everything. This past year when things got bad, and I even told them that I thought something was wrong, they drop kicked me. Now I'm like you in the sense that I am confused about what to tell people about being bipolar and what to share with people about my life. I feel fake when I'm not being open about my entire being and just talking about the weather or some other seemingly shallow topic. I'm really confused about if people can handle it, whether some people are shitty, and what are friendships even for. I just don't even know who to be around people. I spend a lot of time alone as well, simply because it seems easier.Proably the best method is to just stop caring and hope you find a couple gems amongst the masses of shit. I want to stop caring.
