{"ei6rg8b": {"text": "Catching fish with two netsThis technique is particularly handy when trying to catch fish in a decorated tank without much space for maneuvering.Ideally, your small net should be white (as this color spooks the fish) and your big net should be green or black (these are the colors that give fish false sense of security).One net should always be smaller than the other and use the larger net as the stationary net, but keep your hands ready at the handle.Place it somewhere you want your fish to go or place it in the direction your fish is known to run. Use the other hand to guide the fish with the smaller net towards the big one.If done properly, this should lead to a safe catch. Once the fish is in the larger net, close the net and drive it out of the tank.Many times, you will even be able to catch fish with your smaller net before it gets to the large one.CLOSING THE NETOnce you catch the fish, you need to close the net in order to prevent the fish from escaping. To do this, simply pull the net handle up while holding the handle vertically.This will result in the net closing down across the rim as the handle faces lower water resistance than the fabric. Once the fish is out of the tank, make sure to place it in another tank as soon as possible.", "link_id": "t3_azbxf3", "time": 1552191310}}
