{"evgs6g6": {"text": "I haven't read nearly as many as I'd like, but I own and enjoy: \\-Manic: A Memoir  by Terri Cheney She has bipolar type 1 but still does a great job describing hypomania as it progresses for her.  Some of my favourite quotes: \u201cI actually stopped talking. I actually listened. So I knew that I wasn't all the way manic, because when you're all the way manic you never listen to anybody but yourself.\u201d   \u201c\\[ \\] manic sex isn't really intercourse. It's dicourse, just another way to ease the insatiable need for contact and communication. In place of words, I simply spoke with my skin.\u201d   \u201cThe cruelest curse of the disease is also its most sacred promise: You will not feel this way forever.\u201d \\-Wishful Drinking by Carrie FisherCarrie struggles with addiction too but it touches heavily on her bipolar disorder. &amp;#x200B;my absolute FAVE is \\- Madness by Marya Hornbacher.  The way she writes about mania is incredible.  \u201cMy brain sometimes departs from the agreed-upon reality, and my private reality is a very lonely place. But in the end, I'm not sure I wish I'd never gone there.\u201d  - Madness \u201cHere's how you make absolutely sure that you'll keep getting crazier by the day:  \\- Ignore everything your psychiatrist tells you. Disregard all his warnings about the way you're living your life - in fact, do absolutely everything he tells you not to.  \\- Don't always take your pills. They're a hassle, and what if they make you dull? You don't need them. And if you're going to take the pills, take them with a glass of wine. It will make the mood swings even more exciting.  \\- Don't sleep; you've got to make sure your body clock is as fucked up as possible. The less you sleep, the more manic you'll get, until soon you'll go completely over the edge.  \\- Drink caffeine. Tons of it. Take your morning pills with coffee. It can't hurt.  \\- Work around the clock - it's important to put yourself under as much stress as possible.  \\- Eating normally would stabilize your blood sugar, so don't do that; it's better to keep your body in as unstable a state as you possibly can for maximum results.  \\- And, above all else, drink like a fish.\u201d  Madness &amp;#x200B;Another great book is Show me All Your Scars. It's relatively new and is a collection of short stories about different mental illnesses.  There's a good one on Bipolar 2 and the whole book is a modern and very fresh look at mental illness.I have more if anyone needs more suggestions :)", "link_id": "t3_cjmqzy", "time": 1564515000}}

{"er8krxp": {"text": "I used to work as a behavioral counsellor for a residential treatment home for developmentally and physically disabled adults.  We took the ones who had been kicked out of other homes because their behaviors were too violent, extreme and disturbing for those homes. I quickly learned that as the staff we were expected to risk our lives and wellbeing for these clients with zero back up from management in regards to our safety &amp; well-being.Here's a few examples:&amp;#x200B;My main client, a 28 year old woman with violent tendencies towards herself and others (she's put people in the hospital and has nearly lost several limbs because her self-harm is so severe... she can use an uncooked piece of rice on her skin hard enough to open a vein and don't even get me started with what she can do if she got a hold of a button. She slit her throat with a broken button once). Anywho I worked with this woman in her small apartment with one other staff member around for support if needed. This client developed an obsession with scarring my face and wrote me notes that she wanted to pour boiling kettle water on me while I made her tea sometimes.  She expressed a desire to push me into the oven while I was cooking for her and also said she would grab the wheel while I was driving the company vehicle and make us crash off a bridge.   I no longer felt comfortable cooking foods like pasta or making her tea in the tiny apartment after we had a few close calls and she almost burned me with boiling water.  I brought this to the clinican who makes up her program and he told me I had to continue cooking there (there was an upstairs kitchen for other clients I proposed using) because if I cooked elsewhere it would destroy my clients sense of normalcy. &amp;#x200B;I began asking my client to sit in the very back of the van when I had to drive her places because I feared she would grab the wheel or attack me while I drove (she always sat in the passenger seat before she started up with these threats) and she retaliated by punching the mirror off my personal vehicle which was parked in the same driveway.  Again the company refused to compensate me for the damage to my car and seemed unconcerned by the danger I was in.  Eventually, my mental health got to a point where I was anxious constantly.  I transferred to a different place within the company, hoping that since it was a \"Day Program\" with a lot of clients and staff doing activities together I would have more support.  This was not the case.  Now, I was expected to take up to 5 clients in a van into the community, all of which had the tendency to run away and become violent in the van or at the outing location.  At the main office, one of the clients beat a staff member with a fire extinguisher and she suffered permanent damage because there wasn't enough staff to keep her safe or stop the attack once it started. &amp;#x200B;At this time, I started to realize I was going to get badly hurt or have someone hurt under my care, both of which would effectively end my career. Addressing my safety concerns  with management only led me to retaliation from my supervisors and being slightly ridiculed.  This entire time, I had a psychiatrist who was truly amazing and even better, his son worked at the same company as me and was experiencing similar issues.  I couldn't believe it, as we live in a capital city and the odds of that are just insane. My psych offered to put me on temporary disability due to my deteriorating mental state but I refused because I believe disability should be a last resort and I wasn't at that point.  During this year and  a half is when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I had some extremely dark times, for sure exacerbated by my work environment.  I had to be on a vareity of medications to make it through the days and  I accepted this may be the case for the remainder of my life. One day, a coworker of mine was severely beaten with a rake and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance.  That day I sent in a brief email to my manager stating I was resigning, effective immediately, and would be happy to provide  a doctor's note if they had any questions.  They didn't.&amp;#x200B;After that, I did a few interviews while my boyfriend supported us (not ideal, but we made it).  Within two weeks, I was hired for two jobs in one day.   One was as a waitress for a restaurant and the other was as a health support worker for a health care company.  I waitressed until my job at the health care company began and then began doing that full-time.  That career had it's issues but it supported me for the next 8 months until I found my current job. I now work in an office and the change in my mental state is absolutely incredible.  The lack of stress, financial stability and routine schedule has changed my life.  I've been off all my psychiatric medications for a few months and I've never felt so clear headed.  I  felt so hopeless before.  I look forward to most days at work now.&amp;#x200B;Sorry for the novel, if anyone can relate to switching fields and positive effects on their well-being I'd love to hear.", "link_id": "t3_c0qaj7", "time": 1560606611}}

We made a few drinks (we never drink), got silly and cuddly and now we\u2019re making Spanakopitas (those wonderful greek phyllo pastries), snuggling and munching gummy bears on the couch. we have so much going on right now;  it\u2019s the simple nights like these  that make me so happy we\u2019ve been in love for 3 years. We can put our problems aside for an evening to focus on how lucky we are to have this love.", "link_id": "t3_8ns5v5", "time": 1527989277}}

I take my pill in the morning and although I used to require breakfast to wake up in the morning,now I can't bear to consume even a smoothie until noon. I walked around a grocery store for 20 minutes yesterday, trying to find something to eat. Nothing at all appealed to me for some reason. i decided on pre made potato wedges. I ended up vomiting those up in a parking later on. I never get sick to my stomach and it was french fries....I also hardly crave anything and view eating as more than an annoyance than anything now. TRUST ME I LOVE FOOD. This is a very strange side effect of a drug for me, but it hasn't even been a month so i'm waiting it out.  there's been two occasions in the past week where I've randomly vomited up a meal after feeling increasingly hot and horrible and then been completely fine after. I guess you could call it food poisoning but i'm a vegetarian so i don't really find it likely? Anyways my body is struggling so i feel you. I def have less anxiety and more energy.
