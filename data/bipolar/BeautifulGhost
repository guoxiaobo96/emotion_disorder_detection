Most of the medications cause weight gain and during episodes it's easy to stray from a healthy diet to over eating or not eating at all. I've had bipolar since my childhood but it wasnt treated until 7 years ago. I'm a rapid cycler so the ups and downs can sometimes change in as little as minutes. When this happens I CRAVE sweets. I can't control it and I'll cut anyone down who gets between me and the vending machine at work lol! My psychiatrist believes it's due to the instant release of dopamine that sugar gives us. Like a quick fix and a way for me to try and stop my sudden shifts. My metabolism is fast, my weight stays around 125lbs and I'm 5'6. My concern is all the sugar intake will cause me to have diabetes, it's a misconception that people who are overweight are the only ones who get diabetes.  Bipolar and diabetes are so toxic together because just like our mood shifts with bipolar our sugar also shifts constantly with diabetes. 3 years ago I went to a hospital because I was in a lot of pain and had a serious flu like cold.  I was also dizzy and my equilibrium was off. Once the doctor returned to the room she asked me how long ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She then went on to say that \"sometimes, when those who suffer from this disorder have episodes, they often make things up in their heads that seem real but aren't.\" She gave me a xanax and released me with a pamphlet stating I had been treated for psychosis. My sister was with me and she about lost her shit in the room when the doctor said that to me. 3 days later I couldn't breathe and my mom rushed me to urgent care. I fainted when they took my blood pressure and was rushed to another hospital where I was admitted for a pneumonia, kidney infection and an unknown virus. They couldn't stabilize me and my doctor spent over 3 hours at my bedside trying to figure out how to treat the virus they had never seen before. It was so bad he started preparing my parents for worst case scenario and had a priest visit. I pulled out of it and was discharged 3 weeks later. Moral is a lot of doctors and providers write us off as being psychotic before actually treating the symptoms.
