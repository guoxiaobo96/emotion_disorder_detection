{"fuqnt59": {"text": "Yo, I get you. When I was in middle school I was that kid who bought everybody random snacks, made people laugh, held the door for everyone and was even nice to kids who weren't good to me. I was the type of person to see the positive in everything and thought one man could change the world. When someone wasn't nice to me, I used to think, oh but they're probably having a bad day or dealing with something difficult at home, that's why they're treating me like this. I was bullied, beat up by my friends, lost friends, and received texts to go kill myself after I came out. Everywhere I went I was always laughed at in the hallways, at the cafeteria, and gym was literal hell. I was like what did I do to deserve this? The thing is isn't it obvious? Both you and me know you are being too nice. Too nice = hurt, damaged, used, heartbroken, fake friends, etc. People looked at me as an accessory.  When they wanted food, they came to me because they knew I was too nice. When they wanted help with their homework, they came to me because I was too nice. They continued to bully me for being gay because they KNEW I was too afraid, too scared to tell someone because I was too nice. Do you see what I'm saying? Don't trust everyone around you. Be skeptical about people you meet, and don't go giving away your heart to random people who you don't seriously know well enough. You might think its not fair, that people are like this, but people who give away their all for somebody who they barely know, it's not right. You're giving away a piece of yourself to a stranger, and that stranger can easily backfire you and destroy your entire life, because they don't care. Because they don't know you. People are selfish, in the end we should think about ourselves and no else, because it's us that matter the most. Unless its your friends who are treating you like this, then don't even bother with them. Those aren't your friends, they're gaslights and who are trying to hurt you. Cut off negative people, cut off fake friends, and tell yourself that you deserve better. Find someone who will return kindness to you just as you do for them. I'm not saying don't be nice at all, but chose who you are kind too. I am scared of people and my best friend is a stuffed hammerhead, I use him to cope, but I also realized something. Please don't do what I did. After I realized all the times I've been manipulated and used, I stayed away from people. I would not allow myself to open up and be close with anybody. I made myself alone, and I forced myself to have no heart, and no empathy towards anyone. That was a huge mistake, because now I'm relearning how to be kind again and learning how to form close friendships/relationships again as well. I don't want you to end up like that. People should be a balance of both nice and mean.", "link_id": "t3_gwda0f", "time": 1592083614}}

And if he\u2019s getting abused by his father you should really call the police. I understand why he would feel suicidal considering he\u2019s also dealing with being transgender and gender dysphoria. As a trans person it\u2019s common for this to happen, so I know what he\u2019s feeling. The best thing to do is be there for him. And helping him set up a safety plan is crucial. An escape plan really. If it\u2019s possible for him to live with another family member, then please give him that suggestion. You also mentioned you never met him? So ok I understand you call him a friend, but think about this you never even met him. I can already tell this is effecting your mental health in a negative way. If you want to help him great, but if this is getting you all upset, anxious, or scared it\u2019s really best to drop him. I know it\u2019s really difficult. But if I had a friend who would talk suicide all the time and how horrible their life is, I wouldn\u2019t spend anytime with them anymore because it will just try and bring me down. Do you want to be brought down? Do you want your mental health suddenly to decrease just because of one person in your life? You know better than that.

Well, considering I've been in a variety of friend groups and mostly toxic ones unfortunately, but after years of being in toxic friendships I've finally found some healthy relationships. Here's how. Obviously you have to put yourself out there and meet a lot of people, whether they are different from you or of similar interests. It doesn't matter just keep meeting people. And when you do meet someone now being in a healthy relationship means that its even. You call, they call. You make plans, they make plans. When you get into a fight what happens? Do they immediately brush you off or try to fix things with you? Do those small fights usually turn into a huge mess? Because in a healthy relationship, your friend will respect boundaries, they are independent on their own and don't always need you around them 24/7. And if you find that you argue way to much with them over little things, then that isn't healthy for both of you. Also another thing, pay attention to how well they listen to you.
