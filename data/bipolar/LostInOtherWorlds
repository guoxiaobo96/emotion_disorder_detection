{"foeb8nn": {"text": "Okay, a lot to unpack here but I'm going to try.First off, I have been diagnosed bipolar 1 for seven years. In 2014 I was in the place you currently are. Unstable, life falling apart, friends leaving me high and dry, not understanding my illness at all, no meds worked. Sophomore year of college triggered mine, but a bad job led to my diagnosis.Yes, it can get better. I have been mostly stable for two years now. I had to try over 27 meds and multiple combos of them to find something that worked. Up until I achieved stability I had no idea who I was. I felt like my identity was bipolar disorder, but once it's no longer calling the shots, you come out this badass person who has grown and learned and changed sooo much. I love who I am on the other side of this battle.You should not be thinking of suicide every day. Once you are stable it might cross your mind if you are having a really bad day, but for the most part, that will be a distant memory. Do I still have a detailed vision of how I'd do it? Yes. That shit sticks with you.With decision making, if you are manic and you want to start a new career, buy a new car, adopt a pet, jump into a new relationship, anything big with financial, sexual, or judicial consequences, I recommend waiting 3 months before moving forward. I have made soooo many mistakes while manic. After about the 4th big one, my husband and I agreed that I could think of something I was interested in doing, but then wait to act on it for three to four months and see if I still want it. Grand majority of time I don't and that's how I know it's mania.You can't rely on other people to not leave. In my experience, people will come and go. They may promise they can handle it, but bipolar disorder is intense and a lot of people get overwhelmed and walk away. THAT'S OKAY. You are not a lost cause if this happens. And typically the ones who are worth it will fight for you, learn about your disorder, and support you regardless. I've had people walk away when i was acting crazy and then come back once I got stable. Unstable bipolar people can be very toxic and sometimes people need to cut ties for a bit until you can get stable. But don't let it make you feel crazy or worthless if people walk away.Truthfully the only way to get control is find your right meds combo. Bipolar disorder doesn't go away. It is a defect in your brain and you need a medication to balance your brain chemicals so you can achieve stability. Unfortunately, no one medication works for everyone. So you're going to have to try them.Stability doesn't mean you are zonked and emotionless. You should feel decently normal, not overly happy, not tired and uninterested in life. Strive for content and optimistic.Best of luck to you!", "link_id": "t3_g6ss9t", "time": 1587699797}}

I'm assuming you have and that is why you are being so harsh towards someone who is trying to help.Second, I have never physically cheated. I have never allowed myself to communicate with anyone in person. It's one boundary I have set that I could somehow manage to keep. I think it is a lack of confidence that drives it.Third, I do my best to be a good mom and wife when I'm stable. I carry a lot of things on my shoulders and manage our household well. So yes, I consider myself a good wife.Fourth, the dehumanization of my husband is a mental process I can't control. It is part of the mania. If I could control and avoid mania, it wouldn't happen. I'm not proud ANY of this happens and my stable self has no desire to be my manic self. Please understand that the shift that occurs is not something voluntary. It's hard to understand that from the outside.Fifth, I do not justify cheating in any form. I am blessed to have an understanding spouse who has forgiven me and taken me back. He knows how hard I fight to be stable and he knows I don't choose this in any capacity. But I still feel like a piece of shit for putting him through any of this.Sixth, my husband knows everything. I let him know the various things I'm struggling with, though this was not always the case. It is a shameful thing to have these compulsions and I've never wanted to hurt him. The first time I had a manic episode I had no idea it was mania because I was only bipolar type 2 and I thought I really wanted a divorce. Even my doctor's thought it was my true feelings. Six manic episodes later, I'm much more aware. I know the steps that lead up to it like clockwork. But I still struggle to stop the progression as hard as I fight.My point is, you can hate us.

But when mania sets in several things happen to me that have caused me to emotionally cheat four times now. First, I lose all feelings for my husband. There's absolutely nothing I have found to stop this from happening. I have no control over it. Second, we start fighting a lot because I start noticing every single fault he has and holding it against him. I am actively working to let those go this time because they aren't important, but my feelings have still disappeared. Third, at some point I will begin craving emotional affection from someone I find attractive. I want to hear I'm pretty from someone new. It's like the craving of an addict. It becomes physically uncomfortable for me to not pursue this craving in some capacity. I will eventually begin to have panic attacks and get suicidal if I do not at least try to seek out some form of affection. With each manic episode I have been able to dial back the damage done during this phase but I have yet to be able to stop it.I am taking my medication as prescribed, seeing my therapist regularly, seeing my psychiatrist more often, and trying to follow through with my boundaries I had set in place. It's still happening though at a very slow rate. It is incredibly hard to control manic compulsions even though we know how wrong they are and how much damage they do.

I just went in and comforted him every 1 minute, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min, then left). He learned in two nights to self soothe. Once he could put himself to sleep, i worked on his naps, putting him down a couple hours after he had woken up, so 9 or 9:30. And he would sleep until 11 or so.

What you could try doing is controlling your triggers, so stay out of the sun if you're manic, get more sun if you're depressed. Stay away from music, films, stories that trigger your moods. Eat healthy, balance meals. Get light exercise. Think of yourself as in a bubble. That bubble keeps you safe. Ultimately though, bipolar disorder has to be controlled by medications. So the sooner you can see a psychiatrist and begin treatment, the sooner you may see improvement and results. Bipolar disorder is a life journey. It never goes away. You just have to work hard and learn how to control it. It doesn't have to be a death sentence, though sometimes it may feel that way. You can be stable, but you have to put yourself first and take care of your body and mind. And once you are properly diagnosed, i would recommend reading Taking Charge of Bipolar Disorder by Julie Fast and having your family members read it as well so they know what the disorder is and how they can help you.

{"eo38ya8": {"text": "I would suggest a couple things. Is she getting time away from being a full time mom? That alone can make you a hateful, resentful person. She needs personal time, time with friends, dates with you, etc. Furthermore, she may be one of those women who needs goals and appreciation for her accomplishments, and she may thrive better with a part time job. Also, how is your sex life? If you are no longer making time for sex, then that emotional connection is likely to suffer. I would highly recommend taking the Love Languages quiz together and trying to invest in each other's love languages. Often times we try to love each other in our own love languages, but the other person doesn't feel our love that way. A marriage counselor suggested that to us and it helped tremendously. We also each took the Myers Briggs test and that helped us to kind of see why we do the things the other hates and wsys to work around it. And as others have stated, communication is key. Learn how to fight things out in a calm, rational way and work to actually resolve the issues. Don't just fight to fight or spew hatred, and come to the understanding that you both want a resolution not just to be at each other's throats. Don't cut each other down with low blows, name calling, divorce threats, etc. You are teammates, not competitors. So treat each other as such.", "link_id": "t3_bqc81o", "time": 1558237345}}

Do you guys have a bedtime routine and nap schedule set up? Or are you still going by what baby decides? I would highly recommend getting a schedule in place. This will give you both more energy so baby isn't running your lives and you get some free time. In the early months, my spouse and I would have sex right after the baby fell asleep. Waiting until everything is perfect really isn't plausible when you have a child. Nothing is ever fully done in terms of cleaning and errands. And honestly, your postpartum body shouldn't be a factor. My spouse was just as into me after the baby as before. I would suggest possibly some counseling to help you guys figure out how to have a life together in addition to raising your baby. It is a tough stretch of life to figure out and everyone goes through it. I personally see a therapist regularly, and occasionally we have a couples session if we are struggling with anything.

{"emmab5v": {"text": "First off, I'm not lying to anyone. And I'm not evading. I answered the person above you and thought my answer also met your question. But i apparently misunderstood so i will address it now. Second, let's not be enemies here. We are randos on the internet but we don't have to hate each other or act like the other is evil. To me, zygote, embryo, all of those terms are just different stages of growth for a baby. Same way tadpole is a stage of life for a frog. So yes, i believe all of those stages define a human life. To be honest, I'm not even sure what it is referred to before a heartbeat other than a fertilized egg.Now as for the animals verus babies thing, humans are definitely more important than animals. We are in dominion over them. We were given that role. That doesn't mean i don't adore animals, especially kittens! It's a lot easier to raise a kitten than a baby haha. Now the circumstance you created isn't actually a question, but rather a way for you to entrap me in some heartless point that you think you can make about me. Remember, we are veing honest here. I don't want to kill kittens OR babies. I want everyone to have a chance at life. I also don't think baby lives are MORE important than adult lives, however i DO think they are equal. You seem to think that an unborn baby is of lesser value than a born human. That is where i wholeheartedly disagree. As far as the government, i think the government is far too involved in things as it is. I would much rather the human race as a whole step back and look at what they are doing to each other, to their children, to their families and make the decision to do better on their own. We don't need the government dictating our lives, whether it be Democratic or Republican. Part of the way we got here is by not valuing ALL human life. And why is a baby in utero considered non viable to you? If it needs an abortion, then that means it could live. That is viable life. Not a clump of tissue. Not an unaware blob. A baby, from the beat of its heart to its birth.", "link_id": "t3_bl5omy", "time": 1557117057}}

It is a shame those babies did not get to grow, however their loss has become a beacon of hope for people to eradicate diseases that otherwise would've wiped us out.

{"emm4dor": {"text": "I answered your first question above. I do believe a heartbeat defines life as I'm not sure about brain activity with babies so young. Before a heartbeat, to me they are cells. However the argument to get an abortion before there is a heartbeat is near impossible due to how quickly the heart starts beating.As far as pain, it has been proven a baby can feel pain at 18 weeks. Babies can respond to noise outside the womb as early as 13 weeks, we just can't feel it until closer to 18 or 19 weeks usually. If they don't like a sound, they will kick you to let you know it's too loud out there. But there has been record of an abortion done while there was an ultrasound going and the baby writhed in pain. The mother couldn't feel it, but it could be seen. 29 or 30 weeks is so incredibly far along and babies pain sensors and nerves in general are definitely up and running by then. Otherwise they wouldn't respond to being pushed during an ultrasound to move around so we can see them better. In fact, a baby born as early as 23 weeks and in the NICU is not allowed to be touched by hands more than necessary because it is so paingul to their undeveloped skin that the pain could kill them (i had twin nieces born that early, so that is my source for that).Ultimately, i wouldn't kill a cat's unborn kittens. It is life, even though it is an animal. Babies are a million times more important. And if killing a pregnant mother counts as a double homicide, then that babies life should count when abortion is suggested. It's still murder.", "link_id": "t3_bl5omy", "time": 1557112837}}
{"emm3hvw": {"text": "In my opinion, it isn't a human until it has a heartbeat. Before that it is just cells. The heartbeat starts at 4 weeks, which is a mere 2 weeks after conception. By the time you get a pee stick to tell you there are human growth hormones inside you, there is likely already a heartbeat. Doctors won't even see you until 6 weeks just to be safe. At a 6 week ultrasound, you can visibly see the heart pulsing. So i guess my point is theoretically sure? But if you go to an abortion clinic, they will do an exam to confirm a pregnancy and by that point it's likely the baby is already a baby. And look, i can empathize with the pain a woman goes through with pregnancy, and even when they aren't ready to be pregnant. I wasn't ready with my first. My husband didn't want to be a dad and it caused a lot of emotional trauma. But the second i knew i had a baby inside me, my whole life and thinking changed. You are responsible for a human life. You are making the choice to end a babies chance at happiness and life and love. You need to see that ultrasound, see that beating heart, and then tell me you still think it's best that little human be killed. When my son came out, nothing else mattered.

Spontaneous abortions is what they are dubbed when they miscarry for no real reason, and that is so painful and disrespectful for those poor women who have to take the pain of their babies dying and being expelled from their bodies. To sit there and WANT to expel that baby, to seek out a voluntary abortion is so messed up and disrespectful to these women who can't have children. Those women would trade places with you in a heartbeat. We pray that when we go in to our ultrasounds the heart is still beating. There are so many women who can't carry a child that would GLADLY take a baby from you if only you would give it a chance at life. We need to focus less on killing innocent lives, and more on connecting these women with families who will take the baby and raise it.

My issues started coming out in 2010 when i got cheated on and then started dating the guy i would marry. We married in 2012, had a rough first year that involved outbursts and me being physically violent, and in 2013 i was diagnosed bipolar. Since then it has been a battle to survive. I went manic in 2014 and emotionally cheated on him, we separated, and then ended up getting back together. We have nearly divorced multiple times, but i have fought tooth and nail to be stable and have been in therapy as well as marriage counseling and 7 years of marriage in and we are finally a functioning couple. I got pregnant in 2015 shortly after we reunited and while i feel bipolar does hold me back sometimes. I'm a great mom and i adore my son, so much so that i am pregnant with our second now. I was afraid of instability during pregnancy, but pregnancy has been the easiest time for me mood wise. The most important thing is that #1 the person you pick understands your disorder which means going to therapy with you occasionally, reading books on it, and being an active support for you. #2 they have to love you and be willing to fight for you and your relationship and not just throw in the towel if it gets hard. #3 You can't lie to them or hide anything from them. You have to tell them EVERYTHING to build that trust and camaraderie. My husband never gave up on me and that made all the difference, and he never gave up partly because he knew i would never stop fighting for stability which meant finding the right doctor, the right meds, doing the therapy, guarding my mind and emotions, etc. In short, marriage is already work. A bipolar marriage is even more work. But it is the most valuable relationship in my life and has given me the greatest blessing in my son.", "link_id": "t3_biy84u", "time": 1556594105}}

So that goes back to getting on the same page.Third, when my son throws a tantrum, I ignore him or redirect. If he doesn't respond well to redirection, i wait or tell him \"look at me, look me in the eyes.\" Then i calmly explain what he did wrong and what the consequence is. I do spank from time to time, and you will get mixed opinions on this, but i save spankings for dangerous situations usually. For instance, he runs into the street without telling me or asking permission, gets a spanking because he could die. And even then, i try my hardest to make sure I am calm when I do spank.My current discipline trend is taking away sugar first, then all tv or shows, then time out or sent to room alone.

But our son has TRIED to take up that baton and there are a few things I do to get him in line. He is only 3, but this has worked through sleep regressions, sleep rebellions, etc.1. Bedtime routine is no longer than 30 minutes. If he disobeys or dawdles getting ready, no bedtime stories.2. We have a childproof door lock on the door handle. I know a lot of parents have monkey locks which allow the door to be cracked, but no further. This keeps him contained to his room. If he plays with toys, we remove them from the room. He has learned to stay in bed now.3. We have an audio baby monitor in his room. This allows us to hear him if he truly needs us and we can communicate with him without actually going into the room. A lot of kids feel if they can lure the parent in, they are winning, and they will continue to fight you. If you can tell them to go to bed or else! over a monitor, it may discourage them from fighting the sleep to see you come in one more time.4. We keep the room dark except for a night light and we have a sound machine going to drown out random noises. This has been a life saver. He is a light sleeper and wakes at the sound of a car, thunder, etc. The white noise helps him doze off and stay asleep.5. My son is NEVER allowed to sleep in our bed. He has had nightmares and bad dreams, sickness, etc but we have never allowed him to sleep with us for many reasons, but one of which is because we know he will abuse it. If he has a bad dream, i hear him over the monitor and go comfort him. He has a blanket that is his comfort item and i will give that to him, rub his back, and tell him to go back to sleep, then I leave. For a while he would wake up early and I would crawl into his bed and sleep with him until the sun came up, but that was a phase and it ended. I think your kid is probably waking up so much because he knows he will wind up in your bed. If you break that habit, you might get a full night's rest. Hopefully! When I tell my son I'm not laying down with him, i look at it as teaching him to sleep on his own. It's a very important skill. He has actually never asked to sleep in our bed because I refused to do it, but if he had I would address it the same way.So all in all, my son goes down between 8:15-8:45 and sleeps until 8am. Sometimes he is up once or twice with a bad dream, but most nights he sleeps through. As far as a bathroom situation with the door lock, i know some parents will stick a training potty in there, especially for the younger one. But if they have a potty attached to their room, it shouldn't be a problem. You could always unlock the door once they actually fall asleep.

My symptoms started on implantation day. That was the only day I had cramps, my cervical mucus wasn't dry as a desert, but there was barely any. My nipples felt like they were on fire for a couple days around implantation, and then it stopped. My chin broke out like crazy and still is broken out. I started having heart palpitations several days ago, and my uterus felt heavy on and off as if my period was coming, but it was too early. I felt depressed, like you do when you're pmsing. I took an Equate Early test 4 days prior to my missed period, and it was negative. I took a Wondfo the next day, negative. I waited until the day my period was due (I had had a period for the last three months of the 24th of every month without fail), and it was negative, though I didn't have any signs of a period. So this morning I woke up and tested FMU with a First Response and got the FAINTEST line. I knew deep down this time was different. I had acne on my chin like this in my first pregnancy, and all the other symptoms were not normal pms symptoms for me. I thought I was out this month because online everything said if it's negative but it's an early test, it should show... but one day after my missed period there is a line, and I'm just going to pray until it gets darker and continue testing. I should be about 4 weeks and 1 day today. So don't give up!

The only one I trust is First Response, and even then it barely picked up my pregnancy the day after my missed period. Some women take a couple weeks after a missed period to show. Also, this month we had sex every other day during my fertile period and a couple days following just to be safe. The previous months we had quit trying on the last fertile day and I really wonder if I O'd later in my cycle than my tracking app suggested, so drag it out a bit haha.", "link_id": "t3_au718z", "time": 1551127488}}

{"eh5be5i": {"text": "I was put in outpatient therapy back in 2010 and it scared the crap out of me. I wasn't diagnosed bipolar yet, but rather cyclothymic which is just elevated and lowered moods, but nothing wild. I decided right then and there to ask all the questions, learn everything I could, and fight for myself so I would never have to do that again. In 2013 I finally received a diagnosis of bipolar 2. I had switched to a new psychiatrist and hadn't had a manic episode under him, so he decided what ever mania i experienced was lesser and hypomanic. Then sometime in 2014 i experienced my first major manic episode, which later escalated me to bipolar 1. It nearly destroyed my life. The scariest part was I thought it was normal. I was tired of my marriage, wanted a divorce, wanted a new relationship, just wanted to be free! So i separated from my husband, flirted online with a random dude, and moved away. My therapist and psychiatrist never suspected a thing. In two months I crashed and realized everything that had happened. Thankfully, my patient and loving husband took me back and we rebuilt our life. I have since fought through every manic episode and tried to be completely truthful with him, even if i made more mistakes. Unfortunately for me, i become obsessive about meeting new people, particularly men, online when I am manic and it causes massive anxiety to fight it. But each year I have learned more and more about how to counteract it. And this past year my goal was to avoid major depression, because if that didn't happen, I likely wouldn't over swing into manic territory. And it worked!Sometimes I have a pity party that I have to take medications to be normal. Motherhood is very hard at times because of the demand on you. But then i realize that those meds give me a life worth living. Without them, it's chaos. And my son deserves a decent mom. I try to be the best I can be, even with my limitations. And he says I'm his best friend so hopefully i am haha. I am on Seroquel, which contains the mania, and Wellbutrin which bumps me out of depression. About 50% of bipolar patients cannot tolerate antidepressants though, so they struggle a lot more to maintain their depression. Some are just too afraid to even try them, but i try to encourage people to try everything that a doctor suggests. The only side effects i currently suffer is dryness in mucus membranes, so I'm thirsty and what not. But I've had waaaaay worse.", "link_id": "t3_au2uwb", "time": 1550976813}}

A lot of doctors wait until after the teen years to diagnose bipolar disorder because hormones do play a lot into your moods and behaviors, but if you are already seeking out risky sex, you need to be treated for possible mania. It's the time of year when mania starts to hit people anyway. If you aren't managing the depression well, then you will always upswing too much with bipolar disorder resulting in a mood that is too high. So that needs to be addressed.

So if you take out your bills, you get $1170. Correct me if I did that wrong because math isn't my strong suit. But if that is the case, if you set a strict food budget for yourselves, like $400 a month (it is doable if you cook and meal plan), and then divvy out gas and cut entertainment for a while, you could put $50-100 a month in a savings account. And then chuck the rest at debt. I would cut out the debt that will rack up interest first. If you have an emergency, you can use the savings you build for it. But don't touch that savings otherwise. Once you eliminate the credit card debt, cut them up and don't get them again. I have never used a credit card for regular stuff unless i could pay it off that same month. I had one credit card for a small direct sales business and I threw my tax return at it and then cut it up. You should get a decent tax return with having two children, so throw some in savings and the rest at debt. Credit is dangerous, so avoid it like the plague. Only buy what you have the money for. Your bills are relatively low, so that is good. But you have got to knock out some of that debt you've built up so you can increase your savings account.

First of all, there will be days where the kid hasn't slept enough or is just in a mood, and no amount of effort on your part will stop those tantrums. But it shouldn't be an every day thing. So what I've done with my son first and foremost is pick and choose my battles. I feel like from an outside perspective, letting her wear her purple boots isn't that big of a deal. And i imagine it was more an effort to control an out of control child. Like she had done one too many things and the last thing she was going to defy you on was wearing mismatching boots. I totally get that. But i have found if i back off the smaller things and save the fight for the bigger issues, my son listens better and cries less because he isn't hearing \"no\" over and over. Whenever he does throw a tantrum and won't stop, I try to distract him. So I may offer him a snack, or offer to read a book together, even just go outside for a walk. It helps both of us to calm down and refocus. If she refuses to do any of those things, the best thing you can do is walk away or send her to her room and ignore her tantrum. They do it for attention because they know you will crack after a while. So don't give them a chance to break you.

The next day i checked in the garage and nothing was amiss.Another time i was up in the night and my cat was sitting on the end of my bed. I heard a wings fluttering sound and could almost picture this little winged demon creature (I've been able to discern spiritual presence my whole life). I noticed that suddenly my cat had her eyes fixed on a spot in the air. Her head darted as the creature flew under the bed. I heard an audible thud, then my cat's eyes followed it from under the bed and settled on a spot just behind my shoulder. I felt so defenseless.The one thing that told me i wasn't crazy was the night my roommate and i were sitting in our room talking. My cat was on the bed with us and the heat wasn't running.

It makes sense that he wants you to come along with his couple friends, as you are a couple. I would recommend befriending those couples because they will be important in the future.2. You are about to have a baby and will rarely ever get alone time again. You need to find a way to cope with that. You may end up handing him the baby and doing a Target run just to gain sanity. But most of the time your child will be in tow.3. When you are both home, can you not hang out in separate rooms or do your own thing? Often times my husband plays video games on the sofa and I watch a movie on my laptop next to him. He enjoys that I am close, but we don't have to interact. We do our own thing. It's rare that either of us is home completely alone. And if he doesn't allow you to do your own thing sometimes at home, you just need to be open with him and express that you would like some space to do what you enjoy at home.4. Before you get married, you need to make sure that you view him as your best friend. With a baby on the way, you two are going to have to lean on each other through some rough times. Your friends aren't going to be there to help you raise the baby, he will. You need to find ways to bond with each other and enjoy time with each other, instead of escaping with your friends every weekend. If you need to recharge by social interaction, have friends over. Make couple friends that you both like and host. But don't try to act single when you are married and leave him feeling rejected and alone.

Why can't she enjoy just dating and spending time together? Why do you have to move in with each other so fast? I feel she doesn't value sex as you do, and that could be a hurdle you would have to work through. I also question if she is mature enough for a serious relationship yet. If she still had that sorority girl mindset of \"sisters before misters, I can sleep with any man I want,\" then she probably won't value your relationship for much longer. I would just put the brakes on a bit and see if she is content to slow down and just enjoy each other's company. If she gets bored and breaks up with you or worse, cheats, then you will know she definitely wasn't the one. Because if she gets bored this early, she will definitely get bored later on. So there's really no reason to rush into anything for her. Go at a pace you are comfortable with and see if she can be content with that.

Over the summer I did themed weeks and we explored a different topic each week. Some topics were space, ocean, weather, jungle, etc. Pinterest is helpful with ideas. We would do crafts and activities relating to the theme, watch a show relating to it, etc. For jungle week we took a trip to the zoo. We made slime at home and he loves playing with that (super inexpensive to make). He also loves playing with Potato Heads so we make those together.

The other times we just run her outside to pee quickly. If she is crated, she will not go in the house at all. We put down puppy pads and she will poop on those if she absolutely can't hold it (like overnight). Do you have a fenced in area you can let him run some? We have a dog park that I will take my dog to and she will poop several times while playing and be done for the day. If you are walking him too little, he may be pooping in the house as a sign of irritation that he has to come inside, or simply because he didn'thave enough stimulation to go while outside. My dog will hold her poop until the very last minute so she can stay outside. Also, I would suggest positive reinforcement instead of negative (spanking or putting face in his pee) simply because a lot of dogs respond better to that sort of training. Dogs are inherently good animals, unlike cats who can and sometimes do things out of angst. What you can do is get some training treats and when he pees outside give him one treat and praise him. When he poops outside, give him two treats and praise him like crazy. Dogs love to work and make you proud, so if you can show him how to be a good boy, he will be in due time.

I have been told by everyone that dogs are pack dogs, and by being alpha i only mean i do what i say, so if i say she is going to stay outside until she poops, then we stay outside until she poops. And she respected that. I appreciate your explanation on not giving the dog everything. That helped. As far as her patience, i discipline my son when he messes with her. However, I will not tolerate her getting jealous because i am giving my son attention instead of her. That is not okay and that is what i was referring to. She has a crate that she can go lay in if she is overwhelmed and she is starting to do so. But I'm not going to not pay attention to my son because of my overly needy dog. And when she growls it's because my son is coming over to me for help and she is CHOOSING to lay on me. That's not my son's fault. As far as training, we are rewarding her for going to the door to let us know she needs to go. And we reward her for peeing and pooping outside. She also has chew toys and stuffed animals, as well as her own blankie. We have been working on simple commands like sitting and laying down, but it hasn't been as high priority as housetraining. So it isn't like we just adopted a dog and are ignoring her. She gets fed regularly, gets all the attention in the world, and gets a ton of walks in and multiple trips to a dog park weekly to run free. So i don't appreciate you assuming we aren't meeting her needs. But thanks for the other advice.", "link_id": "t3_a2iswf", "time": 1543797418}}

I come out of it around June. Have two really great months of stability and then head back into depression. This year I stabilized in June and managed to stay stable until about November.

{"eabjpnj": {"text": "Usually hypomanic is specific to BP2 as it doesn't last as long and you may not go as high. That's why mania is reserved for BP1. I'm sorry this is your diagnosis, however I'm hoping it means you will find something that works soon. Know that it can take a long while to find the right medications, but I'm a firm believer that meds are needed to manage bipolar disorder. Don't give up. You'll find a solution. Antidepressants can be major catalysts for hypomanic episodes, so it's important to take something to control the ups when you come out the depression. Lamictal works for a lot of people to manage depression, so hopefully it will work for you. My advice is to manage the depression so you can eliminate or minimize the hypomania. The more depressed you are, the worse the hypomanic episode. Think of it like a pendulum. You swing one way, you don't just come back to the center and stop. You keep going and swing to the other side. That's how bipolar depression differs from unipolar depression. So managing the lows can prevent the highs. If you do experience hypomania, the best thing you can do is get sleep and avoid triggers that could make you go higher. I reacted the EXACT same way with my spouse. I have bp1 and the first manic episode i had, i left my husband and tried to be with another guy but it never worked out. I repaired my marriage and have had several similar experiences since. Mania, hypo or not, is very destructive. My husband and i made the rule that when i decide i want to do something/buy something, i have to give it 3-4 months consideration before going through with it. This has prevented me from jumping the gun and getting a divorce or making extravagant purchases, or starting crazy businesses. Whenever i become manic i lose all interest and attraction to my husband which SUCKS. But I've learned that those feelings come back once the mania goes away, so I've just ignored that and powered through. So don't make any permanent decisions based off a temporary mental state. As far as the irritation and rage, i have yet to master that. It simmers just beneath the surface and a trigger can cause me to lash out. I just try to manage my surroundings so very little can set me off. Aside from all of this, take vitamin D in the winter, get ya some light exercise, get at least 6 hours of sleep a night, and eat right.

Avoid the general group of the medicine that did that to you and try something else. Also, some bipolar people can't handle antidepressants. So if you are on one, it could be causing the mania. Worth talking to your doc about it. Second line of defense, identify and guard against your triggers. If a certain type of movie or music sets you off, avoid it. If you aren't sleeping, that is gonna amp up the mania. So work on finding a sleep agent that works. Third, manage your controllables. The first thing is to come down from the mania. Stay out of sunlight as it can make you more manic. Don't exercise much. Eat healthy. Get at least six hours of sleep, more if you can. Sleep is one of the best defenses because you can't do dumb stuff if you are sleeping. Once you come down and stabilize, work to prevent depression. Mania is a reaction to depression usually. So if you go into depression, it is likely you will rebound and go too high into another manic episode. So take vitamin D (after the mania is gone), exercise, get some sun, etc. All those things prevent depression once you are no longer manic. It's a weird balance.

I would stay on top of your psychiatrist until they find something that at least lifts the suicidal thoughts. It is not normal behavior to want to die every waking moment. That is a sign the disorder is in control. Suicide truly fixes nothing. It destroys everyone around you. You also need to manage your controllables outside of meds. Stay away from toxic people, if your job is dragging you down then find a new one or see if you can take a break. Cut out as much stress as possible as stress exacerbates bipolar depression. Take vitamin D. Get in some light exercise and eat nutritional meals. Make sure you get around 7-8 hours of sleep and not a ton more or any less, and also go to bed at a decent time. Controlling those variables can help your medications be more effective. Identify your triggers and avoid them, even if that means not watching certain shows or listening to certain types of music.

{"ea0mbet": {"text": "Hi! So my first tip is to read. Read the genre you are interested in and pay attention to how they separate each act, how they weave plots and subplots, how they build worlds and characters. Read even as you write because it can help you work through writer's block.Second, google all your questions. The internet is an infinite resource and there are so many good things out there. Google character sheets and fill one out for each character. You don't need to include all the info, but use it for your own mind to shape them as they grow in your book. I also pick celebrities that kind of look like the character in my mind and envision them as i write.Third, discover if you are a planner or a pantser. Planners spend a month or so before writing the book creating in depth character sheets, world building sheets (google those too), and plot outlines. If that is you, google until you have a solid idea of your book. If you would rather just start writing and skip around and fill it all in later, then just start.Fourth, make a rough outline of events. Then get you a notecard booklet and dedicate each notecard to a chapter and a light summary of the events within. You can read this version of an outline like the book and see how it progresses, see if anything is out of order, etc.Fifth, I highly recommend getting Scrivener and writing your rough draft in that. Make sure you do a tutorial and write scene by scene so it doesn't mess up the final product. But it makes it so easy to skip around, make notes, save your character sheets/outline for easy access. I love it.Sixth, once you start writing, don't stop to edit. Just push through and finish the rough draft. Then set it aside for a month, and come back to edit it with fresh eyes.Seven, don't expect your first draft or even first book to be perfect. It will need lots of work, tons of ediring and rewriting, and you will find plotholes no matter how much you plan. If you find a section boring then your readers probably will too. Just write for fun. Don't put pressure on yourself. Enjoy the process :)", "link_id": "t3_9ydbzv", "time": 1542602403}}

{"e9jata1": {"text": "Hey there. I have bipolar disorder as well. Are you seeing a counselor and do you have a psychiatrist prescribing you medication to control the bipolar? I have been married for nearly 7 years. I've made many mistakes while in a manic phase. I've been suicidal more times than i can count. But my husband, who is very understanding and patient, has stayed by my side and loved me through it all. The main reason for that is because he knows I am fighting for myself by going to consistent therapy, getting medicated, and taking them as prescribed. Had i not been trying my best and doing my part, he probably wouldn't have had the patience to stick around. And i don't think he should have because not managing your illness is reckless and unfair to the people who love you. We have to take care of ourselves and you have been through SO MUCH that honestly just feeds your disorder. Counseling can help you confront all of the abandonment and trust issues, the pain and stress from the emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. It may take a while to find the right medication concoction to control your ups and downs, but it IS possible. I tried for five years and just now found something to stabilize me for 5 months so far. That's my best advice.Also, the subreddit  is very helpful when you need advice or someone to commiserate. They are all kind and don't judge.", "link_id": "t3_9wasxu", "time": 1541997494}}

Just don't ever forget to make a payment or it will knock your credit score.I would try to increase your savings as much as possible. Do you plan to rent or buy? If you buy, you have to have some sort of down payment depending on the loan you go for. Renting, you will usually have to have first month's rent and the deposit which is usually equal to first month's rent, as well as any pet fees and deposits they require. Having as much saved as possible will cushion you when you fork those over. Also, cooking for yourself, you can manage a meal as simple as peanut butter and jelly sandwich and chips for a dollar per meal. Or you can make a pot of chili or spaghetti sauce and eat off that for several days. If you cook, you can keep the cost of a meal really low, whereas eating out averages $8 or more per meal. I've seen it in my own budget that eating out will kill you and it's way less healthy too. With hobbies and such, i would say budget for them. Give yourself a limit each month that you can spend on your hobbies and put the rest in savings.

Try to have the high ground because people can jump over you and continue to aim, whereas your ability to aim will cap out directly over your head. I actually don't rely on building skills.

You can't stay out late because kiddo has a bedtime. It's incredibly hard. HOWEVER, having your own kid is worth it. My husband didn't want a kid when we had ours and the moment our son was born he fell in love. 2.5 years later and he wants another one. Your kids do something to you. Other people's kids get annoying. Your kids are different. They wrap your hearts around their tiny little fingers. Can they push every single button you have? Yes. But do they make you melt into a puddle of goo with one look? Also yes. They are a treasure. But you have to see them as a hobby. When you're tired, you have to remind yourself that you won't get that middle of the night cuddle session back. That's what gets you through the tough stuff. And then the rest of the time they are fascinating little mini yous that entertain you with their complex thoughts and big \"firsts\".

You can then look back at the month and see your ups and downs on a chart for you. Next, email your psych. If you can't email and get a response of some sort in 24 hours, you need a new one. Clearly this is an issie that should've been brought up in the last session. Also, i had a psych who was unwilling to diagnose me bipolar. I said goodbye. I had another who never answered my calls when a med was making me lose my vision. I left. I now have a wonderful psych who has a call service for off hours and will respond to an email within a day. Find one like that.You say you are already 20, i say hun you are ONLY 20. I'm guessing in your family maybe there is a cultural expectation of some sort? But bipolar disorder doesn't care about that. It will destroy you, so you have to get it under control. Your first step is correcting those meds. I have taken trazadone. It's not a big deal. I've tried about every drug available and the important thing is it regulates sleep and mood without negative side effects. You also don't need to take something without a psych's sign off. So find a psych who will work with you and listen. If you can get the meds worked out, you should stabilize and be able to get back to school. But you are headed for a break down right now. So get on top of it. You have to advocate for yourself and i know that is so hard to do when everything is crumbling, but you can do it. Just take one step at a time.In the future, i would suggest a family counseling session so a therapist can address your family and explain bipolar to them.

Your mental health is by far more important than any degree you could ever get. There's no point in a degree if you can't be here to use it, right?

What happens between him and your mom is their business, from sex to fighting. Don't get involved in that. It sounds like they could definitely work on their behavior. But you are only responsible for yourself, and so is your brother. Be there for him and help him grow up the right way, if your parents are lacking. And don't blame your parents for your shortcomings. That's lazy and an easy excuse. Take control of your own life and make yourself into a hardworking, intelligent young person.

Second, i think you need to find a way to forgive, or at least work through, what was done to you in your past and stop connecting it as an excuse to how you are now. Growing up, i was never supported in my dreams by my parents. And a lot of times now I'll be on the verge of chasing a dream and I'll start to doubt my ability to do it. I've let that doubt stop me, but what I've learned is if i approach that goal as a small step, and just chip away at it, i can eventually accomplish it, parental support be darned. I finally wrote my first manuscript a year ago, and i haven't completed a single manuscript in my lifetime until then. You can do anything you put your mind to. Third, stop viewing everything that didn't work out as a BIG failure. Life is a series of failures with some successes sprinkled in. That's NORMAL. Don't think you're special because you fail \ud83d\ude02 just get back up and try something else. You know that the worst that can happen is not succeeding. And that's okay. So try. Try anything and everything. Fourth, i know what you mean about struggling with weight loss. I used to be thin and then i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and after trying different meds for five years, i gained a lot of weight. On top of it, a lot of those meds make it impossible for me to lose no matter how hard i try. I would just remind yourself that 1. It's going to get harder and harder to lose the older you get, and 2. You can at least lose it if you try! A lot of people can't. So get out there and make an effort. Set weight loss goals for yourself and give yourself some sort of reward for each goal accomplished. If you actually try to improve your life, you're going to see how great it feels when it starts to improve and you won't wanna go back. Who knows, maybe on this journey of trying you'll discover a better career for yourself! If you can play D&amp;D, you have the brains to get a decent job. Don't feed into your self doubt.

Right now you need to knock the mania down a notch because i can tell you are incredibly manic just with how wordy your reply is. Have you tried zyprexa? That always sedates me to the point i can't be manic anymore. It gets me back on track (it does cause rapid weight gain so do your very best to watch what you eat). My doc will put me on it to knock me back to baseline and then switch me to something to maintain my baseline. You could try lithium, but if you do check yourself every morning to see if anything hurts, feels off, etc. I've had a couple meds poison me slowly so you have to be on guard. I never died though, so to me it's worth a try. Lithium kept me from skyrocketing to mania but it didn't help depression, but i know it works for a lot of people.  If you do take it, drink water even if you think you can't drink anymore because it is a salt. I drank until my pee was clear every day because it WILL damage your kidneys if you get dehydrated.

The doors were the slatted accordion style doors and all three of us could see long, black claws reaching through the slats. The doors started to open as we started screaming. The girl's mom rushed in to ask what was going on, and when we looked back at the doors, nothing was there except streamers (which hadn't been visible beforehand) and the girl who had said he was here, was passed out on the floor, dead asleep. We never invited her back.When i was in college, my friend and i shared a room in an apartment. One night i woke up around 5am. Couldn't figure out why. Then i heard this god awful alien sounding screech and something slammed into the wall next to my roommate's bed. I threw the covers over my head and then my cat jumped up on the bed. Suddenly i could sense a winged thing in the room, could barely hear the buzz of wings. I looked out and my cat was following the flight path of this creature as it flew under my roommate's bed, where i heard an audible thunk as it ran into something, then it flew out and landed behind my head. My cat followed it and turned to stare dead past me as it landed on my bed post. Later on, my roommate and i both witnessed a door opening on its own in this apartment.

So he may shut down to try and control that. Bipolar can also make you lose interest in people, activities, foods. It's usually just temporary, but it could be that some days he is really into the relationship, and other days not so much. That is no reflection on you though, so don't internalize it.

He needs to become stable in order to start functioning properly, which i will describe below.When my husband and i get into a fight, i often go silent, not to punish him, but to consider the argument and rebuttal that doesn't lash out at him. For people with bipolar disorder, we don't just get mad. We go from fine to RAGING MAD. We know it's dumb, but it is just a reaction within us that is near impossible to control. All we can control is how we release the rage. He may be trying to protect you, honestly. The worst thing to do would be backing him into a corner and trying to fight verbally. Giving him some space to think and not escalate the discussion/argument is best.With the neglect, he does need to know how you feel so you can work on it together. But i will say that often times i feel completely overwhelmed and overstimulated in life (worse with anxiety in the mix) and i have to be away from wveryone or i blow a gasket. There are many times i tell my husband, just leave me alone. I need space. And I've learned (after five long years) that when i am stable and up to it, i need to cover him in affection and make up for neglecting him. For me, a lot of times im drained and dont have much to give. It isn't personal at all. So dont assume he is an asshole or punishing you. I dont know him, but i wouldnt jump to that conclusion.

Wouldn't come out of hiding, scratched the crap out of me if she got scared. So we took some space. I let her be. Once we got rid of the other cat, she started coming out more. As my son grew older, she started sneaking downstairs onto my lap when he was napping. Now she's a total cuddle bug because i gave her attention when she wanted it and she changed.

Go back in, calm him for less than a minute, walk out, come back in 10 minutes, so on so forth. He will eventually learn that you aren't staying. We did a little cry it out after 6 months of cosleeping and my son got it in 2 nights and attached to a blanket and slept fine. It hurts to hear them cry, but it isn't causing them harm. It gives them the room to become an independent sleeper which they desperately need. My son now sleeps worse if he is in the room with us.

Someone willing to take the kids for a weekend so you can rest. A partner to get up with the kid at night or help you when they are sick, etc. Its rewarding. But sometimes I lose interest in being a mom and I have to fight running away because I feel so overwhelmed.2. Passing bipolar on to your child is actually less likely than giving them ADHD. It's possible, but it's not the most likely. I plan to be very aware and involved in my kids life and constantly keeping the door open to discuss feelings and mental health so he can come to me if he's feeling depressed or suicidal at any point. Adopting has it's own set of issues. You could adopt a kid who ends up having bipolar anyway, or OCD, or anxiety, etc. Its never guaranteed that they will be completely healthy.So really you have to decide if you can handle kids and everything that comes with them, mental issues included. I know how hard the decision is, but I'm actually about to start trying for another, so it's definitely worth it and not impossible to be a good parent.", "link_id": "t3_9ciwnb", "time": 1535956085}}

{"e5ayacl": {"text": "So sorry to stalk your page but I wanted to encourage you. I didn't have a relationship until I was 17 years old. First kiss with my first boyfriend.  It was pretty awkward and we broke up in like 5 months. None of my relationships lasted longer than a year and many of them were very hard. Breakups when you have bipolar disorder are HORRIBLE. They send you spiraling so fast. A lot of the emotions you feel are just infatuation and when that moves on, you end the relationship and break everyone's hearts. It took 6 boyfriends and 3 years (which sounds quick, but I was never single. Terrified of being alone) before I found my would-be husband. And even then, our relationship isn't easy. It's so much work. The beginning of the relationship is exciting because you're new and there's sexual tension and puppy dog love. But then you get past that stage and he does something unkind and you have to forgive him and choose to continue loving him. It's not easy to do that at 17. So basically, dont sweat not having a relationship yet. I too was boy obsessed. I thought every guy was the guy I would marry and I gave them a piece of my heart that I never got back. Take your time. Enjoy other parts of life and romance will find it's way to you. When you're older and ready to start exploring sexual relationships you'll find that the most fulfilling ones are those that you are madly in love with who love you back just as deeply. Surface relationships are never fulfilling. Wait for the guy who can't get enough of you. Who sees the bad in you, but chooses you anyway. He's the one you need to look for and dream of.

My advice would be to stop assuming how he feels, give him the support he needs through this difficult time, and give yourself a window to come out of the mania because it heightens everything- the sexual tension, the lovey dovey feelings, all of it. You may very well be in love, especially since you've felt this way a while. But on the other side, he just came out to you. He probably hasn't come out to anyone else, and many times guys are hesitant to enter a relationship with someone who is out if they aren't ready to confirm their sexuality to the public. So I wouldn't rush it. Give it time. Let the friendship and feelings grow in both parties. You'll know when it's the right time to bring it up, if you find a right time.

If you still love him when you are stable, then you can determine where to go from there. And dont sit there and assume realities that aren't true either. The lies you're telling yourself are feeding your depression. And that's what they are, lies. So tell them to fuck off and give yourself a chance to breathe. Get yourself stable and then make decisions. I have a rule of not making any big decisions for 3-4 months whether I'm manic or not. If I still want it, then I act on it after the time has passed. A lot of times I feel attracted to whoever pays me attention because mania makes me feel so alone. And mania also makes you obsess over things, people, moments. It doesn't make it true.

When he disobeys/ignores me/tells me NO! I make him look in my eyes and I explain why he is wrong. Then I put him in time out until he can apologize and admit what he did wrong. When he does something dangerous, he gets spanked. He learns quickly not to do dangerous things. When he is well behaved I will take him to the park or a play gym. Sometimes I'll plan weekly activities relating to an educational topic. I try to make sure I spend time with him teaching and entertaining at least once or twice a day. Kids do need interaction. However, they need to learn to play independently and be given that freedom. So he will have quiet/nap time in his room with a. doorknob lock, and then also some solo play time throughout the day with me supervising while reading a book or watching TV or something. Kids also love to help, so he helps me unload the dishwasher or vacuum, water plants, feed the pet etc. Teaches discipline and also spends some energy. When he is disobedient, I cut out TV, sugar, fun extra stuff until he chills out. Kids can sometimes be overstimulated from activities and act out as a result. This is why vacations can be less than fun with children. The thing kids want from you the most is time and attention. I regularly cuddle with my son while he watches a show and I relax. With bedtime, I will sometimes lay down with him. But many times I tell him good night and he may play for a few minutes and then crawl in bed and go to sleep. It's important kids learn to fall asleep on their own.

I personally struggle with it, but is it something you can do?If so, can you rent a room from someone to get out of the toxic environment you are in? You may have to start small and work your way up to better things. But getting away from toxicity will greatly help your moods.Next, are you on any medication? Medication is essential to controlling your moods. Some people say they can't find one that works and I agree, it is hard. I tried over 30 medications before I found a combination that worked. It's not impossible. You just have to fight for yourself and take them. Work with a doctor.If you can't take meds, you absolutely HAVE to set boundaries for yourself and avoid all triggers. Get 8 hours of sleep, go to bed at a regular time, dont eat tons of crap, make sure it's healthy and wholesome as much as possible. Take vitamin D and drink a lot of water. And make sure you get in some sort of exercise, even if it's just a walk. You have to control everything you can possibly control.Write down your triggers and also things that lift depression or contain mania and live by those because your life depends on it. You aren't a burden. Most likely your mom or dad gave you bipolar so it isn't something you asked for or brought upon yourself.Don't give up. You can have a normal life.

If you choose to love and be with a bipolar person, know that there may be days where you have to give 80-100 because she just can't do it. It may not get any worse, but different things influence bipolar from the weather to hormone changes. If you marry and decide to have kids, that time after giving birth will be trial and error. She won't have experience on how to prepare for the onslaught of hormones, so you may have to step up and be her advocate and do more than you would like. Bipolar people are worth loving. We have many wonderful traits and they shine when we are treated and maintaining a balance. But there will always be the possibility of manic episodes, suicidal thoughts, etc. It's not easy for anyone involved, but my husband has never left my side through it all because he doesn't want a life without me, even if it means it's hard sometimes. So just weigh what matters more to you: a potentially secure, calm relationship that will still have problems  (every relationship does) or a relationship with a woman you really like/love that may be chaotic at times but has the potential to be really powerful.

It's taken my life and completely turned it upside down in five years, but the thing is I'm stuck with this for the rest of my life. For better or for worse. So I'd rather share with you what bipolar has given me, and maybe it will encourage you in some way.Bipolar has given me a better understanding of how people operate, and as a result an undeniable compassion for those who have something strange going on in their brains.Bipolar has given me the opportunity to rise up to the challenge and not be a stigma. I've become the baseline for those around me who meet people with mental illnesses. I am an advocate for treatment and living above depression, and as such those around me know when someone untreated gives bipolar a bad name. I can't tell you how many people have said \"you've shown me the illness can be treated and they don't have to act like that.\" I'm not perfect. I'm very rarely baseline normal because I have a very severe form of bipolar 1, but I do my best to stay on top of my disorder and fight for my life. And that's what truly matters.Bipolar has taught me that being different is okay. That the uncontrollables don't define me. That just because I've gained weight from the 26 medications I've tried doesn't mean I'm not beautiful. I've fought a battle, and I'm winning. And even when I'm not winning, I'm sure as hell not giving up.Focusing on what it's taken from us will only make us feel defeated. Don't do that to yourself.

Sometimes you're pulled back and forth between the mania and the depression and it feels like normal you is gone. But the truth is, those sides are only episodes and they can only last so long before they change. I have a rule of thumb that if something interests me, I mull it over for at least a couple months before I act on it. This allows a potential episode to pass so I'm not making an emotion fueled decision. If I still have the desire or interest after a few months, I move forward with it. I try to research the interest in the meantime and make sure it's something actually interesting to me. Alot of times that will knock something out of the running too.

{"dud63sg": {"text": "Okay I googled this lithium orotate. It is just a supplement that isn't FDA approved, which is why your doctor probably will not work with it. It is over the counter, which means it is probably not as strong. But it is derived from lithium carbonate which is what I take. I would recommend speaking to your doctor about a low dosage of lithium carbonate as opposed to lithium orotate. He can keep track of it's effects on you. The only side effects I have experienced are some drowsiness, thirstiness (it's a salt so you have to drink A LOT of water), and frequent urination from the water consumption. It's not bad, and i have that in conjunction with the Lamictal. That would probably work well for you and solve the issue with your doctor.As far as the feelings and emotions, that is the cyclothymia. Once you get regulated, those should go away. Don't listen to them. They aren't speaking truth. If you're having antsy feelings, or a rapid pulse, that could be anxiety. I would recommend taking a bath or listening to music, maybe some exercise to calm those nerves. The rest can be controlled by medication.", "link_id": "t3_7y0nrn", "time": 1518823709}}

You don't want to play around with it though because if you have bipolar 1 the mania can go so high that you become psychotic and delusional. Also, I made a journal and just wrote whatever I was feeling and my manic phase is SUCH AN ANNOYING person. So even though you feel great, you may be acting crazy. Antidepressants are notorious for making mania worse actually. Mania feels great when you're in it, but when you come down and you see the damage you've done...worst feeling in the world. And then you have to pick up the pieces. Hypomania- which is in bipolar 2- isn't as bad. But you still don't want to swing back and forth. You need to level out.
