The hobby stitch world is a weird and confusing market.My friends parents bought an embroidery and print business because they were shady people and their main clientelle were bikies who needed their logos made. I was out of a job for a while and was given the opportunity to start working there.Now because it was shady as shit, it was functionally chaotic so that anyone who ever tried to audit them for whatever reason would never be able to sort out where the money came from or where it went, and this bled over into their production (I'm pretty sure some trucks were knocked over for some stock). So after about 3 months of working there I was like fuck this, I can run a business better than these chumps (huge manic thought) and I was undiagnosed at this point in time.So after frustration I started looking at buying my own machine and I came to my parents with a business plan and asked for some money to get a loan to buy a business from ebay (just a poor decision and an absolutely ridiculous idea). So of course I did it.I continued with the previous client list and figured shit out for the next year. It was a one man operation and I did this basically stoned out of my head because it was the only thing keeping me level. Then the kicker came a year later when I decided that I needed some sort of qualification. I figured I needed some sort of piece of paper in my life to say that I've done something. So we found a training company and they said they weren't taking on students. I was disheartened but my parents were like well why aren't they? It turns out they were going into receivership and were selling the embroidery side of the training company. So I bought that too. We made a stupidly low offer of $1 and said we would keep the staff on for 6 months and take the contracts so they don't default and they accepted it. Turns out this too was a horrible idea because the staff was why it was going into receivership and it was a shitshow. We got tied into failing contracts for 2 more years before we closed the doors.However we broke even.

With the added bonus of not having many side effects if any. Compared to ECT where there's memory loss and it's much more intrusive, I would definitely say to give TMS a go but it still might not be a super cure.

{"dhcyg9f": {"text": "Now I'm going to preface this with it not being just a \"I can't do this sober\" story. But also one of my favourite drunk stories. While I had been drinking earlier in the night no amount of alcohol I could consume could ever prepare me for the spectacle that I was about to see or burn the images from my mind.So a few of my friends and I would go to this backpackers bar which had an amazing happy hour and generally we'd take full advantage of it before the night went into a tale of full blown debauchery. Now this bar was a favourite of ours, not just for the amazing drink prices but because it generally had events on a Wednesday night that involved scantily clad women with audience participation. Now this was a special sort of night. Those nights where there's something in the air where you just know that it's going to turn south and turn south in a hurry and the feature event tonight was a wet t-shirt contest. Now we'd planned for tonight to be reasonably quiet; have a few drinks, go to a comedy club, head back home and rest up for a hard day on Thursday. But as we all know even the best laid plans can go awry.So after the comedy club where we were treated to some of the poorest stand up in amateur comedy history we were about to go home when my friends housemate took charge and led us all back to the backpackers bar. This confused us. While we were happy to go we were unaware of her intentions, she was a pretty quiet girl and while attractive she was no model to put it bluntly. We just assumed that she wanted to keep drinking for cheap so we thought \"Why not? What will happen in an hour?\" Well...As we were ordering drinks they called for the girls in the contest and she disappeared. Minutes later out come a parade of drop dead gorgeous girls in white t-shirts, our nervous looking friend and behind her... a girl in a wheelchair. There was whopping and whistles but as soon as the girl in the wheelchair got lifted onto the stage the bar feel into this weird confusion of \"Fuck yeah! Go you!\" And a \"Holy shit, no...\"So everyone in the contest stood up on a platform except for this girl in the wheelchair who awkwardly sat next to it. Our friend went first. Woo-ing occured, and this proceeded through the line of stunning girls until it got to the girl in the wheelchair, but when it got to her she just went for it. She ripped her top off. The bar was like well fuck, alright well played and she went through to the next round. Our friend was sadly knocked out of the competition at this point.The second round started. The other girls started to get competitive because they didn't want to lose the prize of a 1 night cruise to a girl in a wheelchair so off came their tops. The crowd went wild again. Then came the girl in the wheelchair. She dived out of her chair, army crawled across the stage and up onto the raised platform, and started making out with one of the competitors. We were like holy shit. She's done it again!The final round starts. The other two competitors start making out to try to compete again but oh no, this girl wasn't having none of that. Off come her pants and she awkwardly moves her legs up onto the platform and starts grinding on the other two competitors and then grabs the in house photographer to pull her in for the most bizarre, awkward looking disabled foursome in the world. Naturally she won the cruise. Unfortunately she couldn't go on it because it wasn't wheelchair accessible so they gave her another prize of equal value but shit did she deserve it.Confused, slightly horny and in a state of complete shock over what we just witnessed. We all needed a fucking drink.Tldr; watched a weird paraplegic foursome at a wet t-shirt contest. Needed a drink.     ", "link_id": "t3_6a997u", "time": 1494385168}}

What really helped me was CBT or Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and REBT or Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy. They help provide you with some skills in dismissing those horrid intrusive thoughts by challenging them and taking a lot of power out of the thought. For example \"Nobody loves me.\" Nobody is a massive generalization. You could rationalize that at least a few people love you like your parents, your pets, your close friends and that sort of takes the sting out of the thought. It can be really hard to do and it takes a long time and can be a bit of a chore to challenge each of these thoughts so I suggest that you write some stuff down, but in time it's really helpful. Keep your head up. You've got this. Edit: Another example is \"You're worthless.\" Is anybody truly worthless? We all have different experiences and skills that we have to offer. Even though it may not seem like it we have the ability to teach and grow. Even mistakes are a learning opportunity.If you keep doing this yourself you'll quickly get the hang of it.

Their was no way I could ever miss my meds like if I was at home. I had access to PRN's and 24 hour therapy support. My entire day was also planned out for me from when I got up to when I went to bed. There was only about 3 hours a day where I didn't have anything going on but if you compare that to lying in bed all day watching netflix, I was much better equipped to distract myself and as I had already alienated myself from my friends so being in a safe environment with non-judgmental people who were also having their own problems it provided a bit of social relief as well.

Then eventually I was over that hurdle and I didn't miss it that much. I did need to plan. I knew that without bud I would be depressed and that I couldn't be in the house watching tv. I knew I couldn't be around people who I would normally smoke with. I knew that with mixing my weed with tobacco I would have cravings hidden behind nicotine so I bought myself a fresh pack of cigarettes. You've got this. Break it down. Prepare yourself for what you've got to do and once you get over that 2-3 week hurdle you'll be sweet.Edit: Also you did say that the doc was giving you Vraylar for the symptoms, I haven't used that but does that help with sleep? It may be worth talking to them about Temazepam or even some Diazepam for a short period of time. Sleep is a fucking big one. I still don't sleep unless I have Seroquel.", "link_id": "t3_5og716", "time": 1484636114}}

But the following things have helped me manage my life just a little bit better.- Get yourself a good routine in place. Discipline trumps motivation. Having a good routine in place will also limit the decision making process and bring a little bit of stress out of your life.- Work on sleep hygiene! Limit external light sources in your bedroom etc. And make sure you're getting appropriate amounts of sleep. Your cortisol production follows a circadian rhythm and bottoms out at about 4.30am and builds slowly throughout the day with minor fluctuations. Your body needs time to build its production.- Factor in time for self-care. Even just a little piece of time out each day to (preferably before bed) to do something you enjoy, collect yourself and relax does wonders.- Look into CBT therapy with your psychologist or even online counselling if that works for you. It focuses on challenging your thought process and mindfulness which will take some of the power out of those thoughts.Best of luck! You can kick butt!", "link_id": "t3_5hsb1f", "time": 1481500951}}
