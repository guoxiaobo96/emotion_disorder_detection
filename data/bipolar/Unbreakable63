My suggestion, for what it's worth...Be proud and make your own difficult experiences work for you as a valuable tool for helping your clients. As we all know, nobody that hasn't been where we have gone truly understands the intricacies of depression and anxiety. I sought real help because my doctor confided in me that she shares some of the same thoughts and feelings that I do. She suggested some great resources that have worked for her and I really appreciate that. I feel much better knowing that I'm getting help from someone who really understands my challenges and struggles. Don't let it beat you. The world needs more good caring doctors and  therapists.

{"etmm23m": {"text": "The first couple of weeks were really rough. Nausea and dizziness while adjusting and a couple of random panic attacks. I started on Effexor for the first 2 weeks but didn't see much positive change and was switched to Cipralex (20 mg/day now). Another week of side effects but by the third week I started to feel some clarity and less noise in my head. Logical thoughts flowed better. Aside from insomnia and lack of motivation now, I'm feeling hopeful and know I made the right choice to get professional help. Way less dark thoughts...Please don't let other's opinions or worrying about what people will say stop you from getting help. Know the you're not the only one struggling. Some of us have a hard time managing the beast in our heads and have forgotten how to cope or learned bad coping skills. Never surrender!The meds are just the start for me but I feel they have put me in a position to move forward and to learn how to hopefully experience joy be happy again. Learning self awareness skills are essential to be able to live in the moment. Thats big. Work in progress...  Hope this helps.

{"etm8klu": {"text": "I ruminate about the past and what I had then way more than I should sometimes. Life was better...even though I know now that I was faking it back then already. Try to distract yourself by thinking about what you do have to appreciate in your life at this time and accept that we can't go back. We can control the future but need to reboot/re-learn what depression and anxiety took from us. Planning an activity that takes you out of your comfort zone can be quite rewarding, after the fact, and you never know...could lead to meeting new people. Seeking help and confiding in those you can trust are steps in the right direction. It takes time to repair many years of negative thoughts and behaviors. Stay strong man! At 56, I've finally decided to stop worrying about the stigma and admit that I'm not able to fix this on my own. We are all here for you Friend! I started on meds 6 weeks ago and I'm seeing a dim light at the end of tunnel for the first time in many years. Therapy starts next week.
