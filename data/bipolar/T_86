Honestly, as someone with BP I can say that he will probably not be too thrilled about the idea of being hospitalized when it\u2019s brought up by anyone other then himself. Earlier this year while my spouse was away, a good friend of mine called an ambulance on me after I had admitted to taking a handful of my pills. I was so mad at her for the longest time. Looking back now I\u2019m actually quite thankful to have such caring people in my life. Suicidal ideation should never be taken lightly, however, a hospital probably won\u2019t commit him unless he admits to having an actual suicidal plan. But maybe you could explain to the doctors that even if he doesn\u2019t have a plan, while manic he\u2019s making poor choices that could lead to an accidental suicide; like taking too many pills and along with too much alcohol. It also can\u2019t hurt to tell them that you have kids at home. My father is bp1 and growing up I saw/heard a lot of traumatic things. You need to put their safety first, but at the same time getting him help is still putting him first too and you can remind him of that. Maybe when your husband is in a more stable place you could get him to read the book as well, it can\u2019t hurt for him to know what you go through too. You\u2019re both struggling with his disorder just in different ways. If you have any questions or just need support and to chat please feel free to private msg me at any time.

{"f820m8m": {"text": "33f here who has struggled with eating disorders my entire life. I\u2019ve either gone months to years binge eating and gaining weight or extreme restriction of calories and high workouts to become underweight (most my life it\u2019s been that one). On top of binge eating and anorexia, I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 12. Although anorexia is a huge struggle occupying my anxiety, it\u2019s a struggle I can hide. Bipolar, however, does not have that luxury. I\u2019m also a bit of a perfectionist and control freak so I\u2019ve worked extremely hard at learning to best handle my bipolar disorder. Long story short, when people come into my personal life that I feel are going to stay, there know I need to tell them about my bipolar disorder. That\u2019s become easier for me. My bf who I\u2019ve lived with for 3 years is very supportive and one basic rule we use to keep our relationship work despite my mental illness is to never lie about anything, big or small. We try to work as a team and help shoulder each other\u2019s burdens so being completely open and honest is crucial to that. I\u2019ve been struggling hard with anorexia the past 13 months. I didn\u2019t lie to my bf but I just didn\u2019t tell him for quite awhile. If he asked questions like if I ate that day, I told him the truth but I didn\u2019t fully open up about the actual struggle I\u2019m going through till a couple of months ago. I think it\u2019s really important to fully explain the struggle for others to understand. We can\u2019t expect them to understand at all what it\u2019s like when they haven\u2019t been through it or seen it other than how the media poorly/wrongly displays it. You need to sit down and tell him the exact thoughts you have, as terrible as they might be. Let him see you cry or shake over it, fully make him aware so he can better understand that this is not something to take lightly, that an anxiety pill won\u2019t make it go away or that simply thinking happy thoughts will help. Maybe even read books that you can relate to and lend them to him so he can see that it\u2019s a real disorder, or watch YouTube videos on it with him. He can\u2019t know it\u2019s not just a \u201csad feeling\u201d and that it\u2019s an actual illness as real as cancer or diabetes unless you educate him. So sorry for that long post.

I've written out my personal story below in case you can relate and would like to chat or if anyone else reads this and does. Feel free to private message if you do.I've only been restricting my calorie intake for a little over a year now. I started at 181 lbs and now I'm 107 lbs, so that's 74 lbs lost which is a 40.9% change in my total body weight but keeps me within a \"healthy/normal\" BMI of 20.9. I'd have to be 94 lbs at my height to have an underweight BMI of 18.4. I'm kind of obsessed with all the numbers; numbers to my BMI, numbers in pounds, numbers of calories burned during cardio, numbers of calories I can restrict in a day, total number of calories in my food vs how nutritious it is, etc. My \"goal\" weight keeps changing. I was always known as the tiny girl throughout my life before being put on psych meds that hugely affected my weight over a 3 year span; after that I was just \"short\". As if having a mental illness wasn't bad enough, it was also like part of my feminine identity was taken away. A little over 13 months ago I decided I was going to dedicate myself to becoming the tiny girl again. I stopped taking any of my psych meds that had poorly effected my appetite, metabolism or over all energy and drive. I started intermittent fasting at first to introduce myself to new eating schedules. I found out my TDEE and this of course led to a lot of cardio and calorie restricting, which for me also meant eating even healthier foods then before so I could now eat larger meals that were lower in calorie but kept me full longer. I'm not going to lie, my calorie restricting started off pretty high even at the start. I would only allow myself a maximum of 700 calories a day. This led to 500 and now I strive for 200-400 depending on the day. The restricting isn't even about fast weight loss any more. It gives me a sense of control which is something I have always sought for. Having a mental illness makes the idea of self-control seem very appealing and I guess healthy?   Right now, I want to want to recover. I'm hoping I can start after Christmas/New Years. Social settings where people expect you to eat give me a lot of anxiety. It's really occupying my mind right now so I don't think I can fully focus on the idea of wanting to recover until after the holidays. Also, I'm hoping by then I will be a nice even number of 100 lbs, bringing my BMI to 19.5 just one number above \"underweight\", so I can still say I'm normal.", "link_id": "t3_dvbgys", "time": 1573577490}}

It\u2019s angers me do much. Having to be underweight to get a diagnosis is super scary because it doesn\u2019t take into account how long you\u2019ve been struggling. It\u2019s possible you were obese prior to anorexic behaviours setting in. If you went from obese to eating only a few hundred calories a day plus over exercising, over time this can obviously effect your body\u2019s organs just as dangerous as someone who\u2019s underweight. Reading that I\u2019m not anorexic prevents me from getting help and I desperately need and want it, I just don\u2019t have the tools to get better. It also makes my sick brain think that I\u2019m obviously fine since I don\u2019t fit the anorexia diagnostic criteria. Sorry that was my own personal rant. There are actually many other types of eating disorders that don\u2019t require an underweight BMI for a diagnosis.

I\u2019m a 33f and only 4\u201911 so approaching 200lbs was terrifying for me, especially since most my life I\u2019ve been tiny, but definitely for health concerns as well. I started with intermittent fasting. It taught me to have more self control throughout the day and to not eat just because I feel like it. Then I incorporated CICO by downloading MyFitnessPal ap and tracking what I planned to eat that day first thing in the morning, this way I could plan to have a deficit for what my body needs. That made me want to eat healthier so I could actually eat more (chips just aren\u2019t worth my entire calorie count for the day lol) it made me take responsibility for what I was eating. I started some light cardio but for 45mins a day. I\u2019m happy to say that it\u2019s been only 7 months and I\u2019m already 52lbs less! My advice is just to incorporate little steps at a time.", "link_id": "t3_cade6q", "time": 1562595739}}

{"et6s150": {"text": "33f who saw my first psychotherapist at age 11 because my older brother (he was 15) begged my parents to get me help. Obviously at a young age the psychotherapist took her time before diagnosing but by age 12 I had my first diagnosis. My mother kept me in therapy and I started medication but when my father found out, he refused to acknowledge that anything was \u201cwrong\u201d with his daughter and so I was forced to quit both meds and therapy. My life was a mess as I grew up, erratic spending, early marriage and divorce out of mania, self medicating with chemical drugs and drinking, random one night stands, lots of self harming, lots of job turn-arounds, a couple of suicide attempts, randomly moving far away from home and applying to college randomly at an older age. By my late 20s I ended up in the hospital and started seeing a psychiatrist who (very quickly) diagnosed me yet again but this time I decided I really needed the help because I never wanted to end up in the hospital again. I did a lot of research and decided to get blood work done by my GP in case it wasn\u2019t bipolar and it was something else like a thyroid problem, when that was ruled out I sought out another psychiatrist to get another opinion. This psychiatrist took his time which I appreciated and after a few months he diagnosed me with bipolar (3rd time now) so I\u2019m very confident in this diagnosis. After about four years of med trials I\u2019m now on the right med combo for my specific brain chemical chemistry, I\u2019ve done a good amount of therapy to learn my possible triggers and learn strategies to minimize the damage I can do during episodes. I\u2019m mostly stable now. However, last November I decided to stop taking my anti psychotics because even though they are mostly side effect free I do believe they\u2019ve destroyed my short term memory...this past April I ended up in the hospital again and I\u2019m now back on my meds because I\u2019d rather be 33 with the memory of an elderly person then to have to go through an episode that terrible ever again. Long story short, after over twenty years with this disorder I have realized how important it is to not only take you meds but to try therapy, educate yourself and when your stable to make up strategy plans to prevent the damage you can do during episodes. Also, toxic people (even if family &amp; even if you love them) are not as important as your mental health and quality of life.", "link_id": "t3_ca2shd", "time": 1562518324}}

However bipolar is a bit more complicated as their is bipolar1 and bipolar2. For starters, either bipolar does not mean that your moods cycle at the drop of a hat or constantly change, that is the stigmatized version tv shows. Episodes of mania (or hypomania) and depression last anywhere from days at a time to maybe weeks at a time or even months at a time. Both type1&amp;2 can experience hyperactivity, very grandiose feelings of euphoria or sometimes rage which can make impulse control difficult. Bipolar1 experiences mania which causes them to have delusions or even hallucinate. Usually they tend to experience mania more then they experience depression. People who suffer bipolar2 don\u2019t become full manic, they become hypomanic so they don\u2019t have delusions but they still experience hyperactivity, euphoria, irritability and difficulty with impulse control. They tend to suffer more depression then mania which gives them a higher suicide rate.  I absolutely am leaving a lot out here but it\u2019s a basic description.

From what you\u2019ve described so far, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s mania, probably hypomania which is the case for people with bipolar2. Try not to get fixated on bipolar the only possible diagnosis this early on though. It could be a multitude of mental illnesses. It could be bipolar2, depression plus adhd, borderline personality disorder, etc. In any case, you\u2019re right to be a little leery about psych meds. They\u2019re super helpful because like all illnesses if mental illness is left untreated, it will only deteriorate and get worse. However, it usually takes many trials of different medications before you get the right combination for your specific brain chemistry.

{"erk0vbf": {"text": "Did you get a diagnosis from a psychiatrist or a GP? It\u2019s my personal opinion that GPs should not be prescribing psych meds since they aren\u2019t specialized in that area of medicine. If you haven\u2019t seen a psychiatrist, I\u2019d definitely recommend it to get put on meds that are more suited for whatever you\u2019re going through. It just seems odd to me that a doctor would say they think you have mania but then only give you Zoloft an SSRI. It\u2019s pretty unethical for a doctor to that considering that it\u2019s well known that solo treatment of SSRIs tend to throw people with bipolar into mania. Some sort of mood stabilizers really should be prescribed as well.  Unless I\u2019ve misunderstood things, I\u2019m going off what you have posted so far.

What causes them and how to treat them definitely needs more research.  For me personally, I think both medication and therapy has been helpful in treatment.  The meds definitely more so but therapy has taught me the difference in what is my personality and what is the \u201cillness\u201d.  It\u2019s taught me that I may not always be able to control my emotions but I am able to control my actions. I also think that the general public needs to learn this because more and more people are being diagnosed with personality disorders and assuming that it\u2019s out of their control which makes no sense considering it\u2019s called a personality disorder.

I was dating and living with a guy at that time who was not a good support system at all.  I kinda thought all \u201csupporters\u201d were like that.  He acknowledged my illness but threw it in my face all the time.  He never believed things were as bad as they were, I should just suck it up and take a pill...need flash I already took my pills that day! Anyways, we broke up and eventually I ended up with this amazing man who knew nothing at all about mental illness, in fact he had never met someone with a mental illness before me.  We live together and he\u2019s the best.  He goes to local support meetings with me. He reads about the illness, he never tells me to just take a pill, he helps to watch out for my episodes and he\u2019s by my side during them.  I guess this is s long post to basically just say, proper support systems are out there, hard to find but they are out there and I hope you do find one.
