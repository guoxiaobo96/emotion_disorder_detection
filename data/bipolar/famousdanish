But obviously suicidal expressions are emergency alarm systems versus a caution sign we'd rather express here.For me, I am usually unable to cry, so crying has met more willingness towards empathy. Another example would be aggressiveness if one's default mode is passive. Of course, the other may find their own distractions impossible to get past, which to me would signal an unhealthy relationship.

Maybe try joining a club, and give it time to get to know people. For me, stage crew was a good way to kooky people like me, and you can be as social as you want. Also, NASA or SpaceX is a cool goal, for me, I wanted to be in a successful rock band. At this point, at 29, I just wanna be happy. I don't think achieving my dream is a necessity to being happy, and I also think I could find another dream worth shooting for. Best wishes, hang in there.

I've found sometimes going in-patient helps reset things, notifies my family that things are getting dire, and can turn things around. Also, if you're working, you can get short-term disability or utilize the family medical leave act to take time away from work, if you need to (of course, just in the US). Sorry that things are sucking, my life is sucking too, but I'm trying to think of how I can push myself through this.

You're capable. You can freaking ace your engineering classes like you did the SAT, network with your professors like you did your principal, and turn things around. Maybe your grades are plummeting now, but who hasn't had one of those semesters where they fucked up (especially early in a college career).With your mom, that just sounds silly. From my perspective, I would try to laugh it off. Like, your mom watching you like a hawk to see if you're gay? Sounds like a sitcom premise, hehe.

Unfortunately, at six weeks I got depressed and rationalized smoking. I would wear the patch, then take it off when I wanted a smoke. A week later and I relapsed completely.Trying patches again later, I always smoked while wearing them, sometimes even with the patch on... I think that if you relapse during a patch-quitting attempt, it weakens the patch's future efficacy, in my opinion, since your brain associating the patch with smoking cessation is compromised.While wearing the patch, I definitely had a great reduction in cravings. Probably 90% less in intensity. But, if you're smoking cause you're stressed, your brain still might crave a cigarette, because it needs to feel all the sensations of smoking to say \"yes: cigarette de-stress protocol complete\".I definitely noticed some insomnia with patches. I would feel energized late at night, then remember my patch was still on. I'd usually take it off. I don't recall a difference between patch-on/patch-off in preventing craving cigs upon waking.Best of luck. Hope it works for you. Every technique's worth trying out.
