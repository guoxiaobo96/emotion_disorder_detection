{"ek2obzm": {"text": "Thank you so much for posting this - I\u2019m tearing up just typing this. I was at a house party - at his house - he was mixing me drinks all night. Pretty soon, I was blackout drunk, my friends had all left, and the guy kissed me. I turned him down. He still attempted, told me \u201cno one has to know\u201d, and I left his house in tears. Here\u2019s where it gets fuzzy: I don\u2019t know the area of town I\u2019m in, I\u2019m blacking in and out of consciousness, and I can\u2019t find my way home. I remember walking down a street and see the guy with some buddies. Relieved to see someone I knew, I went with them to a bar (that they snuck me into). Blacked out again - came to in the middle of it happening at the house I fled earlier, blacked out again almost immediately. I woke up mortified in the morning and he acted like all was great.. I feel so guilty for continuing to talk to him that morning, for trying to make a relationship with my rapist out of guilt for \u201cdrinking too much\u201d and \u201cfeeling like a whore\u201d - maybe I wouldn\u2019t feel so filthy if we dated. He insisted he tried to take me home but I just didn\u2019t want to go. Looking at my phone calls from the night before, I called my dad at 2 in the morning and hung up... my rapist texted him back as me saying I was fine. We worked one more shift together, then he never showed up to work again. My genitals hurt so bad, it was hard to sit for nearly a week. I was covered in hickies (I\u2019d never even had one up until that point). And I just accepted that I drank to much that night and deserved it. It took 2 years, spiraling into a suicidal depression, a ton of therapy and a therapist literally telling me \u201cyou were raped\u201d to come to terms that it wasn\u2019t consensual and it wasn\u2019t my fault.

{"ecuekcy": {"text": "I am so sorry this happened to you, no one deserves treatment like this. At 19, I (25F) was raped by a coworker (33M - 27M at the time) after I drank too much of whatever he was mixing me that night at a house party. I remember rejecting him trying to kiss me and leaving his house in tears, blacked out, and woke up completely violated and confused in his bed the next morning. I was so ashamed that I actually tried to hangout with him to make myself feel like less of a slut and \u201cmake something\u201d out of it. He worked one more shift with me and mysteriously quit, never spoke again. It took two years for my depression and anxiety to push me to the point of considering ending my life. That\u2019s when I talked to a therapist and after some long, long talks, I finally opened up to her and she helped me realize that what this grown man did was rape. There were so many signs that it was not consensual (i.e. calling and hanging up on my parents at 2am and someone else texting back as me claiming I was fine, physical genital pain for nearly a week, hickies all over my neck (I\u2019d never even had a hickey before), amongst other things). I still blamed myself for nearly 2 years and while I understand now that what he did was wrong, I still blame myself every now and then.
