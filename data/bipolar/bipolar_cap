However, to pick up on another of your points: If you are in the UK, check out the Bipolar UK website for meet-up groups:https://www.bipolaruk.org/find-a-support-groupI understand if you are sceptical, but I didn't know anyone I could talk to with bipolar until I attended a group. It was such a relief and humanised all this stuff we read.", "link_id": "t3_dhcfor", "time": 1570991293}}

Or writi g any of the stuff down - I think it's the principle of \"if it comes out of my head and onto paper  it becomes real\".But I've also been using the eMoods app on android for the past 3 weeks and it's so easy and NOT like journalling. It took me a while to set it up as I wanted it with a couple of custom tracking points on diet and daytime naps. But now it's up and running I have started to collect some solid info about how my moods are changing.

{"f0onnft": {"text": "Hi WWV, I am also recently diagnosed, about 6 weeks ago, but I'm feeling a lot brighter now (maybe heading towards hypo - eek) as my meds have had some time to kick in.My advice: Roll with it, keep telling yourself and others that you will need time. There is no quick fix to stability. It's OK to question the diagnosis but stick with it for now until you've given the experts a chance to get it right. Educate yourself and those important to you. This forum, local support groups, and YouTube (check out Polar Warriors) are great resources. Track your moods - I use the android app eMoods. When you feel motivated, think about how to build a support network. I asked for help on here and have worked with some of the suggestions in the past week or so as the depression lifted. Give yourself time and be kind to yourself. I've kind of mentioned this already, but it's really important.", "link_id": "t3_d5wv91", "time": 1568815932}}

I've only recently been diagnosed BP2, but I've been treated for depression my whole adult life. The darkness comes and the light can be far away, but you will see it eventually.

We spend time with her, we talk to her about the world and we listen to her. We teach her about everything that surrounds us - people, nature, hobbies. We support and encourage her in whatever she wants to do. We know when to take a step back and let her be independent, and how important that is.Yes, my daughter is more at risk than the general population of having an illness in the bipolar family but she will also have opportunities and a level of understanding and support that most of us can only dream of.

She is the light of my life and I am usually able (to a certain degree) to stay relatively even with her whatever my mood. I find that by emersing myself in her world - play, colouring, cuddles with a family film - I can hide from my own and I feel better.But she can't be that saviour to me. It is not fair for her to carry my pressure - especially as I see in her some of my traits even at her young age: seperation anxiety, mild asperger traits, attention defecit. She needs to live her life free of my pressures and I am already steeling myself to the difficulty I will have as she grows up.I adore her more than life itself - her need of me is perhaps why I am still here - but if truth be told, if I had known what I know now about my condition, I wouldn't have had a child.
