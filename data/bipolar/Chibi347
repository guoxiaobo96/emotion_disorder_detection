He actually weened me off the olanzapine I was on and reduced my lithium to a pretty low level (750mg). I\u2019ve only had one manic episode, though no one told me officially, I\u2019m pretty sure it was paired with psychosis too. My doc classified my episode as mania so boom: bipolar 1. The Bipolar Survival Guide is an awesome book that can help you navigate through the process. The mind can be fragile, and it\u2019s scary to have that foundation shaken, so you\u2019re not alone, we have all been there I\u2019m sure. Any drug can work for you, so you may have to sift through a couple to straighten it out. Valproate is an anti-convulsant that is used for bipolar but also epilepsy. It\u2019s up to your doc but my two cents is lithium is tried and true for a mood stabilizer. It\u2019s my opinion that some doctors don\u2019t prescribe lithium as much because pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t make as much money off it as they do off of newer drugs. However lots of folks here seem to have a good rapport with Lamotrigine (Lamictal). Like I said before, get a couple opinions and no matter the outcome you have support through this sub.

Also most people display bipolar behavior around 25 or later but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen earlier. I\u2019d say if you find your routines, work, hobbies, school, effected negatively because of your mood swings the best thing to do would be to seek professional help.
