I struggle to make and keep friends, mainly because I act like a robot and can be awkward. It's a catch 22. If I don't mask I might risk being rejected even more... What has helped me a little bit with coping with rejection is realizing that all this is not my fault. It's not because I'm bad or defective but because my brain is wired differently. That is not my fault, and the way society is, is also not my fault.  I try to remind myself I can't live my life trying to make people like me. I've been doing that for the past 34 years and it's only led to burnout, anxiety, and other mental health issues. It's something I need to keep reminding myself of. I can only try show people I'm interested in what they have to say and that I care, and leave it at that.
