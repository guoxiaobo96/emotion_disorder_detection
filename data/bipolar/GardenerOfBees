The first few times I dropped, I was so afraid of what it was trying to show me that I completely wasted it by being distracted. So I would encourage you to remain open to what it shows you, the good and not so good. I find it to be a very good tool for growth and introspection. Also make sure you are in a place with people you really trust because this can make a huge difference.     I would also encourage you to really consider what it is that you are hoping to get from the experience, as well as what your expectations are. I have oftentimes found that how I am feeling internally and what my expectations are, are quite often a huge factor in how the trip plays out. It's like acid just zooms into and shows you your inner world.   So I recommend that in the days before you trip, consider your motivations and expectations.The day of tripping, review these again and also check in with yourself: are you in a good place (mentally, physically, emotionally)? Are you feeling well (not sick)? Do you feel comfortable and ready for this experience? (it's normal to feel nervous). Do you feel safe with the people that you will be around? If the answer to any of these is no, then if I were you, I would not trip that day and/or with those people. At any time before you take the tabs, you can stop the experience and not do it. Your safety is of paramount importance and you need to do this when you are ready. You have an entire lifetime to drop acid so do not feel rushed or pressured.    Other misc things: have fun and be safe. Our minds are amazing things and I wish you a good trip (when you drop your first time).Holler if you ever need anything.", "link_id": "t3_dpl4vu", "time": 1572515607}}

My reasons for getting it done were simple: I had felt different my entire life and despite how much I tried, I could never quite fit in.It seems as though we want a diagnosis to explain things that we do, experiences that we have or other things. It sounds as though you are in the same category as me. I have observed that oftentimes a diagnosis is simply but the first step. Being on the spectrum may or May not have led you to the choices you have made and experiencs that you have had. However, in the end it will be up to you to change your behaviors that have been causing you issues, or come to some sort,of agreement with your wife and partners regarding issues that are causing difficulties.Basically, I am saying that having a diagnosis may help explain things but in the end it will be up to you to decide whether you wish to change these behaviors and if so, to create a plan for doing so.So to answer your original question, I think despite whether or not you obtain a diagnosis, I think counseling would really assist your partners in figuring out a plan of action for the future that will satisfy all of you.

I grew up not fitting in (despite how hard I tried) and felt like everyone else had been given \"The Guide\" which showed how to act in every situation. Since growing up, I have figured out how to pass as normal but I still have this overwhelming sensation of being stuck behind this glass wall, where I can see,others, but I cannot interact. In real life this translates to not being able to form friendships and all of my relatiomships being at an acquaintance level. I actually did not even tell my husband that I was getting an assessment done, for fear of judgment. Eventually I did tell him and he can take or leave it. Doesn't seem to matter to him.As for your husband, it sounds really frustrating that he seems to be dismissive(?) of your concerns. I know for myself, I had spent my entire life trying to figure out why I was so different from everyone else (mentally, on the inside I mean) and once I got the DX it was a relief that I finally had a name for what made me different. So if you feel the same as me, this could be a life defining moment and it would be deeply saddening that I,could not share it with those I loved the most.Whoa sorry, did not mean to ramble on like that.
