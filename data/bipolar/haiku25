{"ef7ri9i": {"text": "I recently just got out of a three year long relationship with someone verbally abusive. I was in your shoes and I know the struggle of wanting to leave but being afraid and so uncertain. I\u2019m currently doing intensive therapy but haven\u2019t started the program yet. I can\u2019t tell you to leave, that never worked for me when people told me the same thing. It has to come from within you, sounds cheesy I know and I\u2019m sorry it does but it\u2019s so true. You\u2019re going to be so lonely and vulnerable, and your head is going to repeat all the good memories and nostalgia will try to force you back. Just try and remind yourself that it\u2019s going to be so scary to leave and go out on your own but I can tell you, it is going to be worth it. Yes, you\u2019ll feel isolated but with therapy and hopefully if you can find other support networks, you will find this sense of relief and inner strength you didn\u2019t know you had. You really do deserve better, no one should ever treat you that way but I can\u2019t tell you or force you to leave/make decisions for you, you have to do it for yourself. It took me more than a year to finally leave and I was so so scared and it\u2019s only been two months of me leaving and I\u2019m grateful I have my dad who is my main support network and I hope you have/or can find someone to be one for you. Looking back, I wish I didn\u2019t wait as long as I did since there\u2019s so much damage done and I know it\u2019ll take a while to fix what they did. But it took some time for me to make up my mind but now that I\u2019m out, holy shit, I can finally breathe, and I am starting to process everything and I look back and realize how utterly wrong it all was. I really do hope you leave, it\u2019ll be scary but the freedom will be such a relief. Do it now, while you still have the chance, it\u2019ll suck and hurt but don\u2019t wait any longer until more damage can be done (what I wish someone would\u2019ve told me). You already know it\u2019s wrong and he shouldn\u2019t treat you that way and you do want to leave, you just have to take a deep breath and be brave. I don\u2019t know if this helps and please don\u2019t think I\u2019m ordering you what you should do. Just put yourself first. Sorry it\u2019s so long.

It\u2019s like I made it a huge important part of me to buy all of her shit, as though I was special for scoring the LE stuff. Stupid right? But then I just slowly got tired of it (before her stupidness was unleashed). I was so fed up of how it was super LE and yet, she\u2019d rerelease it due to \u201cpopular demand\u201d.

Her makeup team and online swatches were not how they looked in RL. Which brings me to here. I DON\u2019T support her. At all.

{"eaoceg1": {"text": "For the longest time I just ignored how toxic they were for me since the realization that shit, I don\u2019t actually have many real friends, was just a little too much for me to handle. But this past summer, my mental health deteriorated so badly that I may have had a nervous breakdown and I was so incredibly depressed and self-destructive that I had to see my therapist and psychiatrist bi-weekly just to check in. So, I thought we were great friends. We would hang out every night after work, we texted at all hours of the day, it was always us spending time together and talking. Then she got a boyfriend and slowly (so slowly that I didn\u2019t actually notice until much later), she started replacing me with him. She still made time for me but it was definitely reduced to how it was before she when she was in a relationship. Then it got bad. I really needed support and she got antagonistic. She slowly shut me out, never replied to my texts (\u201csorry, I was so busy, I didn\u2019t see your text\u201d) even when her phone was glued to her, she stopped inviting me out, only inviting me to the gym so she could work out whenever her boyfriend wasn\u2019t busy. When I tried to talk about how I wasn\u2019t doing so well, she either ignored me or the last few times, looked at me and walked away. I think that\u2019s when I realized fuck her, I don\u2019t need someone shitty like that in my life. Now when I see her, it\u2019s awkward and she always acts fake and tries to plan hangouts but I learned after a few failed attempts that it\u2019s just her way of saving face. When I look back, I\u2019m actually ashamed at myself, I must\u2019ve looked so pathetic and pitiful.

And I guess in my culture, no matter what they do to you, they\u2019re still family. (I\u2019ve learned now, through therapy, that being family doesn\u2019t give them a pass to be toxic/abusive to you and just because they\u2019re family, you can cut them out for your own mental health.)It was the little things. I\u2019m younger and when our mother used to hit us, she would hide behind me and when we were left alone to clean up the mess my mom always made after her meltdowns, my sister would leave me alone to go watch tv. Or when she told our mother I said \u201cfuck\u201d when I was 7 and our mom forced me to eat a bar of soap and my vomit and my sister just watched and smiled. Or in University, when she found out through snooping in my stuff how much student loans I received that year, she had a meltdown and tried to convince my family (when I refused) that I had to give her the money so she could travel Europe. Or when I stupidly lent her 3K and she gave me two hundred dollars back after me begging and said she didn\u2019t owe me more. Or when she lied to my extended family about things I supposedly said and almost had me disowned just because she was jealous that they liked me more than her. Or on my dad\u2019s birthday, she took him to a diner and asked to borrow money so she could go to Europe and made him pay for dinner because she didn\u2019t bring her wallet. Or last year, when she came over and I was in the washroom, snooped in my room and found my pay stub. She saw how much I made and demanded I lend her an entire pay check so she could get her hair done and go on a trip (even though she makes 65K and I sometimes don\u2019t even manage to pay some of my bills or I skip meals). Or when I was in the hospital after a suicide attempt and she somehow managed to turn the whole thing about her and even the psychiatrist, a nurse and a social worker mentioned how damaging my behaviour was to her and how hurt she was. I think the final straw was when our grandmother was in the hospital a few months ago. Prior to this, she made it quite clear she was done with our family and didn\u2019t care about what went on (when all of us stopped lending her money). So when a few of us flew to see our grandmother a province over, she found out through a distant cousin and sent me text after text saying how I was a toxic POS  and how I should be ashamed that I never let her know. It was rant after curse riddled rant about how she hated me and was done with me and that I should go to therapy because I was a horrible person and she was left out. Not once throughout her text tirade did she ever inquire about our grandmother or ask me what had happened. Nope, the entire time, it was all about her and how horrible I was. She even went into graphic detail that our grandmother could be lying dead and cut open on a \u201ccold metal table\u201d and it would be all my fault.It\u2019s kind of pathetic how after all these years, I just accepted her treating me horribly and using me and damaging almost all aspects of my life. I know it\u2019s messed up but it\u2019s nice to know there are others that have dealt with people like her, that others have cut off contact with them.

{"e641stz": {"text": "For the past two visits, I had issues. Usually when I go, it\u2019s a breeze and I always get approached asking if I need help. More often, I get approached multiple times in one visit. Today, I wasn\u2019t approached but honestly, I think they were just short-staffed. The 1st time: I bought some foundation last VIB Rouge sale in the wrong colour (I\u2019m bad at matching!), so I went to exchange it for the right colour. A simple exchange. Nope, the girl wanted to charge me the difference when it was a simple exchange. She argued with me and I was just dumbstruck. Finally, a senior member came over and quickly did it for me and told the cashier how to do it next time. She was still very rude and abrupt with me and told me that usually \u201cwe don\u2019t do this\u201d. Even though the senior cashier said it was fine to do so. The 2nd time was today. I received two highlighters in the mail, completely shattered. They come in clear boxes so I knew immediately that there was no way I would pay for a box of dust. Preface: I had cashed in my points for the $100 code. So I went and the cashier was so nice and said she didn\u2019t know how to do it so she got the senior cashier to come over. The senior cashier saw it and looked at me and asked, \u201creason for the exchange? Did they come like that or did you open them?\u201d I explained that yes, I received them exactly like that and no, I didn\u2019t even bother to open them when it was clear they were destroyed. She asked me three more times throughout this exchange as though she was trying to find me in a lie. She saw that I also wanted to buy a Kush mascara by Milk makeup (for a friend) and said \u201cwhy don\u2019t you try Benefit\u2019s new one?\u201d I explained that, no, I loved my Kush mascara and wanted a new one to gift to someone and that I only buy cruelty free. She then argued with me that Benefit is cruelty free and trust me, I\u2019m obsessed with always making sure I only buy CF makeup and I told her no they weren\u2019t. I explained that they sell in China, so they aren\u2019t CF. She argued again, interrupted my comment and asked in her headset if Benefit was CF. After a very awkward and tense moment when no reply came, she shrugged it off and said, \u201cwell, if you want that one, it\u2019s fine but Benefit is better. But if you like it then whatever.\u201d  She also said that because I bought the highlighters with the code, they were final sale and that they\u2019d do it this one time for me (as though she were doing me a favour). I doubt the validity of what she said because it doesn\u2019t make sense why it\u2019d be final sale if I paid full price but just used a code? No one else mentioned that to me either. (The exchange took almost 30 minutes where the senior cashier and two managers had to come help but I don\u2019t count that as a problem since they were all very nice. Except I got this weird vibe that made it seem as though I was trying to con them when I legitimately just wanted to exchange two highlighters and buy two additional items).  Overall, this is actually the only times I\u2019ve ever had problems with Sephora. Honestly, I\u2019ve been really lucky and I\u2019m grateful for that. But these two experiences really bummed me out and for sure, I will continue to only buy online.

But what has really helped me was CBT/DBT therapy. I also realized that I couldn\u2019t continue to live like this, cutting myself apart and turning all of my rage and contempt inward. Therapy has made me realize that instead of hurting myself when everything becomes too much, I need to process and regulate my emotions.

Sometimes, everything becomes too much. The emotions are overwhelming, everything around us is too stimulating, it all hurts, it\u2019s just...too much to bear. Hurting myself is a (negative) way to cope with things, to regain control of myself and my emotions. Therapy is teaching me to be mindful and to try to cope positively. Do you think therapy would work for her? Also, what the other commenter said was true. She has to want to change. External pressure is just that, more pressure to deal with.

{"e60cn7z": {"text": "Hi, dual diagnosis here as well. I have BP-II, BPD and other comorbid illnesses. I was diagnosed with bipolar I\u2019m 2015 and I remember that day so clearly because all the pieces just fell into place. I was put on meds and I slightly responded to them (I also had a horrible psydoc that gave me things no bipolar person should take) but also became even more unstable. I never thought I had BPD, at all. I always blamed everything on the bipolar. They do overlap and once I got the bipolar diagnosis, I thought it just made sense. After two hospital visits in two years, getting medication that either made me mentally or physically ill, I finally got a new psydoc. Around six months ago (or 4 or 5, I actually don\u2019t remember the exact date from the top of my head), I decided to see a therapist. I had watched a few YouTube videos (I know, not the best idea) on the difference between BPD and bipolar. I knew I was bipolar, I had responded to the medication but I also knew something was off in me. I saw my therapist (who specializes in BPD) and within ten minutes, she confirmed my fears. I had both bipolar and BPD. She did doubt my bipolar at first but not anymore. With new meds, I\u2019m stable and I hope that my bipolar is under control\u2014for now at least. Which leads me to my BPD. Medication solved a ton of (bipolar) issues but it has made me very self-aware in that I can now tell the difference between the two. For the longest time, I had blamed everything on bipolar, even the mood swings, intense fear of abandonment and irrational bouts of anger. It wasn\u2019t until a year ago when I lashed out and became super angry over something so trivial and someone pointed it out to me that I knew something was wrong\u2014other than my bipolar. Being chemically stable has forced me to realize that I now need to work on my BPD. It\u2019s so weird, before when I was unstable and extremely depressed, getting the BPD diagnosis on top of bipolar was just too much for me to bear.  But now, I feel like it\u2019s not only manageable but with CBT/DBT therapy, I can slowly relearn things. Before, I had blamed bipolar for everything, hated it and myself and yes, at times I did use it as a crutch. I\u2019m now at the point in my life (30 next year) where I\u2019m tired of being messed up and I just want to live. In the best capacity that I can. It all sounds so positive but I swear, it\u2019s really not. I\u2019m currently struggling with my identity (who am I without my disorder(s)?), some ED-related stuff, anxiety and a toxic (abusive) work environment. So, I have good days and really bad days where I just resort to bad habits because it comes naturally. But now I\u2019ve stopped fighting everything and have reached the acceptance phase. This is my normal and yeah, I hate it sometimes but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known and I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m sorry this message is so long. Apologies for any spelling or grammatical errors, I\u2019m typing this about to fall asleep. I guess this is my own rant. It feels really good to know there are others out there with dual diagnoses.

{"e5rthjr": {"text": "What helped me tremendously a few weeks ago, after telling my therapist how I was going to kill myself the night before (plan, notes, etc all prepped and ready) was her understanding. I told her the circumstances and the empathy was something I\u2019ve never felt before. She listened, empathized and would say, \u201cthat must\u2019ve been very invalidating/isolating/must\u2019ve hurt so much\u201d. She told me I could text her if I was ever that close again. That\u2019s the first therapist that\u2019s treated me like a human, with respect and decency. My past therapists treated me like a case (one only speaking to me when she had my file open on her desk. Never looked up either) or a transaction. Sure, my current therapist asks questions but she also just chats with me. I\u2019m much more open with her because she sees me as a human as opposed to my past therapists who were very cold but feigned interest. So broadly speaking, (what had me opening up) was empathy and compassion. Both times I was in the hospital, the doctors were so so cold and almost antagonistic. One even standing there and loudly demanding if I should be locked in a secure room or not, \u201cif you say you\u2019re suicidal, what\u2019s going to stop you from running into traffic?\u201d  I mean, I see his point but I went there for help, for understanding, not to be yelled at or treated like I\u2019m a horrible person. Both doctors only saw the suicidal but not me. Not my humanity, not my circumstance, nothing. The therapists I had to see (where I live (in Canada), if you leave the hospital, you HAVE to see \u201curgent care\u201d therapists until they deem you\u2019re okay) in the hospital and outside of it, were understanding and nice but even then, I was still treated like a case file. A one hour clock in and that\u2019s all. I\u2019ve struggled for so long by myself, being told that if I needed help, all I had to do was ask but literally no one ever helped. Even when I asked.

{"e5nbpqi": {"text": "First of all, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. Sorry for the long message! But I can relate too. I\u2019ve lost quite a few friends recently and some work friends because of my mental illness. I\u2019ve noticed that they\u2019ve moved on without me. When I\u2019m depressed, I tend to have darke humour, I tend to be very self-deprecating and I kind of withdraw and isolate myself. My friends used to hang out with me almost every day after work, they texted me every day\u2014at all hours, and my work friends loved to be around me. When my depression worsened, they started to distance themselves, little by little. It started off with them slowly not inviting me out, not asking me how I was doing, not replying to my texts for hours, then days and now, they don\u2019t reply and I\u2019ve stopped texting them. The thing that hurt the most was when I realized my work friends stopped coming near me, as though they couldn\u2019t bear to even stand next to me. They stopped talking to me unless they had to. Then last week, my best friend accidentally shared huge news with me and didn\u2019t understand why I was so upset that she hadn\u2019t shared it sooner. She said she didn\u2019t want to bother me. I called out a different friend on why we don\u2019t hang out anymore and she said that she used to offer but I kept saying no, so she stopped asking. (I\u2019m going to use \u201cwe\u201d but I\u2019m not speaking for you or anyone else, I just find it\u2019s easier to write that way for me. Sorry!) What a lot of people don\u2019t realize is that, even if we say no, they should continue to invite us to hang out. Just because we\u2019re depressed doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t want to be invited. Sure, we\u2019ll probably turn down the invitation but being invited feels good. It feels like they\u2019re still trying to reach us, that we\u2019re not drowning in our isolated cocoons. I asked my therapist about this recently and she said 1) some people are uncomfortable with mental illness\u2014they don\u2019t know how to act around us, so they withdraw, intentionally or not. 2) she said that some people don\u2019t want to \u201cbother\u201d us because they know we\u2019re struggling. What they don\u2019t realize is that sometimes, having a distraction makes us feel a little bit better, more \u201cnormal\u201d.  We just want to feel welcomed, involved and not alone because when we\u2019re depressed, we are so lost within ourselves and so isolated. Depression is so destructive. It\u2019s soul crushing, it isolates us and it\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019m not trying to justify why those people withdrew from you. Not at all. I don\u2019t know their reasonings and personally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay how they\u2019ve excluded you. If they know that you\u2019re struggling, that you seem different, they should be more understanding, more compassionate, empathetic/sympathetic, and kinder. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re struggling. It sounds like you\u2019re doing your absolute best to remain functional at work. I get why you completely break down when you get to your car. I do the same after work too, except I cry when I get home. It sounds like it takes so much out of you at work\u2014to function, to seem \u201cnormal\u201d, to cope. I wish I had advice or better words to offer you. I see a therapist, it works for me. Do you have anyone like that for you? I\u2019m so so sorry you\u2019re going through this.

It doesn\u2019t make either of us a bad person. Not one bit. I firmly believe that people who SH aren\u2019t bad, aren\u2019t \u201csick\u201d or \u201ccrazy\u201d (someone at work mentioned that anyone who SH is \u201creally crazy,\u201d yeah eff that person), we just have different coping mechanisms. SH itself is bad but we aren\u2019t bad because we SH. You wanting to quit is honestly, the first and biggest step. Because this time, it\u2019s you that is behind the motivation, not anyone else. And it\u2019s true. Those people got it wrong all along. It should be YOU that wants to quit, you should find your own reasons for doing so, their reasons (I\u2019m sorry to say this) are all crap. They\u2019re all pretty shitty reasons that is supposed to guilt and shame you into quitting. Which is shit, if you ask me. Because that now makes you feel guilty when you do cut because you feel like you\u2019re alone and have no one to talk to since they\u2019ve all made it clear that cutting is bad and anyone that does so is bad too. No offence to your therapist but really? Therapy is supposed to be the one safe place where there\u2019s no judgement and they\u2019re supposed to be super supportive, even with SH. My therapist never made SH off limits, she listens, gives input and tells me that every day I don\u2019t SH, is a victory. It sucks that you can\u2019t talk openly about SH to your therapist, sorry that you have to deal with that. I\u2019m here if you ever want to chat. Really!

There are periods I stop but I always come back to it. I\u2019ve added other destructive coping mechanisms but I still come back to cutting. I had to go to the ER twice in two years and the desolation and pain I saw in my dad\u2019s eyes made me want to quit. I said I did but I\u2019m back to secretly cutting in shame.

My self care has taken a hit and fluctuated depending on my mood. Honestly, I\u2019m still struggling so I don\u2019t feel like I can give you the best advice. But what works for me, try to shower at least once every couple of days, even if you can\u2019t leave your bed, just try. Make it that one positive thing you do that day. Other times, dry shampoo. Lots of it. And try to wash your face, if you can manage it, every morning. If you can\u2019t, at least every other day. That\u2019s about all I can say. I\u2019m currently lying on my bed with dirty hair full of dry shampoo and a greasy face. We win some, we lose some, I guess. Have you checked out the bipolar and bipolar-2 subreddits? They\u2019re a lifeline, I do recommend you give them a look. Most importantly, please please please don\u2019t beat yourself up. You\u2019re fighting a hard battle, there will be days that you can\u2019t leave your bed. On those days, don\u2019t force anything. It\u2019s so exhausting to be depressed that adding the anxiety of self care into the mix will only make you feel worse. Don\u2019t tell yourself to get up and do X, or \u201cI should do Y\u201d.  Just focus on surviving. If you have supportive friends, that\u2019s great, try to let them know that you need support and good intentioned advice is also sometimes really hard to deal with (\u201cOP, you should do X\u201d or \u201cif you do this, you\u2019ll feel much better\u201d.)  You have so much stress and anxiety dealing with mental health and school that please try not to pressure yourself into feeling better or comparing yourself to how you think you should be, or comparing yourself to your peers. Easier said than done, I know.  If you ever need to chat or anything, send me a message. I\u2019m here and always down to lend support. Most importantly, be kind to yourself. Sounds like shit but give yourself a break on the hard days. You are trying so hard, going through so much but you\u2019re still trying and I think that\u2019s what counts. You posting this also shows that you are doing your damndest and that\u2019s amazing.

{"dvwvc1a": {"text": "I'm not going to try and write a comment about how WPD affects us as a society/culture or some other shit. I'm going to write what WPD means to me. This is the first time I've ever commented in this sub, I'm not as witty as others here so I usually let others comment while I lurk and upvote. But here's my story and why I check WPD daily: I was in the hospital this past April after a weeklong mixed state (bipolar) episode with severe suicidal ideation/attempts. My left arm was a battlefield of butterfly bandages, scabs, and surgical tape. After leaving the hospital, everyone around me was super fake-nice, giving me the cut and paste response on why life is so wonderful and beautiful and how it's all worth living and everyone around me loves me. It was forced saccharine and it was lies. A few days later, my coworkers and extended family went back to bullying/abusing me and that's where I am now, almost a year later. Depressed, broken but still trying to remain hopeful. The one constant in my life (aside from music, medication, crafts, and journaling) is this sub. Watching other people die is cathartic, visceral, crushing and really makes you face your own humanity and those around you. You see things that are so violent and horrible and yet, you keep clicking and keep watching. But seeing the violence makes me appreciate the fragility of our lives, makes me *want* to live, makes me grateful for everything that I have and I tell those I love daily how I'm happy they're in my life. When I'm at my lowest, ready and wanting to die, I come to this sub and somehow through the horror and blood, it eases the pressure, even for a little while. When I want to harm myself, I go to WPD and after a while, the urge goes away. Watching the destruction of others makes you see the dark in the world but you also see the light, you begin to appreciate all of the good and kindness around you. I am more aware now (after this sub) of my life, my empathy and the dangers all around us. This past week when WPD went private as the mods and admins discussed what to do with the sub, I felt hopeless. I know that sounds stupid, it *is* stupid but this is one of the few subs that I check daily, even every few hours. I feel less alone in my miserable humanity, that sounds so melodramatic but it doesn't make it any less true for me. Now, if WPD is banned, yes, it sucks and I'll feel lost for a bit but that doesn't make the horrors that are occurring around the world disappear. It's just censoring them, forcing sunflowers in our faces instead of letting us choose what we want to view. If this sub is gone, how will we bear witness to the atrocities and violence that is happening even now as I type this and as you read this? They *are* happening and we owe it to those that are dead to remember them, even if it's seeing them die over and over on replay. By getting rid of this sub, you are essentially negating the suffering around the world that people are actively recording for others to see, for others to find out about. Censorship doesn't negate violence, doesn't erase the victims, terrorism, police brutality, domestic violence, suicide, and murder. It's still happening, you are just limiting the access to videos people *want* others to see. You can't sanitize the brutality and beauty of real life. Let others decide for themselves through their own autonomy what they want to view. In our current sociopolitical climate, we should be aware that censorship is more harmful than WPD.
