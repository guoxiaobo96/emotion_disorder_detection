I take Ritual vitamins and just asked for the prenatals for my next subscription which should come in less than a week.

That work environment wouldn't be great for me as a mother since I already had issues with PTO. Now that I am a unit secretary, I only work 3 days a week (12 hrs shifts) and this would significantly save on daycare and my mom already said she would babysit on the Saturdays that my husband and I have to work.Met the hubby on OkCupid. We've been together for six years, married for three years TODAY! We bought a house in August and decided we would start trying in 2020...and here we are.My primary medical concerns are my weight (I am 5'3\" and 208 pounds) and my issues with chronic pain. I have fibromyalgia and had a spinal fusion in 2009 which gives me a little trouble at times. However, I am in the process of getting my doctors in the loop about TTC so we can work through those issues accordingly. They've been aware for some time that I'm near that window of wanting to try and they've given me great advice.

I'm also anxious that I will NEVER get a new job and I'll never be good enough to get hired.3. Riding in a car where I'm not driving. I was in two accidents over the course of six years: September 2009 and October 2015. The first accident, I fractured my spine and had to get surgery because of a distracted driver. I struggle with daily pain. The pain got worse in October 2015 when I was rear-ended at a stoplight by yet another distracted driver. I'm worried about what everyone else is doing while they drive. I know I can't control their stupidity but I fear that one more distracted driver is going to put me in a wheelchair or worse.4. Social situations. If I don't know everyone that will be there, I am filled with dread. I am a Girl Scout leader and I barely know the other leaders in my service unit, yet I am required to go. My co-leader wanted to come but she has an event for her daughter to attend. I'm worried.5. Loud noises/loud speaking.

As someone that suffers from chronic pain (mine is located in my lower back from a spinal fusion), I have been where you are right now. I lost some friends and the ones I managed to keep, I had to educate them on why I tend to get \"flaky\" sometimes. I have to tell them that there are days where I can't even get out of bed. I even had to flake on someone yesterday because the snow made my body ache. The unfortunate part is that I have a close friend that knew me before and after the accident that caused the surgery, but I feel like I have to constantly remind her. Every time she hugs me, she moves my body side to side and I usually end up having to take a pain killer because of it even though I tell her \"HEY THAT HURTS.\" It's probably because people can't really \"see\" the pain unless they are reminded of it. It also doesn't help that pain is subjective, so they may not take your pain as seriously as you do.I would definitely emphasize the fact that you have abdominal/gastrointestinal pain.
