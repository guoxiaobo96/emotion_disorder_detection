I know there are certain things you can do to make sure baby doesn't fall into too deep sleep. One of those is paci/binkies when you put them in their crib. A fan going to circulate air in the room, no blankets/pillows/stuffed animals/bumpers in the crib. I work as a health insurance agent, so I've seen my fair share of sad cases in families concerning their health. One I will never forget. I spoke with a woman who had 4 kids. I asked their ages. Young children, but their 7 week old, Blaze, had passed from SIDS. He had very bad colic. She said in the 7 weeks they had him on this earth, it's like he never stopped crying. Then one night, she lays him down to bed, and he falls asleep. Those 7 weeks of screaming, crying and never getting any sleep because of it really took a toll on the newborn. The next morning, the parents wake up. Wow! They think. Maybe he's past his colic. How lucky were we to get a full night sleep. Blaze had passed that night. He was so exhausted, he fell asleep and never woke up. That's the only time I've ever cried during business. ", "link_id": "t3_2cichw", "time": 1407119405}}
