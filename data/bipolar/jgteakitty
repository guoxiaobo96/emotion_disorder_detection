A while prior to hospitalization, I had stopped taking those medications because I was doing very well, and my lung function on PFT in June was 99% of expected.  What else do you need to know about the headache? It is constant, but usually gets a little better when I am still (though not since I've been here). When I move or walk (I do take care to stand up slowly), the pressure of the pulsing intensifies, and so does the dizziness. The dizziness feels like it is the inside of my head spinning. The pulsating feels like my entire head and a little down the back of my neck; it is not focused on any one point. The only other thing on my MRI, which apparently is not concerning to my doctor though I'd like to know about it, is 3 foci points of white matter hyperintensities in thr frontal lobe. She doesn't think that is connected to the headache. It is very disabling, so I've basically been able to do very little since 08/19.If this treatment is the WHO recommendation, then it sounds like I'm just stuck here, yeah?

My mind was going so fast I couldn't get the words out. After he left I spent the next few hours on the floor with my cats in front of a fan (SO glad I had the fan). Listened to the Cranberries, noticed several things in the lyrics that I hadn't noticed before, and it had great meaning. And played with the cats with a laser pointer (may have talked to them a bit). At 4 hours 45 minutes I got a really weird cramp in my abdomen. Then at 5 hours exactly, the trip was completely over. I was laying on the couch wondering what the hell happened and thinking it was weird how it ended so suddenly. I went upstairs and had a completely normal conversation with my boyfriend, then took a shower and went to bed. Best sleep I've had in a long time!Themes that kept recurring during this trip: fairness, things I should/should not do (but who decides that?), things being unimaginably big (the universe) and unbelievably small (the things that are smaller than an atom - sorry science isn't my strong suit). Also my relation to all of these things. Why people are the way they are -- upbringing, geographic location, time frame, experiences, and how it all fits together.I don't know if I'm \"permanently changed\" after this, but it definitely was a bit of a \"reset\".

{"dwy8nxz": {"text": "I was just diagnosed with fibro this week (after ruling out lupus, other autoimmune stuff, and arthritis). It's seriously been only two days but I can very much relate to what you're saying... it's like no one even cares. I'm not asking for pity or something, but it feels like I didn't even get a diagnosis. Like people were more understanding when I had a \"mystery illness\". I go back to work on Monday; I've been off for three weeks for a different illness, but during that time I got the diagnosis... I don't even know if I'll tell anyone, it seems like if I do they'll just write me off as a complainer or attention seeker. In reality I'd just like the tiniest bit of understanding when I'm having a hard time doing something physical.", "link_id": "t3_8adqi7", "time": 1523071205}}
