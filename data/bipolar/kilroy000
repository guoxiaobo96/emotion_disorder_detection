Ask their pdoc for some resources if you can (or ask them to ask their pdoc). Remember that everyone is different, so what happens for one person may not happen for another. During (hypo)mania there may be some impulsive, possibly harmful behaviour. Some things to watch for might be impulse spending, sudden enthusiasm in new things, random hook-ups, over-reactions to minor aggravations, ove eating, inability to sleep at night, and much more. Again, remember that everyone is different, so they likely won't exhibit all (or even any) of these.During depression, watch for things like ove eating, oversleeping, lack of interest in previously favored activities, shutting themself away, and more. Self harm can happen with either episode. Yet again, everyone is different. There really is no \"getting better,\" but the right medications can help, finding those right medications can be a difficult process though. It's also important that once they're in meds they follow the dosage. I know someone who, long story short, wound up in the mental hospital after they went off of their meds during a manic episode. Your support is very important, and will be very much appreciated, even if they don't show it at first.", "link_id": "t3_ezh3xp", "time": 1580947562}}

The thing that makes it narcolepsy, as opposed to something like chronic insomnia (before someone say that N comes with insomnia, ours is comorbid), is an irregular sleep cycle consisting of excess and out of place REM (rapid eye movement, dream sleep). While REM normally happens in stage 3 sleep, with N it can happen during stage 1, or even while still awake.

One thing I can say is do your research, look online for local therapist and try to find one with good reviews. Most therapists today are going to actually listen to what you say, and will try to treat the cause rather that throwing medications at the symptoms. As far as disability, it is definitely not easy to get onto disability with bipolar. From the research I've done, only about 10% of claims are approved first time, and then only about 13% of first appeals are approved. The second appeal has a much higher approval rate, but if it goes that far then the entire process can take almost two years. I have bipolar AND narcolepsy (a very difficult combination) and I'm currently on the first appeal. The initial claim was denied because they \"couldn't determine a date of disability\" and because they believed there were jobs that I could perform (I want to see the list so I can tell them exactly why I can't work each one). The thing about mental/behavioral disabilities (or ant invisible disability) is that, while it may be incredibly difficult for you to work mentally, you are likely perfectly capable physically. If there is even one job that they think you can perform then the claim will be denied. The problem is that they have no idea what it's like to live with an invisible disability, so they severely underestimate how difficult it can actually be.", "link_id": "t3_efajuw", "time": 1577242966}}

While the symptoms do sound like narcolepsy, there is a chance that it could be something else, a lot of things cause daytime sleepiness. I would also recommend seeing a different sleep doc, that previous one sounds like a bit of a quack. The new sleep doc wel probably be interestedLastly, what kind of idiot doctor wouldn't want to diagnose at 20? I can kind of understand withholding official diagnosis until 16, but 20?!? I was diagnosed when I was 14! It doesn't require total loss of muscle control to be considered cataplexy. One night of \"no issues\" doesn't mean anything, my last overnight study came back as \"normal,\" my doctor actually said that happens a lot.

{"ercipxn": {"text": "You necessarily need a big story planned out from the start. Start off with something simple (e.g. bandits/ monsters attacking a nearby village, or the age-old caravan escort), once you come up with an idea you can incorporate it into that quest. For the story itself, don't be afraid of tropes and cliches, they are very useful tools. You can also take inspiration from real-world historical events or fantasy series (e.g. LoTR or GoT)Some ideas: evil necromancer raising an army of zombies and/or trying to become a lich; a strange illness/curse has fallen over the land and the players need to find and eliminate the source; the players are investigating the corrupt leader(s) of a city, this eventually leads to a dark cult that spreads across the entire kingdom. For the campaign I'm running, instead of having one big long story quest, I broke it up into several smaller arcs that are all connected to the main story, kind of like a TV show. This can have several advantages: rather than being super linear, you can have a couple arcs planned out and let your posters choose where to go, this will keep them more interested (and less likely to side-track the campaign); you don't have to have this big quest line planned out only to have the players completely screw with your plans by doing something you didn't expect (instead you have small quest lines that your players can completely and totally screw with); it can give you more time to plan things out. As your campaign progresses, the quests should become more related to the main story.Just don't worry too much, so long as you and your posts are having fun, the story will practically write itself.", "link_id": "t3_c1alt9", "time": 1560713241}}

Due to the construction of the bow (shape and material) shortbows would often have a higher draw weight compared to a longbow or recurve (80-100 vs. 70-80 respectively), this combined with lighter weight arrows gave the shortbow a greater arrow flight speed (hence the power at shorter ranges). So while your statement is not untrue, the velocity added by firing from horseback was inconsequential.Bonus fun fact: The Mongolian shortbow was quite famous for its power. They were composite wood and animal horn/bone, making them some of the most durable bows of the time. The construction process curved ther limbs to such a degree that it gave bow a rounded heart shape when not strung. The draw weight was commonly around 150 lbs, but could be add low as 100 lbs or add high as 200 lbs. The string would be made from house hide, because the more commonly used sinew would break under that kind of pressure. These bows could be powerful enough to penetrate armour, sometimes going straight through lighter armored targets and into the person behind them. tl;dr: I know WAY too much about archery.", "link_id": "t3_c1bdl4", "time": 1560703875}}

{"eq1i0b6": {"text": "Yeah, that's a very common misconception propagated by media and Hollywood. Narcolepsy actually has to do with an irregular sleep cycle, we have excessive REM (dreaming).In the 4 stage sleep model, REM should only happen during stage 3 and should only last 15-30 minutes at a time. Normally sleep goes stage 1, 10-20 min; stage 2, 15-30 min; stage 3 (REM), 15-30 min; stage 4 30-45 min. During the night the normal cycle goes between stages 3 and 4 (occasionally going into 2) for most of the night, rising to stage 2 then 1 before waking up.With narcolepsy, we will go into REM during stage 1 or 2, and randomly throughout the night. As you might imagine, this can interrupt or prevent stage 4, so we don't get the restful sleep that our minds and bodies need. Because of this, we will wake up sleep deprived.Narcolepsy has a huge effect on dreams, often being quite vivid. Sleep paralysis, when the mind is awake but the body is asleep, is quite common as well.Narcolepsy 1 often comes with cataplexy, a sudden partial or total loss of muscle tone, often caused by sudden outbursts of emotion (e.g. laughter or anger). Narcolepsy 2 usually does not have cataplexy, but the sleepiness is often more intense. Regardless of type, narcolepsy can be managed using sleep aids/muscle relaxers (e.g. xyrem or baclofen) and/or stimulants (e.g. modafinil/Provigil or Adderall), along with a properly maintained sleep schedule.I was diagnosed with type 2 when I was 14 (about 12 years ago). At first it wasn't all that bad, but it got worse with time (and the stress of adult life). I take madafinil, splitting the dose so I take it in the morning and at noon. I will go into REM within 15 min of falling asleep, it's really weird when I start dreaming before I fall asleep. I have a healthy social life, and was going to college until recently (I dropped out due to multiple mental breakdowns, not narcolepsy). I do have a hard time working, but that's due to a combination of multiple things all compounding on top of each other.It is very possible to live a (mostly) normal life, with a job, friends, and family.

There aren't a whole lot of western themed enemies, so you're going to need to modify and re-skin some.

As u/kurogane42 said, settlers would most likely have more technology, while natives would have more magic. In my campaign, the natives magic is more spiritual or inherent in nature, with more witches, sorcerers, and oracles; the settlers are more classically trained, with more wizards and clerics. tl;dr for the next paragraph:  Allow gunslingers and adv. firearms, but you may want to modify the rules a bit to make them less BS.Gunslingers and advance firearms are a must. Use the (possible modified) \"Guns Everywhere\" rules for availability of firearms. Just remember that RAW advance firearms are complete bull, so you may want to apply some house-rules (making sure to inform you players); e.g. adv. firearms resolve attacks against touch AC when within their first five range increments, that is absurd; I modified it  so that the armor penetration is within point blank range, because even with the more aerodynamic shape and rotation from the rifling, it would take the power of a firework for any firearm of that era to penetrate any sort of armor at 400 ft. (with a rifle, or 100 ft. for a revolver), and I don't want to hear anything about magic powder. (Don't you love run-on sentences?)  Even at point blank, the penetration is really freaking powerful.

There have been times when I have had to take a reduced dose (due to an incompetent medical assistant), and there is a definite difference in motivation and wakefulness. Also, try not to play with dosage too much, especially not with higher doses, as u/KPorath says in his comment, taking too much can lessen the effects of lower doses, along with intensifying side-effects. If you're on a variable dose (e.g. 100-200 per day), start the day with a lower dose and take more if you feel you need it, it's kind of like cooking: you can always add more salt if there isn't enough, but you can't exactly take it away when you add too much.I'm taking a considerably higher dose, at 400/day, but that's because I have narcolepsy, so my body uses all of it, that's why my side-effects (other than dry-mouth) aren't as bad. The worst side-effect happens when I've been off of it for an extended period (which is never by choice) and suddenly go back onto it, as opposed to tapering, I have experienced trouble focusing my eyes when I first take it in the morning, usually passing after about 15 min, however is has lasted almost an hour before.

Don't go directly into a romantic relationship, start as friends. Get to know them as friends, then as you get more comfortable, you can tell them about your bipolar and see their reaction. Being friends first can also help avoid a bad breakup, if you were friends before, why can't you be friends after? I've only ever been in one relationship, and it was hard when we broke up, but she's still my best friend, even with being 600 miles apart.

It is possible for a CE character to have friends, nobody will like you if you don't like anybody. Remember that \"chaotic\" doesn't mean \"anti-law,\" it means that you will act in self interest despite the law. If you go around purposely breaking the law, you will probably be killed before the end of the first session.

I was playing a LE Punisher-type character (succumbed to evil to eliminate evil). Suffice to say, my character did not like his character.

I've even picked up other RPGs including Call of Cthulu, Vampire the Masquerade, and Rifts, to name a few. When it comes to the backstory, I usually come up with basic details first (occupation, family, maybe a few childhood events). Then I determine how they got to where they are. If we start at low level (1-4) I consider why I started adventuring (e.g. wanderlust, left homeless by bandit raid, money, etc.). If we start at mid level (5-10) I consider what I did before or current adventure (e.g. mercenary company, caravan guard, freelancer, etc.) If we start at high level (10+) I consider what types of adventures I've been on before (e.g. solving a string of murders that leads to a blood cult, caravan guard job that ends with eradicating bandits from an area, etc.). Sometimes I'll come up with details beforehand, other times I let the details flush themselves out as we play. I usually don't worry about where I'm from, I'll often have a basic description (e.g. farmland, forest, mountain city, etc.).I hope D&amp;D (and maybe some other RPGs) brings you many years of enjoyment, and many great friends.

The psychiatrist said I was \"too young,\"  so he prescribed Dexedrine when I was 5 and switched me to Adderall when I was 7.  The Adderall made me into a zombie while I was on it, and unpredictably emotional when it wore off.  I would sometimes get angry to the point of violence, and at other times all I could do was sit underneath the dining table and cry.  We stopped seeing that quack after he yelled at my parents for taking me to a sleep specialist because I couldn't stay awake in class (I was diagnosed with RLS at 12 and narcolepsy at 14).  I went off of Adderall around the same time (due to a heart condition).  I started seeing a good psychiatrist shortly after and was officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed Lamictal.&amp;#x200B;It wasn't until I was about 21 that I learned to recognize when I'm in an episode.  The pharmacy screwed up with some of my meds (not lamictal, fortunately) and I was without them for almost two weeks.  When my meds finally got filled I went manic from the sudden change in body chemistry.  After about a month and a half of mania, I fell into a bad depression.

{"e9e3ayu": {"text": "For in-game mechanical differences, see the other comments.  I pride myself as a fairly knowledgeable toxophilite (someone who is knowledgeable in and/or practices archery), so I can give you some of the real-world differences.Longbows are one of the oldest designs.  They unstrung bow has long, straight limbs (hence the name), and was historically at least as tall as the archer wielding it (5-6 ft.); the string would usually be about a foot shorter.  They usually had a 50-75 lb. draw weight at a 48-56 in. draw, depending on the size and weight of the limbs.  The low tension on the longer limbs gives the arrow a slower flight speed, allowing for greater accuracy at longer ranges, this made them most effective when used from the back lines or from the tops of walls.The recurve bow is kind of a variation of the longbow.  Rather than being straight, the unstrung limbs curve at both ends, usually about 60-90\u00b0, and the bow is strung against the curves; these *recurves* would give you the same amount of power out of shorter limbs, making the bow more compact and easier to use in tighter spaces (e.g. hidden hunting blinds or sniper's nest).As the name implies, short bows are much shorter than long bows, often about 1/2-3/4 the size.  Even with lower draw weight (40-60 lbs. at 40-50 in., see below for an exception), the higher tension on the limbs means the flight speed of the arrow is considerably faster than that of a longbow, giving them high power at short range, but poor accuracy at longer ranges.  Their compact size and short-range power made them ideal for use from horseback.A composite bow is made from multiple materials, traditionally multiple different types of wood in the early medieval period or wood and steel in the late medieval and renaissance periods.  This made the limbs considerably stronger, allowing for greater draw weight (75-100 lbs. for a longbow or recurve and 60-80 lbs. for a short bow).One exception to the \"short bows have lower draw weight\" is the Mongolian short bow most famously used by the armies of Genghis Khan (and my personal favorite).  These bows were composite wood and animal horn.  If straightened, the limbs would be unusually long for a short bow (around 4-5 ft.) but they had a recurve of over 180\u00ba, almost looking like the letter \"D\" when unstrung.  Because of the intense recurve, these bows would have a draw weight somewhere around 100-200 lbs., allowing them to effectively punch through armor (and often the person inside said armor).There's your history lesson on bows.  Who knows, maybe it will help someone understand the real-world reasons for the in-game mechanics.", "link_id": "t3_9vmvgr", "time": 1541807051}}
