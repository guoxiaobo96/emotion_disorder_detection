I didn\u2019t want to be her. I didn\u2019t want to be a \u201cbipolar person.\u201d It got to a point where I jumped from mania to depression all the time. I made very poor decisions and ended up wanting to take my life. I got hospitalized 3 years ago and have been on medication and in therapy ever since. I say all this because had someone told me they were dating someone with BD early on I would have begged them to leave. Unfortunately there is still a huge stigma and a lot of unknown about this disease. Your dad wants what\u2019s best and knows this won\u2019t be an easy road for you. I\u2019m in a relationship and though medicated have been jumping episodes this month. However what they are opposed to not being on meds is dramatically more manageable. This is no cure there is no perfect medicine. It will be trying but if the person is right for you they may be the best thing that ever happened to you. We love deeper than most. It\u2019s all about what your willing to fight for. I would read and get more ideas. Please don\u2019t look at all the bad and assume the worst. Everyone is different.
