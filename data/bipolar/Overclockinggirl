My mother was disabled and I know it would\u2019ve broken her heart if she couldn\u2019t get to me to help me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 2 years ago and it is a tough battle but I am doing ok now. I will say that hospitalizations were 100% necessary about 4-5 times in my life. I tried committing suicide twice and failed, obviously. Then voluntarily committed myself after that because I realized I couldn\u2019t go on living that way. Unfortunately, even after being hospitalized twice during that severe, 2 year long depressive episode, it didn\u2019t get me to a euthymic mental state. Now that I am on the correct medication (mood stabilizer and LOW dose of an SSRI), I feel better than ever. I can say first hand that alcohol does not mix with bipolar disorder. I am struggling with that reality now but I\u2019m working on it. I would say your best bet would be to call 911 or perhaps, if she is more stable today, the non-emergency number for the location she lives. I\u2019m sure you can google it and find their number. Explain the situation and see if they can help. You could also try contacting NAMI (National Alliance of Mental Illness). Also, don\u2019t beat yourself up and try to take care of yourself. It can be very draining trying to help someone with mental illness. I have lost many wonderful friends and even immediate family members because they weren\u2019t able to balance their own lives and try to support me and help me. Deep down, I am a very happy, loving, calm, friendly person. However, when I am either manic or depressed, I\u2019m a totally different person.

{"f7cxjru": {"text": "Wow. The part where you said waking up at 90 years old and realizing you never actually lived your life or did anything you wanted to do... that describes me exactly. My full time job is actually similar to your idea of torture. I work a 9-5 in a boring office and I do repetitive work over and over. When I had a severe, full blown manic episode about 2 years ago, I thought for sure I was going to be famous and I could leave my job. I went to California with a friend and she left me there (I also had psychosis and ran out of money so although it sucked, I sort of don\u2019t blame her in a way). I think I definitely get really excited about things. I just started doing yoga with a friend, making other new friends, I want to write a book, maybe do acting classes and dance classes. My best friend of several years recently dropped me like a bad habit and I\u2019m sort of reinventing myself if you will. I\u2019m sad, but I\u2019m not letting it ruin my life. I\u2019ve finally accepted that I\u2019m not everyone\u2019s cup of tea.I actually get about a month of paid vacation time and I feel like that\u2019s a decent amount. I have terrible self discipline so I don\u2019t think I could be self employed unless I tried really really hard at it. I just feel like I have so many talents buried inside my lil soul and I\u2019m going to explode if I don\u2019t show the world. Even if I turn out like Arthur Fleck from joker, and I\u2019m just a big \u201cmentally ill joke\u201d, I\u2019ll be proud of myself for at least trying (I won\u2019t kill anyone either). I bet your grandkids will tell all their friends how bada** their granny is! You sound like someone I would get along with and you\u2019re so kind for posting this long novel out for a stranger!I absolutely try to distract myself from negative feelings (mostly drinking alcohol or drawing and painting). I\u2019m definitely a glass half full type of person (at least when I\u2019m not in the depths of a psychotic, suicidal depressive episode. Those are fun). I think I communicate through \u201cpersonal storytelling\u201d which is what I feel like I\u2019m doing right now sort of, oops.I would say my fashion is pretty eclectic and I\u2019m totally jealous you have a rainbow cat shirt from Japan! Sounds awesome. When I was manic, my fianc\u00e9 said I would wear like 4-5 patterns that absolutely did not match and I dressed like a 4 year old girl dressed herself. At the time, I felt so hot and confident and I think even if I looked goofy, I owned it. *shrugs*Hmmm, now you have my attention. I think part of me does want to be unique but I also already feel very unique. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m missing anything, I just want to put my ideas out there and see what happens (Art, writing a book, try acting and dancing). I only really feel envious of people who have cool names (I hate my name so much and I want to change it) and are successful and financially secure. Other than that, I like who I am inside. Dammit! I think I\u2019m very independent but I\u2019m also sort of a little codependent in my relationship. I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s tough. However, I hardly think about others before I act. That sounds bad but I sort of look after myself and do my thing, and if people are offended or something doesn\u2019t work out, then that\u2019s the way it is in my mind. I don\u2019t try to intentionally hurt anyone but if I make someone uncomfortable (that\u2019s what my ex best friend said about me and why she kicked me out of her wedding), then I just won\u2019t spend time with you anymore. I just speak my mind and do my thing. I\u2019m only ever just being honest and authentic.I can relate to that. I feel like I\u2019m a very nice person deep down and I love making people laugh and smile. But it\u2019s sort of on my own terms. This helped a lot!

Months later, we start dating and he tells me when I walked into that room, he tried to use his \u201csuperpowers\u201d to make me sit by him.

Then, abruptly and without warning, I was essentially ghosted by my biological family after I told one biological cousin about my mental illness diagnosis. I had gotten close to him and I felt comfortable with sharing. He seemed very understanding and supportive at first so it broke my heart when he stopped talking to me. I am OK now, but it just hurts so bad and to read your post and remember how excited I was just startled me. I recently found out my biological father murdered his girlfriend and then committed suicide, so I guess the family may assume there\u2019s some sort of violent mental illness gene and decided they didn\u2019t want to take a chance on me killing anyone?

{"f6r0zsu": {"text": "I don\u2019t know if you will read this but if you do, maybe show your daughter. I was born to two alcoholics and I was not planned. I was in foster care for 6 years while my biological mother and foster mother fought over me. Due to the trauma of being in foster care and not having a stable home life for the first 6 years, I repressed 90% of my childhood memories that involved any visitations with my biological mother. I have a relationship with my biological mother now, as an adult, 27 year old woman. It was difficult at first because of how I felt towards her as a child. She sort of made me uncomfortable but now I realize it\u2019s probably because she was always intoxicated. Although I technically in my mind consider my \u201cmom\u201d to be the woman that adopted me, I am forever grateful that my biological mother was strong enough to put me up for adoption. My biological mother was young and had a part time job, but didn\u2019t make nearly enough money to support me and she was living with her parents (my biological maternal grandparents). My biological father wasn\u2019t capable of taking care of me and he actually had a granddaughter (my biological niece) on the way at the same time. My biological parents were 17 years apart.Adoption does not mean there\u2019s no love or you\u2019re giving the love away. I know now that my biological mother loves me unconditionally. She fought for me and ultimately realized the best thing to do would be to give me to a loving family that could afford to raise me properly, even though it felt like torture to lose her baby.Like I said, it wasn\u2019t the easiest life but I was spoiled and loved. As an adopted person, I truly feel blessed. It\u2019s almost like having two families. My adoptive mother has since passed away (from cancer) and I think of her every single and miss her so much, it hurts. Sometimes I cry and talk to her in my head. I often listen to her old voicemail messages she would leave me while she was waiting for me to visit her at her hospice/assisted living center. She was so strong, intelligent and nurturing. She treated me like one of her own and loved me until her last breath (I was with her while was dying).Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions or if your daughter does.

{"f5om96h": {"text": "After going through an almost 2 year episode of suicidal major depression, I stopped seeing my psychiatrist. I was my mother\u2019s care giver and after she died, my immediate family basically disowned me. The anti-depressant medications weren\u2019t helping and two hospitalizations in the psych ward didn\u2019t help. I had tried committing suicide twice and it didn\u2019t work. I had been in a terrible car accident and aside from the major depression, I was having debilitating driving anxiety. I just wanted to be able to get in my car and go to work, come home, and go to bed without having a severe panic attack.So I go see this highly recommended primary care doctor who I know prescribed behavioral health medication. Now, I told this doc I had a predisposition to bipolar disorder, but I had never had a manic episode, only depression. I lied and told him I was feeling ok except for having severe anxiety (I had completely given up on trying to fix the depression because even my therapist told me she didn\u2019t know what to say anymore after my 20th appointment of telling her the same exact things). This primary care doctor is amazing. He is very compassionate and seems to truly care. He prescribes me a medication for my driving anxiety as an atypical anti-anxiety medication that is non-habit forming and he has seen lots of success in his other patients. I pick up the Rx and start taking it 2x daily as needed. Within a week and a half, my driving anxiety disappears. After about another week, I woke up one morning feeling *slightly less depressed* and I started sobbing from happiness! It felt like a literal miracle. I started reaching out to old friends I had blown off for so long (I hardly did anything with friends unless they physically came and peeled me out of bed). As the days go by, I start feeling better and better! I contact my doctor office and let them know it\u2019s helping tremendously with my anxiety and ask if I could take it 3x a day. The primary care doc tell the nurse to tell me, \u201cabsolutely! It\u2019s non-habit forming and we\u2019re so happy it\u2019s helping you!\u201d It was great. I was feeling like myself again.Then, an old friend from college invites me on a trip across the country. We were very close in college and I really enjoyed her company and had missed her. She had a better job than me and we were discussing going on a short trip together. I explained I couldn\u2019t afford it unfortunately but I would love to go another time. She insists she\u2019ll pay for it if I pay her back within a year or so. We plan the trip for the next month. I am so excited because I hadn\u2019t been on a vacation in years! The days are going by and I\u2019m feeling better and better and better and hmmm some people are commenting that I\u2019m starting to *act strangely* but I brush it off. I felt great. I figured it was just strange to see me happy after being depressed for so long. Then, a friend texts me after hanging out with her of her other friends and she says, \u201cCourtney and Nikki said it was pretty obvious you were on cocaine last night while we were out to eat\u201d and I was like \u201cwhat the fuck? I don\u2019t do cocaine.\u201d And my friend says, \u201cwell they said you were talking a million miles a minute and acting really weird in their opinion\u201d I asked her what she thought and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, you just seemed in a good mood\u201d so that was weird but I brushed it off because I wasn\u2019t doing cocaine and I felt great.Friend and I go on our vacation. Everything is great, we\u2019re having so much fun. We go to the beach, shopping, get food, get our picture drawn by some artist man. I was having the time of my life. Then we go somewhere and my card gets declined. I had blown all my money. I had saved money specifically for the trip and I didn\u2019t even realize I was just blowing it left and right on random stuff. My friend is furious and tells me to have someone wire me money because she paid for the trip so I need to pay for my food and drinks. Everything goes from bad to worse within 24 hours. Friend and I get into screaming fight outside of a bar and she says she\u2019s leaving me there (halfway across the country). I tell her I don\u2019t care and probably called her names but I had half blacked out. I just remember her standing over me and saying, \u201cyou\u2019re poor, annoying, ugly and nobody likes you!\u201dThis is getting way too long so I\u2019m trying to wrap it up. I get into an argument with one of the air bnb owners and it almost turns physical (she raises her hand at me). I start sobbing and asked someone to call the cops and they say they absolutely will not call the cops and I have to leave. I tell them I have no where to go and no money. They tell me they don\u2019t care and chase me around their stupid treehouse mansion, telling me to get out. So I gather everything I can and leave. So, then I spent the next couple days bumming around with homeless people, sleeping on the beach and in public bathrooms. I lost my phone charger at some point. I thought I had it with me so I either left it at the air bnb or dropped it somewhere. Nobody could get in touch with me. I come to find out later that the friend I came with had ended up telling my other friends and significant other that I belong in a mental hospital forever, I\u2019m doing drugs and she doesn\u2019t care where I am or what happens to me.I\u2019m not sure how long I was technically a missing person for but I want to say around 20 hours. My friends, family and significant other thought I was dead. Somehow I convinced the airline company to get me on a flight home without paying since I was stranded and I said it was a emergency and I missed my flight.Turns out I had a major manic episode with psychotic features and I was eventually hospitalized after I got arrested once when I got home. According to my new psychiatrist, it was all *just a coincidence* that I was taking the anti-anxiety med when the mania started, but I don\u2019t believe that. I think the medication absolutely triggered the mania and psychosis.*TL;DR:* Swung from suicidally depressed to severely manic and psychotic within a month and found myself stranded across the country with no phone charger, no money and no luggage. I slept on beaches and in public restrooms with homeless people. Family and friends thought I was dead for approximately 20 hours.", "link_id": "t3_doc3xb", "time": 1572322413}}

Fast forward to now and I still have symptoms. He decides he thinks it is Odontogenic sinusitis and refers me to my dentist because he thinks a root canal would fix it. I just saw my dentist last week and he exams me, looks at scans and reads report from ENT. The dentist says he absolutely doesn\u2019t feel comfortable giving me a root canal based off my symptoms because I have no tooth pain/discomfort.

{"f4a0rkf": {"text": "Yeah. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit I had one instance of pretty severe homicidal thoughts while in a manic/psychotic episode after doing cocaine. The thoughts alone were terrifying enough that I was screaming bloody murder outside at 12am, was completely inconsolable and begging my friends and partner to take me to the psych ward. They didn\u2019t because they knew I would be restrained and I was raped years ago so it could\u2019ve been a horrible situation. Someone called the police. I was able to snap out of it when the police came because I had a flashback of being in jail and almost restrained while in a psych ward and I didn\u2019t want to go back to jail or be in a restraint chair. After the police left, I spent the next 2 hours wondering around the city in the rain crying. Anyways, I think the movie just made me feel almost embarrassed and sad. Although I have had strange and awful thoughts, I\u2019ve never acted on them and I am on medication and stable now. And not doing cocaine.

I kept guessing the powerball number so I thought it was only a matter of time before we won. Then, numbers stopped jumping out as the right lottery numbers but I they started being colors. So, 1 was blue, 2 was yellow, 3 was green and 4 was red so 34 was Christmas. I started following people while driving around based on their license plates. One day I followed some guy somewhere and ended up in front of this huge mansion in a nice area near me. I took a picture of it because I knew I was going to win the lottery so I decided I would buy it or one similar to it once I got my money. I also gave a random old lady who was a complete stranger a ride to her church once. We became friends.
