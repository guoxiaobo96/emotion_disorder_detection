In the month that I was there I saw about 5 people quit because of the treatment of the staff. The floor staff were barely spoken to like human beings, management had some weird air of self importance and really didn\u2019t give a shit about you even though their company supposedly puts staff first. I got really sick one weekend and called in on the Saturday, to which I had to somehow find my own cover for the shift and get a doctors note. I came in the next day still super sick and had to keep running to the bathroom to throw up but they wouldn\u2019t let me leave. It was humiliating. GSR\u2019s also weren\u2019t allowed to talk to each other on the floor and were quickly broken up if caught, but management would constantly walk around and gossip about all the staff. One girl who was there for two weeks ended up walking out, she was barely trained properly yet penalized severely if she didn\u2019t know how to do something the right way. I heard management talk shit about her CONSTANTLY, no idea why they picked on her specifically but i wouldn\u2019t hesitate to call it bullying. I\u2019ve heard tons of bad things from other ex employees too.", "link_id": "t3_cnsh4d", "time": 1569358586}}
