Is it possible that, by having access to millions of different perspectives and their innermost thoughts, people who have that propensity to (social) anxiety will begin to nervously wonder and project the thoughts and feelings of strangers in real life? When online we can view people\u2019s vulnerabilities and submit our own, without the vulnerability of being known or judged, reality can become a vastly scarier place. I will walk down the street, completely open to the vulnerability of being known and judged, while having no access to the perceptions of others and no (socially acceptable) way of conveying our true selves to these people. The people passing by me have all but no context or understanding of who I am, yet my physical presence opens me up to their consideration. So my mind goes crazy wondering how their mind is working, how it\u2019s observing me, *if* it\u2019s even observing me. I don\u2019t know if this made any sense.

{"flthc7s": {"text": "That took me down a bit of a rabbit hole. I\u2019ve never once considered using heroin, but that progression is just... gosh. And the posts from people who have been through it, or the people who know those people... it depressed the hell out of me. The way they describe how in life, you are increasing your threshold to happiness. But once you\u2019ve had that high, nothing ever comes close to it again. There were other addicts who commented on a post of his, where they said that even when they\u2019ve been \u2018x\u2019 amount of years clean, they never stop wanting to do it again. They never feel happy again. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder, what do they stay with it for? I\u2019m glad they\u2019re clean, but what keeps them going in life if they can no longer find happiness?I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a little over two years ago. God knows when it started; but at the very least, the seed has always been there, growing and waiting. I dropped out of college, full scholarship, in the middle of my spring sophomore semester. I\u2019d go days without leaving my room, barely leaving my bed. Sometimes when I couldn\u2019t quite pacify myself, I\u2019d lay in bed crying; I\u2019d eat until it was painful just to lay down again; or I\u2019d start to slip into something that seemed like low level paranoia or insanity, where I could recognize that I was in my room but my mind was being assaulted with thoughts and stimuli to where I started to forget physical reality. I can barely relate the feeling, but I suppose it\u2019s like when you close your eyes really hard to the point where you start seeing shapes and light. It\u2019s like I had isolated myself in my mind for so long that *that\u2019s* where reality decided to go. Anyway, reading those stories, and those feelings, it makes me wonder if I\u2019ll feel happiness again. From what I\u2019ve gathered, it seems like the \u201cbliss\u201d of heroin numbs you to the \u201cjoy\u201d of life. It\u2019s almost as if heroin use reveals how truly joyless life is. And sometimes, that\u2019s how my depression feels. Because as shitty as it makes you feel, there\u2019s something about engaging that dark place that feels comforting and freeing. As if you are *living true* again. And you recall the times when you began \u201cfeeling ok\u201d again, and you wonder how you could\u2019ve been so foolish, how you could\u2019ve ever kidded yourself into that mindset. And while I am not in any way trying to equate my struggles with those battling addiction, I think that my chronic mental state has numbed me to life as well. I don\u2019t know why I wrote all of this jumbled shit. I\u2019m sure it will go unnoticed, and I\u2019ll feel even more stupid for sharing it than I do right now. But these stories really hit me, and I felt compelled in this moment.I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever feel motivated to improve my life. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever feel like I deserve life, or life deserves living.

I had always been pretty shy or insecure around guys, so getting attention from someone felt really good and I ended up going out with him. He cheated on me a month after we started hanging out, and I foolishly went back to him a few days later. He told me he loved me and would say how beautiful I was, but there were times when he said I was pretty, but kind of plain. Or he would compliment my body but then when we were hanging out with one of his friends, he said that he (a bit nsfw here) would massage my boobs to see if they would get bigger, and once when I asked him about my chest, he said he hadn\u2019t had a gf with breasts that small since junior high. I didn\u2019t fully realize how disconnected and unfulfilling our relationship was until it was finally over - he texted me and said he wasn\u2019t attracted to my body and wanted to be with other girls.

Ive been trying unsuccessfully to study in one of the engineering buildings at my college at 2:30 in the morning and I went on Reddit to further distract myself. I played this song and started bopping my head along to the music. Eventually, I was so moved that I got out of my seat, went into one of the deserted hallways, and just started dancing.
