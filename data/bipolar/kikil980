{"f00x2av": {"text": "So this situation actually happened recently at a KU college bar notorious for letting anyone in with some sort of ID near me. A 20 year old student got in with a fake ID and ended up bringing home a 17 year old girl and having sexual contact. She ended up backing out or something and they went back to the bar. She went to the hospital and presented no evidence of being raped (he had confessed to touching her consensually, but not having sex and she claimed that he did have sex with her). He ended up getting charged with rape which is a whole other ordeal because he\u2019s black and there was no evidence. But he was charged because he was let in underage, so he should\u2019ve assumed that she could be underage along with her anecdotal evidence of being too intoxicated to consent. 17 is the age of consent, so it wasn\u2019t considered statuary, but I assume that her being underage played into the verdict. There\u2019s a bit of an issue that I see in this way of thinking because it\u2019s a college bar, so personally in that situation I\u2019d assume that even those that are underage would be college students and 18+ because of that. I don\u2019t want to blame the girl because nobody actually does know what happened, but you are supposed to be proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt and that clearly isn\u2019t accurate. I\u2019d say to make sure to go to a bar that you know doesn\u2019t put up with fakes and/or is more upscale and less likely to let things slide if you plan on using this to judge. A good idea would be to not hook up on the first meeting if there\u2019s any doubt and to find/ask for social media to find evidence that they\u2019re out of high school.

I only looked up the number in the hopes that it could tell me something helpful or reassuring for the moment whether it\u2019s an accurate sign or not is beyond me, but at least it\u2019s helped me realize that I have energy needing to be released in myself or the spirit depending on the cause.

The floors creek, so if somebody was walking around I would\u2019ve heard it and that\u2019s why I assumed it wasn\u2019t a person. I talked to my roommate and confirmed that it wasn\u2019t him, but I would\u2019ve heard him open his door or walk in his room if he was up anyway. I was able to gauge how far the door was opened because I didn\u2019t get up and move it until this morning, so I got a good look at it in the light. I did lay there for a minute rethinking what had just happened and listening/watching in the crack before instantly getting on my phone to distract myself. I really don\u2019t look for paranormal signs ever and I\u2019m just interested by spooky things (hence why I thought playing ouija would be fun in the first place) and other spiritually based things, but really only astrology and a bit of crystals.

What helps balance it out is if you can get an appearance of slightly wider hips.

My favorite youtuber for workout on this is Vicky Justiz. She has tons of helpful workout videos that help achieve a more hourglass figure which will look really natural with your broad shoulders. This is her best video on [wider hips](https://youtu.be/YcEwrvNsfu4). Another helpful thing would be getting a smaller waist to make your hips look wider and also just to have a more feminine shape. She has a [video](https://youtu.be/V0-Vro-26Go)  on that too that\u2019s actually amazing!

{"ek21122": {"text": "When it comes to eyebrows start natural at first! There\u2019s tons of resources to find the brow shape the fits best with your face, but I\u2019ll get you a quick little sum up: the inner start of your brows should start lined up with the inner corner of your eye (approximately), your arch should line up with a diagonal line from the outer corner of your nose going through your pupil, and they should end at a diagonal line going from the outer corner of your nose to the outer corner of your eye. It helps to hold up a pen or anything straight to visualize the lines. [Here](https://www.fashionbelief.com/how-to-highlight-and-shape-your-eyebrows.html) is an article that has a picture showing what I\u2019m talking about. If you pluck them yourself, go very light with it at first to feel it out and then if you want more definition do more. I would suggest getting them threaded by a professional if you\u2019re comfortable. Just make sure to explain to them that you want more of a feminine shape because some guys get them threaded too! Another thing that really helps to have a more feminine looking face is plump lips and rosy cheeks. What I\u2019ve noticed is that biological men with plumper lips often look more feminine. There\u2019s tons of great plumping lip glosses and if you don\u2019t like lip gloss, you can leave it on for about 20 minutes and then wipe it off to get the same result. My personal favorite is the Too Faced Lip Injection Extreme. It\u2019s around $25, so if that\u2019s out of your budget there\u2019s others that are good too, but this one gave me the best results and does last for a while if you\u2019re only using once a day. My only advice for this one is to make sure not to go outside of you lips at all. The first time I used it I got a little bit outside of my lips and it made around my mouth a little bit red. If you focus on applying more towards the center of your lips and then go lighter towards the outer parts you should be fine. Make sure when wiping off the lip gloss that you also don\u2019t wipe it to the outside of your mouth. For blush a natural peachy pink would look great on you. A tiny bit goes a long way, so don\u2019t go crazy with it. I also like brushing just a tiny bit of whatever is left on my brush after cheeks on my nose, personal preference so just play with it and see what makes you feel the best. With everything else makeup related - youtube tutorials are the best learning tools out there. I would suggest James Charles because he does a great job explaining everything and it could be helpful to see how he much transforms his masculine face with makeup. He rarely does natural looks, but he has plenty of videos just explaining how to do the shape of eyeshadow and all of that and you can opt for more natural colors if you want. You look great.

Make sure to say that you have no issue with him finding other girls attractive as long as it\u2019s not cheating because it\u2019s very normal to notice attractive people while still in a relationship. I think the best thing you can do is practice cognitive therapy with these thoughts. When an insecure or jealous thought comes up you need to literally \u201ctalk back\u201d to the thought in your head. For example when if you were to think \u201cHe thinks that girl is prettier than me and is going to leave me for her\u201d talk back to that thought with \u201cNo he isn\u2019t he has chosen to be with me.

It\u2019s just like in high school (or later) when you went on your first date with a boy you were probably nervous and felt awkward; it just felt better because you knew that you\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to be dating boys.

Came out to my closest friends 2. Came out to my mom 3. Finally starting pursuing girls 4. Kissed a girl that I\u2019m actually attracted to for the first time 5.

I\u2019m bisexual, but I also kind of felt like I missed out so much not ever experiencing anything in high school. In reality though, we are still so young and have so much time to get all of the life experiences. I know it feels kind of late now to accept your sexuality at 18 because there\u2019s kids 13 and younger coming out, but just 10 years ago we would have been viewed as somewhat young for coming out and accepting a different sexuality. This age really isn\u2019t late at all. Take your time coming out and learning more about yourself. If your friends and family are likely to be accepting, you probably will end up feeling so much relief more than anything when you do come out. Personally, I was also scared to come out even though I knew that my family and close friends would be accepting. When I did it, I found out that my mom and friend are both also bisexual! Also my other friends reacted even better than I expected. They asked questions that showed that they cared to understand and told me to give them all the details whenever I meet a girl. If you have anyone close to you like a friend, coworker, teacher, or even a trustworthy acquaintance that you are positive will support you, it may help to come out to them first, once you feel ready. They can give you that reassurance and be somebody to possibly defend you, help you, validate you, and encourage you while going through this.
