When I was manic, I was able to work like a machine and retain information well. When I was depressed, I blamed my inability to focus on the depression, rather than the ADHD. When I finally treated the manic episodes and depressive episodes, (1) a lot of the studying tactics that I'd adopted didn't work for me anymore, and (2) the ADHD was in full power mode.

This means that you've probably developed coping mechanisms to function and get things done - working around the depression and using the hypomania to your advantage. The medications will even out your moods. With the right cocktail of medications, you won't experience depressions anymore. That's good. But you'll also lose the hypomania, which is something that a lot of people with bipolar have come to depend on. Many people on this sub talk about missing that aspect of their unmedicated selves because it provided a spark of creativity, a drive, and an inhuman amount of motivation.

Anxiety has a way of crushing you. But I hope you find a way to deal with the anxiety and make the best choice for you and your family, whatever that may be. You're going to find a new equilibrium. I know that it's taking a lot of time, and that can be unsettling and difficult. But I hope that you continue to give yourself the best possible chances of getting there by being kind and gentle to yourself. And giving yourself credit for doing awesome things, despite all these crazy changes. You're doing great. Don't give up hope!", "link_id": "t3_eemsns", "time": 1577228677}}

It may take you longer and you may have to work harder for a \"normal\" life with a degree and career. But you can do it, it's possible. Don't give up so easily. From your post, you sound like you're still young. Well, now that I'm 30, I guess a lot of people just seem very young. Seeing my friends have children, have steady careers, and buy their first homes is really hard sometimes. Those are things that I want for myself too. But honestly, I lived my life thinking that I'd be dead by 30. Being alive right now is a win for me. A lot of small things that people take for granted will also be wins for you. Celebrate yourself and your life. It might not look like someone else's, but what you're doing - rebuilding your life- is REALLY HARD. You mentioned that the episodes are happening, at least once a year. I think you should discuss your medications with your doctor and continue/ start therapy. What you're feeling, I've been there too. Having bipolar can be very difficult sometimes. Depending on family for support and seeing friends leave you are so hard. But you're living life the best you can, and as long as you keep fighting for the life that you want, I believe that you can build a pretty good life for yourself.Bipolar teaches you to fight to live and function on a daily basis. I think most of the people in this subreddit have gotten very good at fighting because of our experiences. We're still alive despite all the curveballs that life throws us. And bipolar throws us some nasty curveballs. Sometimes, you're going to fight and win, but sometimes, you're going to fight and lose. Don't give up.

You were diagnosed very recently (not even a year,) you've started medications that have side effects, are continuing or started therapy, moved to another state, divorced and gotten back together with your wife, raising a toddler, and going to another state for a vacation. Wow. You're a trooper. Anyone going through these changes would be having a hard time, bipolar or not. I want to address your feeling that there's something wrong with you. I know that feeling too. It was especially strong the first year after my diagnosis. Things that I considered true about myself were tested, and my whole world shifted. I think it's very important to remind yourself about the things that are great about you and that you do right. I'm going to list some things that stood out to me in your post. - You're a fighter. You continue to soldier through change, even though you feel crippling anxiety. - You're responsible. You haven't given up or run away from your responsibilities as a partner, employee, father, and family member.  - You're resilient. You just moved to another state and instead of letting the anxiety take you over, you're continuing to make a NEW routine. I'm sorry that you're feeling a lot of anxiety with these changes. Something that helps me is doing DBT every morning. I do a page of McKay's The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook every morning. I highly suggest it. Good luck weathering these changes.

My doctor is a whiny little asshole, in hindsight. He's still a pretty good fit for me though. I think you're doing a great job. Your doctor suggested a medication. Instead of taking that information and taking it at face value, you did the leg work to educate yourself and figure out if you want to put that inside your body. Akathisia sucks, and it's a risk that you take every time you take an antipsychotic. But I take an antipsychotic and I'm glad I took that risk, because my medication has changed my life. Honestly, it sucks because bipolar medication is not easy on the body. Lamictal can cause Steven Johnson's syndrome, lithium can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypothyroid, atypical antipsychotics can cause metabolic syndrome and akathisia. All drugs come with risks. You have to decide what risks you're willing to take and which risks are non-negotiable for you. Pharma pamphlets can feel super scummy because they're literally made to sell you stuff. But that pamphlet about the MOA of atypical antipsychotics was made to educate you about what's going on inside your brain when you take these medications.

I understand why some people are hypervigilant, looking for warning signs.I think gatekeeping is not fair to people. I have bipolar type I. I know this because my manic episodes last more than a week. Some people have really destructive impulses when they're having a manic episode. I quietly do my homework, have very interesting and animated conversations with people, become extra enthusiastic and loud, masturbate furiously, lose my memory, and become too psychotic to leave the house. My episodes look very different from other people's, including my family members who also have bipolar. And that's why it took so long to get diagnosed and get help. Because I didn't APPEAR to be \"bipolar enough.\" It was only when I lost my memory that people actually started taking me seriously. One thing I love about  is the accepting community. I don't identify with everything that I read, but when you post something here, people will always respond to say warm and encouraging things. You're right that a lot of the posts that people make are normal things that neurotypicals also experience. But that's because we're human.", "link_id": "t3_dxdpqw", "time": 1574021861}}

I felt like there was something wrong with me, as a person, and the weight gain made me feel even worse. Life became unbearably harder because I was so hard on myself. In that vulnerable moment, the things that people said in passing hurt so much more. Quips about my weight gain or my attitude changes really cut deep. One of the best decisions that I made during that time was to find a psychiatrist who took me seriously. When I said that weight gain bothered me, we went through a list of medications that didn't cause weight gain and tried each one. We talked about lifestyle changes too. I also found a good therapist, which helped a lot too. I know that your decision to stop medications comes from a similarly painful and vulnerable place. But I really suggest that you assemble a team. (like the Avengers!)1. Find a support system of friends and family who love you and support you no matter what. 2. Find things that make your life worth living. For me, it's my education. 3. Find a psychiatrist who takes everything you say seriously and genuinely wants the best for you. 4. Find a therapist you feel comfortable with. This is just my personal experience. I'm sorry the people in your life made you feel awful.

{"eh4w0f1": {"text": "I think that it is absolutely possible to lose the weight. I'm also on medications that make me gain weight. My psychiatrist started me on Metformin to help with the weight gain (metformin is a drug for diabetes patients that can cause modest weight loss.) That might be something you can talk to your physician about. In addition, I'm part of  and I track my calories. I recommend you read the FAQ for that subreddit to get an idea about where to start your fitness journey. I'm on medications that make me gain weight and I've been losing weight and putting on muscle. If I can do it, so can you. Also, I noticed some people in the comments saying that risperidone can cause brain damage. It does not. \"Antipsychotic drugs... block [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) [D2 receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor) in the [dopaminergic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic_pathways) of the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain). This means that dopamine released in these pathways has less effect (Wiki).\" The blockage of dopamine in your brain can cause side effects such as movement problems, shaking and restlessness. If you feel any of these symptoms, you need to tell your doctor ASAP. That happened to me before on another medication, I stopped the medication and the problem went away. This medication will not cause long term brain damage, especially if you're up front with your doctor about any symptoms or problems that come up. ", "link_id": "t3_amv9pg", "time": 1550964141}}

In terms of building muscle, I think your exercise regimen sounds great. I think it's smart to focus on both goals instead of one because they're connected.
