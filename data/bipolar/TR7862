Someone saved from the fire as i was unconscious. When i became conscious someone grab me out of the school bus. My arm was burned. I went to several clinics or doctors to heal my burn. Then the whole year i was in pain. No cure for my burn was diagnosed. I was bullied in school. I was been separated from my friends in school. I was so quiet. In the age of 15, i was undergone a surgery that took one month. My grandmother diedin these years. When i was 17, my teacher sexually harassed me. I tried to tell my mother. She didn't listen to me. I tolerated him for a month because he used to touch my front top part. My brain ability to memorize was gone. I was spending my life like a dead person. Whenever i had exam, i cried everytime every subject every grade. Then i went to undergrad, my teachers make me so sick that i use to cry, they make my journey of University miserable.  I cried and cried and cried. After doing my graduate, i burst with sadness i cried so much no one was able to stop me. I heard voices and vfb oices and cry. They gave me meds. Every 3 months i used to burst with tears and crying. All becausecof voices. I go for our holy mosque. I went to spiritual people.  No one helped me but criticize me like everything that is happening to me is my fault. Then i came to US after one year i again burst with tears. This time i was not resting but walking n walking. My sis took me to a lady she made me cry. My own relatives made me cry. My own sis never see me with smile. My own mother made me cry. Hence there was no one in this world that hasn't made me cry. Who should i blame. I want to be people friends but not letting them know about my life journey. Its not easy for me it was never easier for me to choose happiness.
