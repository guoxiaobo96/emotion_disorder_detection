The friction pushes bacteria all up in there, and can cause issues, so first off, ALWAYS pee after piv sex. The D-Mannose comes in thusly: most UTI's are caused by e. Coli. E.

After my freshman year of college, I moved in with my grandparents in another state, which I had lived in for a good bit of my childhood. About 2 months after moving in with them, I began having violent bursts of vomiting, but only at night. They lasted several hours and continued well past only throwing up foam. It happened every night, no matter what I did or didn't eat, or when I had dinner. Nothing stopped it. The sun disappeared over the horizon, my countdown to throwing up began. This continued for months. I was certain I was dying of something terrible. I finally said something to my grandmother about it, and we went to the clinic. The doc heard what I had to say, palpatated my abdomen (no tenderness or swelling), and asked to look up my nose. His response: \"Oh my God, it looks like the surface of the moon in here.\" Apparently, living in another state for several years was enough to cause my allergies to go haywire. The time of night that I began vomiting was when the air and humidity shifted, exposing me to a hefty dose of my allergens, which made my already considerable post nasal drip upset my stomach. He prescribed a nasal spray and claritin, and that was that. To this day, as long as I take my allergy meds, I'm fine. But if I forget them, things get bad.", "link_id": "t3_f9kd1v", "time": 1582764138}}

We had VERY strict rules as to what was and wasn't acceptable content. Material had to be screened, then transcoded, then screened a second time for categorization, and then released online. One day, the guys from the transcoding room came over all freaking out about this video they had cross their desks. It was from South America, and featured a group of men harassing a llama, fornicating with the llama, and then dismembering it with machetes. They brought their copy for my department to see, and it was put on at the computer station next to me.  Needless to say, this should have been screened out on the first step, as just about everything about it was against our policies. I'm also serious about animal rights and this video was extremely disturbing and (literally) viscerally graphic. I began suffering from panic attacks, and called my psych from the bathroom for an emergency appointment. My boss wasn't in his office for all of this. I left him both a physical note and an email, after calling his cell multiple times. I left to go to my appointment. After my appointment, I received a voicemail saying if I was not back at the office by after our lunch break, I would be suspended for a week.

I hit my local pharmacy for Pamprin and Midol Complete. Pamprin contains no caffeine, so nice cramp control while also not being jittery. I also purchased both tylenol quick release gel caps and ibuprofen. I am sensitive to heavy pain meds, so I purchased a basic gentle laxative for my first couple days post surgery. I had gas x at home already, but how well it does or doesn't work for surgery gases is debatable. I figured if I needed it, I'd take it. I have fibro, so I already had Flexeril on hand (a muscle relaxer). I set a timer and every 6 hours, I took an alternating dose of over the counter pain meds, pamprin/ midol based on what time of day it was, 1 single laxative on the first 2 days (my tummy is just stupid sensitive to any possible changes), and 2 10mg Flexeril a day. I was prescribed 5 oxys, and was VERY well medicated before I left the hospital. I took 3 during my first week of recovery, and the final two the week after as I was easing back into my regular driving schedule (after my daily driving was done, obviously). Heating pads were used often during the first few days. My home is also THC friendly, so we made a batch of butter that I had on whatever I was eating twice a day. I sleep on the second floor of my home, in a water bed, under a weighted blanket, and I wasn't too keen on the stairs at first, so my partner brought clean sheets and my weighted blanket down and I camped in the recliner on night 1 and the couch on night 2. I was back in my bed after that, though I didn't haul my own blanket. I had no trouble rolling over or sleeping on my sides at any point. My pain was very well controlled throughout my recovery. I had 1 issue with my lower right incision getting infected, but antibiotics took care of it.

My joints are tight and grindy, my limbs are heavy, but once I'm moving, I'm doing stuff! Until I'm out of stuff to do, and then... the slow descent into madness.I have to tell myself all the time that I'm not lazy. If I'm wiped out, I don't have the energy to do my part around the home. Please note, no one in my chosen family has ever told me I'm lazy or that I don't do enough. I'm frequently told to sit down and take a break and just breathe for a minute. But if I'm not pulling my weight, helping with dinner, driving folks places, cleaning house, whatever we're up to that day, I feel like a burden. But with the mixed episode, the satisfaction in completing those tasks is either short-lived or nonexistent. What I WANT to do is little tasks throughout the day to upkeep my home, not wait until I'm hypomanic and do ALL THE THINGS! It's so exhausting, and keeps me down for days. But right now, I can never be sure if the energy to do the things is gonna be there. It's good to know we aren't alone. Bipolar can be very isolating, and being alone is just the worst. I know that I can count on my chosen family to take care of me the best they can. Many of us have diagnosis of one thing or another, and we all pitch in to make this thing work.

Sometimes I can even spring out of bed ready to go out and take on the world! But like an hour later I'm melting at my computer with a coffee in my hand! I think, more than anything, the inconsistency from minute to minute is driving my nuts. I never know what my next response to any stimuli is going to be, and trying to lower my overall volume (I perceive myself as loud right now) results in people responding very strangely because I then seem devoid of emotion.

You DO NOT want to wash the blanket itself. Get one with a duvet cover. Mine has a micro plush side and a cool sheet side, and it's luxurious. I wash the cover and then fasten the duvet clasps and it holds the blanket. Pay attention to size. Moving my blanket is like moving a dead body. The bigger your blanket dimensions, the bigger of a pain in the ass containing it will be. Mine is roughly twin size, it takes up exactly half of my king sized bed, and only gets moved when I wash my sheets and remake the bed or if I crash at a friend's house. I had surgery recently and had my husband bring it down from my second floor bedroom so I could crash in the recliner with it. Be aware: once you begin sleeping with one, it can be crappy to sleep without it. I crash over at a friend's place about one weekend a month, and after my first weekend without it, I began taking it with me because I COULD NOT sleep without it.

{"dpc1uwe": {"text": "I am bipolar 2 and have fibro, a migraine disorder and interstitial cystitis (bladder lining condition). I balance meds, supplements and diet for all of them as best I can. I'm on 2 mg Risperidone, 10 x2 mg Flexeril, 50 mg Trazodone, and 10 x2 mg Propranolol daily, in addition to supplements. I also have 100 mg Sumatriptan, 95 mg Pyridium, and Promethazine for nausea, as needed. For supplements, I take Omegas, a probiotic, gluc/cond/msm, vit D, and calc/mag/zinc. I've tried many other meds in conjunction with these, and so far, this is working for me currently. Many meds or supplements that are beneficial to one disorder directly counteract others. A few examples: Vit B is excellent for fibro folks but triggers my IC flares from even a single dose. My IC benefits from Amitryptaline, but it interacts with my bipolar, causing fugue states and memory loss. Gabapentin was good for my Fibro but caused heavy confusion with my psych meds, a symptom that I refuse to deal with because I become enraged and struggle with violent impulses (fight or flight). Exercise is excellent for folks with mental health concerns, but my Fibro means that my recovery time can be a week+ per gym day and I'm crippled the entire time. The rest of my treatment comes from a ketogenic diet. High fat, mid protein, low carb, tons of motherfucking water. I drink between 1.5-2x the recommended daily water intake (weight/2 = oz of water) due to my bladder issues, so I'm constantly balancing my electrolytes. I don't work, but I do keep house for my large family, so I make sure I'm moving for at least 10-15 minutes every hour. There's much more to it, but that's the rough breakdown.
