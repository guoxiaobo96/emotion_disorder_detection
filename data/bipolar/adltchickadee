I really struggled with going to class prior to the dissertation phase, which is a problem I never, ever experienced during my bachelor's and master's programs.The worst thing is that I hate my dissertation topic and doubt its results. I proposed my project during hypomania and wrote it during the worst depression of my life. I was suicidal for the first time since I was a teenager, and I had to push through and complete my project simply because I didn't want the time and money I'd spent to go down the drain. As soon as I finished, I left academia. I sometimes don't even list my PhD on my CV/resume because it doesn't relate at all to the work I'm doing now and only makes me look overeducated and under-experienced. I don't even teach anymore, and my PhD is in education! Nothing has turned out the way I expected. Long story short: getting a PhD devastated my mental health. I also want to add: I started my master's (in creative writing) right after undergrad and then I taught at various universities for ten years until pursuing my PhD. Because I worked for so long after finishing my master's, I had some savings to tap when I started the PhD in my mid-thirties.

{"eqap9ho": {"text": "Gabapentin is a really interesting drug. It's been very effective for me as my pdoc increased the dose. I started taking it to get off of Klonopin. on a low dose (100mg) it did absolutely nothing for me. However, my pdoc said you could go really high with gabapentin, so he increased the dose gradually from 300mg to 900mg and I started to feel beneficial effects....as well as interesting/troubling side effects.For me, though, atm, the benefits outweigh the negatives.Right now I take 600 to 900mg in the morning. it makes me very calm and blurry....almost high. For that reason, it helps a lot with anxiety. However....it makes me clumsy, slur my words, and even creates pressured speech. Luckily, I work from home during the morning. By the afternoon (the time when I co-work with others or go out) the slightly drunken behavior has faded.After a few months on this higher dose (900mg) I did start to feel like I was gaining weight. I told my pdoc about it, and he put me back on Klonopin.But here's the interesting thing......I just don't like the Klonopin as much as much anymore. I actually feel like the gabapentin is more effective. Also, I've noticed that the Klonopin is making  me grind my teeth at night.I've gone back on the gabapentin, but to help with the weight,  I've cut out dairy and meat during the week (eating what I want on the weekends) and started walking \\~ an hour at least five days a week. I think this has helped because I've gone back to my normal weight.I'm going to try and stay on this track because, honestly, the blurry feeling is what I need these days. I guess that sounds terrible, but it's true. My stress level skyrockets when the gabapentin wears off later in the day.So, basically: gabapentin works for me, but it has lots fo side effects. In spite of that, I'm going to continue to take it. (And I'm actually proud of that bc I've been on Klonopin for ten years. This is the only thing that's really made it possible for me to get off of Klonopin, which has been a big thing for me for a long time.)One last thing................I had a terrible experience one day when I forgot that I'd taken \\~200 mg of gabapentin and then ate some edibles a few hours later. Gabapentin apparently really exaggerates the effects of marijuana. I was glad I was at home that afternoon so I could just stretch out on my bed until the experience passed. (yeah, I know I was irresponsible, but I'm just saying it here as a head's up to others.)I read later that gabapentin has been made a controlled substance in Ohio, Kentucky, and some others states because people take it to enhance the effect of opioids.", "link_id": "t3_bxulfp", "time": 1559937303}}

Unfortunately, I now-- several years later-- look back on those friendships and wish so badly that I hadn't cut them out of my life so cruelly to save my pride.I guess my point is, do what you can to take care of yourself without contacting them or reminiscing. Stop re-reading their messages...or even deleted their messages altogether. I know that seems almost impossible, but know that if you give them the time to step back without pressure from you, they may return to you.Since they said they don't want to talk to you or have contact with you at this point, do everything you can to let them be.

That was years ago, and now that I've been diagnosed with bipolar, I realize that they were likely hypomanic and probably undiagnosed or off their meds. If I had know what was going on (i.e., if there  was a movement to \"raise awareness\" about hypomanic symptoms), I could have talked to them outside of class and referred them to the counseling center instead of telling them to gtfo of my classroom.Praising people for coming out with mental illness sounds wonderful, too, but I worry that people in high school and young college students getting comfortable with being \"out\" in high school and college will run into some cruel realities when they hit the workforce. Depending on their workplace, being \"out\" can possibly risk them their jobs. The rest of the world is not as progressive as some parts of the internet and most colleges.

The metabolizing/half-life stuff is very interesting, because of the two pdocs I've seen over the past year, their reaction has both been \"You're on such a low dose of klonopin; most people are way higher.\" I'm 36, so maybe I do metabolize it differently than younger people? Who knows. Anyhow...In my heart I know that .5 klonopin 3x per day is nuts (and I already have enough trouble focusing on my work). I've always been 100% med-compliant, but this amount of klonopin sounds crazy, and I'm thinking I will probably skip the second (mid-day) dose. I'm also going to start seeing a therapist (again, I recently moved and have to find a new team out here) next week, so I'm definitely trying to be proactive.I'm seeing this pdoc again on January 3. I know he's planning to cut back on my Wellbutrin and increase the Lamictal, so I'll definitely ask him wth he's thinking with the 3x per day klonopin script.As for *wanting* to be on Klonopin....to be honest, if it weren't for the fact that I know it's physically addicting (and having been through withdrawal for it already), and the fact that you can build up a tolerance for it, I would just stay on it. It makes me feel peaceful and...idk, like a normal person? Also, since I've been on klonopin for so long (nine years...just not at this crazy dose) I already know how it affects me. Trying something new is a little terrifying. This pdoc has mentioned risperodal several times, and since I'm not manic (or even hypomanic these days) I'm skeptical. Edit: Posted an update at the top. Thanks again for the talk, you two.", "link_id": "t3_5fktla", "time": 1480533394}}

This sounds ridiculous, but if possible turn out all the lights (OK, I guess that would make it hard to get work done, but if it's possible do it). The hawk's instinct is to stay out of the dark, so if you can make the space dark, do it. He/she will want to fly to the light.You can also try to lure it out with live feeder rats or mice from a pet store. They have to be live though (don't get the frozen ones) because the movement of the rodents will attract the hawk. Place the live bait somewhere close to an open door so that the hawk will have to fly out to get it, but still close enough that the hawk can see it.I wouldn't try to trap the hawk on your own, that's something professionals have to do.On the plus side, though, I don't think you have to worry about the hawk starving. A healthy hawk will try to get out and move to another location if it runs out of food. If you do have any rats or something in your wear house, though, the hawk will probably clear them out, so that's a nice benefit.tl; dr: make it as easy as possible for the hawk to get out by opening as many doors and windows as you can and keeping the building as dark as feasibly dark as possible.", "link_id": "t3_3x8l6q", "time": 1450375104}}

She can also be rather loud, especially when she is calling for me or my husband. Like you said, cockatiels will become close with humans, but the down side is that when the humans are away, the bird gets lonely.You might want to consider getting a pair of budgies. They are less expensive than cockatiels, and they are smaller and (slightly) quieter. Two budgies will keep each other company during the day when you are at school, and with some extra food and water, you can leave them overnight every now and then without any problem. They are also  a lot more interactive than canaries but not as needy as cockatiels and other parrots. ", "link_id": "t3_ua9rz", "time": 1338301610}}
