I left it in the unused backyard for at least one winter and one summer with no maintenance, no watering. It just lived in its little 10\" pot... and kept living. In 2009 I went away to law school (thanks, hypomania) and stored it in my mom's yard. It got water, but stayed in its little pot. Plants don't like living in little pots - they get \"root bound\" and stop growing. It's how they make bonsai. Anyway, it survived. There was some extreme pruning required.In the winter of 2009/2010 some bad things happened and I got diagnosed. It took a while for me to come to terms with my diagnosis and I was generally unstable due to meds etc for a few months. Truth be told, I was pretty miserable.One day I noticed that the drug/variety store a block from my house had Japanese maples for sale and the realization hit me:**If my little tree could make it through what it did and survive, so could I. There were tears then, and there are tears now as I write this.**I graduated from law school, opened my own practice, everything went to shit, and I was still living at my mom's with that tree in its pot in the back.Last fall I moved in with my girlfriend and this spring I planted my tree in the front yard. [This is from the spring, before all the leaves were out](https://i.imgur.com/U34TrLf.jpg)       It's pretty ugly now, but it's thriving.

Social workers are not going to serve an arrest warrant on an accused murderer (and no amount of social reform will make murder go away). We need a crew of people who can deal with these situations. While they would fill the role that police do now, they would receive different training and they would not be acculturated into a rotten police department. My opinion? Every law enforcement officer in Multnomah County should be fired and have to apply if they want their job back. Part of the hiring process would be citizen review of complaints, discipline, etc, with the power to turn down an applicant. That would just be a start, getting out a lot of bad apples.

I am acutely aware of the power of thought, and it has made a very positive difference in my life - despite my mental illness.I'm also acutely aware of the fact that bipolar disorder can't be cured, only treated. I believe that positive thought is an essential part of that treatment - having a mostly great attitude toward life has probably saved mine. But with bipolar, you hit limitations. Positive thinking can't fix a physically damaged brain any more than it can fix a broken leg, and frequent shifts in cognition makes it really hard to maintain consistent thought patterns. It's like having to reprogram a computer every time you turn it on.tl;dr I do my best at this and it helps, just like positive thinking can make any injury a little more bearable.And fuck off with your toxic positivity.

I've had plenty of hookups and flings and short terrible relationships.I'm in my first healthy long-term relationship now, because I wasn't ready until now.  More than three years in now.Just keep building yourself into who you want to be, be kind and ethical in your life, have a good time, and romantic relations will appear. And the first few will probably suck donkey balls.High school relationships are definitely important and meaningful for the people in them, but they are also silly and, imho, should not be anyone's goal.Not exactly related, but it is a fact that a lot more people have crushes on you than you think (this is a popular topic at reunions - \"no, wait, you were into me?\")Never be afraid to casually ask someone out. If you spend time around them and you enjoy each others' company, it's almost guaranteed that they sometimes think about you when they're getting themselves off. Hopefully you can find a way to help them with that.If you shower every day, wear clean clothes that fit, and keep your hair looking good and get haircuts - whether it's a traditional style or something unusual - that's enough. Doesn't matter whether your're prep, goth, dork, whatever. Just be clean. Contacts over glasses for sure. If you have hair on your face, you should probably just shave unless you actively fuck around with facial hair. Adult women don't tend to care for anything other than thick, full beards or clean shaven. My high school sideburns sucked.It doesn't matter if you think you're ugly. Most people think that, especially teens. It's probably not true. I can almost guarantee you that you're at worst average or a little funny-looking. If your clothes and person are tidy, you'll look better and feel better about yourself, which also makes you look yet even better.If you're a 300 lb neckbeard you should focus exclusively on not being a 300 lb neckbeard. That goes for any kind of obesity, it's way easier to get a handle on it when you're young.Finally, base your interactions with other people around consent. this goes for more than sexual situations and people will like you more whether or not they know what you're doing.", "link_id": "t3_gm7zw1", "time": 1589867108}}

If you are used to Photoshop, you might find it a little bit strange. You can scale designs to any size!You might think that lawyers have similar freedom with our own work product. After all, as long as a judge or opposing party can understand a court filing, the other details are irrelevant. But it turns out this is not the case!

Analogous to that, I bet you could find what you need in the Bible and through Christ (I hope this post doesn't get deleted, I swear I'm an atheist) if you gave it all a fresh look. Your education was limited and did not teach you what you needed to learn. But it gave you a great psychospiritual toolbox that is still there for you.

But if you haven't really jumped into that hole already, don't think you need to.I'm a 41-year-old atheist, but atheism is now a very small part of my identity. I like learning about religious beliefs and traditions, especially mysticism, and there is so much to take away that has nothing to do with anything metaphysical or spiritual. Because I think that's all bullshit.Likewise, if it's appropriate for you, you can cut through all of the bullshit that has nothing to do with Christ or the mystery of the Holy Trinity and see what you find when you look from another direction. The Eastern Orthodox mystical tradition is one direction I'd suggest.

As the Pacific plate is pushed down into the earth\u2019s mantle, where it melts. The resulting magma is lighter than the materials in the mantle,so it rises up. When it finds a hole or crack in the crust, it will rise up into that space. And if the space is close enough to the surface and the magma is under enough pressure (from the magma continuing to rise underneath? BOOM! Magma will come out of the surface in one way or another- I encourage you to read about the different kinds of volcanoes.I suppose it\u2019s possible for a big earthquake to shake a volcano so much that whatever\u2019s holding the magma in breaks - but as a resident of Cascadia who is concerned about the quake, I haven\u2019t heard about a threat of volcanic eruptions.

I didn\u2019t run the table, but I don\u2019t think anyone had more than one slice of pie by the time I was finished with them.It wasn\u2019t a very good law school, and Alex was a very smart guy, and he starkly learned the difference between big fish in small ponds and small fish in big ponds.I don\u2019t even play trivia games. Yeah, it takes more than a couple of brain cells to be good at trivia - but it\u2019s nowhere near a complete representation of intelligence (even if some people perceive it as such). Trivia skills and intelligence are not  things I like to brag about, and demolishing a group of people at a trivia game is most definitely a kind of bragging.Bar trivia is different. You\u2019re on a team and success can\u2019t be imputed to any one person. My teammates are my friends and they already know my strengths and weaknesses. More than that, they know that I don\u2019t always assume I\u2019m right, and I\u2019m always happy to be corrected (even if the correction is wrong). I still don\u2019t often play because I don\u2019t like being a competitive person or stoking my own ego. There is no way around those things with bar trivia, because the goal is to crush all of the other teams and beat them by as much as possible. To see their downcast faces in the later rounds once they start to see the margin of victory creep higher and higher. Especially if they\u2019re the team that regularly wins!I\u2019m friends with another bar trivia ringer who is as good as me and boy oh boy does that get fun.This is why I don\u2019t play.

At least as many have milder anxiety and depression disorders. A whole lot have ADD, and a plenty of others have serious anxiety disorders like OCD and PTSD. I suspect that almost everyone has some degree of CPTSD. Others deal with body dysmorphia related to food, exercise, or gender. Millions (including us) have chronic diseases. Some people just have weird psychology that takes a lot of therapy to work through.Racial dynamics can lead to psychological conditions that the white medical establishment hasn\u2019t even considered. Neurotypical folks still often suffer from being in abusive homes and other shitty situations. Even poverty is a source of trauma. And we can\u2019t forget our neurodiverse brethren with autism, epilepsy, behavioral disorders, and a whole host of other unique traits.While they experience the world differently than others on this do, people with Cluster B disorders like Borderline Personality Disorder, socio/psychopathy, and narcissism are all over the place and worthy of inclusion even if they might disagree.And then there are our peers who have brutally serious conditions like bp1, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder who often have no choice but to live on the streets.Oh\ufffc, and traumatic brain injuries cause all sorts of psychosocial symptoms.bp2 is difficult to treat, more difficult even than some heinous conditions. It\u2019s still cutting-edge psychiatry. And that\u2019s the only part that\u2019s not normal.You, though, are as ab/normal as the rest of us.

Two is an absolute bare minimum.  You'll find these distances significantly greater than you're used to and this obviously can go out the window in heavy traffic at any speed, but it is absolutely the gold standard and has been for at least a few decades.

At that point it doesn't matter at all how big it is.The few women who really demand big dicks can be compared to those who won't settle for anything less than a buff firefighter or athlete. It's just their thing and it's not something most women do. My guess is that only 10-15% of my partners care much or anything about size. It just isn't something anyone should worry about. Even if you have a micropenis or whatever. Some of the best sex I've had came from a woman who did not like to be fucked, but was *great* with her hands.Now, the shower v grower debate is an entirely different thing.", "link_id": "t3_f533hx", "time": 1581925210}}

I would like to encourage all of you to choose to vote against Donald Trump in the general election (at least if he's facing a progressive) for three reasons. I hope you choose to hear me out. 1. Donald Trump's tax and social welfare policies are absolutely incompatible with Yang's. He is pulling the country in a direction that will make UBI much more difficult to realize in the future.2. Conversely, the progressive Democrats (Warren and Sanders) support taxes, social programs, and policies that will be a framework for a future UBI and get voters much more comfortable with the idea.3. The Supreme Court. From what I have seen, the Yang Gang has few bona fide conservatives, and even fewer social conservatives. Most of you lean libertarian and believe in individual rights and freedoms. If Trump serves another term, he will appoint one or two highly conservative justices who will take away abortion rights, protections for LGBTQ folks, due process in criminal cases, and other such things we hold dear. They will protect large businesses in their efforts to fuck over workers and consumers, and they will help dismantle the social safety nets that Yang wants to improve.I believe that you can best support Yang's policy goals by voting for Warren or Sanders. It doesn't need to be a \"strategic\" vote against Trump. You can cast a vote you believe in.The real beauty is that it's still your choice and you can use the power of  your vote however you want to. I just wanted to share some ways that a vote for a progressive Democrat will go a long way toward creating policies that many or most of you support.p.s. -  if the nominee is not a progressive, items 1 and 2 on the list will still be in play and at least worth a thought.

Oh boy.  I suspect that within the next generation or two of antipsychotics, which will eventually have a different name because of their broad utility, we might see something that looks like a cure. Latuda is pointing in that direction.But I digress. Most mental techniques that help people with ordinary depression and anxiety, or just stuff like organizing our lives better, will work for us. They're just more difficult and don't work as well. And since we need all the help we can get, we should give ourselves a chance. is much harder for me to address unhelpful behaviors now.

The \"benefits\" of arbitration, eg \"low cost, efficiency, and speed\", id at 8, might make them faster than ordinary courts, but the small claims and eviction courts that ordinarily decide residential landlord-tenant disputes are very cheap and fast, and there is no public policy reason to bypass them. On top of that, there would be no federal jurisdiction absent a comically absurd situation involving a federal question. I mean, I guess a landlord who really wanted his day in arbitration court could sneakily add an illegal arbitration clause and then wait until the tenant violated the FHA or some shit like that and then pay a big filing fee to get his federal question adjudicated by a litigator who would rather kill himself than represent clients.. but that would be pretty odd. If a landlord-tenant case was worth enough for diversity jurisdiction, I would presume that the tenant is wealthy and sophisticated enough to have had his lease reviewed and approved by an attorney.As far as *Kindred Nursing Center* is concerned, laws limiting the provisions of residential rental agreements are broad and detailed and neither specify a prohibition on arbitration nor sneak around such a provision.

There is also the idea that you can continue doing something in order to stop doing it  (hello, nicotine gum). While abstinence isn't necessarily required for every person trying to recover from an addiction, it is for most people. The thing I really don't understand about recovering from alcoholism is how fundamentally disruptive it is to the social life of an alcoholic. One of the hardest things for me when quitting smoking was fear and anxiety about how I would respond to situations where I normally smoked (getting up, after meals, etc). That sorted itself out almost instantly once I stopped. Fear and anxiety about not having fun with my friends anymore would be a really big deal - and I am impressed by everyone who has navigated that issue.", "link_id": "t3_eo4qkr", "time": 1578949671}}

I've used it the last six years. Often it takes me a couple of days to set up, during which time I sleep in a small backpacking tent. This year, I finally got a nice big piece of Aluminet. Simply tossing it over my tent reduced the temperature by ten or twenty degrees. The inside surface of the tent was much cooler than it would have been in direct sun. After I set up my yurt, I placed the Aluminet over it. It cooled it by five or ten degrees. It was not as good as my setup the previous year, where I was able to place my yurt under a large communal 10' high shade structure shaded with silver tarps (which radiate plenty of heat, but were four feet at their closest point to the yurt.After build week, my camp got too crowded for me so I moved to my girlfriend's camp and stayed in her ice fishing shelter, under the same 10' shade structure I used the previous year. Even under the shade it got pretty hot (and got really hot at our regional even in not-that-hot weather. When I moved, I brought my Aluminet with me. Simply draping it over the shelter again led to a significant decrease in temperature. I got her swamp cooler set up too, which made the shelter very comfortable.I might not have done any sort of formal study, and I've never used a shiftpod, but nothing I've heard or seen makes them better enough than ice fishing shelters to justify the price.At any rate, I feel comfortable that I have enough experience with these materials and structures - a couple of months of actual experience using them on playa and a little bit more at other events - to understand how they work under the only relevant conditions.I prefer my yurt to other options, even though transport and setup is a royal pain in the ass. In addition to being cool and comfortable, it is a real and sorely-needed  refuge for this introvert. I think an ice fishing shelter or a Shiftpod would be great with an exhaust fan on top, a swamp cooler, and a piece of Aluminet big enough to cover the entire thing (like $150 or $200 worth). It's good to remember that the ice fishing shelters are designed to keep you WARM, and the Shiftpod does not depart a great deal from that design. Neither really works without active cooling and both are best enjoyed under shade.Another helpful thing is to raise your mattress off the ground in order to minimize how much it insulates your airspace from the nice cool ground.

Often they are turned down quickly, or courts refuse to hear them because there is no chance of winning. May differ by state.In no particular order:1. Direct ordinary appeal of the case to state appellate court2. Appeal of appellate decision to state supreme court3. Appeal of state supreme court decision to US Supreme Court 4.

Appeal of habeas corpus proceeding to US circuit court 10. Appeal of circuit court decision to Supreme Court If significant new evidence is found, there can be new post-conviction proceedings. This would typically be evidence or a witness that was not disclosed by prosecutors, evidence withheld from prosecutors by police, evidence that the defense lawyer should have discovered, and more.In capital cases, all of this might be paid for by public defense offices.Most of these appeals cannot be done at the same time.

Some cars are owned half-and-half, with each shift driven by a different driver.Some have a single owner, with the other half being leased out with the lease fee going to the owner.Others might be owned by a former driver who hopes to lease out both halves (and hold on to the medallion with the goal of selling it at a high price... no longer realistic in the Uber Age).Yet others might be owned by the cab company.My company is owned by the car owners.Idk how leases work in trucking. Obviously some drivers lease their trucks over the course of years from a finance company. I would suspect that some companies give drivers shorter leases for company-owned trucks.

{"f7aabq5": {"text": "Thinly-sliced silicon crystals with small admixtures of boron and phosphorus are layered and etched through chemical processes that turn them into electrical data processing devices. These consist mainly of wires, used to move electricity from place to place, and transistors, which are electronically-controlled switches that, in groups, can store information and do mathematical operations. Modern technology has made the wires and transistors very small, which allow more information (in the form of electricity) to pass through them. Since there is so much electricity, the wires and transistors are rapidly heated to a temperature hot enough to melt or burn them, much like an electric toaster, stove,  heater, or other heating device. In order to avoid melting or burning, the chips must be cooled down. In large desktop computers, this is done with massive fans blowing over hear sinks that are connected to the chips. Heat sinks have a large surface area which allows them to radiate heat from the chips and cool off more quickly. Sometimes liquid cooling systems like those found on automobile engines are used.Liquid cooling, large heatsinks, and powerful fans are too large to be used on laptops. That means laptops must use smaller fans and heatsinks. This limits the size and power of chips used in laptops. If a too-powerful chip is used, the laptop might burn up along with the person using it. This could lead to lawsuits and product returns, so laptop makers try to use chips that are just powerfil enough.A \"gaming laptop\" is larger and has a better cooling system than a standard one, but it doesn't always cool down the chips completely. This is the case with the chip being discussed. If this chip were used in a consumer laptop like a MacBook, there would not be enough room for an adequate cooling system.Apple makes their laptops out of solid machined aluminum, which itself acts as a large heatsink not found in other laptops, most of which are made from plastic. The aluminum case along with other technical wizardry might allow Apple to put more power into a laptop without an increase in its size. But probably not, since Apple has not sold a really great laptop since 2015.", "link_id": "t3_duwkbo", "time": 1573524418}}

Passenger vehicles/light trucks are all pretty much the same in this respects - even the heaviest pickups etc are still light enough not to seriously damage roads.Smaller vehicles do, however, take advantage of new infrastructure, standard maintenance, etc. Taxing then by distance only is fair and equitable. Gas taxes have historically been a good (if not as equitable) stand-in for distance driven. The rise of hybrids threw this off, but they are a small minority of road vehicles.

Lots of people (including me) were willing to ignore his considerable shortcomings and vote for him because he was the best of only two options or just because of Hillary-hate.He does not have that advantage anymore. He would be somewhere near the bottom of the pack this time around if he hadn't had the opportunity to take advantage of a clear playing field in 2016. He is depending on residual support. I think he will wind up with only his core supporters to depend on, and they won't get him very far. Biden is a more appealing establishment than Hillary was, and there are other appealing centrists in the mix. Warren and Sanders have modest differences in policy proposals regarding M4A, etc., but most progressives are not going to base their decisions on campaign promises that a president can't carry out in the first place. Warren is the most polished and, no matter how many hairs Sanders supporters split, the most effective politician among the two. It is hard for me to imagine Warren supporters switching to Sanders, less so the other way around. Most Pete and Biden supporters looking left won't go any farther than Warren.Sanders will probably pick up a  big share of Gabbard and Yang supporters when they drop out, but that is not a lot of voters.

{"f35qnr5": {"text": "Thank you so much for the awesome answer. I will admit that I was trolling just a little bit. I am a lawyer and one of the cool things about the US/UK legal system is the way precedent can be used to quickly figure out how existing laws can be applied to new things. I haven't worked in this area of the law, and I don't need to: when presented with a novel question or a new technology, courts will attempt to find precedent that fits as close as possible. There is often no need to reinvent the wheel. In the case of live video, very little distinguishes live streams from broadcast TV other than the technology used to promote and transmit it. If a case doesn't involve those sorts of technical issues, and most wouldn't, case law relating to broadcast TV will usually be applicable to streaming. At the end of the day, copyright is copyright. And when there is a question about whether something is fair use, precedent from one medium will often be used to make arguments (through analogy) regarding another. For example, a case about samples used in music might be very relevant to the question of whether something like this video might be fair use. The details are quite different, but issues of the amount of material used, the way it is changed, etc. can and do apply to multiple types of media. This is what makes law fun to do. It's like a treasure hunt for relevant precedent. If you're still reading, a video of somebody commenting on an entire sporting event or other show is not fair use. You just can't use anywhere near that much of somebody else's copyrighted material without permission. It doesn't matter at all whether it's live or pre-recorded.A great example of fair use in the context of commentary on a copyrighted work is the Honest Trailers channel on YouTube. I don't think they could get away with any more copyrighted content than they are already using.", "link_id": "t3_dflcf7", "time": 1570686421}}

The staging lot and/or the event might open earlier or later than it has in the past. I work Apex (the first person you see upon arrival, the one who asks you if you need to go to Will Call). I always try to work the pre-opening shift. It's fun, because instead of sorting ~~cats~~ cars between only Will Call and the lanes, we get to add the staging lot. It's always an awesome ballet of hand signals, cones, radio coordination, and ~~shouted commands~~ politely asking people to get back in their cars. It's a point in the entry process where speed and efficiency are crucial and curt behavior that is sometimes interpreted as rude actually keeps things moving. Apex is at its best this shift - when everybody is excited about opening, when the dance is more complicated, and, most important, when a big party starts as soon as I'm done working.Anyway, I help fill the staging lot.It exists as a disincentive for arriving early, which is unfair to people who follow the rules and arrive on time.If you arrrive without a WAP before the staging lot opens (let's say six pm, but that is not certain), you will be turned away. If you arrive without a WAP after the staging lot opens, you will be sent to the lot. It works on a first-, last-out basis. Nobody leaves the lot until the event opens at midnight, and the first to leave the lot will be the people who arrive just before midnight. People who arrived earlier will have to wait for everybody who arrived after them. This is a \"penalty\" to the extent that it delays entry into the event, and that is inconvenient for anybody. But it is also a unique opportunity to spend a few hours in line with a bunch of interesting folks, in a line that does not move frequently or unexpectedly, a line that actually allows you to have some fun that other participants don't get to have.

For the long term, avoid a PNP unless they have 20+ years of experience and a focus on BP2. An MD between the ages of 40 and 60 is what you want. At least 40, because treating this disease is an art that requires experience.

Anyway, here's a ramble about some of the things underlying my position:In fact, if an indictment came from the DOJ, the Court would have to figure out whether there is a justicible question about indictment in the first place. If a sitting president were indicted, the first thing he might do would be to pull a Saturday Night Massacre until he found a U.S. attorney willing to move to dismiss the charges. If that happened, who would even have standing to sue in the first place? Even if a judge refused to grant the motion (that action would be justicible), the President could just order the prosecutors not to take any action on the case.  Who, then, would have standing to sue? A victim of an ordinary crime has no standing to force the DA to prosecute a case. It would be sort of analogous to Bush v. Gore, but it would be about a criminal prosecution - something ordinary and well-umderstood, with centuries of applicable precedent. I would bet that the question of a crime victim's standing was settled in Merry Olde England. That was not the case when it came to a state election recount. The lack of clear precedent in Bush v. Gore gave.the justices cover for their purely political decision.It would be more interesting if an indictment were issued by an independent counsel. I don't think it would fly unless the statute expressly granted that power to the counsel. But we don't have an independent counsel.", "link_id": "t3_9ne2fp", "time": 1539321424}}

Is this for the purpose of making board layout neater and cleaner? The \"big electrolytics\" in this case are C12, C13, and C14? I have read about this practice and put smaller caps next to all of the other big ones, but since these are part of the boost schematic I blindly followed, I didn't want to add anything. C12 is apparently central to the basic operation of the circuit... would it be good to put one there, too?I'm not concerned about the buck switching interfering with my signal - my goal is that the converter will only operate while the battery is charging, i.e. when the DC source is plugged in, and I think I got that part right. Jacks, jacks, jacks. I had my jack game mostly planned out before I even heard of an opamp.Input: For the main mic, I am going to use a four-pin CB-style jack with a CB mic. For the experimental \"AGC\" mic channel, I'll use a 1/8\" phone jack. I'll be able to switch these two if one doesn't work. For the mp3 channel, I'll use a normal 3.5mm jack. Power jack, standard barrel connector. Unfortunately (think) I have to use all insulated jacks, as the enclosure is metal and I don't want a chassis ground.Signal and switch connections between boards and controls: I've experimented with vertical headers and jacks on other prototypes of this and they seem to work pretty well. Power connections between boards (and preamp-to-amp): screw terminals.", "link_id": "t3_8sz4pl", "time": 1529701552}}

I think it's a pretty simple equation - to be a Ranger, you need to be at least a third-year burner,  do a long day of training, do an even longer alpha shift and pass it, and, probably most important, have an interest in being a Ranger. Absolutely none of those things are necessary for someone to successfully work a burn perimeter, not even in the Sandman (hippie-tackler) role. Good judgment and training are obviously still needed, but that's a much lower bar for interested volunteers to get over.Regardless, I think we can expect all-staff calls for the big burn perimeters again next year...
