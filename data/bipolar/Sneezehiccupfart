I dont necessarily practice the religious part, just the meditation.What you are feeling could still be part of depression, just not a deep depression. You could try taking some time (10min) to meditate on life once or twice a day. You may also need a new therapist. I think what you are feeling could get better. Its no way to live life to be constantly unappreciative or unhappy with your situation. I also dont think its necessarily your fault.

{"fj44gvv": {"text": "I am 32F. Diagnosed in Jan/Feb of 2010. I was also premed and it was int he middle of interview season. I went to only 3 interviews. I was seeing a psychiatrist without myparents knowing. They thought I just wasn't taking good care of myself. I was in yoga, exercising daily, going out with friends, but I still had a very intense depression. The psychiatrist I was seeing kept prescribing antidepressant after antidepressant and misdiagnosed me with typical depression.  Shortly after my 21st birthday and a day after going out with friends, I attempted suicide. Luckily I was found and the paramedics came, packed me up and brought me to the hospital. Strangely, I remember that as the most peaceful time in my life. When I got transferred to inpatient and started on meds, the fog of depression lifted and I was finally able to see colors again and feel things. It was like God said OK you can live again. I had to step back from my life for a while. I dropped out of my last semester of college. I was only 2 credits from graduating. I did an intensive day program for about 3mo. I enrolled that summer in a local community college and completed my degree from close to home. Miraculously I was accepted to medical school and left that August to NY. Things were rough and I had a bad psychiatrist in the beginning. I met my future husband that fall and for the first time started building healthy social support and friends. Some of whom even know my diagnosis. I graduated and got accepted to residency, married and did well for a while. I relapsed recently and am going through a tough time now, but I have had many happy times over the past 10 years.
