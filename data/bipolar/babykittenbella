Because I do my very best every day, its frustrating when those I work with don\u2019t do the same (at least from my perspective). The thing I\u2019ve learnt is that some people don\u2019t operate like that, or they simply have different priorities. Your team mate\u2019s main priority is probably the health and survival of her child, as it should be. It sucks that its affecting your team, and the outcome.After many frustrating years working in teams, I have learned the following helps to manage my expectations and limit frustration:1. At the start of the project everyone discusses and agrees to deadlines. Break up milestones into smaller chunks, to keep everyone on track, accountable and to avoid \u2018cramming\u2019 or rush jobs.2. Ask everyone if there is other things in their life that could affect deadlines, and agree that early warning, asking for help and clear communication makes it easier to manage set backs as a team.3. Never wait to share work after 75% of the time has passed. Aim to share work at 25% of the time. This gives you an early indication of who needs help, and who might let you down.4. If, at the halfway mark, you have repeat offenders, reach out to your lecturer or superior and ask for advice in dealing with the members not pulling their weight. This alerts them to the problem, but you are trying to solve it. Team work, yay!5. Document everything. Running email, copies of texts etc. Should you have to go and ask to have someone removed, you have documented proof of your attempts to communicate clearly, check in regularly etc.Best of luck!", "link_id": "t3_dxy8m5", "time": 1574070285}}

I wish there was a blood test that could confirm it, I find it all very subjective. Anyway, 2 years on I have accepted that I am indeed bipolar 1. I had a manic episode.
