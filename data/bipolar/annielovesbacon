I used in my paper. Basically, anorexia and bulimia affect the brain\u2019s grey matter. Even after recovery, the grey matter doesn\u2019t go all the way back to normal. Some hypothesize that if recovery is maintained over a long period of time, the grey matter will continue to rise and possibly normalize, but studies haven\u2019t made it that far yet. Grey matter affects cognition, memory, and attention as well as more advanced motor functions like coordination and precision.

The first step is to become more aware and cognizant of them, but the second step \u2014 which is important!! \u2014 is countering them. For example, you may think, \u201cI\u2019m such an idiot because I did x.\u201d When you catch that thought, think to yourself, \u201cLots of other people have done x and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re idiots. Everyone messes up sometimes. It\u2019s okay.\u201d The reason countering the thoughts is so important is simply becoming more aware of your negative thoughts without doing anything about them is very painful. And by practicing countering them, you are building up a good habit. Another thing that worked for me is adjusting how I speak to myself \u2014 not just the content of my thoughts but *how* I am speaking. For example, I have a nickname my closest friends call me, and it makes me feel safe and loved when they call me that. I started using that nickname to counter my thoughts as an added bit of compassion. For example I might say, \u201c[Nickname], you\u2019re not an idiot. It\u2019s okay.\u201d One more thing that has helped is journaling. I know that\u2019s not for everyone, and that\u2019s okay. But documenting how I am thinking/feeling about myself was helpful to me. Something about seeing the actual words written on paper changed my perspective. Be patient with yourself.

My mom doesn\u2019t like to do those things so it\u2019s special time just for us. As a kid/teen he always set aside time to teach me things. He taught me how to play basketball, how to build a table, how to cook, helped me with homework, etc. It always meant a lot to me that 1) he would set aside that time for me and 2) I could learn things while also getting to spend time with him. More than anything, he always listened to me. Even when I talked about stuff he didn\u2019t understand or really care about. When I had (have) questions, he always answered them, no matter how stupid. If he didn\u2019t know the answer, he would look it up and tell me later.

It was sooo uncomfortable and often angering to have those comforts stripped away from me. I wanted to see someone else, but I go to the only clinic I can afford so it was her, or no one. Three years later and now I can see how much that attitude has helped. I\u2019ve made a lot of progress.

Like therapists, teachers see hundreds of people over their careers. A student only has one teacher each year, but each year a teacher has a great deal of students. Teachers know a bit about their students' lives, but students don't know much about their teachers unless they choose to self-disclose.My point is, teachers almost always remember their students. Maybe they don't recognize them right away (like if it has been decades), but most people don't realize the impact students have on their teachers. Most teachers will remember their students' names and where they were in life when they were in their class. I imagine it's similar for therapists: they probably remember us, and maybe they don't recognize us on sight or remember details of our stories, but they probably know who we are and remember vaguely things about our lives.This is just my guess, though, an extrapolation of my experience being a granddaughte of teachers.", "link_id": "t3_91eu8r", "time": 1532419133}}

It took me a while, but I moved past the pain. It no longer hurts to think about my former therapist, I just look back at our time fondly. And I'm able to look back at our time with more retrospect, too -- after working with a different therapist, I can compare their different approaches and what did and didn't work.

So there is less (almost no) personal connection, and no way to really talk a problem out like you could in person, but it's really useful if you need to get things off your chest and/or if you need advice.

You don't have to do college \"like everybody else.\" If you need to take a semester or more off, that's okay! - Like others have mentioned, most universities have resources for students, such as a counseling center. You may not get to see your therapist as often as you'd like, but it's almost always super cheap or even free. Additionally, schools have disability resource centers. You can get accommodations for bipolar, as well as for other things such as anxiety. I take my exams in my school's disability resource center because I have test anxiety.- Going to class often feels impossible. Try to go, even when you don't want to. You may feel exhausted during and after class, you may zone out, but you won't feel the guilt/panic/regret/etc. of missing class. That said, sometimes you just gotta miss. Sometimes you're glued to your bed. When that's the case, communicate with your professors! You don't have to divulge personal information unless you're comfortable with that, but at least you can ask them what you've missed and how you can make it up. This will help you not get behind in class.- Some profs are assholes. But you might be surprised how many will show compassion. I had a really rough semester this past fall. One reason was I was basically caring for a friend full-time, and when she ended up in the hospital, it took every ounce of energy out of me. I just could not make it to classes. I explained the situation to my profs.

It can hurt to make yourself vulnerable. But if you push yourself, stay honest and open with your therapist, and put in the effort, you will get something out of therapy. It's hard and scary but it's really rewarding.Edit: For me, it also helps to write about what my therapist and I talk about after each session.

{"ds2jkzs": {"text": "I had a similar situation, although not ED related. Just FYI what I'm about to say will deal with sexual assault, abuse, and suicide, so read with caution if those topics are sensitive to you.I have a friend who was brutally assaulted many times by her then-boyfriend. It really, REALLY messed her up -- she had to drop out of school in the spring. She came back this fall and was doing a lot better. Then, she saw her abuser out of the blue (he doesn't even live in our town) and from there it was just a downward spiral of depression and PTSD and anxiety for her.She would call me or my friend almost every night because she was scared to be alone (he knows where she lives), and we would come right over and spend the night with her, or invite her over to one of our houses. We were with her constantly because she was afraid to be alone. All understandable, of course!After about two months of that, she attempted suicide. My friend and I instantly drove her to the hospital, stayed with her all night, and helped her check into the psych ward. We visited her, bought her new clothes, and were basically a liaison between her and her mom. She and her mom are not on good terms but of course her mom pays insurance and needed to know what was going on.Then when she got out of the hospital/psych ward a week later, we helped her find a place to live, find a job, and get back on her feet.Let me make this clear: none of this is my friend's fault. She bears no blame for her mental health, for the abuse she suffered -- none of it. But taking care of her became a full time job for my other friend and me... our grades suffered, and our mental health has never been worse than it was at that time (we both have mental health issues of our own). At first I felt so guilty and ashamed admitting that taking care of my friend was so hard for me. But after talking about it with my therapist like, a thousand times, I realized that to protect my own mental health, I was going to have to distance myself from my friend. It was hard, but I made it clear to her that I will be here to support her, but I can't spend every night with her. If she's in imminent danger, of course I will help her. But she needs a professional to help her with these other things. I hope she finds that help, but I've come to realize that that's not up to me.I know that's not the same as your situation. You have the added stress of her kids and the familial tie. But I understand the pain and guilt comes with detaching yourself. Try to keep in mind that it's not selfish to put your needs first. If your sister doesn't want to seek help for her ED, then there is nothing you can do to help her. You can make it clear that you love her and you want the best for her, but I would suggest telling her that when she is ready to seriously approach getting help, that's when you will be here for her. But you can't keep pouring yourself out for someone who is not trying to get better. It will just drain you, and it won't help you.I'm so sorry you're in this situation.

Certainly there are bad therapists out there, but in my opinion, everyone always talks about bad therapist, but people talk about good therapists less often -- so it seems like there are less good therapists.

She doesn't push me too hard, but she does push me. I often will say \"I don't know\" when in fact I do know, but I am uncomfortable or I'm not sure how exactly to say what I want to say. My therapist does not let that slide, she allows me time to think, but if I know, then she wants me to tell her. (And sometimes I truly don't know, and she is perfectly okay with that, too.) I also use humor as a coping/deflecting mechanism, and once she realized that, she began to call me out on it. She laughs at my jokes (I am pretty funny, I have to admit), but then she redirects me back to the question.Sure, being pushed like this makes therapy sometimes difficult or even unpleasant, but if I'm not being challenged, then I'm not growing. Therapy is supposed to be uncomfortable. I don't mean to say therapy shouldn't feel safe -- it should -- just that if I talk to my therapist like I talk to my friends, I'm never going to unlearn my toxic, self-destructive behaviors. Other things my therapist does that make her a great therapist: Save the occasional aside, she doesn't talk about herself or make anything about herself.

Every so often, she will stop and ask me if I feel like what we're doing is useful, if the session is going the way I want it to, etc. (I appreciated her saying that up front, because when she introduced mindfulness to me and it wasn't useful, I didn't feel bad about telling her, and then we didn't waste time on it.)

It was really scary and anxiety-inducing but it has changed (and saved) my life. I hope you will benefit from it too!Definitely bring in a list of your concerns. If you're feeling depressed, try to unpack that a bit -- like specific symptoms (can't get out of bed, feel hopeless, etc.), how it's affecting your work/school/social life, how long this has been going on. And that applies to more than just depression, of course.My No. 1 tip is HONESTY. It is very very hard (for me, at least) to be open and upfront with someone I do not know, especially about difficult mental health stuff. But your therapist can only help you if they know everything that's going on, so try to be open and honest about everything you are feeling/dealing with.At my university counseling center, I had an intake appointment for my first appointment where I was placed with the first available counselor and they basically just assessed what was going on -- it was 30 min rather than a normal counseling session which is 50ish minutes. At the end of my intake appt, the therapist I saw told me I could continue seeing her in the future (I did), or she could help connect me with a different therapist if I needed to. (For instance, if I had been placed with a male counselor, I would have requested a female counselor because that would be more comfortable for me.)There's so much more I could say, so if you have any specific questions please feel free to reply and ask or DM me.

I've spent a lot of time searching for mother figures and my therapist and I have worked a lot on my constant need to fill that \"mother figure\" role in my life. Perhaps that third client switched because they were wanting the same thing. I doubt it has anything to do with you, they are probably just searching to fill a hole in their heart that they need help understanding.I relate a lot to your second client (at least how you've described them). I left my first therapist because I felt she didn't push me enough. I tend to be very cagey in therapy and dodge questions and use avoidance techniques. My first therapist let those slide, I think because she was trying to be gentle with me, but it didn't help me. I eventually left because I wasn't making any progress. I felt so, so bad -- I didn't want her feelings to get hurt -- but she just wasn't the right therapist for me. My therapist now has a personality that matches better with mine and she pushes me harder, she argues with me (which I like because I am argumentative).

She doesn't let it slide when I say \"I don't know,\" because she knows that I *do* know and just don't want to answer. It's not helpful for me to avoid answers like that, and so she pushes me. It's good.Also just some general advice from the few therapists I've seen: If you practice a specific type of therapy or have a couple methods you really prefer, make sure that's what's best for your client. I had a therapist who was really into mindfulness. I get that it works for some people, but it doesn't for me (and I was open minded and I really tried, I swear). I told her over and over again that it didn't do much for me, but she kept bringing it up. It was frustrating because it felt like she wasn't listening to me or that I was doing it \"wrong.\" I wish she had understood that one certain method won't work for every single person.Another thing: take a quick second, maybe at the end of session, to say something kind or encouraging to your client. My therapist and I sometimes have really tough sessions where we may argue a lot or talk about really hard topics for me, but she makes an effort to say to me \"I'm proud of you for opening up so much today\" or \"I know that this is really hard for you, and I'm sorry\" or even just \"thank you for coming in today.\" It means a lot to me and shows me that she cares.", "link_id": "t3_6a5hpd", "time": 1494660019}}

I am really, really bad about talking about my feelings or anything that makes me uncomfortable, and I'm cagey by nature. Even in therapy, where I know that I have to be open in order to receive the help I need, I tend to deflect questions with jokes or respond with \"I don't know\" a lot.

You could try offering to cook one or two nights a week and choose something healthy for those nights, but if your parents refuse (like mine did), just do what other commenters have mentioned and use My Fitness Pal to watch calories in and calories out. It'll work out!For exercise, I think the walking path at the park and the hiking trail are great. Take it slow -- start by walking 15 minutes a day, then 30, then an hour... when you feel ready, you can start running a little bit, or doing a mix of walking and running. I like to put in headphones and listen to music while I walk. You could do that, or listen to podcasts or movies -- whatever you want! I know \"just\" walking doesn't sound like much, but it's better than nothing, and it WILL help.You can totally be at a healthy weight by 18 if you stick with it.

That said, there are lots of intramural football teams that are really fun and would love to have you, regardless of experience!2. There's basically three categories of dorms at OU -- Headington, Cate, and the towers (Walker, Adams, and Couch). Headington is definitely the nicest, but it's very expensive. It's where all the athletes live, and because of that, it has stricter rules like checking in guests, enforced visitation hours, and its own private cafeteria. Cate is the least expensive, but it's also the oldest. Very small with community bathrooms. My recommendation would be to live in one of the towers. They are suite style, which means you have one roommate and you share a bathroom with that roommate and two other people. Each tower is pretty similar, but has its own unique thing -- Couch has the cafeteria at the bottom, plus a small restaurant and study lounge; Walker has a convenience store at the bottom which sells snacks, medicine, and other necessities; Adams has a fried chicken restaurant, Cane's, and tutoring.3. The party scene is great at OU if that's what you're into, but if you're not, there's definitely lots of other things to do. I think it's the perfect balance.4. There are lots of good fraternities at OU, but I'm sure some still haze. I don't know much beyond that.

It will actually water the tree.That said, there are definitely good therapists and bad therapists. There are lots of websites out there with advice on how to choose which type of therapist is right for you -- I would definitely recommend that you look into that.I wish you the best of luck!", "link_id": "t3_4ilv08", "time": 1462858959}}

But I'm dying to know more about what he did, how it affected, if she's still in contact with him, etc", "link_id": "t3_3vlqrv", "time": 1449398433}}
{"cxoztbg": {"text": "I once went through the drive thru of McDonald's with my friend. I ordered 20 piece McNuggets and two large fries for us to share. The guy in the car in front of me leaned out his window and said \"Dang! All that just for you?! You gotta chill!\" My friend rolled down her window and said \"Yo half is for me!\" The guy just laughed and pulled forward.When I got to the window, the lady informed me that he had paid for our food. Naturally I paid for the car behind me (although I felt bad because our meal had been expensive and the person behind me was just $5)I don't know why this has stuck with me for the past few years. I wonder if he paid for our food because he felt bad for what he said, or if he was joking with us intending to pay for our food the whole time.", "link_id": "t3_3vm3pq", "time": 1449397205}}
