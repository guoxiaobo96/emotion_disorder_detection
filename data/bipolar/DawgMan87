Like 10% on a liberal estimate of people who aren\u2019t out or willing to disclose their orientation or identity. So 90% of the people around us have a lived experience that is in many cases vastly different than the pathways open to us, the ambitions we are \u201callowed\u201d to have, and expectations we are to fulfil to fit social norms. You can\u2019t wear the quirky bright coloured sneakers and not expect to raise a thought in someone else\u2019s mind about who you are and what you represent.

The face you put on for the world each day is a choice. The shame you expressed is your own conscience relating your outward expression of self to others in a way that has not always defined you. There is such a thing a fluidity- in gender, orientation, that you can extend such feelings to how you dress, behave, the activities you involve yourself in and the people your surround yourself with. My advice would be to just be you. Wear your fun shoes. Go workout at the gym (endorphins are great medicine). Plenty of women work out. Being fit isn\u2019t a feminine characteristic.There is no right or wrong, just metering expectations of the people in the community around you.

This drug is also hard on your liver, so they check your enzymes quarterly with a CBC to make sure it\u2019s not killing you. Long term are bone density issues, like 10yr longitudinal study impact. Most people have no side effects with regular use. I\u2019ve been on it for 4 years. There is a new formulation in trials right now that has lower doses of the active components with the same efficacy. The current form of Truvada is the maximum dose daily. Like using a hand grenade to open a door when all you need is to turn the knob. So don\u2019t let the long-term 10 yr+ side effects scare you. For PrEP, the drug may change in a few years to a less harsh formulation. The rubric for prescribing/insurers covering it is typically 1) man who has sex with men 2) sex with multiple partners 3) sometimes with or without condoms 4) sometimes while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 6) If you are a needle drug user or are a sex worker. This info may be key if you\u2019re on a Medicaid expansion plan and your intake appointment needs to prove on paper that you\u2019re at high risk for HIV exposure and you would benefit from PrEP. Ask me anything. I\u2019ve been on Truvada with Medicaid and employer insurances, where it either cost nothing or I had to get the copay card through Gilead to supplement my insurance. PrEP is like how Guardasil was 10 years ago. It used to be only for girls with a high risk of cervical cancer, then men under 21, now it\u2019s used for both sexes 12 and up.  PrEP will be what ends the AIDS epidemic. When people ask me why I take it, I respond that if you could take a pill everyday that 100% prevented cancer, would you take it? Even if it was expensive, required multiple dr appointments, and the small risk of long-term side effects?A little bone density loss sounds a lot better than getting sick with complications from HIV. And the prevention of HIV is much less expensive than the cost to treat it, which is why public health systems are becoming keen to cover their at-risk populations.

This drug is also hard on your liver, so they check your enzymes quarterly with a CBC to make sure it\u2019s not killing you. Long term are bone density issues, like 10yr longitudinal study impact. Most people have no side effects with regular use. I\u2019ve been on it for 4 years. There is a new formulation in trials right now that has lower doses of the active components with the same efficacy. The current form of Truvada is the maximum dose daily. Like using a hand grenade to open a door when all you need is to turn the knob. So don\u2019t let the long-term 10 yr+ side effects scare you. For PrEP, the drug may change in a few years to a less harsh formulation. The rubric for prescribing/insurers covering it is typically 1) man who has sex with men 2) sex with multiple partners 3) sometimes with or without condoms 4) sometimes while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 6) If you are a needle drug user or are a sex worker. This info may be key if you\u2019re on a Medicaid expansion plan and your intake appointment needs to prove on paper that you\u2019re at high risk for HIV exposure and you would benefit from PrEP. Ask me anything. I\u2019ve been on Truvada with Medicaid and employer insurances, where it either cost nothing or I had to get the copay card through Gilead to supplement my insurance. PrEP is like how Guardasil was 10 years ago. It used to be only for girls with a high risk of cervical cancer, then men under 21, now it\u2019s used for both sexes 12 and up.  PrEP will be what ends the AIDS epidemic. When people ask me why I take it, I respond that if you could take a pill everyday that 100% prevented cancer, would you take it? Even if it was expensive, required multiple dr appointments, and the small risk of long-term side effects?A little bone density loss sounds a lot better than getting sick with complications from HIV. And the prevention of HIV is much less expensive than the cost to treat it, which is why public health systems are become keen to cover their at-risk populations.

So the same passage in the context of a gay man would read \u201cif a gay man had sexual relations with a woman as one does with a man, both of them have done what is detestable.\u201dI note also that in the same chapter of Leviticus there is not equal comment on women sleeping with women. The Baptist community would interpret the Bible to mean that Jesus is the New Word, Way, Truth and Law. That the old ways have passed. King Solomon would just say \u201cnothing new under the Sun; eat, drink, and be merry\u201d. What good does shaming someone with a book do? Jesus says \u201clove thy neighbour\u201d not isolate and shame them for being gay.

My abusing alcohol was a symptom of my bipolar disorder. And a symptom I ignored for 10 years. I was unknowingly using alcohol to take me down off manic highs and to dull the anxiety and also coax me through depressive lows, put me to sleep, and make me numb. So I didn\u2019t beat alcoholism. I had an alcohol abuse disorder that was directly linked to undiagnosed and untreated bipolar 1 disorder. I gave up booze for over a year. And was very afraid to have a drink, fearing I\u2019d become some raging alcoholic or start sucking down bottles of wine in a sitting again. That hasn\u2019t happened. Now that I\u2019m stable and on meds, I have control to moderate my consumption of alcohol. My tolerance is also low as hell now. And with lithium, I dry out like a sponge and get thirsty super quick when drinking. An AA acolyte would say I was, am, and will always be an alcoholic and even one drop is the slippery slope to an early grave...... though getting my severe mental illness treated and monitored has made all the difference.

Being numb to our challenges often makes them more challenging to overcome. Time lost (wasted?) in a state of numbness can exacerbate the outcome of any situation. The only thing worse than trying something and making mistakes is taking no action at all. For me, my greatest fear is stagnation.  I get bored easily. I thrive in environments that change. Maybe I can thank my manic features for adapting to dynamic environments. I like feeling. Even if it\u2019s sad, depressing, hot or cold, or whatever. Feeling anything means I\u2019m alive. That I\u2019m human. That I\u2019m here. Numb is complacent. Numb is not living. Numb is subsisting. Going through the motions isn\u2019t a life. To me at least.

{"ediamv7": {"text": "This is a great question for google. You\u2019ll need money. If you can afford the whole thing at once you can buy a property outright. If not, you\u2019ll need to approach your bank or other lending institution to apply for a mortgage (derived from the French for \u201cdeath pledge\u201d). The bank can pre-qualify you for a spending amount that can help you determine which properties you can actually afford. Based on a few factors, they can back the full amount needed to purchase a house. You\u2019ll typically have to come up with a down payment. Like around 20%. And then you pay the bank monthly until the principal amount plus interest is repaid. So basically you\u2019re renting your house from the bank. Though the amount repaid is paid-in equity so that when you sell, you keep the value of the mortgage you\u2019ve paid in already. If you don\u2019t pay, the bank can foreclose and you lose ownership of your house. Down payment amount and interest rates on the loan will be different based on the bank and any particular program you\u2019re applying through, like USDA, first-time homebuyer, military veteran, etc. You can search for homes for sale using web tools like Zillow, which scan the MLS (multiple listing service) that real estate agents use to find suitable properties in your search. Some people sell their houses themselves. There are websites and road signs that indicate a property is For Sale By Owner. You can negotiate the sale on your own. And some sellers would be willing to hold the mortgage themselves. So you\u2019re essentially renting from the current owner, though take over the property when paid off. A licensed real estate agent, or the broker they work under, can help you find property to buy and are trained to search for the best options and act in your best interests. They\u2019ll have contacts with building inspectors and other professionals who can assess hidden damage and costs of necessary or expected repairs that can factor into how much you may offer to pay.So you need money.

And enough people don\u2019t use them or use them consistently enough to prevent the spread of HIV+.It\u2019s cheaper to put the riskiest population on PrEP than to treat them for HIV. The truth is that not every gay man who has sex is going to be sober or free of STIs when you encounter them. PrEP is safety and prevention that I choose for my health, not for the benefit of others, though to protect myself. There were condoms during the AIDS crisis. Without advocates for treatment and prevention there\u2019d be a lot more gay men lost in this generation. PrEP is prescribed with the understanding that condoms are still used consistently, especially because it doesn\u2019t prevent any other STIs and things like syphilis and gonorrhoea are rampant these days. If someone offered you a daily pill to be cancer-free, you\u2019d take it, right? For a man who has sex with men, with multiple partners, sometimes under the influence of drugs or alcohol (poppers count here), and with or without condoms, PrEP is a lifesaving preventative measure. If you are monogamous and mutually exclusive with a single partner and use condoms every time and only have sex when sober, PrEP might be a waste of your money. Though the day your partner cheats on you while drunk with some random hookup and maybe bareback........ you\u2019re perhaps going to wish you had something to protect you.

And that diagnosis is dependent on a few factors [like here](https://online.epocrates.com/diseases/48836/Bipolar-disorder-in-adults/Diagnostic-Criteria) Depending on how you\u2019re presenting to a psych dr or therapist over time may allow them to dial in a diagnosis. So you may start off by exhibiting certain patterns of behaviours and a hospitalisation/psychotic episode, though a dr may need more information or follow-up to make a determination for bipolar over other disorders. In my experience I was hospitalised and after 3 months confirmed that I have bipolar disorder and that she saw it as a spectrum rather than black or white. I had been put on lithium from the start in the hospital because I asked for it from the range of options the psych doc was giving me to manage my symptoms and it\u2019s worked out so far. My psych doc in follow ups was really just interested that I was stable. That the only thing that would nail down a diagnosis any further would be if I had parents or family members that were diagnosed. So for me I was treated for bipolar from my first psychotic episode and then later confirmed by my doc when other factors had been accounted for. I had abruptly quit alcohol a week before I was hospitalised and had been assaulted by my fianc\u00e9 the day before. So the ridiculous amount of stress I was under put me over the edge. And they had to make sure that I wasn\u2019t suffering from withdrawal that would misdiagnose the psychosis. Ask your doctor. Why x instead of bipolar. Or do you think I\u2019m bipolar. If not bipolar what might I be experiencing. I hope you get answers. Knowing is half the battle. ", "link_id": "t3_9xiu50", "time": 1542343604}}

Thank you for being loving and kind and for creating an open and accepting environment for your son (and siblings). It\u2019s something I could only have dreamed about. Your fears are the same fears most parents have about their gay kids; that they\u2019ll be harassed, assaulted, beaten, abused, or killed over their sexual orientation. And those fears are largely overblown. Most abuse or assault like that happens between someone they already know. The stranger giving candy from the van down the street isn\u2019t the worry. And the registered sex offenders who are monitored by the state and known to the community are certainly less of a threat than the sex offenders who haven\u2019t been caught yet, or who haven\u2019t acted on their impulses. I think the biggest gateway for some horrible interaction is going to be from strangers on the internet and on dating apps. That\u2019s where the police find all their suspects for stings these days. It\u2019s easy for people to lie about themselves online and on gay dating apps. Just as easy as it is for a minor to click \u201cI agree that I\u2019m 18 or older\u201d on an app with adult material. My first hand experience to that effect is the handful of kids, one or two a month, that reach out to me on Grindr, chat me up, I ask their real age, usually a year or two younger than 18, and I block and report their underage profile. Not everyone feels the same. Not everyone has hard limits on age of consent or how young they would hang out with in real life with someone. When I came out, my mom expressed her worst fears turn to anger that \u201cyou\u2019re going to wind up dead in the gutter with AIDS after running off with some old molester who just wants to stick his hands in your pants\u201d. Now is that an extreme example of a mother\u2019s worst possible fears? Perhaps. Just because your son has a sunny disposition doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re naive. He\u2019s barely on the cusp of teenage years and so much will change. His understanding of himself in relation to others with change. Give him the tools, resources, and information to make smart decisions about himself, his body, his image, and what he shares online with the rest of the world. Know what apps are on their phone or devices, how to find hidden apps or folders, and how to lockdown or restrict usage during certain days or hours. I think the fact that you are concerned enough to ask a bunch of gay internet strangers for advice is concern enough. It sounds like you cultivate a safe place to explore these feelings when so many parents force their kids to hide their identities. ", "link_id": "t3_9l7zfz", "time": 1538626434}}

And that what legislators are paid to do. For example, the Affordable Care Act is 2,700 pages long and the associated regulations relates to the law totals 10-20k pages long. Congress introduced and passed the law in 6 months. A single citizen, in their free time, wouldn\u2019t be able to review all the information. And granted, neither do the representatives.

Transmission of HIV isn\u2019t luck, though there are statistics and demographics and risk profiles at play. Talk it out. Be honest. He\u2019s heard all the excuses in the book. Let him know what you want and need and hopefully he can convey the same. Love and have compassion for your fellow man, even if he isn\u2019t the Prince Charming you are waiting for. For context, I dated someone who was HIV+ and went on Truvada to strengthen our commitment and to have safer sex. And now I\u2019m on it for myself and piece of mind with Grindr hookups.

You mentioned that you had talked about the \u201cusual heteronormative milestones\u201d and thought you had an understanding. Maybe something was lost in translation. He wants all the things you don\u2019t. And you want everything he doesn\u2019t want. Namely, binding commitment between yourselves through marriage or children. I think the cutoff point could have been the move to Paris. You quit your job and moved to a different country to be with someone who wants marriage and kids and commitment. While your story sounds very \u201ccharmed\u201d, I can\u2019t help to think it just a little off that you\u2019d be basically living with his mother in his ancestral home in the countryside and have absolutely no intentions on becoming a part of that family. As if the delicious croissants \ud83e\udd50 were there for anyone who comes along as the \u201cboyfriend of JS\u201d. They were auditioning you for an active role in their family, not showering you with a cultural exchange that could be traded for \u201canother handsome Frenchman\u201d. You moved to a different country for somebody while telling him you were keeping your eye out on the side for the next best thing. I understand his hurt and frustration. Maybe he didn\u2019t understand that you were really not okay with marriage or children at all. Would have saved you a lot of time, effort, and heartache.Are you crazy? No. Privileged? Pompous? Perhaps. Fuck me, what do I know. You want what he\u2019s not willing to sacrifice  (un -committed non-exclusivity) and he wants what you\u2019re not willing to embody (husband and father to his children). It will never work. You can\u2019t change him. And the only thing you can do is change your expectations. Going forward, when looking for some serious dating, be upfront about your hard limits. The no kids, no marriage thing can be a turn-off. Especially in light of the freedoms for gays to marry and adopt or have children of their own. In a world that seeks to divide and ostracise, marriage and kids is a way many gays choose to live out a more heteronormative lifestyle, like the tight-knit family ties you witnessed in the village in the French countryside.

Let them know that you\u2019re just freaking out a little and that you don\u2019t typically have unprotected sex.

In the spring of 2018, after the federal trial of Mateen\u2019s wife, it was revealed that she lied in her handwritten statement in 2016 where she had described that Mateen had premeditated the attack at the venue. It\u2019s now believed that the nightclub was a random soft target.
