I also agree that a label doesn\u2019t necessarily matter, as long as you think you\u2019re overall getting the help you need. My therapist always has said they treat symptoms, not disorders, which is why different medication works for different people. I have just always noticed that when it comes down to it, I have no idea who I am. I really question the reality of everything and everyone around me, on top of questioning myself. There\u2019s other symptoms, but that\u2019s the simplest way to put it. I think this can go hand in hand with other disorders, where they kind of blend together.

I hate having to defend myself (to myself and other people) about why medication works for me and without it, I simply could not function. It takes a lot of work sometimes to get to that point where you realize you need more help than talk therapy. I even get offended hearing someone talking about medication to other people and how they \u201cdisagree\u201d with it, having NEVER been put on anything. It actually just happened to me at work, and I finally chimed in and explained how they were wrong. She ended up asking questions, and I was proud I got to inform her!
