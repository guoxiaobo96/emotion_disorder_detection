Of course this meant when I snapped out of it and hit a depressive wall the depression was made so much worse, and it really fucked with my head for a long time. I'm currently planning to roll again for the first time in a very long time for NYE, but I'm more cautious now.

It can be really difficult at times as my actions can be very unpredictable sometimes and my episodes can be hard to handle. What we have both found helps is to just communicate a lot. Me and my sub talk about stuff to a weird extent (even by BDSM standards) but when you have mental health issue that is notorious for getting in the way of relationships communication is even more important  than normal. I can't offer up any advice aside from to talk about as much as you can with your sub, and maybe try things that help me stay grounded in manic episodes like meditation (not to be THAT guy). I hope you know that it is possible to balance a relationship with bipolar, it just comes with a few added complications. I really hope you manage to keep on top of things, I know how hard that can be sometimes.", "link_id": "t3_dykwi2", "time": 1574198509}}
