The main one in the computer, an external that the computer frequently gets cloned to, and a third clone that is kept at someone else\u2019s house and switched out periodically with the second drive. That way if your house burns down or is robbed, you still have a backup. Preferably keep one of the backups in a waterproof and fireproof safe. Also make sure to convert any files that are going obsolete, such as VHS tapes, while you can. That being said, printing is the best thing you can do for pictures. Many people in Japan lost all their digital files in the 2011 tsunami, but were able to salvage photos from the wreckage. Teams of volunteers were able to scan, digitally repair, and print the water damaged photos for them.Another important thing for digital photographers is to make sure to update the metadata on every photograph. Whenever someone in the family needs photos of someone, such as for a funeral, I just click on their name and every image I have of them in a batch of 40K+ images taken over the past 11 years pops up in seconds. I have no idea what the future of digital storage will look like, but if any of my descendants wants to see what the lives of their ancestors were like, it will be MUCH easier for them (embarrassing for me, but I\u2019ll be dead anyway).

I've read it is rarely used because people associate the labrys with feminism rather than lesbianism, but the feedback I'm getting here indicates otherwise. No major reason for avoiding colored flags... I just find symbols fascinating and enjoy tinkering with them :)", "link_id": "t3_723b8h", "time": 1506283285}}

{"dnffjn7": {"text": "(New to reddit. I don't see the text so I'll place it in the comments. Forgive my blunders.)Hello everyone! I\u2019m a budding graphic designer looking for people who might be interested in collaborating on a fun project. I\u2019m not involved in any LGBTQ+etc groups in person, but I do enjoy lurking online from time to time. I\u2019ve been searching for lesbian spaces that aren\u2019t strangled by certain ideologies, so I hope this idea is welcome here.We should create a lesbian symbol, one that represents natal women who only date natal women. For many people, biology matters. Unfortunately, due to current identity politics, lesbians are frequently harassed for having \u201ctransphobic\u201d and \u201cmisandristic\u201d sexual preferences. Having a new symbol that is exclusive to natal female lesbians could help promote solidarity, identity, and strength within our small community. At the very least, if this project catches on, it\u2019d be cool to see some fresh ideas. So far, I\u2019ve utilized a pair of interconnecting XX\u2019s blended with current gay, feminine, and love symbolism. I understand sex chromosomes aren\u2019t a perfect science, and don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s accepted outside of the United States, so I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this. Additional imagery you feel is widely recognized as representative of natal women or lesbianism is something I\u2019m especially interested in. So what do you think?", "link_id": "t3_723b8h", "time": 1506230192}}
