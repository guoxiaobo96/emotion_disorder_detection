At the very end, it was used to just get through a minute, hour, day. Couldn't function without it. Bottom line: alcoholism is a progressive disease. It can, and will, take over completely.  I wish I could tell you that maturing helped me to learn to drink responsibly. It didn't.From all the research I have done on this, stopping alcohol completely is the first step towards recovery. Then, address the mental health issues. At one time, I was a \"dry drunk\", which is when you have completely abstained from alcohol for a period of time, but are still miserable, dysfunctional, and probably emotionally sick. I was going to AA meetings, but it wasn't helping. I ended up relapsing. Badly.I ended up in rehab, and then in a long-term care facility for 6 more months after that.

But, before he can deal with his anger, your husband really needs to get a handle on his alcoholism. THEN look into anger management.

I haven't had a scenario like the above in years. But it used to really give me a lot of angst. These days, I *still* tend to say (angrily), \"Wtf is wrong with people?! Why aren't they checking their phones every 5 minutes like I do?\" It is so hard to recover from that mentality. I literally always have  my phone with me everywhere I go.I'm Canadian, too, by the way.
