Both nations are economically attached at the hip, so declaring war on your largest trade partner would basically crash not only your economy but the global economy. Like, the US relies on Chinese exports of electronics like solar panels and microchips, we almost exclusively buy solar panels from China. And China relies on food imports from the US and US allies like Australia and Europe. So if we go to war, one side that relies heavily on technology in warfare stops having replacement parts and the other side goes hungry.Also both sides have nukes, which would hopefully deter the idea of an apocalyptic nuclear war. I think the US will just remain a waning superpower until China takes hegemony and then the next guy takes over and then we all die of climate change.

There are also Wastelanders around in like Fallout 1-2 who have formed towns and are not explicitly from the Vaults, so they're presumably the descendants of people who survived the blasts by hiding in basements and stuff. There's also diaries from Fallout 4 of a family who survives in their basement bomb shelter, and later die to raiders, so there were people up and about and not actively dying like months after the bomb dropped.Also, mostly only major population centers were targeted by the bombs, so if you're like a remote Inuit tribe living in Alaska or Canada, you might not even know anything happened until much later.", "link_id": "t3_dyd4sk", "time": 1574140771}}

The NCR military we see in New Vegas are an undermanned, undersupplied force, as indicated by the military and supply situation at Camp Forlorn Hope and Bitter Springs. Their manpower is constantly stretched between barely keeping raider tribes like the Powder Gangers and Fiends in check, skirmishing with the Legion, \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d  civilian locations like Freeside, and occupying strategic positions like the Strip and Hoover Dam.I think a good real-world analogy would be the US war in the Middle East. It was a really unpopular war, and despite being the most technologically advanced army in the world, the US was unable to defeat an insurgent force that was more familiar with the land, used hit-and-run tactics, and committed terror attacks on the civilian populace. The Legion is very well trained, considering all they do is train for battle from childhood. A lot of the NCR\u2019s troops are conscripted and poorly trained (like the Misfits at Camp Golf). Compare a Legionary who\u2019s not afraid of death and has basically trained since childhood to fight to a scared California farmboy who enlisted out of boredom and mostly has experience picking mutfruit.

We\u2019d need to cut down on things like beef and dairy, which are propped up by government subsidies, and switch out meat with other more sustainable protein sources like bugs, seaweed, and beans. Also you can feed bugs organic waste and they can turn it into useable protein, there\u2019s even a type of mealworm that can eat plastic.

{"e3jcpmf": {"text": "It\u2019s an incredibly deep game, with rich emergent gameplay and ludonarrative. It boggles my mind that a game I\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours on what only fits in a few hundred megabytes. The art style is nice too, and the story and scenario writing is gripping, with what tidbits you\u2019re given. The gameplay is incredibly deep, like the amount of interactions that happen between characters or items or crafting recipes you can make. Like, for example, if you get the stomach flu, you\u2019ll be easier to track and it\u2019ll be harder to hide since you\u2019re actually leaving a trail of vomit and diarrhea\u2014 or the fact that each NPC you encounter on the map doesn\u2019t have a preset behavior but is just trying to survive the best they can, just like you. Like a melonhead or even a dog that you beat to death with a rock might\u2019ve lived a long life of scavenging, accidentally ate some poison berries and was stumbling around before you snuck up on it. They don\u2019t just blindly attack you because they\u2019re enemies in a game, they choose the best time to strike (usually when you\u2019re asleep), and only if they think they can win (if it\u2019s like 3 dogs to 1 you), and then they\u2019ll try to flee when things go south. Cons: the game is in a weird format so it\u2019s hard to mod, the modding scene is also pretty dead since it\u2019s kind of a cult classic. The developer doesn\u2019t really add new content but just updates like bug fixes and compatibility (You could probably ask him about this too, he\u2019s on the subreddit sometimes). You also die a lot, and randomly. Nothing really protects you from death besides like hiding within the boundaries of the DMC. But that\u2019s pretty boring and uneventful. And you might finally grind your way to becoming a full cyborg with a sniper rifle and body armor and you wander out into the wastes and Ohgodthatbluefrogtouchedme. Dead.There\u2019s also no real protection from getting jumped at night by a dogman. Or a cannibal. Sure the noise traps will wake you, but then you stumble around in the dark until you die in one hit. There\u2019s also like a billion ways to contract gastroenteritis or otherwise get infected and then it\u2019s literally up to chance since the chance of surviving an illness is % based, and drinking herbal tea and taking antibiotics will only better your odds, not cure it. Also the combat almost always has a \u201cbest option\u201d you can pick (if you can make a trap or trip them using strength, do it, then stab them with a spear from three spaces away), which makes it rather boring. Unless you get shot or ambushed and die in one hit. A lot of the gameplay is also VERY REPTITIVE, for example gathering wood for making arrows or making tannin tea to sell is just a bunch of repetition, but you need to do it if you want a safe source of income/enough arrows to survive a fight. Also like the other guy said, nothing is explained to you, so you might just die because you didn\u2019t get some esoteric item to save you during a quest encounter.", "link_id": "t3_945pu3", "time": 1533306131}}

You can cry at a sad movie or gush over a cute puppy, even if it\u2019s hard to bring yourself to do, you can be vulnerable to others by opening up about your feelings. I feel like being masculine shouldn\u2019t be defined by who is the strongest, or the loudest, or who can endure the most pain.

And even if you don\u2019t know the breed, you have to write *something* down for a breed. So you write pit bull.Also, since pit bulls are classified as a \u201cdangerous breed\u201d in many places, it gives police free reign to shoot or confiscate them. So if you want to get rid of a suspect\u2019s barking dog? It was a dangerous pit bull breed. Also when the media gets involved, there\u2019s a game of Telephone about the exact breed of dog. For example, the LA Times\u2019 local section [ran a story](http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/05/local/me-briefs5.S1) on a pitbull that bit a small child\u2019s face. Except it wasn\u2019t a pitbull, it was a German Shepherd mix..The victim\u2019s family told the news reporters it \u201cmight\u2019ve been a pitbull\u201d and they ran with it. The LA Times admits as much in a correction to the article. Also for local news stations, characterizing dog attacks as being perpetrated by pit bulls fits their narrative better and draws in more viewers. Nobody wants to hear that it was a goofy, lovable golden retriever that mauled that kid. No, instead it was a dangerous, aggressive pitbull.", "link_id": "t3_7kgc87", "time": 1513614450}}

Also, a lot of *different* bulldog breeds fall under what is usually classified as a \"pit bull\", so just statistically, there's far more dogs in the \"pit bull\" classification than other breeds because it's so nebulous. \"Did that dog look kind of like a pit bull? Put down in the report that it was a pit bull\".What I'm trying to say is that pit bulls don't bite any more or any less than other types of dogs, it's more a statistical error and public bias that puts them in that situation like the myth of the pit bull's deadly bite pressure.
