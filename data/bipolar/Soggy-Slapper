{"fr6fiif": {"text": "It\u2019s actually a really simple explanation. Stimulants are well known for increasing anxiety. I had some friends in undergrad who took adderall occasionally to help them study and they HATED it because it made them so anxious and uncomfortable. The only reason people with adhd can take stimulants is because it actually lowers their anxiety by helping them focus and keeping their brain from bouncing back and forth between every possible idea that could make them anxious Meanwhile, when you\u2019re in your really low moods, your anxiety is probably gonna go up even without the Ritalin. Depression increases anxiety by itself, and it decreases concentration, which is something that often increases anxiety in people with adhd. So since you\u2019re already more anxious from being depressed, and the Ritalin isn\u2019t able to reduce your anxiety by helping you concentrate as well, it\u2019s probably just having the same anxiety increasing effects that it has in people without adhd.

There\u2019s only a handful of different kinds but there\u2019s a metric shit load of jobs that our brains have to do so they all have to pick up multiple jobs at the same time and that\u2019s why medicines effecting one neurotransmitter effects multiple different brain functions You mentioned Wellbutrin treating adhd and depression, but it\u2019s also a good smoking cessation aid. Wellbutrin effects norepinephrine and dopamine, and both of those are things produced by nicotine so it helps people quit without feeling the full effects of losing everything the nicotine used to make in their brains. Meanwhile norepinephrine and dopamine help you stay alert and focused which is why it helps adhd, and they help with mood which is why it\u2019s an antidepressantSimilarly, SSRI\u2019s increase the amount of serotonin in your brain which obviously makes you feel happy. But serotonin also helps the brain manage pain, so some SSRI\u2019s are used to help chronic pain. Serotonin also gets converted into melatonin, so the increased amount you get from an antidepressant helps you sleep. Serotonin also controls anxiety and aggression, so it does a lot to help you feel more calm when you have extra serotonin in your systemIt doesn\u2019t really make sense that one chemical can affect mood, pain, sleep, anxiety, aggression, and more, but there are so many jobs the brain has to do so each neurotransmitter has to pick up a lot of them even though the jobs they do aren\u2019t very closely related. Acetylcholine for example controls muscle movement and memory formation even though those two jobs have nothing in common.

I\u2019ll say to take everything I say with a grain of salt because I\u2019m still a student, but working on my second graduate degree I like to think I at lease know a few things about a few things So ultimately, a sociopath simply doesn\u2019t care about other people. They don\u2019t understand that every person on earth has a life just as vivid as theirs Imagine it like you\u2019re playing Skyrim or grand theft auto or something and you\u2019re looking at some random non playable character just walking down the sidewalk. Imagine I\u2019m in quarantine and I\u2019ve been playing this game for like 10 hours straight, I\u2019m bored as fuck, I\u2019m just gonna kill this random character to see what happens and make something interesting. After all, that random video game character isn\u2019t a real person like me, right? Who cares if I kill him, he\u2019s just a couple pixels on a screen. Plus if I kill him, now the police are after me and I have to avoid them so I\u2019m not as bored anymore That\u2019s kind of my best way of explaining how they view things. They truly don\u2019t view other people as human beings equal to themselves. They could (theoretically) slit a man\u2019s throat and then say something like \u201cI always have the worst luck\u201d because the man\u2019s blood gets on their new shirt. And if you think about it, if you kill some random character in a video game and you end up getting killed by the law or something, you\u2019d be upset and think something along the lines of \u201cdamn that cop really got me? That\u2019s bullshit, he shouldn\u2019t have been able to kill me, the game is cheating and this is wrong\u201d. Now in the context of the video game, the guy I killed was a person with a family and everything, but who cares because their experience isn\u2019t as vivid or important or real as mine, right? Now obviously the life of a sociopath/psychopath (one of the most misunderstood subjects in psychology) is not exactly 100% comparable to you being bored while playing a video game. But what I\u2019m trying to say here is that it truly doesn\u2019t register to them that \u201cthis person in front of me is equally as human as me\u201d and instead they might thing \u201clet\u2019s kill this guy or burn his car or house or something because I\u2019m bored and there are no real repercussions\u201d but when I see a human being, they just see a meaningless and unimportant object that doesn\u2019t matter I don\u2019t actually believe what they do is 100% their fault because they are mentally ill and they never just woke up one morning and decided they were gonna be that way.

My mom was the only person who understood that so she let me fake being sick to stay home from school sometimes just to get a break Now I don\u2019t necessarily believe in ghosts, but my childhood house was weird and we all think it was haunted. There would be multiple times when we (everyone who lived there) would hear occasional voices that weren\u2019t there, we would just get this feeling that we were being watched, we would randomly start feeling just *weird* and *wrong* and I honestly don\u2019t have a better way to explain that but we all felt it.

Like I said, I don\u2019t wanna say I believe in ghosts, but something about that house just wasn\u2019t right So back to the story: I was getting abused at home and bullied at school particularly hard lately so I coordinated with my mom that we would fake me being sick so I could get the day home alone to recove After everyone left and I was home alone, I just felt wrong and uneasy the whole time but I couldn\u2019t explain why. Then later in the day, I\u2019d guess early afternoon around 3pm or so, I start occasionally hearing a footstep or two in the hallway Now I\u2019m like 10-12 and I\u2019m hearing footsteps in my house so I\u2019m terrified. And I\u2019m not talking faint and quiet footsteps, I\u2019m talking a full grown man wearing steel toe boot footsteps. So I\u2019m freaking out at this point and trying to reassure myself. My thinking was \u201cokay this is scary but all that\u2019s ever happened is this thing has made noises and made us feel weird so it can\u2019t hurt us right?\u201d Then out of nowhere, all of the lights in the house cut off, and all of the toilets in the house flush at the same time. I tried to comfort myself by saying that it was just sensory stuff, but then almost like it read my mind and called my bluff, whatever it was manifested into physical/material action for the first time, so I felt exposed and threatened So at this point, 10-12 year old me was freaking the fuck out. Since the only source of support in my life at the time was my mom, I call her while she\u2019s at work and I just start crying and yelling about what\u2019s happening and how scared I am. Then, inexplicably, after I finish pouring everything out on her and she\u2019s finally able to start talking to comfort me, it all stopped. Now I\u2019m 23, so I\u2019m at least twice the age I was when this happened, and I still haven\u2019t come up with an explanation for it. The best I can come up with is this: when I was 21 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2. Bipolar mania can sometimes result in psychosis and hallucinations, but that doesn\u2019t happen with type 2 and I\u2019ve never had any problems with those things before. Additionally, bipolar disorder typically develops in your 20\u2019s, so the idea that I could\u2019ve experienced the worst symptoms of my life and actually started hallucinating an entire decade before I was diagnosed is a serious stretch. Like I said I don\u2019t necessarily want to say I believe in ghosts, but this shit was damn near inexplicable", "link_id": "t3_g88ccd", "time": 1587897882}}
{"fo4v4ns": {"text": "My main takeaway from reading this is that he never said he wants to break up with you or take a break or anything. He still cares about you and he wants to be there for you, he just also wants some time by himself and he feels like he\u2019s not getting it. But at no point in this conversation did he insult you or call you crazy or anything. He definitely used strong language, but that\u2019s probably just because he\u2019s emotional at the moment. From what it looks like to me, he\u2019s upset with the action of you wanting more attention than he\u2019s comfortable giving, but he isn\u2019t mad at you as a person. I think you should take some time to think about how his need for some alone time is just as valid as your need for attention, it\u2019s not a sign that he secretly hates you and wants to break up or anything, he just likes being alone sometimes. He doesn\u2019t seem to hold any resentment for you as a person, so I think if you can work on the action that\u2019s bothering him then y\u2019all will be okay", "link_id": "t3_g5perx", "time": 1587511824}}

The baseball fields are nice for some people I\u2019m sure, but the vast majority of people aren\u2019t into baseball that much Having 6 parks is nice I guess, but how often do you go to your local parks? I\u2019d say the average person probably goes to a park once in a blue moon but not that often because there\u2019s not much to do other than just go on a walkAlso I lived around there for 4 years and I have never once heard of that peach orchard or that nature preserve. Those sound really cool so I\u2019m upset that I hadn\u2019t known about them when I lived there, but for most people it isn\u2019t a factor of life Now let\u2019s talk about that weather. I will concede and admit that the mild winters are nice, but the summers are hell. Have you ever experienced a South Carolina summer? It doesn\u2019t look too bad on paper but that shit is torture. The average max temperature of 90 is an understatement, for most of the years I lived there the temperature for an average summer\u2019s day was rarely even just 90, it was normally somewhere between 95-105. And that doesn\u2019t sound like that big of a difference until you think about the ungodly humidity we have in South Carolina. I don\u2019t watch the local news much but I\u2019d commonly see them report heat indexes (not the real temperature but how the temperature really feels) of 100-120 because the humidity magnified the heat so much. And on top of that, the air feels like soup. It\u2019s so thick and hot that it doesn\u2019t even feel like breathing normal air. South Carolina summers are torture and it easily outweighs the advantages of a mild winter Sorry about the rant, I just fucking hated living in the fort mill area and I finally get to rant about it", "link_id": "t3_g3c058", "time": 1587222417}}

{"fmyrsz7": {"text": "Hey I\u2019ve got a really cool story about this exact topic. So for three years straight up until the last 4 months I was a registered behavioral technician working for agencies that provided applied behavioral therapy for children with autism. One day, out of nowhere, I got a call telling me that the company I worked for was taking away all but 3 of my weekly hours and giving them away to a new girl they literally just hired despite my years of experience. I didn\u2019t originally thing this was a gender thing, but since I was one of 3 males working for this company, and after the events I\u2019m about to discuss, I can almost guarantee that\u2019s why So fast forward, after a month, I have another job doing the same thing at another agency. They call me up promising me a client, and thus promising me I\u2019d have hours and a paycheck. The week before I was supposed to start, the mother of the boy I was going to be working with called my company and told them they don\u2019t feel comfortable with a male coming into their house Fast forward another month later. I have now been going two months trying to pay all my bills and support myself without any income. I get a call from the company \u201cguaranteeing\u201d me another client, and thus hours, and thus income. I get extremely excited that I would finally be able to afford to feed myself, then about a week or so later I get another call telling me the mom decided she isn\u2019t comfortable with a male coming into her house to work with her child At this point I\u2019ve been three months without any income, purely due to my gender and not due to any fault of my own. At this point I\u2019ve lost 20 pounds because I literally could not afford to feed myself. This was the point where I decided to quit the job and find something else to do. I really didn\u2019t want to quit because I truly loved the work. Seeing my kids I worked with and seeing the progress we\u2019ve made in their treatment was one of the best feelings ever On top of that, all of the families that would actually let me work with their kids told me I was the best therapist they\u2019d had. Since I was a guy I was the only one willing to get real rough and tumble with the boys so all I was ever assigned was male clients and they loved me. I\u2019m talking run up to the door to hug me, cried when I quit the job kind of love. But I couldn\u2019t offer that to a lot of kids just because I was born a male I went through one of the hardest times of my life,  lost all of my income, lost maybe 30 pounds by the end of it all because I couldn\u2019t afford to eat, stayed up all night wondering how I would pay bills, and I was forced to make children cry when I quit and deny other children the opportunity to treatment that could change their lives.

Since adenosine is one of the main neurotransmitters that makes you feel tired, blocking its absorption makes you feel energetic. The brain still needs to absorb it though so it starts to create more adenosine receptors to make up for the ones the caffeine is blocking, which makes you feel tiredThen on top of that caffeine also produces dopamine and adrenaline that make you feel happy and energetic. Over time the brain learns it\u2019ll keep getting a constant supply of dopamine and adrenaline from the caffeine so it stops producing them on its own to save resources and your body starts to rely almost entirely on the caffeine Neither of those are major problems, and the brain can easily recover from it in a relatively short period of time but it\u2019s definitely something to take into account if someone is considering if coffee is healthy for them", "link_id": "t3_ctvehv", "time": 1566517290}}

My wages are $2.50 an hour and since I\u2019m the only bartender in the restaurant, I work just one shift less than what legally qualifies for full time just so my employers aren\u2019t legally obligated to give me benefits, I have to take care of up to 30 customers at a time while also having to keep up with the bar (keeping the ice box full, filling up every pitcher of water that the other waiters use for their tables, making all of the tea that we use as soon was we need it, pouring all the beers and wines and making all liquor drinks, etc). The individual tasks aren\u2019t hard, but doing all of that combined all at the same time, keeping it all organized in my head, and still being fast enough to give my customers a good experience all at the same time is pretty damn hard and I come home exhausted and stressed out almost every night I work 18% is considered the social norm where I live, 15% is the minimal amount that\u2019s socially acceptable and even then you\u2019re considered kinda rude and cheap, and if you ask me I deserve 20% for doing all that I do and still providing service that\u2019s good enough for people to stop me and tell me how good I was and leave good reviews about me online As for other tipped employees like room service and barbers and things, I have no idea. They don\u2019t have to work for double digit numbers of people at a time like I do so I assume it\u2019s lower, but it\u2019s never really clear. I want to ask them what\u2019s customary, but I know that if someone asked me that then I\u2019d be extremely uncomfortable and feel like I\u2019m extorting them with social pressure US tipping culture is one of the dumbest and most confusing things about our country. On one hand I think it\u2019s extremely wrong on every level to make the customer pay to make up for the wages that the employer refuses to pay, but at the same time I enjoy the money that it brings in. Sometimes I\u2019ll make $20 for 10 hours of work, sometimes I\u2019ll make $150+ for 4 hours of work. But if I make that $150 then it\u2019s usually means I worked extremely hard and I earned all that money; meanwhile if I worked for a fixed wage like $10 per hour I would\u2019ve only made $40 for all that hard work.

{"el49yd6": {"text": "One of the things I learned while getting my degrees in psychology is how the school system (at least in America) is ran in the worst way imaginable for the students mental health Since the dawn of humanity until extremely recently, children would have to take the role of modern day adults while they were just in their teens, so the brain of a child naturally evolved to NEED to learn everything they possibly can about the world as quickly as possible. Children don\u2019t just want to learn, their brains are wired so that they naturally feel as though they absolutely must learn as much information as possible Fast forward to the modern American school system and the entire process of education is based purely on the concept of punishment. Your mom drops you off at school one minute late? The school is gonna punish 6 year old you like you were the one who personally drove the car and dropped you off late. Play around or talk to your peers during class (as children are naturally supposed to do) and you get punished and lose the privilege of socializing with your peers (another deeply innate desire of our extremely social species) or you lose the privilege of going to recess and releasing some of your pent up energy (another thing that children have an extremely innate need to do since we didn\u2019t evolve to sit stilly quietly in a classroom for 7 hours every day) Children go to their first few days of school extremely excited to learn new things, meet new people and make new friends. After the first or second week of school, they absolutely hate it and don\u2019t even want to go for one more day much less for a minimum of 10 more years. This is because the education system forces children to live out their days in an attempt to avoid punishment for an endless amount of years which is extremely exhausting for adults much less for young children It\u2019s been the mainstream belief in psychology (especially school psychology which is my field) that schools should revolve around rewards for doing well instead of punishments for not being perfect. If you get a reward for being good, you\u2019re then deeply motivated to obtain that reward without anyone telling you to do it because your brain is just naturally inclined to seek rewards Meanwhile, avoiding punishment is a polar opposite behavior. Instead of showing up to school internally motivated to do the best your can, you should up to school worried about how you might get punished today. You start getting resentful, you get exhausted from constantly being on guard, you\u2019re scared to express yourself or do anything, and you attempt to hide anything you think there\u2019s even a possibility your might get punished for. Instead of showing up to school happy and excited, you dread even the idea of going there from the second you wake up", "link_id": "t3_be6z95", "time": 1555522889}}
{"el47jqz": {"text": "I think this is something massively overlooked today. In my opinion, boys rough housing is 100% natural and 100% beneficial since it gives them an outlet to release the natural aggression and competitiveness that\u2019s just naturally occurring in the male brain and it forces them to work on communication, problem solving, and negotiating/cooperation while also providing a bonding experience. I\u2019m by no means a qualified expert, but I just got my bachelors in psychology and I\u2019m going on to get my masters in counseling and a specialist in education degree (in my field this means a specialization in applying psychology to children) so I think I have some ground to stand on in this issue So in the field of evolutionary psychology (one of my favorites) and especially in the systematic school of evolutionary psychology, it\u2019s believed that the male brain evolved to be naturally aggressive and competitive. Because human males since the dawn of humanity always had the role of securing resources to provide to the others, and competing against opposing elements to obtain these resources, the male brain is just naturally wired to seek out \u201cscoring\u201d aka obtaining something, be it victory in a social context, points in sports, video games, school tests or assignments, etc, the male brain is wired to seek out a sense of \u201cI got this\u201d or \u201cI did this\u201d which naturally forced the male brain to evolve to be competitive and aggressive both physically and socially Naturally because of this predisposed aggression and competitiveness, boys almost always going to fuck around with each other out of this competitiveness, and it often gets physically \u201cviolent\u201d because boys are just naturally predisposed to be more aggressive. Now since these boys are children and since there\u2019s no real threat or no serious need to obtain something for survival, this aggression and competitiveness is most likely going to be channeled into rough housing with friends to obtain the kind of \u201cscoring\u201d that they naturally seek. Now since this is all small scale fun and not a serious conflict, they\u2019re almost forced to communicate with the other boys to come up with an agreement of some sort like \u201cokay he won\u201d or \u201cokay he gets to be first player\u201d or \u201cokay we\u2019ll both share the ball\u201d etcEven in my own personal life this rough housing is a beneficial thing. I\u2019m 22 and I still tussle with the boys just for fun. One time my roommate picked me up and slammed me on the floor just because he wanted my seat. We threw down, had a good time with it, then had to communicate to decide who got the seat at the end. There wasn\u2019t a single negative aspect about it. We just played around with each other as friends, bonded a bit over it, then had to practice communication to decide what happened after the fight.

The story of the children who have been defeated, abused, and abandoned by the system must always be told. I cannot explain to anyone who hasn\u2019t experienced it, but the one thing that I am most proud of out of everything that I have ever achieved in my life is surviving this demon\u2019s torture. I remember begging my own mother with tears in my eyes to kill me at 7 years old, then attempting my first suicide just weeks later, and yet I survived. I will never shy away from this accomplishment. No matter how much it hurts to remember, I will always be proud I was actually never allowed to go into court and give my side of the story. Neither me or my older sister were allowed into the courtroom. I hated it then, but looking back, I definitely understand the decision not to let a 13 and 14 year old filled with rage not understandable to anyone who hadn\u2019t experienced what we had gone through into a serious legal setting. Especially since that evil subhuman animal and his degenerate lawyer based their defense on the idea that she indoctrinated us into hating the good Christian man that he was, out of purely evil motives She relied on testimony from people who knew us and our family. One of the things that hurts me the most to think about is my grandma\u2019s letter of testimony. I was 13 so I don\u2019t remember much of it, but I will always remember how it started off by saying that I was always an extremely happy child, and she gradually watched the smile be stolen by my face, and roughly since the age of 5, she never saw that same smile come back. I struggle not to cry just typing that. I remember even his side of the family asking me why I never really smiled after roughly that same age.

My older sister and I were both lucky enough to be freed of visitation and never had to see him again unless we chose to do so. My little sister though, who is 10 years younger than me so she was only 3 when the divorce happened, is still mandated by the court to visit him once a weekHe still doesn\u2019t openly acknowledge that he did anything wrong, but he definitely treats her differently than he did me and my older sister. No physical abuse, but definitely emotional/mental abuse. I tear up just typing this, my little sister cuts herself at his house just because of how much it hurts her to be forced to visit this disgusting animal every week. We\u2019re terrified to take him to court to get visitation rights taken away. The only reason my mom won custody in the first trial was because of my therapist, and we wouldn\u2019t have that luxury if we started another trial today. Based off of how the last one went, we\u2019re terrified of starting another trial, nothing scares us more than the idea that a biased southern court would give my (publicly) good Christian father custody of our little baby for him to torture her into suicide. Right now we have her going to a therapist. We\u2019ve cynically assumed, out of pessimistic realism from what we\u2019ve already witnessed, that this therapist won\u2019t necessarily be able to help in another custody battle, but we just want her to learn how to adapt and overcome it like I did.

My family even somehow managed to spin their immigration to America into an act of Russian nationalism, so I can\u2019t say that everything they taught me was 100% rational But from their Russian nationalist perspective of communism, which was really socialism since communism (complete absence of government due to total peace, harmony and cooperation of the working class) has never been achieved; their perspective of the reason for the downfall of the Soviet Union was that the western coalition united to strangle it to death, mixed with the union\u2019s desire to constantly spread and encompass new impoverished backwards countries into the great socialist economy, that ultimately lead to the fall of the Soviet Union. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong because I to learn, but from what I know, the Soviet Union itself was very self sufficient until it forced itself to grow and incorporate economies that were so backwards that it just couldn\u2019t support itself Now I\u2019ll preface this paragraph just as I have all the others: please correct me if I\u2019m wrong because I acknowledge my information is from a biased source but- from the information I\u2019ve been given- the Union of Soviet socialist republics was very well off in the realms of free education, free healthcare, and guaranteed income, until other republics that were not equipped to sustain such a system were incorporated into the Union I fully applaud the ussr for trying its best to spread free healthcare, education, and guaranteed income to as many people as humanly possible,but it simply isn\u2019t possible to spread these policies to the entire world without each individual culture to which it is spread agreeing that this is the path that society should embrace. Statistically, the Soviet Union was likely the most successful country on earth. It took Russia, one of the most backwards and impoverished shit holes on the planet and made it the second greatest superpower the world has ever seen in just a couple decades, which has never been done before. But what they didn\u2019t realize is that you can\u2019t just make the entire world do the exact same thing. It\u2019s a phenomenon that every individual and unique culture must personally undergo.

{"eeux3ky": {"text": "I\u2019m an openly and proudly gay man and I can\u2019t agree to some of this and can\u2019t agree with other parts. I think a lot of it is because there\u2019s not many of us so people just aren\u2019t used to it and they don\u2019t understand why we do some things, and since the annoying ones stick out more it\u2019s all people remember so I\u2019ll try to explain some things if you care enough to read my long ass postFor the stereotypical gay part: I don\u2019t think a lot of the stereotypical gay men choose to be that way. I\u2019m pretty masculine and I never chose to be that way and I never chose to like things like lifting weight or working on cars, I\u2019m just kinda naturally like that. I think it\u2019s the same with them. They didn\u2019t choose to like makeup or drag or whatever they\u2019re just like that. And most of the guys I know with the stereotypical voice actually hate it and really wish they could change it. Now I\u2019ll also say that there are definitely some who go way too overboard with it. I feel like they\u2019re probably just trying to embrace it or something to be proud but they do way too much. Like the ones who talk about it too much or say they dress better than everyone etc it\u2019s just annoying. I even had a few of them tell me I\u2019m homophobic because I wouldn\u2019t date them because they\u2019re too feminine when really, what do I have in common with someone like that? It\u2019s just annoying fuck off Then there\u2019s the rubbing it in your face and asking for more respect for being gay. There are definitely people who do that but people also take it out of hand. For example, my straight friends always talk about the girls they fucked last night or how hot a girls body is etc, but the one time I told them that I had sex with someone last night their response was \u201cthat\u2019s too much information we don\u2019t need to know about that stop flaunting your sexuality\u201d and literally all I said was I went home with someone last night. Then there\u2019s the extra respect thing, a lot of people just hear us standing up for ourselves and think we want special privileges. I USED to have some friends who insulted multiple people and hated just for being gay, when I confronted them, apparently I was just asking for special privileges and more respect than other people just for being gay. Like I said, there\u2019s definitely a ton of people who do those really annoying things, but at the same time I think a lot of straight people blow it out of proportion just because they aren\u2019t used to it so they just don\u2019t know why we do it ", "link_id": "t3_ajbiyj", "time": 1548351778}}

What I didn\u2019t know was that this antidepressant I never should\u2019ve been on which started the mania, should NEVER be mixed with those two The combination had a horrible reaction and ended up giving me serotonin syndrome- where there\u2019s so much serotonin pooled up in your brain that it becomes toxic and can kill your whole brain. To make it even better, it happened when I was at work. I work in one on one childcare, and on this particular day I was in the client\u2019s house, and it was also the day of our monthly session with my supervisor and our translator since the client family is straight out of Mexico I was at work and I was feeling extremely anxious and extremely confused for no reason. Then I started getting really cold but I was sweating profusely. I started shivering and my vision started to get blurry and all of it was making me even more anxious and confused. When my vision got so blurry I could barely see I didn\u2019t think I could keep going and I had to ask my supervisor to take over while I sat down to try to feel better.

It hurt me trying to get my first job later because it looked sketchy that I was 20 and never had a job before. It was really bad for her too because I was extremely angry and mean with her since an abusive childhood was all I knew, and ever since I matured I\u2019ve worried about how that might have fucked her up mentally in any wayLong story short- children are not meant to raise children ", "link_id": "t3_ag5ied", "time": 1547570576}}

Here\u2019s two things that helped for me but it\u2019ll be a really long winded post so sorry about that I used one tactic (probably not the best word for it) that worked great for me but I\u2019m not sure you could use. I basically just cut off any family members who were openly homophobic without even coming out to them because they weren\u2019t worth my time but I had one grandma who basically raised me and gave me the only shelter I had when I was being abused as a child so there\u2019s a strong connection there I didn\u2019t want to lose. She was pretty homophobic though and said things like \u201canybody who chooses to be gay is stupid, they know it\u2019ll send them to hell so they deserve it\u201d just to give you an idea of what she believed. I couldn\u2019t figure out how to tell her so one day I just decided to go all out and just be really aggressive with it and kinda bully or intimidate her to accept it. I was watching tv with her and everyone else in the house who I all had strong bonds with and a story about gay marriage or something came in the news, she started talking her normal shit and I just said something along the lines of \u201cyou know what, I\u2019m gay and I dare you to say something like that again. If I even suspect that you don\u2019t accept me and don\u2019t love me for it none of you will ever see me again if your life\u201d. Really extreme, but it worked and they all apologized and said they loved me and the only thing they didn\u2019t like was that I never felt like I could tell them before. Pretty funny how much that opinion changed the second I confronted them. Can\u2019t really say I\u2019d suggest it to anyone because it\u2019s a HUGE risk but it was great for me The other thing I\u2019d suggest is making her watch things about hate crimes against gay men. My mom is the greatest person in my life, but when I came out to her I vividly remember her saying \u201cI still love you and I\u2019ll always love you and I\u2019ll always accept who you are but I really wish you weren\u2019t that way\u201d she never held it against me but it was something we never talked about for years. A huge thing that changed her mind was seeing things on tv about hate crimes against gay people and realizing that they could\u2019ve easily been her own son. After seeing stories in the news about gay beating or gay killings or even just gay kids being bullied in school or watching crime shows were gay people get murdered she loves me more than ever and she\u2019s disgusted by anyone who wouldn\u2019t accept me. I remember her calling me one day crying because she watched a crime show where a gay man was murdered, one day she told me she won\u2019t even talk to her own brother anymore because he despises gay people and she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with anyone who wouldn\u2019t accept her son I don\u2019t know how your house works so I don\u2019t know how you\u2019d do it but I\u2019d suggest something like watching shows on Netflix about gay hate crimes. I can\u2019t remember the name but they used to have a whole documentary about a famous case were this teenage boy was beaten to death for being gay and I know there are a few crime shows where gay people get killed or bullied and tortured etc. I can\u2019t promise it would work but when a mother thinks about the real possibility of her own some being murdered it tends to have a pretty powerful effect ", "link_id": "t3_ad30js", "time": 1546802126}}

If you don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready then trust your gut and done fuck with it until you\u2019re sure. Also, keep in mind the stage of life that you\u2019re in, you\u2019re only in college for a few years then you\u2019ll have to move to wherever you find a job or wherever you go to grad school and what are the chances that whoever you would start dating would move to the same exact place? Now let\u2019s get to the positives though. I\u2019m very proud of you for admitting all of these things so early on. I\u2019m taking my last 2 classes of college now and i really wish i could go back to freshman year and have the maturity to realize that i just wasn\u2019t ready. I\u2019d say half of my college career could be characterized by me getting hurt and fucked over by ain\u2019t shit men who just decided to take advantage of how vulnerable I was and how much I wanted a boyfriend and looking back on it I really wish I would\u2019ve just enjoyed myself instead of getting myself upset over people who weren\u2019t even worth one second of my life. I\u2019m not trying to say you should shut yourself out from everyone but try to be careful and mature about it because at our age we\u2019re not even close to being fully mature and people will easily fuck you over for their own benefit", "link_id": "t3_ad20c1", "time": 1546761509}}

Deaths from starvation and poverty were already happening and the communist government helped reduce that6) Inform then if the greatest the USSR accomplished.

{"ed4637g": {"text": "I have bipolar type 2 so I\u2019m obviously going to have a different experience than she will but you seem like you\u2019ll be happy for any information you can get. So I\u2019ll start with the bad news to get it out of the way. Bipolar disorder typically develops in the 20\u2019s and the fact that your daughter was diagnosed in her mid teens could suggest the condition could be worse for her. It\u2019s also a long journey to get the disorder under control, it takes a lot of work and there\u2019s no way of knowing how long it will take. The last thing to remember is there is no cure for bipolar disorder. It will always be there, but medicine can GREATLY help cut down on the amount of episodes and help make them much less intense. Now for the positives: getting diagnosed in the mid teens wouldn\u2019t make it profoundly more severe than a diagnosis in her 20\u2019s. If anything it could be a bit worse but it won\u2019t be anything like a diagnosis before the age of 10 and those are the really serious cases. The next positive is that even though getting it under control is a long journey that takes a lot of work, it almost always ends up under control in the end. Bipolar disorder is considered one of the more serious mental disorders, but thankfully it\u2019s possibly the one we know the most about and possibly the one we\u2019re best at treating. Treatments for things like schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder are little more than an educated guess but we\u2019re pretty successful in treating the mental causes of the disorder through therapy, and we\u2019re even more successful in treating the physical causes through medication. Another think you will probably love to hear, a lot of bipolar meditations have little to no side effects. Take this with a grain of salt coming from me since I have a different type than your daughter so I need different meds, but I\u2019ve never felt a single side effect from mine. Now for some good things I\u2019m seeing in your personal situation: I am very happy to hear that she\u2019s not only open to getting therapy. I used to always be against it because it hard for me to open up, but now that I\u2019m actually going I can say it makes a world of difference. I can also say that I cannot possibly explain how proud I am of you for being so concerned, and so determined to help your daughter through it. I can\u2019t explain it, and chances are that your daughter won\u2019t show it, but there\u2019s really no way to express to you how much it helps to have support from anyone, and I\u2019d be willing to say the support of my mom has been the most impactful of all. Just stick through it, listen to her and do everything you can to help and she will make it through this. Just like everyone else who\u2019s commented, we can get it in control and live a successful life. I went from losing large portions of every year because I was so depressed I couldn\u2019t even get out of bed. Now I\u2019m 2 classes away from getting my bachelors degree, I\u2019m months away from starting grad school to earn my masters, and I\u2019ve impressed employers so much that I\u2019m already working a job that requires a degree before I\u2019ve even earned one. The bipolar brain is very different from the average one, and most of the time the bipolar brain tends to be far more intelligent and creative that the average one.

I\u2019m also gay, and I\u2019m in the Deep South so it\u2019s pretty hard to find other gay men. What you have to realize though is that finding a boyfriend won\u2019t fix the emptiness you feel inside. It will definitely distract you from it for a while, but once that honeymoon phase is over, you\u2019ll end up exactly where you started but with the extra complication of another person added on top.

I\u2019d also suggest being careful with hookups too. They\u2019re really fun and you can definitely have them from time to time there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but they can also be just another escape tactic to run from your issues instead of fixing them. They open you up to bad people too, that\u2019s how I got sexually assaulted. Before you really go into dating, you need to find out what exactly is causing that emptiness you feel inside and search for ways to fix it. My suggestion is self improvement: improve self hygiene and care as much as possible, eliminate any negative thinking that puts yourself down and force yourself to replace it with positive thinking to boost yourself up, exercise and at least try to eat better, try to go out more and look for things you like to do that make you feel good. Every single one of these is WAY easier said than done but part of being an adult is realizing nobody is gonna fix our problems for us so we have to do everything we can to make ourselves the best we can possibly be if we ever want to be happy.

{"ecur7qk": {"text": "Obviously it\u2019s gonna be different for everyone but I\u2019ll give my input and I\u2019ve found a lot of people agree with a lot of my points Stigma: the stigma surrounding mental health is EXTREMELY powerful, especially in conservative areas. I live in the Deep South so the stigma is stronger here than most areas. So much so that even I, a survivor of child abuse, with a diagnosis of ptsd, adhd, bipolar disorder, and an anxiety disorder, I clearly need mental health care much more than most people. Even though I\u2019m painfully aware of how much I need it, I still hate walking into my psychiatrist\u2019s and my therapist\u2019s offices because of how strong the stigma is Cost: probably one of the biggest obstacles. I\u2019m a college student so by default i have no money. I have insurance but I\u2019d still have a $40 copay for every visit. Since I\u2019m a full time student, i can only work part time and it\u2019s simply not possible to work part time at a low paying entry level job and still afford to pay for rent, gas, food, school supplies, bills, medicine, and anything else I had to pay for and still have enough money left over to regularly pay $40 copays on counselor and psychiatrist appointments. I don\u2019t qualify for state programs or anything because of low mental health funding in my state, and as a college student I\u2019m still listed as a dependent on my mom\u2019s taxes so her income gets imputed into the equation. Even though she makes enough money to disqualify me from these programs, they don\u2019t take into account that she\u2019s a single mother with three children to support in addition to supporting herself so she has next to no money to help me in paying for mental health. I also just don\u2019t have time to go to any support groups because I\u2019m a full time college student with a part time job to support myself while also trying to have hobbies and a social life to help with the mental illness Bad mental health workers: since I\u2019m in the Deep South nearly all counselors only provide religious based care and as a gay man I don\u2019t really feel comfortable getting care based on a religion that clearly says I deserve to be stoned to death. Even the non religious mental health workers are often just simply bad at what they do. I had a psychiatrist who told me to be thankful I\u2019m bipolar because hypomania can make me more productive sometimes and then prescribe me an antidepressant even though it\u2019s a well documented fact that you don\u2019t prescribe antidepressants to people with bipolar disorder because they\u2019re notorious for making the disorder worse but she truly my bipolar disorder was a gift and she didn\u2019t want to fully suppress it with medication. Not only was it a nasty little pill that made me feel like shit the whole time I was on it, but it made my mood swings way more intense but it made me rapid cycle out of control sometimes even 3 times a week. One time I started the week out so depressed I couldn\u2019t do anything but lay in bed all day thinking about suicide and having my roommates watch over me while I slept to make sure I didn\u2019t do it, then a few days later I was so manic I was yelling at a professor and almost physically fighting him and almost got expelled, then a few days later I was so back to the same depression. When I told her how much damage she did, she quit her job that same day and left the state because she was scared I\u2019d sue and she\u2019d lose her license. After that professor incident, the school made me go to school counseling services and on the first appointment they told me that I didn\u2019t seem like I wanted to be there so they weren\u2019t going to schedule a second appointment. The counselor I\u2019m seeing now (only because my mom\u2019s EAP will pay for 8 appointments a year) told me after like 3 visits that she couldn\u2019t think of much more to do with me and asked if I felt we really needed any more appointments. I\u2019ve had a horrible experience with mental health care Symptoms prevent getting help: with my anxiety and bipolar depression, most the time I either feel too scared to open up to professionals or I could be too depressed to be able to get up and go to an appointment. No matter how much I know for a fact these feelings are uncalled for and only come from the symptoms of my mental illness, it still doesn\u2019t change it so it\u2019s still very hard to actually go get help. Mix that with the poor care I\u2019ve always received and it\u2019s a very nasty combination No matter how much you tell people that going out and getting help will improve their situation, it\u2019s pretty much NEVER that easy and there\u2019s a never ending amount of huge obstacles that are nearly impossible to overcome ", "link_id": "t3_aaoxvt", "time": 1546147256}}

{"eckrh7l": {"text": "Look if talking to your Rudolph plushie is how you process things then that\u2019s just how you handle it and that\u2019s okay. What I want you to ask it though is why you HAVE to presume responsibility for and punish yourself for something that isn\u2019t your fault at all. Like I said I wasn\u2019t there so I don\u2019t know exactly what happened, but from an outside looking in perspective I cannot for the life of me find a single way that you\u2019re the one in the wrong here. From what I\u2019ve seen, the only thing you\u2019ve done wrong this entire time is hurt yourself for someone else\u2019s mistakes. I grew up being horribly abused by my father, then like I said my parents got divorced after an argument about something I did. For the majority of my life I always thought \u201cmaybe if I didn\u2019t do what I did he wouldn\u2019t have beaten me\u201d or \u201cmaybe if I didn\u2019t do what I did they wouldn\u2019t have gotten divorced\u201d  and do you wanna know where that line of thinking got me? It got me to attempt suicide at just 7 years old, it got me locked up in a hospital on suicide watch at just 13 years old only to come out and see my entire family crying because I had gotten into such a dark place and they were never able to do anything to help because I never felt like I could tell them about it because I always thought I was the one who was the problem. Of course many other things had a lot to do with it too, but that line of thinking is a huge reason why I lost basically my entire life to depression and why I\u2019m just now in this last year finally starting to come out of it and realize how much none of it was my fault, none of it was because I\u2019m this horrible person I always made myself out to be, and that I\u2019ve always had so much value and worth I\u2019ve never let myself see just because I was too busy strangling myself to death all because of other people\u2019s mistakes. I don\u2019t know you. I don\u2019t know what happened. But I do know the general mindset you\u2019re coming from. I know how bad it feels. I know how painfully obvious I seems that you are the one and only cause of everything that happened and all the pain it\u2019s caused, and I know it\u2019s just not true no matter how much you say to make yourself believe it. I\u2019ve spent the majority of my life paying trained and educated mental health professionals, and putting so much effort into doing everything I can to fix the toxic programming that was beaten into me, and that seems to have been beaten into you. Due to all of the things that have happened to me in my life, I have made it a point to beg no man for anything, but I\u2019m coming as close as I can to begging you to take the advice of someone who\u2019s been where you\u2019ve been, who\u2019s suffered their entire life because of it, and who\u2019s spent the majority of their live desperately attempting to rebuild their life after the toll that it\u2019s taken on them. Even if you don\u2019t take the perspective that I\u2019ve offered that has been based on years of advice from multiple different trained mental health professionals, I at least ask that you ask your mom or whoever it was who defended you or literally anyone else who was there whether or not you were the one in the wrong there. The absolute worst they can do is say yes and leave you in the same exact position, but they\u2019ll most likely say no and confirm for you that you weren\u2019t the problem. I don\u2019t know you.

Maybe you did something that wasn\u2019t smart or wasn\u2019t right sure, but the person who was yelling was the clear aggressor in the situation and the person who clearly started it all. If they would have been a decent human being and just expressed that they didn\u2019t like this small thing you did then there wouldn\u2019t be a problem but instead they decided to tell and that\u2019s what caused the argument, not whatever you did. On top of all that, when the other person confronted them they were basically confirming that whatever you did either wasn\u2019t wrong or wasn\u2019t worth yelling about so that\u2019s more proof that the person who caused it was the person yelling and not you. And finally, the argument wouldn\u2019t have even started if this person would\u2019ve just accepted what your mom (I assume) said or even just respectfully disagreed, then it would\u2019ve all been done there but instead they decided to continue to be aggressive and escalate the situation into the argument that ruined everything. Like I said, maybe whatever you didn\u2019t wasn\u2019t good, but from what you\u2019ve said there I cannot find a single thing you did to start the argument and I literally cannot find a way any of this is your fault.

Human beings live for a very long time so we\u2019ve got decades to find someone else and if we improve ourselves until we\u2019re truly happy and loving of ourselves then other people will inevitably be drawn to that. You can sit around and ruminate over it and beat yourself up and convince yourself that no one is ever going to love you as much as you want but that\u2019s never going to make you feel better. You just have to force yourself to think positively and make yourself the best you can be. ", "link_id": "t3_a8n7pt", "time": 1545544877}}

For whatever reason, this one time I was tripping and we were playing by chasing each other around the house. I don\u2019t know what happened but out of nowhere she just snapped and her chasing went from playful to extremely violent and aggressive. She chased me all around the house growling and barking at me with all of the hair on her back raised. I went into my room and she followed me in there and tried to back me into a corner and she was growling really angrily and showing all of her teeth. I ran into the hallway so she\u2019d follow me and get out of my room then I turned around and ran back into my room and closed the door as fast as I could so she couldn\u2019t get back in there. She started barking at my door and running into it over and over so hard that I kinda struggled to keep it closed. It was a pretty scary event and I was tripping too so I was terrified. I called my roommate to come get her and she still wouldn\u2019t call down he had to bring her into his room and hold her and completely restrain her from moving until she eventually calmed down. My roommate said he\u2019s never seen her like that he asked me if I hit her or something to make her so angry. I don\u2019t know what happened, I wasn\u2019t being aggressive and I played with her like that all the time with no problem so it definitely had something to do with me tripping.

Then when I was 13 my mom divorced him, which is the only reason I\u2019m still here today, but we had to move into a small rundown trailer because that\u2019s all she could afford while supporting herself and three kids all on her own so I had to leave all of my friends, then at the same time I was realizing I was gay in the extremely homophobic Bible Belt which made me hate myself and the whole combination was almost too much for me to handle. And to top it all off I\u2019ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so every once in a while my brain just decides to shit itself and sometimes it\u2019ll make me feel like the happiest man in the world but most of the time it\u2019ll make me so depressed i can\u2019t even get out of bed and all I can do the entire time is think about how much i want to kill myself to make it stop.

I will be honest though and end this by saying you should take all of this with a grain of salt because while I do have a moderate education in neuroscience I\u2019m nowhere near a professional and classes don\u2019t teach much about lsd and we barely even know how it works at allEdit: I was completely wrong about it producing serotonin look at the replies below ", "link_id": "t3_9yss8u", "time": 1542728595}}
{"ea3sw1i": {"text": "You\u2019re not a douche for not having sex with someone you don\u2019t want to have sex with I don\u2019t see why any of these people are giving you shit for this. Human beings are all hardwired to want to have sex with people they find attractive and not want to have sex with people they find unattractive. We evolved to find certain things/people attractive because they signal good genes  and we evolved to want to have sex with them in an attempt to mix our genes with what we perceive to be good genes to pass on our genetics in an improved way. It\u2019s a scientific fact that I\u2019ve been taught in multiple courses throughout my higher education. Aside from that, you are literally never once obligated to have sex with anyone who you don\u2019t want to have sex with. If you don\u2019t consent to having sex, it\u2019s rape. If you don\u2019t want to have sex with someone just say no and if they have a problem with that then that\u2019s pretty weird and rapey so you need to avoid them like the plague. Sex is all about consent and all about making sure both people get what they want out of it and everyone here insulting you is just a creep who\u2019s bitter about getting turned down by people in their lives.

{"ea3qujx": {"text": "SSRI\u2019s work by keeping serotonin from being absorbed immediately once it goes into the synapse so that it ends up pooling up in there so there\u2019s eventually more serotonin in the brain to help fight off the depression. LSD essentially makes the brain fire off a metric shit ton of serotonin, and if an SSRI is keeping it from being absorbed then it\u2019s just pooling up instead of being absorbed so it can\u2019t work. Meanwhile Wellbutrin works by doing the same thing to dopamine and norepinephrine instead of serotonin, and LSD doesn\u2019t make anywhere near as much of those so it might lessen the trip but not by very much. Make sure your friend is extremely careful mixing LSD with an SSRI because it would take a lot to have the same effect and having too much serotonin in the brain is extremely toxic and causes serotonin syndrome which could very easily and quickly lead to a coma or death. I ended up getting serotonin syndrome once from mixing an SSRI with adderall and taking a giant dab to calm me down from the combination. It was easily one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life and it\u2019s probably in the top 3 worst feelings I\u2019ve ever had so I\u2019d advise against mixing the two to be safe ", "link_id": "t3_9yss8u", "time": 1542726129}}
