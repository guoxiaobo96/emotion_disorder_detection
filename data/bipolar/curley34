Thats what made me not like her.Now to address your points. 1. Comedians offend people for a living. If she can't take people calling her fat, she's in the wrong business. Also, calling someone fat is not sexist.2. Again you say someone criticizing her jokes is sexist. This discredits all female comedians because you think that they shouldn't be criticized because it would be sexist. Also who says that this same group doesn't dislike Judd Apatow. All the hate for Amy Schumer is out right now because she just bombed on Netflix. 3. I have never personally heard people say she can't joke about her vagina because dick jokes are looked down upon, so I can't really address that. But I can comment on when you say that a drawing of a dick is funny. Comedy is subjective, I don't find dick or vagina jokes funny, but thats just me and I don't care if someone does find them funny. In conclusion, don't blame everything on sexism because that invalidates any criticism of any female comedian. You may like Amy Schumer and thats fine, but the majority of people on reddit don't. You shouldn't force someone to like something they don't.P.S. Sorry for the dissertation I wrote, I just wanted to give you a straight answer. ", "link_id": "t3_698vbf", "time": 1493920347}}
