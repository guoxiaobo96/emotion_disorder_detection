This particular thread has me second guessing my beliefs on spanking as so many say it\u2019s straight up abuse and an absolute no go.First off, I don\u2019t have kids. Would love one but it\u2019s complicated. I don\u2019t agree with spanking for minor things but I was raised that severe actions deserve severe consequences. We were not hit ever but an occasional swat on the butt or hand wasn\u2019t unheard of. However my cousin (age 2 at the time) bit me and made me bleed. I (age 5 at the time) was overall okay I guess but bleeding none the less. My dad went to spank my cousin for it and my uncle is highly against spanking. They almost fist fought over it. To my knowledge my dad would not have \u201cbeat\u201d my cousin and my uncle had no intentions of intervening between cousin and I but I dunno... so who in that situation was more justified? Would you consider my dad a just no based on his actions or my uncle a just no for not punishing his child for biting in a manner acceptable to him? I\u2019m genuinely torn because my uncle has become an extremely just no in my adult life where my dad has always been very much a just yes dad/FIL/grandpa... and just to put it out there, my dad has never felt the need to spank any grandkid for any reason because siblings step in and punish in their own way.

Mania is just as terrible as depression for a bipolar person. Sure manic episodes are when we\u2019re fun and high energy and want to do everything and anything, but it\u2019s also when finances are destroyed, cheating occurs, anger explodes, so on... if you want a happy and healthy relationship you need to back off if you\u2019re not married. Give her some breathing room. Support her by just being there when she\u2019s ready and listening.

{"eq74km2": {"text": "I am the bipolar SO and I\u2019ve come to realize you have to choose very wisely those you can trust and those you cannot to share your mental illness diagnosis with. My husband never talks to anyone about my bipolar but just rather the problems he\u2019s facing with me. He doesn\u2019t bring up issues we\u2019re having as if they are related to my illness but rather just in a light of everyone struggles sometimes and he needs help to work through it. I\u2019d maybe suggest doing the same. My having bipolar doesn\u2019t necessarily dictate who I am and what I\u2019m going through, it just exacerbates already existing problems. Therefore him going to friends and family is no longer \u201cmy wife is bipolar and being \u2018crazy\u2019\u201d but \u201chey wife is not being entirely the good person she\u2019s capable of and I need some help coping\u201d. You don\u2019t have to classify an illness to share that you\u2019re having problems, and having bipolar doesn\u2019t necessarily excuse bad behavior. I\u2019m still human and even without the diagnosis there\u2019d likely be problems. Saying it\u2019s all because I have bipolar is putting it in a \u201cblack and white\u201d mentality.

However I wanted to tell you that my husband and I have been married over 11 years now and together about 13 or 14. It\u2019s been a struggle and we\u2019ve had a lot of hard times. Some of it has been my fault, some his, some mutual fault. I have been stable more often than not through the years and whenever I\u2019m \u201coff\u201d I always seek out help immediately. We\u2019ve both only started therapy last year when things got super difficult in our relationship. I don\u2019t know what goes on in my husband\u2019s sessions but I do know the combined effort from both of us to better ourselves and the way we handle hard moments between us has made a world of difference. I guess my point is, it\u2019s a joint effort. Your therapist feeling \u201csad\u201d for you may seem off putting, but I\u2019m on the bipolar side and my therapist has said that to me too. Relationships of this nature are hard on both parties. My husband isn\u2019t always perfect at helping me through my more difficult times and I\u2019m sure as hell not great for him all the time. However we\u2019ve communicated and we do therapy not only separate but together as well and we\u2019ve made it this far. It can be done. I love my husband with all my heart and he loves me with all his. If both parties are trying their damnedest then it\u2019s well worth it. I hope you can find a more fitting therapist for your needs.

{"en1a6b7": {"text": "I\u2019m sorry for your struggles. I can somewhat relate. We tried for about a year using progesterone/clomid combo. After a chemical pregnancy my husband basically said he never wanted kids/was just going through with it all for me. Three months of intensive therapy and grieving and we were finally in a place to discuss what all we\u2019d been through. He opened up and said he does want kids and only part of him is \u201cdoing it just for me\u201d, and that he just didn\u2019t like the previous RE or the options he gave. We decided to see a new RE. Had a consultation with him this past Monday and a couples therapy appt immediately following. All in all we feel much more comfortable and on the same page. My husband hates the idea of IUI and we\u2019re both against IVF. The first RE was basically trying to rush us straight to IUI even though we wanted to try TMI. This RE basically said we needed to do what we are comfortable with as a couple and slowly work towards IUI if things aren\u2019t going the way we want. It was a huge relief to my husband to find an RE that didn\u2019t make us feel as though IUI was the only way it\u2019d ever happen for us. Because of our personal circumstances the RE felt comfortable letting us take all the time we want to try MTI. All in all, I think what I\u2019m trying to say is, for men (or at least my husband) the whole process can be scarier than to us women who have accepted and are willing to do whatever it takes. All my husband needed was to know that he could move at his own pace and call the shots. I\u2019m a control freak and this was a hard thing for me to let him have the say on, but I\u2019m so much more hopeful now that I\u2019ve let him call the shots on when and what will happen.

{"eh6erw6": {"text": "Typical disclaimer: not a doctor.I wouldn\u2019t jump to the conclusion of PCOS based on what you\u2019ve said. However every woman is different and there is no \u201ctypical symptom\u201d to it. I\u2019ve been reading on here and some things women say they\u2019re experiencing are symptoms I\u2019ve never had nor even knew were PCOS related. I\u2019ll give you a synopsis of my experience and try and keep it short...I went about two years without a period at all and no irregular discharge. That alone led to an ultrasound to see if I had PCOS. The ultrasound showed many cysts therefore the PCOS was confirmed. I took birth control for about eight years and had regulars periods that whole time. PCOS for me has never been painful except one time, not confirmed, I think a cyst popped and it was excruciating. I only recently got put on metformin for it, as in the past like three weeks. My obgyn said there\u2019s no direct link showing it\u2019s for certain even helpful. However he said it also can\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s mainly used in cases of insulin resistance and after blood work showed I had that I decided to go ahead and start taking it. The only symptoms I experience from it other than lack of periods are excessive hair and sometimes breakouts. I wouldn\u2019t particularly go on birth control or stay on it but it can cause major issues to go long lengths of time with no periods. If you have bleeding at all you\u2019re likely fine and birth control is only necessary if you feel it is. Any period is better than no period. Birth control will not necessarily stop symptoms, as I said, eight or nine years of it and the only thing that changed for me was I suddenly had periods again. All that said, do whatever makes you feel better about your situation. PCOS is not life threatening and as it sounds like you don\u2019t plan on any more kids you\u2019re fine. Diet and exercise may help more with some of your issues than anything else. Metformin also doesn\u2019t always help in weight loss but once again it doesn\u2019t hurt either. Hope you get the answers you\u2019re looking for from your dr. Best of luck!", "link_id": "t3_au8snr", "time": 1551022156}}

You may also want to just google it and find medical sights with information so you are informed. Do not watch videos on YouTube that imply the person is having an \u201cepisode\u201d while filming. A lot of those are not accurate to day to day life of someone and may give you the wrong impression.

It covers a wide spectrum of people with the illness and what their loved ones are dealing with. That reddit needs to be taken with a grain of salt, though. Not everyone on there is well informed as to what they are dealing with or how to cope. Maybe try posting this there though and see what some of them have to say. Therapy and med management are extremely important to someone with bipolar. If she is not receiving one or preferably both, then you have a long road of the same shit you\u2019re dealing with. You also can\u2019t force someone to do those. It\u2019s a fine line to walk of being supportive and understanding while also being realistic of what you can manage.

I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re at a loss and I\u2019m sorry that you two have a child that may be suffering as well. I am bipolar. My husband is not. We\u2019ve been married ten years. We have put each other through some of the toughest spots in life. I\u2019ve been at fault and he\u2019s been at fault. The one thing we had in common is the want to get help when things go too far. You\u2019re only one person. You\u2019re important too. You can\u2019t lose sight of your own self worth trying to help her. This year I had to enter an outpatient psychiatric program. I wasn\u2019t quite to the point of hospitalization, but I was fast approaching. My husband stood by me up to and during all this. He was encouraging and sympathetic. He lost himself trying to keep my head above water though. However, because I was taking care of my mental health he realized he may need to start doing the same. Now we both see a therapist and a psychiatrist. We learned that if one of us is drowning the other can\u2019t dive in to help without risking drowning as well. We can only throw in the life preserver and shout instructions and hope for the best. I think you\u2019re at that point. Just do as much as you can for her from a safe distance and try and help her help herself. If she\u2019s not willing to work through things, that\u2019s not your fault. She has to want help to be able to receive help. I can\u2019t imagine how it feels to think it\u2019s time to run from the one person you love more than anything... my heart breaks for you.

I\u2019m no expert but I\u2019ve had plenty of experts tell me that diagnosing before early twenties is very difficult. As a teen, even a late teen, you\u2019re experiencing emotions stronger and sense of self worth very differently than you may as you get older. Don\u2019t focus on being diagnosed. Instead tell your dr when meds aren\u2019t being as effective as you want. Keep a mood chart, track symptoms that you\u2019re experiencing; whether they may relate to one diagnosis or another isn\u2019t important. One symptom can come from a myriad of diagnoses. Stay focused on getting better, not getting diagnosed. It took several meds to find what worked for me. When I was fifteen they said I was depressed, it wasn\u2019t until about 21 or 22 that they decided I was bipolar. It was a struggle for me because I wasn\u2019t aware of myself and I didn\u2019t know what to tell the dr. I had no family support and didn\u2019t know that what I was experiencing wasn\u2019t just who I was. If nothing else, at least you\u2019re recognizing a problem and reaching out. That alone is amazing. Keep at it.", "link_id": "t3_9764sp", "time": 1534230416}}

It never hurts to get a second opinion though, log your moods on a mood chart (check out the App Store, there\u2019s a ton of apps for it), note symptoms of both depression and mania, and then take that with you to the dr and see what they say based off what you tell them and the information you track.

During the mania I was always on the go, had excessive energy, didn\u2019t need to sleep, insatiable sexually, made irrational decisions... these were the biggest factors for both for me. Then comes the length of time. If your symptoms of either don\u2019t last 5-7 days or longer in either direction than you may have another diagnoses. Also, I can\u2019t remember which one, but the difference in which bipolar type you have is based upon whether you are full blown manic or just hypo-manic. But the length of time would still be the same. My therapist suggests if you question your diagnosis to keep a mood diary. You can find apps to do this with.

I was hyper sexual, full of love and devotion, attentive, generous in just about every way, but I was also manic. The meds put an end to all that. I forced myself most of the time to be intimate after meds. I forced myself to endure through cuddling and having a clingy husband... I basically knew deep down somewhere that my husband was/is my everything. We fought, I hated, we barely had sex... but he stuck through all that for a very, VERY, long time. Ten years of marriage celebrated this year. I\u2019m much better after finally changing my meds last year as far as our relationship is concerned.
