I ran upstairs, which was dark, to check for people hiding and in my dad\u2019s den I heard a very distinct growl, like a dog\u2019s growl. It gave me goosebumps on the back of my head.

A ballerina music box my great-grandma gave me would turn on in the middle of the night, despite the switch being in the \u201coff\u201d position.

Have a support system in place, be it partner, family or friends, who can help out during those first few months. Honestly once the baby is there, your body kind of adjusts to the baby\u2019s schedule, especially if you\u2019re breastfeeding/pumping.

My husband also shouldered a lot of the responsibility whenever he could. Prepare yourself to delegate tasks to others when you feel overwhelmed (a difficult endeavor!) In conclusion: meds, communication with your doctor(s) about what you\u2019re feeling, allowing others to step in and help when needed, and reassuring yourself that you\u2019ll adjust to the baby\u2019s schedule once he/she is here!
