U of I and other state schools really didn\u2019t try to give you that home feeling like Mizzou does. Then the private schools like Northwestern were just stuck up in my opinion (although they\u2019ve earned that I guess.) The town has tons of things to do other than get drunk all the time, but there\u2019s definitely parties to find when that\u2019s what you want to do. Most if not all of the major programs are really solid and will give you the education you need. I think the hardest part of being from a town that doesn\u2019t have a lot of Mizzou grads is unless you plan on moving to KC or STL you will not live in the same town as the friends you make in college. A lot of Mizzou students are from those cities and go right back after they graduate.

I got on an anti-depressant. My brain only wants to kill itself when I am lost in my trauma or I decide I'm worthless (also rooted in trauma.) Yes, I think my healthy brain never wants to kill itself. If suicide was natural and healthy-thinking, I don't see how the human race could be where it is today. Every mammal is built for survival.

{"dw6fga2": {"text": "How long ago was the last assault? That can put things into prospective. It took 4 years after my last assault for me to be diagnosed with PTSD. I had many of the same behaviors as you. I just saw them as coping mechanisms. But after a year or two some of them started to go away and some still lingered. I stopped wanting to have casual sex, but I still had to get up multiple times a night a check the locks on my house. I was still detached during sex even though I was now with a partner I loved. When it lingers for a long time, that's a sign that it's something more than initial coping. But whether it is or isn't ptsd, I urge you to get counseling and as soon as you can. It will help you develop healthier coping mechanisms and help you heal quite a bit. I am a changed person after finding a therapist I clicked with. Please give it a shot.
