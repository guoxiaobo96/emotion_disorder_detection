{"d6yko6o": {"text": "The bugs in the first picture, I can't make out. But, if I had to guess, they're weevils. I work at a pet store, and we regularly get them in open bulk food bins. They are harmless, but can be a nuisance.  I usually freeze all my food (even pre-bagged can have them) for a few days before opening it and using it. The beetles are usually what you see first, but there are also moths that leave spiderweb like residue in food containers. People can also get them in their homes.The bugs in the second picture look like rodent mites. My rats have gotten them before. They're fairly common and all rodents technically have them in small amounts, but they do bloom during times of stress and sickness (or when more are introduced on bedding, food, new toys, etc). Wash/toss all bedding items, put out new food/wooden toys and make sure all hard plastic items have been washed and sanitized. Put any recently purchased food, bedding and wooden accessories in the freezer for 24-48 hours. This will rule out any new invaders.  As for treatment of the mice themselves, I'm not sure how to approach it. My rats are a lot bigger and easier to dose medication for. I would suggest looking for a vet near you that is able to recommend a remedy for such a small creature or specializes in rodents. I don't recommend then spray topical insecticides you find in pet stores. Mice/rodents regularly groom themselves, and should they ingest any chemicals, it may make them sick. Hope this helps, even if it's just a little! Best of luck.       ", "link_id": "t3_4zqtjq", "time": 1472281350}}

I have a short fuse sometimes and snap at my fianc\u00e9 for no good reason. I have more bad than good days, lately and it's so frustrating when I start to feel bad for feeling bad. Between the absolute gutting loneliness that I feel I have no right feeling, and the crippling sadness that hits like a tidal wave out of nowhere, I've spent many a day hyperventilating on my bathroom floor, leaning over the toilet because I was breathing/crying so hard that I felt nauseous... I struggle with articulating my feelings to my fianc\u00e9, because it's so hard to explain how I can feel so empty when we're starting a life together. I have a major loss of libido. That's also hard to explain... Lately it seems as though when it's not one thing, it's another. I feel like a loser for leaving a good paying job because it was robbing me of my confidence, happiness and soul, even though everyone has told me I made the right choice. I'm unbelievably self conscious... I feel like a burden to everyone and hate being given gifts because I feel as though I do not deserve to receive them. I can't do college. I've tried 3 times. I stay interested for maybe a month and then it goes downhill until I just stop going altogether. The only thing that makes me smile lately are my spiders, making jewelry and being in the forest.

The best advice I've ever received is that if you have a lot of pink pigmentation in your skin, choose a shade of red lipstick with blue hues in it. It will be less likely to clash with your skin and will look more natural. Lip liner! It will help you reduce it feathering on the edges of your lips and help it stay on them. You can go with a lip liner close to the shade of your lip, clear or a red similar to the one you're wearing. Red liner, of course, will make the color pop more. :) Also, matte lipsticks tend to have better wear, Russian Red is matte and the other two I mentioned are glossy. Hope this helps!!Another two of my favorite red shades are Sephoras Cortisane (R02, this is a darker red, soo beautiful!) and The Red (R04).

I don't mean it was horrible and I would never get a piercing done again, I think since it was closer to my nose, it made my eyes water and pinched a bit more.We all handle pain differently, and to me piercing is an entirely different type of pain. Research it well and get reviews on a lot of your areas popular tattoo/piercing parlors. Make sure the piercer is experienced and professional and that everything is sterilized. I feel like the pain of the procedure is determined by the ease at which the piercer puts you, and how comfortable you are with your decision. Make sure the person doing it talks you through it and seems excited to do it. I'm sure you will be told to take a deep breath and exhale it strongly (this helps a lot for me). For another comparison of the pain, stubbing your toe is probably going to be more intense of a pain than getting pierced. It's over much quicker.In terms of the piercing location choice, I think you'd look great with a nose hoop, as well as a labret. Hope this helps!
