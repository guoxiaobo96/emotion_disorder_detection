He would always comfort me when I was crying but he never protected me from her because he \"didn't know\" and my mom \"would do anything for me.\" I was the only one of my siblings that was physically abused.She admitted what she had done after I grew up, but never expressed remorse. My father says he doesn't condone her actions but has done shit about it. They're married. She openly says I deserved it. He is a coward. Now that he knows, and he doesn't confront her or try to make things right... I see him as just as bad as her now. I'm working up the courage to go no contact. It kills me that my dad, my best friend, values peace with his cunt of a wife more than my wellbeing. Thank you for doing the right thing. When I read your first post I got chills, it is so similar to my own story. But yours can be happy at least. Yes, your family is falling apart, and this might not seem like a happy ending, but your family was destroyed a long time ago when your wife and son tortured your poor daughter for years.

Literally every reading I've done in the past about him has included this card, and I've come to associate this specific card and reversal with him. Which probably isn't a great sign, but the heart wants what it wants :(Challenge: Reversed 3 of Swords. The negative aspects of this already negative card signify the confusion and infatuation aspect of this relationship. There is absolutely no clarity on where we stand and it drives me crazy. Past: Reversed Devil. Blindness, weakness, feeling chained... Yep, it was a lot worse in the past. I did this reading because I had moved on from him and then the other night things became confused again.Future: Reversed 4 of Wands. This card confuses me. The traditional Rider Waite interpretation indicates that the meaning is the same whether its reversed or upright, but that's far too positive a card for me to feel comfortable. It indicates happiness, but maybe out of reach?Subconscious:Reversed 2 of Cups. Conflict, novelty, false hope. The promise of love unfulfilled. That's certainly on my mind. Aspiration: Reversed Star. Arrogance, impotence. Maybe the ability to guide myself out of this tangle of illusory emotions?Advice/Querent: King of Swords. Clarity, authority. I need to take control over my emotions and get through this with logic. External: Queen of Wands. Female empowerment, creativity, action. I honestly don't know what this one means in this situation.Hopes/Fears: Hermit. Solitude, wisdom, but also loneliness. I want to be independent but I am afraid of being alone.
