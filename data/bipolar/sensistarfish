{"ew7jsbg": {"text": "Second-trimester abortion is an important component of comprehensive women\u2019s health care, and women seek termination later in pregnancy for a variety of medical and social reasons. Circumstances that can lead to second-trimester abortion include delays in suspecting and testing for pregnancy, delay in obtaining insurance or other funding, and delay in obtaining referral, as well as difficulties in locating and traveling to a provider (5). Poverty, lower education level, and having multiple disruptive life events, have been associated with higher rates of seeking second-trimester abortion (3). In addition, major anatomic or genetic anomalies may be detected in the fetus in the second trimester and women may choose to terminate their pregnancies (47\u201395%) (6\u20138). The identification of major anatomic or genetic anomalies in the fetus through screening and diagnostic testing most commonly occurs in the second trimester, although first-trimester screening and chorionic villus sampling can enable first-trimester diagnosis of aneuploidy. Some obstetric and medical indications for second-trimester termination include preeclampsia and preterm premature rupture of membranes, among other conditions. Additional indications for uterine evacuation in the second trimester are pregnancy failure before 20 weeks of gestation and fetal demise. In 2005, the U.S. fetal mortality rate was 6.22 fetal deaths at 20 weeks of gestation or more per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths, and this rate was higher for teenagers; women aged 35 years and older; and among non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and American Indian or Alaska Native women (9).No woman deserves to be forced to continue a pregnancy for any of these reasons.

Sorry I don\u2019t use measurements. It\u2019s how I do. Fry half a pound of chopped bacon in the bottom of your soup pot, then remove it. Shuck your corn and slice off the kernels in the meantime.

In a separate bowl or a mason jar, dump in 3 tablespoons of flour, salt, and pepper, and mix with 4 tablespoons of milk, enough to make a \u201cslurry\u201d consistency. You\u2019re going to pour this mixture into the soup while it is simmering. Then you just let it bubble away while the flour thickens the broth for maybe...5 minutes.

The discussions revolve around the content of the material they are presented with. We are all willing to have meaningful conversations about a shared pleasure, and are respectful of differing viewpoints. Here, and more recently I\u2019ve noticed, it\u2019s just a ton of complaining about the writing, storylines, and acting. That\u2019s the farthest thing from captivating.

We know nothing of the man's history of crime, yet the pure accusation that he raped a handmaid, and caused her miscarriage, is enough to bring him to his demise. There's no trial, there's no testimony, just Aunt Lydia professing that he's a rapist, then the handmaids go wild, pushing the oppression onto someone appropriate, even though there is normalized rape and oppression of women all around them every day.

We are angry at who the media (the government of Gilead) tells us to be angry at, we are angry at who we are told it's appropriate to be angry with. *edit: furthermore, I feel that the salvaging (mostly in the tv series) is a metaphor for the stage that is social media. It's a meeting place for news and gathering together. It's here where Offred learns from Janine that Moira was sent to the colonies and is dead. Offred mentions that it's one of the only times that the handmaids can share any news, through whispered messages.

I find a lot of people there should be getting professional therapy and help instead of using Reddit to bolster their beliefs. It's a lot of arm chair psychology. I recently posted a story about my childhood with the correct flair for sexual abuse, and it was deleted because it was \"too graphic\" and \"might trigger someone.\" Isn't that what abuse is? It's triggering and sometimes graphic. It was meant to be a safe space and can be for many people, but real stories of abuse get removed? I was told I needed to edit my story to be less harsh. I've been told that all my life, and have many hours of therapy behind me telling me to do the exact opposite. I finally got what other people were saying about the sub, it can be great, but it also can be a place where everyone whines about their not narcissistic parents, while not doing anything real to change their situation.

After years of dating, and finally moving into our first home together, I was finally able to convince him to see a doctor for extreme shoulder and neck pain. A simple MRI revealed that he suffers from a condition called chiari malformation. His brain stem was slowly sinking into his spinal column, causing pain, numbness in his extremities, and loss of vision. His condition was so severe that it required immediate brain surgery to keep him alive. The first appointment with a neurologist confirmed that it was caused by a congenital birth defect. Instead of being there for her son, she took the opportunity to get sympathy for what she had done wrong during her pregnancy, which included \"drinking until he was the size of a grapefruit.\" The surgery was extensive and incredibly painful. His recovery was expected to last over a year. She never stopped by to help me during that time, meanwhile I was his 24 hour nurse, while juggling an autistic child. She was angry that I wanted him in his own home instead of at her house, and punished me by refusing to give me a single bit of help. ", "link_id": "t3_5j2jfh", "time": 1482117012}}

I find it really hard to complain about how hard it was for me to see someone I love going through what he did, when the pain after surgery was so unbearable he was asking me to let him die. He doesn't remember most of what happened in the hospital, so there is a disconnect from what he was going through and what I was seeing. we just take every day as we can. There will be frustrating times, and there will be times that we both feel so lucky to have each other.", "link_id": "t3_16cp94", "time": 1357875057}}

He gets intense head rushes and tunnel vision, and then has an episode of migraines shortly thereafter. The procedure is called decompression surgery. They bore a moon shaped hole into the skull, and then put a patch in the dura (the membrane that surrounds the brain) to make more room for the tonsils.

{"c6b9zku": {"text": "Good for you. I was making a bi-weekly stop at the grocery store last week when a man who seemed a little lost kept approaching strangers as they passed by telling them about the lord, and how he had been saved, and that's why he is here today, because Jesus died for our sins. An old couple who seemed to know him had dismissed his approach to rejoice in the light of the lord, and passed by with a \"see you at church Floyd!\" I felt very uncomfortable as he approached the checkout directly behind me, and he asked a stranger if they were a christian. My face flushed as I eavesdropped on their conversation, and as I placed my items on the conveyor belt, I dreaded that he would come to me and ask me about my faith in the lord, as I am an atheist, and I was afraid as to what I should tell him. This man was elderly, and I knew that my confession as an heathen would scare him, and likely ruin his day. I stayed quiet and avoided eye contact, until the clerk finished my transaction and I began to walk away. It was then that I heard the cashier say \"4 and some change,\"  and he said, \"I only have about three dollars, you best put these two cans of tuna back.\"  I whipped my cart around, and told the cashier to put them back on his order, and grabbed a dollar from my purse (which I normally wouldn't have as I don't usually carry cash.) I stole a glance at his cart, he had four cans of tuna and a loaf of cheap bread and that was it. I said \"I wouldn't want you to miss out on a tuna sandwich!\" The kicker is, he was too senile to notice I had even payed for his goods, and never even thanked me. Yet, I walked out of that store knowing that I had done something for this man. Though he will never realize it, I walked away knowing that I had done the right thing...because I wanted to, because I knew it was right. The woman who claimed to be a christian when he asked, cooed when I made the gesture, but never offered a single penny. It's good to be human, and the best deeds are done when nobody really knows what you've done for them.", "link_id": "t3_108a46", "time": 1348204959}}
