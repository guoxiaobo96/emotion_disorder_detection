I'd like to think it was only because of bipolar but hobestly it has to be something like 50% BPD and 50% my conscious choice.Look for a PDOC if you don't have one already. Try to find the right medication with them. It took a while for me to find the right Doctor for me but I've been going to my current one for 10 years right now. We get each other.Try yo get a book or two about bipolar, they help a lot in the beginning when it's all really New and you don't know your patterns, triggers and what things are The disease and what things are your doing or personality.Get therapy if you can. It helps a lot if you apply yourself in it.Take care of your body. Do some exercise, eat well, try to sleep at least 8 hours each night.And besides all that what worked best for me and took a while to understand was having a structured life. Create a schedule for yourself. With all your duties with others and yourself. If you know what you need to do and where you need to be at any time of the day, when your mood isn't good, it's one less problem that you don't have to think about.I have no words for how long it took me to understand that last part and how much it helps me over the years.You are NOT ALONE.

And decides, still on the bus, that I had to have a birthday party this sunday, the 5th.But today I was talking with my boas about when I would get my salary for this month. My country law orders that it has to be until the 5th working day of the month. And she told me that she paid my January salary on december 16th.Woah.I went back to our whatsapp conversation history and our e-mail exchanges and didn't find anything about this. She indeed paid me the value I earn each month. But I didn't realize it was the money I would normaly get on the next month. I thought it was some extra money for some extra work I had on december since a coworker went on vacations and I also had to do her job until she comes back.I got really angry at my boss. I don't want no early money. I'm not good with money, even more when I'm as hypomanic as I am right now. I want to quit so bad. She knows her craft but it is a really small business and she isn't a good manager. She's a labour and social security lawyer that gives classes and does some audits. She's also my aunt. And calle my mom when she has some problemas with my work...So long story short I'll get no work money on this month. Yay. I spent most of it during the trip. Thinking that it was extra. and that I would get my salary on the start of the month as it was not clear what was happening. ughSo some hours ago I decided to cancel the party. My plan was to do something that isn't expensive, but planning a party is another chore that I don't need in my life right now. I'll probably go to the same place that I go every saturday with my friends. It'll be better, easier and more fun  :)", "link_id": "t3_ejanf7", "time": 1578101054}}

Both of them thought that I'm better than I was one month ago. Just finished my second week of this semester at college. I changed one of the classes to another professor my friends recommended, and liked his class and style better. The only downside is the schedule, this class is at night and starts 100 minutes later. I also went to the \"N\u00facleo de Pr\u00e1tica Jur\u00eddica\". It's another part of one of the classes I took this semester. The class is called something like \"Judicial Practice\". In it we will have to help persons that go there and need legal advice but can't afford a lawyer. We also have to go to the court and watch at least 8 hours of hearings during the semester, write a repport about them and take the report to the college. Besides those two parts I will have to pass the actual class. In it, each student gets a hypothetical private law case. And will write, print and take on specific dates all the petitions of that case. (I don't know the exact translation for english). So, say your case is about a car crash, and one of the parties involved wants financial compensations. The student will write the first petition, by the person that starts said Judicial Action (the one that wants the money). Some time later the same student will write another petition by the other person involved in the car crash, the one that doesn't wants to pay the money. That petitiom will counter the arguments brought by the first petition, and raise their own. Some time later the same student will write the judicial sentence, like if the student is the Judge of the case. This work will be 60% of the grade. The other 40% will be a regular exam. In it we will just write a petition. Here in Brazil, we have something like the BAR association. To work as a lawyer, after graduating from law school, the students have to pass an exam. It has two phases. One of them is just a exam like the SATs with 100 multiple choice questions. In the second phase, the student will have to choose one of the branches of the Law. (Like private law, criminal law, constitucional law, tax law, etc). And the student will have to write some petitions pertaining to that branch about a hypothetical case. It is very hard, most of the students take special preparatory classes for it. I'm very motivated overall. Things are getting better, and I'm trying to ensure that they keep going in this direction. edit: spelling", "link_id": "t3_97zjjl", "time": 1534683944}}

It was more research focused. I know it will be hard to do all that and pass the other classes. But I know that I can do it if I actually really try to do it.

It's so close that I just have to cross the street from my new building back door. I heard 3 or 4 shots. I've never heard gunshots in person, so close, in real life. I asked some nearby persons that if that sound was of gunfire. They confirmed. Some ran to the other way. When I realized what actually happened it was over. Got pretty nervous, and eventually left by another exit. I found out later that someone was being robbed, a \"municipal guard\" intervened, and was shot by the robber. Municipal guards work for the City, they don't use lethal weapons, and mostly just help with \"easy stuff\". One saved my ass one time I got really hurt by doing more exercise than I should. He helped me call my sister that took me to a hospital. Then we have the Military Police, those are the classic cops that stay on the streets or in their police cars. They carry guns and do most of the \"fighting\". There is also the detective session of the police, called \"civil police\". They work together with the military cops. Then we have the Federal Police. Something like the FBI, and that cover some kinds of crimes. Specially political corruption.Tonight my step father told me another person was killed in our neighbourhood. This time it was a private security guard.It's 3:52 AM.

I need to consolidate all my notes in the same place, didn't get to that yet. I hurt my hip recently so I should carry minimum weight. My laptop is old and pretty heavy.

It's a book with the most important written laws and codes (Our system is much more written law based than the common law, that focus more on precedents, jurisprudence, etc). I don't need to take this book to every class. Another problem is that the library doesn't have books about some subjects that are up to date. Our legislators love to change the law so they get old fast. Some books are even from 2009 or earlier. I've bought two books this semester, but those exams already happened. Our law books, where authors write about the law, jurisprudence, and it's theories are pretty heavy too. Most of them have more than a thousand pages. It's not smart carrying one of those and also the Vade Meccum. I did it some days earlier and it got pretty heavy.Maybe I wrote a lot. My next midterm is the day after tomorrow.

I kind of know that pattern you're in from my personal experience. When depressed I run away from all my commitments with myself and others. Because of that I suffer the consequences and my mood deteriorates. When I snap out of it I realize what a shitty thing I did for months straight and then try to run against the clock to compensate the consequences of my errors. This phase gives me extreme anxiety and makes it really hard to sleep more than 6 hours. Or actually stick with all the new plans I make. Eg: When depressed I stop doing any physical activity and just stay home at my computer watching movies and other stuff. When I stop being so depressed I want to 'do all the things' and start doing brisk walks every single day during a much longer time and longer distance than a reasonable sedentary person would do.

I moved to another neighborhood but still go to the same church for mass on Sundays. I found out about a nearby church yesterday but their website said they only do confessions on weekdays.I talk with a priest of the \"old\" church I still go on for mass. Mostly via whatsapp. Well, long story short on the Thursday I went to a snooker bar with an old friend that was shortly in town and now is going back to his job abroad (in Canada). I went early there and he told me some other friends from highschool would go there that night. It took a while but they arrived. I didn't want to stay up until 4 a.m. but I haven't seen some of them in over a year. One of the friends I consider my close friends went too. We spent much time together during our senior year in High School. Long story short I went to the bar. Played a game of snooker (accidentally shot the white ball into the hole and lost).Got a haircut Thursday morning. It wasn't great but it was for free (coupon).I also have my hip hurt so I should keep my brisk walking to a minimum. That's hard when I'm hypomanic and need to lose more than 10 kilos. In the bar there were nowhere to seat so we just kept talking standing up and drinking. When I went there I convinced myself I shouldnt drink alcohol. I stayed strong until about 2am. I said some stupid stuff and felt I made the conversation 'darker'. We were having fun and making fun of ewch other and current events. But I haven't had this kind of conversation in a while so I felt I kind of made a 'wrong conversation move'. And my self doubt kicked in and I felt sad and anxious. One of them lighted a cigarette. I started missing smoking one of those. Managed to not ask for one. Or make any comment about it.I didn't plan to drink last night but just before going home I caught an opportunity and drank one glass of beer. I like it but don't drink often. I thought I could take a sleeping medicine to help me sleep, but I knew that if I drank I couldn't take the pill.About 2, 2:30 am I called an Uber abd went home. Didn't sleep right when I got home. Made some camomile tea and browsed the internet. A bad choice, but at least friday was a national holiday.Saturday I went to my old aparapartment ans packed in boxes a lot of stuff that's still there. Afterwards I ate pizza and went to the church. Around 9pm. It was a really beautiful and cathartic experience. Today, easter Sunday I went to the mass. Felt really good. Like there is something bigger than myself that is takijg care and helping me find the right path for my life.Wow this post got really big. Ran out of my camomile tea so I will now take a hot bath and try to think about positive and calming things.Thanks guys.

I was diagnosed with bipolar like when I was 15. My dad offered me to go live with him for a while. He helped me A LOT. Like, materially and motivating me. He always thought I shouldn't think less of myself because of my disorder, that I could have a 99% normal life, as long as I did the right things. I was quite depressed at the time. I was weighting 105,700kg. The most heavy I have recorded. I went on to 92kg or so. I exercized every single day, ate salads before lunch and soup before diner. I was still in high school, and when I was living with my mom I skipped classes. When I was living with my dad, he drove me every day to the door of the school and waited until I got in. He woke me up in the mornings so I didn't miss my morning brisk walk. I lost weight. My grades went up (I normally am a good student, people call me smart, but I'm just good at paying attention when I want to). I got more in touch with my friends. I stayed with him about during a year. In my class photos in the year before and after the difference is astounding. I look much more healthy, energetic, and hopeful, close to my friends and stuff.I know life is hard, but in the end the work we put into it pays off a lot more than it seems like.Right now I'm having trouble getting enough sleep.

{"dfceibe": {"text": "I think at first maybe the ones who care about you are worried and afraid of the whole thing. They will react in some way that won't look like they care. But with time, the ones who are really there for you will understand that you have an illness like any other illness. Another thing. This may sound condenscending, but it really helps. Try to educate yourself on the matter. There are plenty of good books out there in english, that are more like manuals on how to cope and have a good life with bipolar. The one I'm reading right now is called \"the bipolar workbook - tools for controlling your mood swings\" by Monica Ramirez Basco, PhD. I have read another shorter one that is about the same thing. I don't remember the title but it's good too though. The other have a session helping you to accept your diagnosis, decide who you have to tell about it, and when to do it, and the better way to have \"the talk\".If you've been diagnosed I'm going to assume you're seeing a psychiatrist. This person will help you with medication, and adjusting the doses or the medicines as you go. I go to the same one for like 5 years or so, we got to know each other, even talk about other stuff on the sessions, really nice guy that helps me a lot.There are 4 simple things you can do for yourself, that I've read in that other book, and by personal experience I know they really work.You have to take your medicines on time, consistently. One thing that helps is having one of those pill boxes, where you can put your daily dose of them. If they aren't working as expected or you have side effects call your doctor. If you're having a swing up or down you should call him and talk about it. When in doubt just call him, the sooner you take action to stop a \"crisis\" the easier it is to control it. Organize your life with structure. Create a schedule with all your obligations, even those that are only with yourself (eating well, exercise, some hobbies, etc). After that you have to stick with it. It may be boring and all. But if you know what you have to do at what time each day it is easier to cope with all the stress that is unavoidable in life and can affect negatively your mood.Learn to self monitor your mood swings. There's a thing called mood chart. You can find it in the internet, books, or even an app for your smart phone. You can use it to record each day what time you woke up, what time you went to bad, you give a number to your mood in the morning and another before going to sleep. The number, let's say between zero and ten is on a scale that has sadness/depression on one end and manic on the other one. You can also add notes telling what events in your life you felt made you go either way. With time you will learn your own patterns and it will make you a few steps ahead of the illness.Also you need to get a good amount of sleep, preferably on a consistent schedule. Me personally if I sleep too little I get anxious, moody and cranky. If I sleep too much, I do nothing all day and get depressed. Everybody says the ideal is 8 hours but I'm no doctor. I just think that 6 hours is too little and 12 hours is too much sleep. I wish you the best. The persons that really like you and care about you will support you no matter what. They just have to begin to understand what it is all about, and that it's not your fault that you have bipolar.I'm 26 and have been diagnosed at 15. It was really hard in the begining. My first couple of doctors weren't so good at treating me. Until I found the guy I'm with until today. You can have a life that's 90% normal, you just have to take extra precautions like a person with say diabetis would have to do too.", "link_id": "t3_6166fv", "time": 1490348511}}

Spent all night playing video-games and am now ashamed of myself. Sorry for the rant. I had a meeting with my psychiatrist Wednesday and asked for referrals of therapists. I went to group therapy for almost a decade but it didn\u2019t do much for me. I asked for behaviorist ones and he referred me to two of them, which work near my campus. I really need to lose weight, and study more and get a better job. I know I can overcome all of this, I\u2019ve done it before. But all in all I miss my friends, my hobbies, going to mass and having more money. Edit: spelling and grammar. English is my second language so some parts of the post may be badly written. But I just need to get some sleep and get my stuff together.", "link_id": "t3_5ycmla", "time": 1490341533}}
