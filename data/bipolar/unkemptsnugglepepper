{"ebkv1t4": {"text": "Welcome.  I didn't want to admit I had bipolar. For some reason depression was ok but bipolar wasn't.  When I was diagnosed I finally accepted it.  That was about 8 years ago.  I had signs of it for much longer.  Some advice. -knowledge is powerI like \"The Bipolar Survival Guide\" by David j Miksowitz (I think I spelled that pretty close). Its an easy read that goes over a lot; what is bipolar, how do I deal with it, what treatments are available, how can loved ones help me.  Knowing little signs of bipolar is super helpful.  Crazy meds is my go to site for med information. It's in layman's terms, sometimes humorous.  It explains the most common side effects, weird and rare side effects. I think it's much easier to read than the packet or official website of the pill.   -keep a mood journalThis helps so much with being able to tell a doctor what's going on.  DBSA Tracker is a good one for you're phone.  You can make a chart in Excell or a bullet journal and color in the day with your mood.  I have normal, depressed, manic, irritable, and other.  -take your meds. Even when you feel normal.  Stopping meds can be dangerous and you have to start with a baby dose and work back up.  A lot of us stopped because we felt ok and then our symptoms come back in a giant wave of doom.  Also be open with your doctor about side effects. There's a long list of them.   I always take my pills with breakfast because I always have it, so i always remember my pills.  You can get a pill reminder on your phone or set an alarm if you forget.  You may also get one of those pill dispenser things. They're good if you have trouble remembering if you took your pills or not. -DietMostly be mindful of your diet. Too much coffee and energy drinks can make me hypomanic. Too much sugar and I have a depression crash.  I've heard the keto diet is helpful for keeping a steady mood and taking off extra pounds from meds.  I think just eating well helps and some exercise.  Just like someone with diabetes or high blood pressure we need to take care of ourselves in addition to meds. Depression sucks and that's the main thing I fight with bipolar ii.

If you obtain it legally, I'm not sure it's recommended for bipolar. It seems to me it would make symptoms worse over time and create a stronger dependence on the weed.  I do reccomend talking to a psychiatrist about your concerns with medication.  You may find a med that works well for you with minimal side effects.  Like stated by someone else, we have a chemical imbalance in our brains.  We need to eat right and exercise and avoid certain things just like someone with diabetes or high blood pressure.  Sometimes managing life isn't enough.I also recommend if you're not into medication, some natural remedies such as St. John's wort.  It's a plant that you can get in capsule form.  Most stores have it in low doses and natural stores will have it in higher concentration.  It helps with mood stability. Vitamin D and B vitamins are helpful too. I hear red raishi mushrooms are good, but they seem like a miracle herb with too much hype to be real.  The hard part about herbal supplements is that the 'research' isn't like prescription medications.  Some sites wont list side effects, just benefits. Everything has a side effect, some can be good.  As for diet, I know that a lot of sugar and caffeine are bad. Some energy drinks will put me in a hypomanic state.
