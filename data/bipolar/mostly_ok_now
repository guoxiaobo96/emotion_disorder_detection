I dealt with your situation for several years before I realized that my therapist wasn't focusing on actually helping me but rather saw me as a buddy. When I had that realization and he ignored my concerns, he was fired. Found a new therapist, had one session, walked away so pissed off it wasn't worth voicing any concerns to her and fired her right away. Found the right type of therapist (focused on trauma) and I thought he was ok at first, but after a few sessions thought he too was focusing on the wrong thing. I just kind of stopped him and I said \"talking about this isn't helpful for me, I want to focus on X,Y, and Z.\" He went silent for a few seconds to think, said he saw exactly where I was coming from and made a genuine heartfelt apology. That was the first time a medical professional ever listened to me, and the first time an adult had ever apologized to me. It was so profound I cried for the first time in therapy. Since then, my recovery has fast tracked because of that. We focus on the deeper pain rather than the superficial stuff that is IMO obvious to everyone. Get some rest, sounds like an emotionally exhausting experience for you. Allow yourself to wait until you are ready and have the energy and time to find someone new.

Recently, I was driving on the beltway in the right most lane, just maintaining 60 MPH. Someone from the lane next to me cut in front of me so closely with no warning that my ABS kicked in at 60 MPH and I was inches from hitting them! I swerved slightly into the shoulder and was shocked the douche tailgating me didn't slam into me. I honked as I slammed on the breaks and they didn't even notice! They continued on cutting people off until the next exit where I had to pull off to get my heart beat regulated before I could continue driving to my meeting. People are so cavalier about driving dangerously. I don't get it! People drive so insanely fast, 100+ on route 70, zooming in and out without checking blind spots on busy highways, I hold my breath every time I see someone speeding towards slowed/stopped cars. People shouldn't be bailing out on the shoulder so frequently when stopped traffic is absolutely clear in front of them. Maybe if people drove as much as I do all over the place and had so many near misses they'd be a bit more careful and consistent.Bonus: I got a justice served moment this morning when a douche sped off spewing coal at a left turn light (clearly doing 2x the limit already mid-apex) and I got out of the way for what I already knew was an under cover cop then watched him turn on his lights and pull the prick over.", "link_id": "t3_f8sfj4", "time": 1582585124}}

I have 40k saved for a downpayment on a shit tiny house in a shit neighborhood. I need to save for another year at least. Meanwhile, all my cousins purchased homes outright by the age of 23 in the UK (the ones in London had help from their parents who had help from THEIR parents).My cousins legitimately cannot comprehend how I pay ANY money on health care costs.

I missed so much school they tried to kick me out multiple times. I lost all my friends because they were sick of me being a \"drama queen.\" My own parents would scream at me to get out of bed and go to school because after years of seeing every specialist they didn't believe me anymore. When I finally got diagnosed with histoplasmosis I felt vindicated, only 2 days later my life changed forever, and not for the better.I had a lumbar puncture scheduled to see if the disease had spread to my brain. It was horrifically botched. I was tortured on the table for over an hour after this doctor sticking a needle in my spine 27 times before she finally gave up. From the first stick, I've had permanent sciatica. Since this could never be \"proven\" and she lied on the form (she said she made 3 attempts, the maximum allowed) I couldn't sue her. That's when the fibromyalgia, chronic migraines, and permanent sciatica started. I had to get a disabled parking placard just for university. Even with that, I still had to walk 10 minutes uphill in a ton of pain lugging books. Several times parking enforcement asked me why I thought it was ok to \"take my grandma's placard.\" I showed them my disabled ID and still kept getting harassed. Some one looking for a spot saw me park in the first disabled spot, I got out, and after she parked she walked over and keyed my car. When I started working, I was on opiates from inexplicable abdominal pain for years. A couple years into working, after being in extreme pain for 3 days (but powering through it because that's what I always do), I passed out at work and a coworker took me to the ER. A cyst ruptured my ovary open and I was hemorrhaging blood and severely anemic. I had emergency surgery and was diagnosed with Endometriosis. A week later, after being back at work 1 day, the same thing happened on my other ovary. I couldn't have surgery again and was just told to rest. I went on unpaid leave. I feel like this was the one time my illness wasn't \"invisible\" because people were so concerned about how underweight I was. I was just in too much pain to keep anything down. After surgery, they took away my pain killers after a couple weeks. I was still in so much pain. I quit my job, started drinking, and a couple months later tried to kill myself to escape the pain.Woke up in the ER and asked for a doctor who just stuck her head in and screamed \"YOU'RE A FUCKING DRUG SEEKER.\" Got committed after being locked in a room with a plastic bed, free bleeding without being allowed to even have my birth control. I was put in an addiction wing, even though I had no opiates in my system when I tried to kill myself. Since then, I've worked a lame (but well paying) job and just getting through day by day. In the last 5 weeks I've had extreme pain in my spine and really high blood pressure. I have two herniated discs and six bulging discs in my neck.

The fact that she's so fixated on the cause leads me to believe it's a bit of an exaggeration, but that's just my personal experience.I don't feel humiliated talking about it though. I do feel humiliated in the moment because I feel like every one is staring at me even though I can't see them. I mean sweat is dripping off my face for God's sake. But I find talking about it helps to pin point the WHY. Just recently learned from my psychiatrist that panic attacks while grocery shopping are fairly normal for those with PTSD.

I was severely anemic and had emergency surgery to stitch my ovary back together and to remove the endometrial adhesions that they could see (since my abdomen was full of blood). Diagnosed with endometriosis after years of me telling doctors I think I have it. Afterwards the doctors were like \"ohhh it all makes sense now. Adhesions can grow up your whole abdomen.\" Anyway, they offered to remove my uterus but not my ovaries  because I was in my early 20's and they didn't want to throw me into early menopause. Point being, I hate when people make assumptions about other people's medical conditions. You don't know what's going on and there's a good chance her doctors don't know either.
