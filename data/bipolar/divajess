If she qualified for an IEP under OHI for ADHD, then you don't need achievement testing, provided you still have enough data sources to consider the assessment comprehensive (can't just be freestanding diagnosis).  Also, if the parent consented to start of IEP services, you haven't violated due process.It sounds like the outcome doesn't sit well with you because it's perhaps not the most appropriate placement for the needs of the kid.  I think of them like \"Classroom IEPs\", as in, \"if the kid is in this class, she will need an IEP.\"  It's true, \"work completion\" is not a reason for eligibility, nor is \"teacher can't manage the class\".  It's a difficult situation.You can still do achievement testing for program evaluation when she's in special ed, doing it depends on what you're hoping to learn from the data.

There are times when I don't sleep, or when I can't wake up.  Some days I eat everything, some days I will eat nothing.  Some days I will not stop yelling, or, not stop crying, or not stop talking.  Sometimes I am the best person to hang with.  Some days I am a depressed drag.  Some days I spend money when I shouldn't.  Or say things that I shouldn't...Some times I am hurtful, and some days I will be irrationally scared or anxious or worried.  Most of the time, I don't look or act like a person with a mental illness, and some of that stability is within my power to control.  But no matter what I do, I WILL experience those days listed above, some more than others, some for short periods and as for very long periods.  It affects our school and work performance, the dynamics of professional and intimate relationships.  It affects our finances directly and indirectly.

Having insufficient material available for gluconeogenesis will obviously limit the rate, but in the experiments we reviewed, having excess material did not increase the rate.We haven't found any solid evidence to support the idea that excess protein is turned into glucose.More experiments are needed to confirm that this still holds true in keto dieters.Hope this helps!!

So, if I feel my heart start to race, or I start talking really fast, or I get that \"thrill\" feeling, then I make myself stop, breathe, and slow down.  I go for a walk, go play guitar, lay on the floor and watch my brain run around for a while...I've developed a list of \"slow down\" activities over the last couple years.  I spend a lot of time telling myself, it doesn't have to be right now, slow and steady, take a deep breath...I'm sure I've actually been more productive this way.  But it is hard.  My brain is a puppy and I try to be its calm, methodical owner...hth...", "link_id": "t3_386by9", "time": 1433634264}}

I have been there, and have moved out of that way of thinking.  I was soooo judgemental, of myself and others, and in support of that, constantly observing, analyzing, critiquing...it's exhausting.  I did a few things:1. Bipolar meds worked wonders for me.2. I joined a dojo.  Here, in a 100% non-competitive, supportive, extra-curricular environment, I get to wrestle with my issues of perfectionism, self-limitation, not being the best in the group, blah blah blah. And my abs are amazing.3. I embraced my inner slacker.  I promised that for one year, I would refrain from signing up for classes, joining new groups, looking for new jobs, houses or degree programs, or any other new obligations.  I set one goal for each day, and never any more.  Some days my goal was to not make a goal.  I have three kids and somehow everybody seemed to get fed, even with my severe slacking.  Also some pot and lots of \"who gives a fuck?s\" helped me learn what \"relax\" looks like.This is my bipolar sumup, for what its worth: I used to think my feelings were real.  I used to think that they were all very, very important.  But the majority of them are neither.  My mind is like a hamster in a wheel, and it will use ANYTHING as fuel to get going.  I have stopped in the middle of tears to realize that I didn't even care, nor had I ever cared about whatever shit was making me cry.Don't get me wrong, I do think feelings are necessary and valuable but that was before I understood that I don't feel things the same way other people do.  So now, the stronger I feel about something, the more suspect it is, and the harder I try to logic my way through it.  And more often than not, the argument falls apart.Good luck. everybody!", "link_id": "t3_1colpg", "time": 1366438167}}
