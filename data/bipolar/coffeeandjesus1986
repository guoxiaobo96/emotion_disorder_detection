I had met him 2 days prior he was a gospel preacher, we had said hi in passing. My life was changed. We got married in 4 1/2 months. He made me go to the doctor and find out why I was so sick. Up until that point I lived at home not by choice and my parents refused to take me to the doctor I was faking it according to them. I went to my doctor who said you might have endometriosis after your wedding you need to have the surgery. A month after my wedding I had a laparoscopy and a d&amp;c.

That morning he said he forgot something in the office but my mom said please don\u2019t go, there\u2019s a strange car and I have a bad feeling something bad is going to happen if you go. As soon as she said that I called. She had turned on every light in their house, front porch back porch and kept me on the phone. She said she couldn\u2019t shake the bad feeling and I felt off myself I was 45 minutes away. Finally the person whomever it was left, and then it seemed like the off/bad feeling left. I told my mom the dream, and it was like a foreshadowing of what could\u2019ve happened. Nobody ever parked in the church lot, ever. Unless it was for church services. Especially not at 3:30-4 in the morning. Its been almost 8 years and I still remember it like it happened yesterday.It\u2019s true, I\u2019m definitely not making it up. My mom and I still get the creeps thinking and talking about it. ", "link_id": "t3_9pgbcc", "time": 1540004582}}

I was a totally different person back then and I\u2019m so glad I\u2019ve grown and changed.It was a night I think sometime in January 2006, don\u2019t ask the day it all runs together. I had been kicked out of my parents house so I was couch surfing at a friends house. What I do remember is my then friend and then boyfriend who were of legal age (I was 19) got a whole bunch of booze and soda as chasers. I remember this much..Then friend told me to try a jack and coke. I had a huge glass of that and then I drank some fireball. I had really never drank I was the \u201cgood little Christian girl\u201d and this was totally out of my league.The part I am fuzzy on, then boyfriend dared me to chug some jack straight I did it because I thought it was cool. It wasn\u2019t The part I don\u2019t remember. I got so wasted drinking even more and then my boyfriend turned on the CD player with some rap music so we had an impromptu dance session where I decided I would dance with said friend. My ex was drunk too so friend and boyfriend got into a brawl and started fighting. Drunk me ran out of the house I have no idea why and my then friend dragged me back in. At that point I blacked out and fell on the living room floor. I woke up the next morning ex boyfriend is nowhere to be found I had vomit in my hair my clothes were filthy and I had a trash can by my head. My then friend said you really got wild last night and that\u2019s when they told me what I did, dancing them fighting me running outside then blacking out. I had the worst headache of my life and I looked like death warmed over and from then I cut back my drinking and then I stopped cold turkey after breaking up with the ex boyfriend-long story on that. I still crave alcohol but I don\u2019t drink I actually turned my life around in 2008 I\u2019m back to being the good Christian and I love to help others with my experience.", "link_id": "t3_9naczl", "time": 1539278470}}

Two weeks later I was around 18 weeks by my dating-I miscarried a little boy in my bathroom. I knew I was pregnant and nobody except my husband believed me.It gets worse.2 weeks later we lost my father in law from a massive heart attack so on top of grieving for the baby, I was grieving for my father in law.It gets worse.A month later my husbands grandma my grandma in law dies of pneumonia and a broken heart. We couldn\u2019t make it to the funeral no money we were 700 miles away. It gets worse.Less than 2 months later my husband lost his job which meant we lost our house.

After dealing with her I\u2019d usually need a smoke break because I was so stressed out.I put in my two weeks after dreading going into work one too many times and getting sick of fixing mistakes she and the others made. I didn\u2019t want the supervisor position I was fed up. I quit that job and quit smoking the environment became toxic toward the end. They closed permanently a week after I officially quit. We all knew it was coming. Corporate made too many bad decisions leading up to this hiring decision. I\u2019ll never forget \u201cKaren\u201d I still have a friend I worked with I talk to on occasion she brings her up because we all had \u201cKaren\u201d horror stories she sat beside me so we had each other on those horrid calls. I understand giving jobs to the homeless I totally get it but we were a 3rd party center with a corporate contract if we did anything wrong we could\u2019ve had the contract pulled. When they made that decision it took away time spent with real issues because of the corporation we worked with we had a market that was mostly upper crust rich people in a certain state who would escalate up the chain if they didn\u2019t get their way or any of us were incompetent. That\u2019s why it made us so mad. We spent more time fixing mistakes than keeping customers happy towards the end. Corporate actually sent their minions to investigate our upper management they had meetings a month before leading up to the sudden closure of my ex workplace.

I was cycling between mania and depression about 7 1/2 years ago, my husband was stressed out dealing with me, a bad church situation as a preacher and two jobs. We were strained and we were so close to just giving up. We pretty much were roommates for a few months then he got a job opportunity in another state, which took stress off of him, and my mood settled down. We thought all was well-I was controlling my moods as best I could without a diagnosis. 5 years ago, new state, I was working, he was working we hardly saw each other, my mood and health started declining again, I took it out on him by distancing myself, staying with my family and just being a witch. We were within probably weeks of divorce again and I got a tip to go to a doctor, get checked out and then see a therapist. I saw a doctor got a diagnosis of bipolar disorder type 1, started medication and seeing a therapist. I also was dealing with seizures of unknown origin and once I got my diagnosis and started therapy I was given tips on how to manage my mood swings, started medication and rebuilding our marriage. A month after I started all of the medication, got my seizures under control they\u2019re stress induced I\u2019m on medication for it still I found out I was pregnant after an infertility diagnosis.My husband and I focused on rebuilding our relationship and focusing on being husband and wife and becoming parents. It took a lot of hard work on both of our parts and tons of soul searching but we made it through it.We met and married in 4 months of meeting, so we struggled especially as he is 9 years older than me I was in my 20s when we married and he was in his 30s so it was immaturity on my part and as I grew as person, dealt with chronic illness and now mental illness it changed me, and it took both of us recognizing it and understanding that it changed our marriage that we were able to survive the near split twice. Now we are stronger than ever like it\u2019s absolutely amazing how far we\u2019ve come in almost 10 years of marriage. We made it and we work together.

{"e49jfmj": {"text": "Here\u2019s my story it\u2019s long so be warned.I was diagnosed when I was 22 in 2009 a month after my wedding. I was placed on birth control and I was faithful except for 3 days I lost them and well I found out in January 2010 I was pregnant. 4 days later I miscarried my doctor who I had actually cried with me.I got pregnant 4 months later, but lost that one at 6 weeks. That was July 2010I then did a round of Lupron in March-June 2011, in between Lupron and my miscarriage I used no birth control and somehow I did not end up pregnant-I was pretty much infertile. I was in a new state new doctor, he was pretty awesome. After Lupron we moved for work and I got pregnant in November 2011 a full year and 5 months or so since my last pregnancy. I didn\u2019t find out til January. I had a positive test went to a ob/gyn that was recommended by a new friend. He flat out refused to believe I was pregnant even though I had a faint positive at his office it was a false negative. I went home and cried he didn\u2019t believe me. I lost a little boy at 18 weeks along on February 8 2012. I lost my father in law 2 weeks later. Well we gave up trying gave up birth control the doctor after my loss said the endometriosis which is stage 4, makes to where my hormones can\u2019t sustain a pregnancy and I was pretty much infertile.Imagine my surprise in November 2013 when I went to my pcp and she ordered a pregnancy test. I thought it was my medication making me sick and dizzy. Nope I was pregnant. For a 4th time. She recommended a brand new doctor and he took me on. He said my chances to conceive looking at my history was 1 in 20,000 and carrying to term 1 in 10,000. He said he would move heaven and earth to make sure this baby made it. Hormones, weekly checks, preterm labor scare (twice) but I made it to 39 weeks and she was safely born. She\u2019s now 4 years old.I was going to get my tubes tied after her birth but my doc had an emergency and life happened. I\u2019m technically infertile-we went no birth control for the first 3 months after she was born I know it was risky but I didn\u2019t end up pregnant again. I got nexplanon after that to make sure that less than 20,000 odds I don\u2019t get pregnant again.I\u2019ve only had 1 surgery, birth control, Lupron and so many ultrasounds I could be a tech but at least I have my daughter. It was a long road and it has affected me personally. I\u2019m just thankful to have my daughter. My husband and I tried so long and he never ever blamed me just held my hand and let me cry over birth and pregnancy announcements.

All of a sudden we hear heavy boots walking upstairs and then pool balls being broke from the pool table upstairs. Our parents got up and asked why we were playing pool. We said we were in bed I was 15 my brother was 11 at this time. It happened a couple more times then stopped.Second-our current house. We are renters, I live with my husband, daughter and mom in law. We\u2019ve been here 2 years and strange stuff happens a lot! My daughter refuses to sleep in my mom in laws room she said it\u2019s creepy. One night a random VHS tape fell from somewhere in her room and scared everyone. My books in the office will be in the floor in a nice neat stack. Our daughter is nearly 4 and sleeping in her room in the opposite side of the house. Sometimes we hear little kid footsteps in front of our door around 10-10:30 at night long after she\u2019s asleep.
