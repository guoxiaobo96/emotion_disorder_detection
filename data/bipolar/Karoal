Meanwhile in Polish, it's much harder to predict what the declined noun could be.For certain words, different cases can look exactly the same. Take the example *tree* = *fa = drzewo*. Then the plural is *drzewa = f\u00e1k.* Coincidentally, *drzewa* is also the possessive case of a singular *drzewo,* which (sometimes?) can be translated as *fai.*The genitive case of *drzewo* is also *drzewo*, but you wouldn't necessarily know that. This sort of weird collision is confusing even to native Polish speakers. It's common to accidentally use the wrong case of a word.So far we've only talked about the annoying noun cases. There are many more quirks of the Polish language which would seem strange. Since you're native Hungarian, you might find the noun genders frustrating.The vocabulary shouldn't be impossibly hard.

{"fjov9eq": {"text": "One of the worst thing about manic episodes (and BP in general) is that they rob you of things that should be your best memories.You could be just doing the laundry while manic and feel better than ever before. Your threshold for feeling good is raised so much, that even getting accepted into your dream university feels a bit bland in comparison. It really messes with you.There is such a massive range of emotions that you can feel while manic. Life is suddenly in HD, everything is such a rush. You feel like Neo from the Matrix. The secrets of life have been revealed to you. You feel unstoppable, outside the confines of mortality. Time flows differently. The sudden epiphanies must be written down, you find yourself scribbling some sacred mysteries on a sheet of paper. Every single possible thought enters your mind. It's really hard to describe.In my personal experience, after treatment you realise that all these feelings and insights are more or less worthless. The things that really matter are suddenly mundane. The mania seems so far away, it might as well have been a different person that has lived through it. It really does feel like it wasn't you. That's why your friend might feel that he doesn't actually need the medication after a while. After all, the meds do make you feel flatter.The spectrum of things you can go through while manic is so huge, that it's impossible to describe it in one post. During mania, you can feel like Buddha having reached enlightenment. Maybe you're destined to be rich and famous. Maybe your brain will tell you that actually, you're a reincarnation of Hitler and must be killed. Quite possibly, you can be both manic and depressed at once. Mixed episodes are hell on earth, luckily not everyone has those.Speaking of depression, it almost always follows the episode. And it almost always lasts longer than the mania. At points I've been depressed for months only to be manic for a week. Major life milestones feel so empty while depressed. You could receive the Nobel Peace prize and feel nothing.While medication (if you take it) is usually extremely good at treating mania, it's not always the case for depressive episodes. That could be another factor why your mate sometimes doesn't want to take medication.", "link_id": "t3_fe7ya8", "time": 1583535505}}

If I were to ask my grandparents, they would know someone who knows someone there. However, I wouldn't expect Polish people to know much about the city itself.During communist times, if you were lucky, you had relatives in the US who'd be able to help you financially. There were shops with luxury goods in Poland that only accepted dollars.Nowadays I'd like to think I know a lot more about Chicago than most Polish people do, but I don't know anything about the diaspora there.

Here are the links for first years of [JMC](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/jmc-info/jmc-first-yea and [Computing](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/computing/computing-first-yea respectively. As a student I still consult these pages a lot. The course has been restructured a bit so it's hard for me to say what it's like now.Barely any mechanics is done in the first two years, and in third year JMC you are free to choose from most maths dept. courses as far as I know.Computing students learn more about hardware, in first year they have [this module (112)](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/courses/112/) which JMCs do not sit. Computing students also have to do slightly more programming in general. There are 3 milestones in both of the infamous second-year projects (Pintos and WACC), however JMCs only do the first two milestones to allow time for maths.There are month-long group projects after exams at the end of first and second year. They're lots of fun. They're exactly the same for both JMCs and Computing students who often end up in the same groups. JMCs also get a chance to pick a Maths project in second year instead, but not many people do that.In third and fourth years, JMCs have a minimum number of maths modules they have to pick. I think it's 2 or 3. Other than that, they're free to choose whatever Maths or Computing modules they want. The difference between JMCs and Computing modules becomes small and they often work together in the third year group project.Socially, JMCs and Computing students mingle a lot and are basically equivalent. Everyone somehow seems to know who studies what, but there is not much of a divide. If anything, some JMCs seem to hang out with each other more since their course is smaller and a bit special, but that's not a big deal.", "link_id": "t3_e8jr8z", "time": 1575969100}}

The vast majority of JMCs that I've met have taken more computing modules than maths.Other than course content, there is not a massive difference between Computing and JMC students. Most JMCs will spend most of their time in the DoC anyway, although they have access to maths facilities. The JMC course is still mostly run by the Department of Computing, and you'd get a degree from the faculty of Engineering at the end.In both Computing and in JMC you will get a lot of stats content. In terms of maths, JMCs can choose between applied or pure modules from second year onwards.You might hear that JMC is \"harder\" than computing.

Much easier to appreciate a sunset on a bike than in a gym or pool. You move fast so there are lots of nice things that you pass by.- There is a big cycling community so if you struggle with loneliness, you can join a group. I never did though- Honestly... I'm not as scared of accidents as more people are. In fact it helps against my suicidal thoughts- Most cities have cheap bike rentals (yay London, \u00a32/day) which makes cycling very accessible.

The CBT approach is that thoughts, behaviours and emotions are all inter-related and each of those affects the others in some way. In this way, vicious cycles and spirals can form which cause suffering.In your case, it sounds like you might have to do a bit of hacking around your mind to try to reprogram it. Maybe it's simliar to me and you're so used to these thoughts that you have them even when you're well? There's a lot that you can do on these grounds, and you're already doing a lot more than some other people with BP.DBT is not a familiar topic for me, but from what I know a lot of it is just based on coping with your emotions. So it wouldn't go into how to stop feeling like that, rather how to go with the flow and not resist the emotions.I'm not actually that experienced so I can't tell you that much.

As long as it doesn't cause you distress, lots of people space out. If it's distressing, you might want to bring that up with your doctor then.Personally I have been diagnosed with bipolar. Anecdotally people's mental illness can be \"coloured\" by their personality.In my experience mental illness affects you a tiny bit like being under the influence of a drug. You're acting and thinking differently, but you're still you in some way. That's where the analogy ends but I hope you understand me that your personality and your mental illness blend together somewhat.I know it's easy to freak out, I have done it and am still doing it.

{"dgxghuo": {"text": "The comment I was responding to was deleted, but I feel that it's quite relevant to what you said.Oh man. These fears took out a year of my life. Maybe reading this thread was not the best thing for me.I had depression as a teenager, which culminated when I was 19. I was sent to hospital for two weeks due to suicidal ideation, straight to a psychosis ward. That really affected me. The things that happened in there were not exactly traumatic, and compared to other wards it was supposedly a great place to be, but man did it leave an imprint on me.Over the next few months I started behaving quite like these people in my ward. I spent weeks not really knowing what I was doing. I would just blank out and stare at myself in the mirror, or suddenly tense up and collapse on the floor, or speak to myself, laugh to myself, or walk around with a crazed look on my face, or have these spasms and tics that I could hardly control. I would get urges to climb out of the window, or to write out my jumbled thoughts on a whiteboard at university, both of which I did carry out. All standard psychosis stuff. The 'problem' was, I was completely aware of what I was doing, and I knew that what I was doing was not ordinary. I had quite a solid sense of what was real and what wasn't, even though that statement doesn't have much value if it comes from a person who is behaving in this way.I'm not trying to write out my life story here, so I'll make this brief. I was diagnosed with psychosis in the end, and was put on quite heavy medication to stop my 'condition' from progressing. I accepted both the diagnosis and the medication, maybe it's even what I wanted. But over time I realised that what I was going through was probably not a psychotic episode. There were no voices, no visual hallucinations, no delusions, nothing. Just a 19yo boy acting strangely.Of course it was a bit too late to contest anything. I have since stopped taking meds. I have started the long process of 'correcting' my diagnosis, which will be quite tricky since it's really common for people with psychotic symptoms to deny having anything of that sort.What did that leave me? A significant level of self-doubt. I have panic attacks where I start to question my sanity. I spend a lot of my time on edge, waiting for some supposed voices or visions to appear. I hate myself for my interest / involvement in religion, since that is just one step closer to developing delusions. Any suicidal thoughts which I am getting are terrifying because they are mostly unjustified, too. I question my motives on literally everything; I am very easily influenced by others. I don't know whether I have psychosis, or just subconsciously want it, or I don't want it to the extent that I force this fear to become true, and that is quite a burden on my mind.**TL;DR:** might have scared myself into psychosis ", "link_id": "t3_68878w", "time": 1493513516}}

For now let's only think about what happens for each number after the decimal point. You could map the position of the first digit after the decimal point to the number 1, the second position to 2 etc. For each position you have, there are 10 possible choices of digits. So the number of possible combinations of digits is multiplied by 10.
