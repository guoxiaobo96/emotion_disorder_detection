In particular though, she wanted to be a nurse. She was 28 with a bachelor\u2019s in criminal justice (so no science background at all). When I asked her what kind of nurse she wanted to be she said, \u201cWell, I think an RN.\u201d I thought she was joking and when I realized she was completely serious I started asking her what made her want to become a nurse, to which her only reasons were that they only worked 3 days a week and made 50-60k and it wasn\u2019t \u201cTHAT hard of a job.\u201d She also used to tell me things like, \u201cYeah I want to be a nurse, but I don\u2019t want to have to wipe people\u2019s butts or take them to the bathroom!\u201d She insisted that there was a way around that and I knew that she was never going to become a nurse.I am in the medical field myself so she would constantly ask me what being a nurse was like and since my bachelor\u2019s is in human biology she figures I could tutor her since she had to take all the prerequisite classes for nursing school. I asked her what programs she had looked into and she would talk about \u201cnursing school\u201d not realizing that it\u2019s a second bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing. Once I explained that to her she insisted I was wrong. She would also occasionally ask me, before she had started her prerequisite classes, \u201cWhy do people think anatomy and physiology is so hard, it\u2019s literally so simple\u201d and so I asked, \u201cDo you know what anatomy and physiology is?\u201d And she replied, \u201cWell yeah anatomy is the bones and physiology is the muscles.\u201d Again, she didn\u2019t believe me when I told her that that was in fact, not what anatomy and physiology were. Yet she would continue to say, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna memorize The Bone Dance from Hannah Montana to ace anatomy!\u201d Spoiler alert: she dropped after half a semester into anatomy.

Because premature babies have an immature immune system, they are usually started on antibiotics right away, but sometimes (for reasons I don\u2019t really know) the antibiotics destroy the nerves in the ears, leading to deafness.

{"fmd4ew2": {"text": "Okay, here it goes. Gonna try to be as respectful as possible, and I\u2019m hoping you will do the same.For one, I would be happy to give teachers a pay raise if there was a way to get rid of the bad teachers. With the tenure system and ridiculous job protections from the teacher\u2019s union, there are some god awful teachers who are squatting on positions that could be taken by better teachers. Two, I believe STEM teachers should make more than humanities and arts teachers. The main reasons for this is that 1. A STEM degree is much more challenging to receive and 2. Those who major in STEM fields have much more lucrative options than being a school teacher. That is why it is so hard to find good teachers for STEM, because they could make a lot more money doing different work in their field. For humanities majors, teaching is usually the most lucrative career option they have. These two studies are not the same. Three, if we\u2019re going to talk about Finland\u2019s high performing education system, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re making a fair comparison. Schools have much higher standards for their teachers, normal primary and secondary school teachers have to complete a master\u2019s degree at minimum. There is no tenure offered for school teachers and there is little job stability. There is a reason why they are paid more, there is more work and risk involved in being a school teacher in Finland than in the United States. Let\u2019s not forget the fact that Finland has a voucher system and schools must compete for students, whereas in the United States a lot of students have no choice but to attend underperforming schools. We don\u2019t like to close schools because the teacher\u2019s union doesn\u2019t want to lay off any tenured teachers (less teachers=less union dues), so there have been many efforts made to limit school choice and force kids to stay in public schools in their district so that the schools can remain open. I am all for implementing a system like Finland\u2019s, but I\u2019m pretty sure the teachers would not like it.", "link_id": "t3_fuj1q3", "time": 1585959087}}

By increasing the pay we can attract more valuable STEM school teachers and prepare students better.

Certain industries like strip clubs and some porn are women using these industries to their advantage, knowing that their sex appeal has monetary value. Other industries, like revenge porn and sex-trafficking (which is where a lot of prostitution comes from) are blatant exploitations of women. These are situations where a woman is used for sex and others profit off of this and the woman gains nothing from it. Although a man loses money, he is not being cheated out of it, he is just exchanging it for a service.

{"flltosq": {"text": "Hello! Fellow vaginismus haver here. I feel like there is definitely more to this story. For one, has she had any sexual trauma? That is extremely common with vaginismus and can really go into the problem of not necessarily having a low sex drive, but not wanting to engage in sex with another person or be vulnerable that way. I know you feel like a terrible person, but I can tell you as someone who has the condition, there are men who won\u2019t go on a second date with me or push my timeline (I have the severest form where my vagina closes all the way, it has taken me a year and a half to get where I am now, and I still have yet to be able to have intercourse). The fact that you have gone five years being with her without sex shows that you really do care about her and that she means more to you than just sex. That being said, sex is a pleasurable and intimate activity and you have every right to miss it and want to integrate it back into the relationship. These are some things I would suggest if you want to try to save your relationship. They might not all work but maybe if you and your girlfriend are open you might give them a try:1. If her condition does stem from trauma, and she is not already, try having her go to therapy. EMDR therapy is extremely effective for many people at reducing the effects of trauma. Maybe this is something she might be open to. It will help her to feel better and might help her to feel more comfortable being vulnerable with you.2. Make using dilators pleasurable. They can actually feel good if you want them to. For me I watch porn and use lube and I actually look forward to my sessions, even if they\u2019re initially painful. When I first started, I was so tight I was using q-tips because I couldn\u2019t even use the smallest dilator in my set. I used to cry because it was so painful and I didn\u2019t see the progress immediately. When I talked to my therapist about it she told me I just needed to change my perspective on it. Instead of thinking, \u201cOh shit this is gonna hurt,\u201d I can change the event by instead thinking, \u201cI wonder what this is going to feel like,\u201d or \u201cThis is going to feel nice.\u201d Changing my perspective really is what I can attribute to my progress. 3. Join in her sessions if she\u2019s comfortable with it. Again, try to have fun with these. It doesn\u2019t have to be a painful process, and remind her she\u2019s not alone. Incorporate the dilators into your other sexual activities and try to get her off using them. If you are able to move to sex again, use the dilators as part of foreplay to minimize any pain she\u2019ll feel from you. Most of all, make sure that this isn\u2019t completely about sex. Especially if this comes from a place of trauma, she\u2019s already been made to feel like a sex object. Don\u2019t make it worse. Root for her and be on her side.

{"fl1a34i": {"text": "Thinking back, I believe my symptoms started my first year in college. Often times narcolepsy can be brought on by the flu, which is what I believe happened to me. At 18 years old about 2 weeks into my first quarter in college I came down with a really bad case of the flu and thinking back that is when my symptoms started. 1. First symptoms: Suddenly I was falling asleep in class every single day. I tried getting more sleep at night, but it continued to happen. I would fall asleep sitting up and sometimes I would lean forward to try and pay closer attention but my eyes would close and I would be awake but I wouldn\u2019t be able to open them again. It was always the same class around 4pm. My friends would make fun of me because I couldn\u2019t stay awake through a single movie or for more than one or two episodes of a TV show or sometimes I would fall asleep mid-conversation and they would slam books next to me or slap my forehead and laugh because I would try to open my eyes again but couldn\u2019t.2. Gradually or suddenly: How do I say this? It was new, like something that I hadn\u2019t done before, but there were so many other changes in my life while transitioning to college I thought it was associated with those changes. I would say it gradually worsened and concerned me more. At first I was falling asleep every day at 4pm, but then as time progressed it was 2 hours after waking up as well as 4pm and I needed those two naps every day, more if I was short any sleep from the night before. It got to a point where doing simple tasks like putting laundry away or playing with my dog suddenly my body would get really heavy and I would lay down on the floor and sleep for about an hour, especially if this was around 4pm or 2 hours after waking up. I scared my roommates because I would slump over the table while eating breakfast. 3. When I decided to seek help: I was already going from doctor to doctor, but I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, then bipolar disorder and ADHD. Turns out these kind of mood symptoms are commonly caused by narcolepsy, but my doctors assumed my sleepiness was a result of having these mood disorders. No matter what medication I took, the sleepiness would not go away and the depression, anxiety, and lack of focus continued. I gained about 30 pounds from the inactivity, my grades took a deep dive, my social life was dying because I had no energy to go out with friends, and I didn\u2019t even have the energy to take care of myself or clean up my house because I would fall asleep all the time. I had many breakdowns about it and when I finally did go to a doctor seeking answers about this daytime sleepiness, between having to wait for appointments to see my doctors and waiting for insurance to approve things, I was finally diagnosed after 10 months of actively seeking this diagnosis (go to my comments and see one I wrote about an MSLT if you want more details about the diagnosing process). I suffered with narcolepsy for about 3 years before being put on the right medication. It really has changed my quality of life and now even though I experience some tiredness during the day (around 4pm and 2 hours after waking up, of course) I am able to actually fight off sleep and power through, which is something I didn\u2019t even know was possible. I\u2019m looking to lose the weight, get my grades back on track, and finally rebuild my life from the destruction that the mood symptoms caused. It hasn\u2019t been easy and it seemed to come out of left field, but I am relieved there is treatment for what most people don\u2019t realize is a debilitating condition.(Sorry this is long I know, hope I helped :P)", "link_id": "t3_flx1p1", "time": 1584724942}}
{"fksulkl": {"text": "Yes it does have to do with the surface tension. Water has a very high surface tension since it can make strong hydrogen bonds to itself, whereas alcohol does not hydrogen bond to itself as easily, therefore does not hold itself together as strongly as water.Because the oxygen attached to the hydrogen has a lot of electrons, it is more hungry for electrons, and when attached to hydrogen, sucks its electron away, forming a slight negative charge on the oxygen and a slight positive charge on the oxygen. Because opposites attract, the slightly negative oxygen attracts a slightly positive hydrogen and they form a \u201chydrogen bond\u201d where they are held together by opposite charges but with no sharing of electrons.Water molecules are also much smaller than alcohol molecules and the oxygen in a water molecule is more electronegative than the ones in an alcohol. This makes the water have higher surface tension than alcohol.", "link_id": "t3_fka54s", "time": 1584498757}}

When you come in they will have you put your stuff down and they will bring you into a room where they will put a full EKG on you (sensors over your chest, arms, and legs) as well as a partial EEG (electrodes on the head) and some face sensors. Similar to a polysomnography they will put a cannula on you, give you a pulse oximeter (the little sensor clip on your finger), and strap a monitor on your chest (this test also tests for sleep apnea which I think is stupid because to do this test in the first place you have to already test negative for sleep apnea). The first part of the test is they put you to bed and they give you 8 hours for the night (they will wake you up in the morning regardless of how much sleep you get). Then after waking up they will take off the chest monitor, pulse oximeter, and cannula and all the EKG sensors so that all you're left with is the EEG stuff and face sensors. The second part takes the entire day where they ask you to take 5 naps 2 hours apart. For me, I was woken up after the first part at 7:30am, then I was asked to nap at 9:30am, 11:30am, 1:30pm, 3:30pm, and 5:30pm. They give you 15 minutes to fall asleep. If you do fall asleep they give you another 15 minutes. I will warn it does get annoying to have to be woken up so many times. Bring some stuff to do so you don't get bored out of your mind. Also bring some food that you can heat up as they likely will have a microwave you can use. As for results, you are diagnosed with narcolepsy if you fall asleep on at least two of the naps AND go into REM sleep. For me, I went into REM three times xD", "link_id": "t3_fivuvj", "time": 1584248218}}

I agree sex should be enjoyed by both, but men do orgasm something like 95% of the time with every sexual encounter. For women, it is much harder to orgasm. The way I see it, when a woman doesn\u2019t want to go down on a man, it sucks and she\u2019s not a great lover but the motions (not that the sensations are the same, but the motions) are similar enough to where the guy can still finish.
