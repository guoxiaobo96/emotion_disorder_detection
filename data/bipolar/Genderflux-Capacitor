My advice is the same either way.Here's the thing: if you are abusing him, the answer is not for him to abuse you in return. You have offered to take a break. To allow him time away from you. HE WON'T ACCEPT IT. Instead, he refuses to allow you to leave and threatens to hurt himself. He is threatening self harm. I don't care how he phrases it. \"I will have a breakdown and quit working\" is a form of self harm.If one of us did this, it would (rightly!) be called abuse.

All these people who talk about supporting mentally ill people have no problem being nasty to me and abandoning me during my worst points.We deal with worse stigma than people with anxiety and unipolar depression. Mental health positivity isn't for us. In fact, the people who have been the cruelest to me are people with anxiety and depression. I'm expected to support them through their symptoms, but mine are just too much.The 4 closest people to me in the world abandoned me, said cruel things to me, and attempted to turn other people against me during my last manic phase. And then I went to a support group with a lot of bipolar people in it, and THEY GOT ME. THEY UNDERSTOOD. THEY TOLD ME I WASN'T CRAZY AND I DIDN'T DESERVE THIS TREATMENT. That made a world of difference in my life and is a major reason why I'm still alive.", "link_id": "t3_e5hhtd", "time": 1575385032}}

I really am. That's not going to be my experience. I have bipolar disorder. That's not going away. I will have episodes for the rest of my life.\"Do something you like!\" Good god, I wish people would fucking stop with this advice. IF I LIKED ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, MAYBE I WOULD. When someone is in this low of a spot, coming at them with chirpy \"common sense\" advice is so insulting. Yeah, I know I should go do something I like. I don't have the energy to summon up the executive functioning to pick out a Netflix show right now.You know who you remind me of? The \"best friend\" I had who was gonna be there for me during this rough time. I was in crisis and suicidal, and he comes at me with \"this is how you push people away!\" He's not a professional. He can't fix me. He didn't sign on for a batshit insane friend. I get it. I don't blame him for stepping back. BUT DON'T FUCKING ASK HOW I AM AND THEN FREAK OUT WHEN YOU DON'T LIKE THE ANSWER. DON'T ACT LIKE YOU ARE GONNA BE THERE FOR SOMEONE AND THEN GHOST WITHOUT A WORD WHEN YOU GET OVERWHELMED. Look, I'm not angry at YOU. I'm angry at all the YOUS out there who pull this bullshit and spray all these platitudes like pesticides on a cornfield. These are not unique ideas. We have all heard them. I was suicidal an hour ago. Check my post history. BOY OH BOY am I glad I didn't run into this bullshit when I was suicidal. This would've made things worse. Calling me selfish would just play into my worst fears about myself. Telling me to just hang in there and do something I like would have just made me feel bad for not being able to do that one simple thing.It's admirable to want to help people. But spraying us all with generic positivity buckshot is not the way to do it. Check your assumptions. Don't call us names. Don't assume that your circumstances are like ours. Look, I'm not every suicidal person on this sub. Maybe this did help someone! That would be great! But reading the comments on here, I'm not the only person who had a visceral reaction to this. Please take this feedback from someone WHO IS CURRENTLY LIVING IN THIS HELL. If you really really want to help us, please do some reading about what sorts of things help.
