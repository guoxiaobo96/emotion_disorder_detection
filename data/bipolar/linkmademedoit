I am scared of passing on my genes but I think of it this way, I now understand the signs I displayed as a young child and teenager that I had mental health issues. As someone who has experienced that and knows what to look for, I feel more prepared to catch it as early as possible if it does happen and help my child through it. If mental health issues don't present until adulthood, I'll be prepared for that too and work through getting my child help as I need. The percentage is relatively low. And there is no guarantee that if you pass on the disorder it will present itself. But in my family, I am their proof that you can succeed despite the disorder and I hope that with medications and support my child will be too. Idk, I feel like I'm not explaining it right. You don't have to decide today. You're young. It's taken me a decade to decide I want children. I used to hate the idea of passing it on, I still do, but it's worth the risk to me. Like I said, even if they get the gene, it may not even present itself. We, unfortunately, are the lucky ones who it decided to present itself in.", "link_id": "t3_g2xb6o", "time": 1587138129}}

I think most are listening right now. Even if they don't adjust the classes they may be willing to help you personally. I'm in my last semester of grad school and throughout my college experience I've learned most professors want to see you succeed. I started noticing signs of a depressive episode coming my way (increased therapy sessions and meds were adjusted which eased me out) but I'm still feeling blank and have a lack of motivation most days. If you're able, do a telehealth visit with your doctor's. It's nice to have someone to talk to who understands what you're going through. Just some ideas that are helping me through this (I created this from talking to other people and finding out what they do to keep busy and motivated. I know it's hard when you're depressed. This is why number 1 is the first thing I did) this is in no way meant to be medical advice. I'm a social worker but I'm not a medical professional.:Make a schedule and try to schedule some mindless activities like cleaning. Include time for school work even if it's just 30 minutes here and there.Eat healthy.Engage in something creative (I'm doing lettering)Stick to a proper sleep routineTake naps if you become worn out.Exercise. I started doing yoga from YouTube videos.Get some sunshine.Call a friend or family member instead of text (I don't know your relationships so maybe talk to your therapist to find out if this is good for you. I know there are some people that I can't talk to that are off my list)If I come up with more I can always come back and post.

One semester in undergraduate I had to medically withdraw because of the disorder. I did get a few Ds and Fs in there. The best advice I can give is to keep seeing your doctor and go to therapy. The therapist should help you work through daily struggles and the psychiatrist or nurse practitioner should help you get stable on your medications. It took 6 years for me to get stable on my meds. It doesn't happen overnight. I'm on 4 different medications and we are hanging on the edge of a 5th. Others have more, some have less. I struggled in my classes with and without meds. I have to be open with my professors and tell them when I am struggling. I have even told some of them about the disorder and my medication change and have been given extensions or extra assignments to keep my grades up. It also depends on your own determination. You and I may be different. I was determined to prove people wrong, that some people with bipolar disorder could lead a successful life too with the proper treatment. I was determined to be proud of myself. For me, I needed meaning to keep going because some days would have been easy to just give up. Also, look for support. If you have people who know about your disorder, seek out their support too. That can help you move forward if you need someone else to talk to. Oh and to put it into context I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 with rapid cycling. Don't let the disorder define you. You'll make it through this. We are proof it's possible. Now you just need to hold onto the determination within yourself. &lt;3", "link_id": "t3_fpy8xv", "time": 1585327738}}
