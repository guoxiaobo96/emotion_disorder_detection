When he finally stops I inform him that he can't use that ladder because it's fo employees only. He then demanded that I go up and get him a full pallet of shingles two racks up, nevermind the fact that a new pallet of the same shingles were on the bottom rack and he had access to flatbed carts in the same aisle. I told him that, as well as the fact that a ladder would not be the correct thing to use. His genius response was \"well what am I supposed to get it down with?\" The correct answer here is a forklift. He then demanded I get the forklift, and I told him I wasn't certified. He then offered to do it, which I denied for the obvious reason of he's a customer. I informed him that our forklift driver was out to lunch, so he responded with \"well then go get your manager.\" My manager is on vacation for the week, and I told him such. He then asked if he should just go to Home Depot, to which I replied, \"well, that would be your choice and I can't stop you.\" He then suggested I just leave the ladder with him while I go find a manager.

She will also need water, so lightly mist part of the enclosure with a spray bottle or get some damp cotton balls so it's moist enough. If you do mist her enclosure, be careful not to spray her. If you ever need to get something off her (sometimes tiny bits of debris/white specks make their way into them) try to get her back into the jar like you did when you got her the first time. Gently place her in the freezer for about 10 minutes to slow her down, and very gently swab her with a Q-tip. Be aware, her abdomen is VERY sensitive and she'll probably try to bite you if you're not careful with the Q-tip (which is why you need to slow her down in the freezer). Also be advised that if you get an adult from the wild, there is a chance she could be gravid (pregnant). You can either sell off the egg sacks, or freeze them to kill the slings. If you feed her too often, she could run the risk of bursting her abdomen from a fall (not likely, but still something to watch out for).
