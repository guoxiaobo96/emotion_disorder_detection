{"fs9uj4o": {"text": "I have bipolar disorder, here's how I got started treating my mental illness.I started having depressive and hypomanic episodes when I was 14, but I always believed that it was disrespectful to people who were \"actually depressed\" for me to say I was feeling depressed. At one point in high school, I made a post very similar to this one asking for help. I didn't seek help until years later when things came to a drastic point when I was 18. I was thinking about committing suicide almost every day, sneaking liquor from my parents to drink alone, and I found no joy in life.I didn't want anyone to know I was feeling this way. I had no idea where to start, so I went to my family doctor. He asked me some questions about how I was feeling, and then he referred me to a therapist. I went to college and got a therapist there, too. After a couple of weeks of counseling, I went to a psychiatrist to try antidepressants. It was difficult, but I told my mom that I was feeling depressed.Long story short, every time I sought out help for my mental illness, it was because it had reached a breaking point. It is so difficult to realize that you need help, and you're doing so much just by making this post. Through lots of therapy and psychiatry, I've learned how to manage my mental illness, and it's possible for you too.Please seek help from a doctor or therapist, they can help you manage your symptoms and figure out how to communicate these things with the people in your life. I wish I would have told people how I was feeling when I started feeling that way, my teenage years would have been so much less difficult.

I think if I had more than a week to do it, I would write for more instruments, but hey whatever right!!I wrote this song about the good times of a relationship of mine that just ended.

I would wake up and go to school, do some afterschool activities, and then go to bed, only to wake up exhausted. The way I felt was that there was nothing in my life that I cared for, no one in my life that cared about me, and nothing that I could like about myself.The thing I regret most is that I never talked to anyone about it. I would go through every day pretending to be happy- I was good at it. If I can give any advice, it would be this: try to talk to someone about this. If there is any way that you can get a counselor or therapist, that would be ideal. When I think back to those times and how much I was suffering, I wish that I could tell my past self that it's okay to not be okay. Two years ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. When I was feeling this way in high school and middle school, I was having depressive episodes. Being bipolar isn't something that is easy to tackle alone, and things are much easier with other people on your side. While it does sound to me like you're feeling really depressed, I'm not trying to imply that you have a chronic mental illness or anything- it's ok if you do or if you don't, either way, no one deserves to feel as bad as you do. Through therapy, I've learned that a lot of the self-esteem issues I have are rooted in bad experiences I've had (bullying, etc.). I've come to realize that most of it is in my head. Even with this said, I still struggle with it sometimes. I guess what I'm saying is that ***self-compassion is necessary***. There is nothing inherently wrong with you, and you deserve love and happiness just as much as anyone else. It may not feel like it if you're having problems initiating social interactions, but I promise that you matter.Therapy can help work some of these things out, and that's why I recommend it so much. Try not to despair; things can and will get better with time and effort, and you deserve to be happy.I'm rooting for you, best of luck, friend :)", "link_id": "t3_d2xloh", "time": 1568239637}}
