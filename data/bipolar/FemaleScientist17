If you are planning an experiment talk to ithers for input, ask for help, and read papers.

{"e6kny0a": {"text": "So it seems like you have every reason to be stressed out. You are very busy with work and school and fighting with your partner is definitely adding to it. Do not beat yourself up about anxiety and insomnia. As someone who has had both I know how hard it can be. It makes a more difficult day even more miserable. The best thing to do imo is to try and see if you can schedule things differently and prioritize items more. Is it possible to take a smaller course load? Work fewer hours to allow more time to study? Take some time to think about different possibilities. Also make sure you take some time for yourself. Be kind to yourself and realize that without your health, mental or otherwise, nothing can happen. Prioritize yourself. Maybe see if you can attend therapy once in awhile? That can help with stress management but also learning to be kinder to yourself. For insomnia there are some OTC supplements and sleep aids you can try. Obviously this isn\u2019t the best option for everyone based on medication interactions or personal choice or whatever the reason may be.

For me work and education was the most important thing my entire life, but when my world fell apart I have learned that you have nothing if you don\u2019t have your health. My PI doesn\u2019t know about my diagnosis but he does know that I have health issues. He is understanding about me having to be at appts and sometimes even taking a day off. I work as hard as I can in lab, but I don\u2019t overdo it because that can be chaotic for me. As for labmates, they don\u2019t know my diagnosis either, but know I have health issues. If they were actually nicer and more understanding people I might tell them, but knowing them rather well I feel like they would be judgemental. Everyone\u2019s situation is different so telling then or anyone is something you should think about and base on your experiences with those people, which can be really scary but also can be rewarding in the end. As for the leave of absence, if you feel that is what\u2019s best and will help you find your footing then do it. Ultimately, taking care of your mental health will make your life better overall.

I am on meds and sometimes they work really well while other times I feel like it will never be better. But for me, I went from having no good days to having a few good days in between bad ones. That tells me that it can get better. If it can get better for me, it can get better for you too.

Medication may not be the best route for everyone, but seeking professional help is a very good idea. It's helped me so much that I'm beginning to get my life back.
