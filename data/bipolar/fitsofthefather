A few days ago I was on the highest acuity unit (schizophrenia, psychotic D/O,  manic bipolar, assaultive patients, etc) as the only nurse with 18 patents for more than half the day before a second nurse finally came. We are under investigation, so the amount of work they keep piling on nurses to satisfy surveyors is absurd. They make no effort to try to figure out how to make the system easier for nurses. They just give us more work. And all of this keeps me from actually giving good patient care, because I'm too busy charting (paper, ugh). I've noticed that a lot of nurses who are able to get all their work done do so by lying about assessments, because a good assessment takes too much time. I got into psych because of my own mental health struggles and a desire to help this egregiously underserved population. Instead I'm just a cog in a machine that gives terrible care so some CEO's have a good quarter. I'm part of the problem, and I wish I could explain to my patient sobbing alone in her room that I DO care, I want to sit and talk with you, but I can't because... I have to chart. On top of all of this--- nobody respects psych nurses. There is no pride in the job. Other nurses turn their noses up at psych. We aren't even trained in therapeutic communication or coping skills or psych meds, or anything relevant to the specialty that might give us any kind of expertise at all at my job. You have to do this on your own, and many nurses just don't.  Management doesn't care if you're a good psych nurse at my job, they care if you did all your treatment plans for Tylenol. From the beginning I wanted psych. I am passionate about it, and eventually want to become a psych NP. But now I'm seriously second guessing this choice. I'm still in my first year as a nurse and wondering if I should jump ship and try another specialty. I'm sorry I totally used your post as an opportunity to vent. I just can't believe how disappointing psych nursing has been. I'm so sorry about what you're going through. I'm also the one supporting my husband and kid, and so scared to take a cut to start over in another area of nursing.Personally I don't think you should leave nursing because of a bad psych gig. There are lots of opportunities in nursing where the pay is good but you don't have to do bedside. Being an RN opens a lot of doors.

I thought that by becoming a psych nurse I could make a difference and give the kind of care I needed at the time, but I can't. The for-profit hospital machine is too heartless, both to employees and patients. I'm hoping I eventually find a psych job where it actually feels like I'm helping patients. Aside from the system, there are so many psych nurses who are there for the wrong reasons. It's easy to feel jaded when the nurses don't seem to care and your Dr spends 5 minutes with you.I also think patients get hyperfocused on the \"guinea pig\" feeling that the trial-and-error nature of psychiatry causes. Mental illness causes a lot of mistrust and negativity and hopelessness, and it's easy to turn those feelings on the psychiatry industry, especially when you can try dozens of medications and medication combinations before you get any kind of relief....

It's ok to swallow the saliva, you just won't get as much out of ketamine that you swallow, so you want to give it time under the tongue. However I have a feeling that letting all your saliva pool in your mouth for 15 minutes is actually preventing the ketamine from being absorbed because you're diluting the fluid that sits against the mucus membranes that absorb the ketamine with your saliva. So I would try letting small amounts of saliva pool for a few minutes then swallowing. Keep repeating that until it's gone. You should be able to taste how concentrated or diluted it is in your mouth, so if it still tastes strongly of ketamine, let it sit. If it tastes \"weak\", swallow.

Like so many others, I've been terrified of passing this illness on, but eventually we decided to be a little more flexible wth birth control and see if it happened (basically switching to rhythm method only). Well it happened immediately, even though we avoided my supposed ovulation window (and I'm 35+!).  This was quite a shock, but I couldn't be happier.Heritability of bipolar disorder is supposedly around 25%, but genetic predisposition doesn't guarantee full-blown illness, either. And while I wouldn't wish bipolar on anyone, I also know I will be much better prepared to help my daughter should she inherit it than my parents were. How many of us were raised by supportive, savvy parents? I'd guess very few. I'm certain I would have a much milder form of bipolar, if it emerged at all, had my parents handled things differently. That's the hope I cling to, but I'd also be lying if I said I have no anxiety about passing it on.I have bipolar II and spend a lot of time in a mild depressive state (used to be more severe before ketamine therapy), but cycle through different shades of depression and periods of remission. My pregnancy was about 20% severely depressed, 40% mildly depressed, 40% remitted/euthymic. This is similar to how I am with ketamine therapy. I felt pretty amazing when euthymic and pregnant (not hypomanic though). I had a LOT of stress during my pregnancy and would guess if I hadn't, I would have had more frequent/longer good phases.I waa on lithium 600mg daily and quit immediately with a positive pregnancy test at 3 weeks. Lithium has always been more insurance against really bad episodes than truly stabilizing, and I don't think stopping it mattered.I was also on ketamine intranasal 2x a week. It was rough not having this failsafe to pull me out of episodes, but I still felt better unmedicated and pregnant than I ever have unmedicated and not-pregnant.I was also on clonidine to regulate sleep/anxiety, and stayed on it during my pregnancy. This probably helped keep me stable-iish since my wacky sleep cycles make me more ill. I stopped it after giving birth though, because I can't take something to sleep with this little milk goblin waking me up every 2 hours!The postpartum period has been far better than I expected. I've adjusted just fine to sleeping in 2 hour shifts...way, way betrer than I expected.

Mostly it's been waves of milder depression, which I can handle. And having this little person to focus on me helps give me purpose and motivation, which I think keeps me from sinking deeper into a deeper depression. I was so curious about other people's experiences as parents with bipolar, and I think it's so important we help inform each other.

Like being drunk, but less stupid and less sick. -- Maybe you know this, but you should really try to get off kratom before starting ketamine. We don't have enough research to know if this is safe. Some docs will not prescribe ketamine if you have any substance abuse/dependence issues.--sidepoint: someone said you won't \"get high\" from intranasal, and it's only 200mg per bottle per month. Both statements are incorrect. Prescription intranasal bottles are usually 1g-1.5g a month. If you are not an addict, you will easily trip on  ~1mg/lb body weight. You should not follow that person's advice, because 500mg is *way too much* for a new user. I would never want to see someone jump in at the 500mg level...yikes. I started on 80mg-100mg at a time with intranasal (a week following IV infusions, but I don't know what my dose was on those) and tripped harder the first time than I ever did during an infusion. I've had 3 years of using ketamine 1-3x a week, varying from 150mg to 300mg each time. I usually have a trip experience, and if I don't, I know tolerance is building so I take a break to regain sensitivity. The trip experience is a good measure of how well it's affecting me. That said *you do not need to get high on ketamine to benefit.*Sometimes I prefer not to. That's just the dosage schedule that seems to work for me. --also note that everyone is different.

{"ej7ohqf": {"text": "Hey I'm pregnant too! However, I quit drinking about 2 years ago, so that has made this easier than I had always anticipated. But I can understand your feelings completely, because for years I always wondered...how the heck will I quit when I get pregnant? It seemed utterly impossible. 9 months without wine or beer?? I was a 3-4 glasses of wine a night drinker, too, for several years. But that is now so far in the past it is truly hard to even remember I did that. Recently I asked my husband...did I really drink every night? Yes, he said, every night.  It feels like a faded dream. And an extraordinary waste of money!The a-ha moment for me was when a friend who is on the same depression treatment as I am (ketamine) said it doesn't work if he drinks. I tried his advice, abstained a few times when I took my ketamine, and realized it was true. I know this may not seem relevant to you, but it started a fundamental shift in my thinking about alcohol. If it was negating my medicine (the only medicine to help severe intractable depression in 15+ years), and perpetuating depression, then...it was poison. Meanwhile I was taking a pharmacology class where I learned about alcohol downregulating your Gaba receptors (they influence anxiety), making you more prone to anxiety and dependent on alcohol to relieve it. Alcohol doesn't truly relieve anxiety...*it causes it in the first place.* Ok, so this shit is truly poison. I \"knew\" this before, but couldn't really accept it. I was in denial and wanted to keep chasing the buzz.And that was another thing: as I started to pay more attention to my experience with alcohol, I became acutely aware that the only time I actually felt good from drinking was during the initial buzz after the first drink or two. That buzz lasted maybe 15-30 minutes, but it seemed I was spending another couple of hours trying to get that feeling back, and never did. I would just get sloppier. So I was poisoning myself for hours for a 15-30min buzz. What a waste of my brain!What I'm trying to demonstrate to you is that the most important thing is that you educate yourself and get in touch with yourself in a way that will radically shift how you view alcohol. It is poison for you (and your baby, but of course you know that and I don't mean to shame you!). Knowing that and understanding that help make stopping so much easier. As someone else suggested, research like crazy-- it helps shift perspective.Some of the hardest times when I quit were social events, but soon I realized I had been living a 10 year lie; I did not need alcohol to be confident, social, or funny. I did not need alcohol to ease anxiety. I only believed I did, and allowed myself to be a victim of that belief. And ultimately, alcohol frequently made my anxiety so much worse the day after. I never writhe in shame obsessing over \"oh god what did I say last night??\" anymore.  I'm so much healthier and happier socially than I ever was with alcohol.I have no idea if any of this is relatable or helpful to you. I just want to show you that reliance on alcohol is a chemical dependency and a bit of mythology (you don't *need it*), and all of that can be uprooted and overcome. And once on the other side, you might never view alcohol the same way.Good luck to you-- I fully believe you can do this! Congrats on the wee one :)", "link_id": "t3_b4j43e", "time": 1553366879}}

If you were brought up in a chaotic household, these patterns of extremes feel 'normal' to you, and true 'normal' actually feels boring. An abusive partner feeds us these extremes again and keeps us in a cycle of chaos that is familiar and satisfying, even if traumatic. I know (or at least recognize in hindsight) that for me, I was addicted to the drama of catching my Nex in lies, and also heavily hooked on the apologies, reparations, and deep relief I felt when we reconciled. I was absolutely furious with his behavior, but I was far more afraid of not being loved by him than I was angry. If he could apologize and make it up to me, I would be high on falling in love all over again. Being alone and unloved was much worse than the cycle of abuse. And my family life growing up had already taught me that abuse isn't a reason to leave, and extreme drama is normal.I'm not sure if it works the same way as other addictions, but I would guess it's very similar. It's an \"adrenaline junkie\" type addiction.

I am nothing, but from nothing I can build something.You are seeking treatment for OCD, which tells me you likely struggle a great deal with feeling out of control. I'm here to tell you that with ketamine, you are given some control back. You are given the power to dive in deep and rewrite aberrant patterns in the mind. This does *not* mean you will have full power of every trip-- I wouldn't recommend trying to control them if you feel you have a mind that works against you. Instead, ride it like a wave, with nonjudgment; go in with curiosity and openness, as if seeking a higher power. When presented with ugliness, ask the void-- what can I learn from this? How can I heal it? When you feel the guilt and shame and darkness overtake you, ask that this be the bottom of it, like an extinction event, a final hard cry before relief. Allow yourself to feel it, grieve it, and say goodbye. Then ask, *what next*?There is something very freeing in being nothing to the universe. To all of existence, you are nearly insignificant. But to your immediate sphere of influence, you could mean the world. That is where I have arrived. We have tremendous power to do good and to matter on the local scale.

This generic ketamine is prescribed \"off-label,\" which means the FDA has not approved it for depression but dr's prescribe it for this use anyway.

Exercise is also great for the comedown from stimulants. And meditation helps me reduce the amount of stimulants I need.

There are pill pusher docs and anti-stimulant docs out there, but only you can really know the right balance for yourself.[Edit] btw many bipolar specialists think ADD in bipolar is actually caused by damage that bipolar disorder does to the brain.

Bipolar is a \"stress-related\" illness, and while we may not always notice the direct connection, frequently it is stressors that cause major mood shifts.I've studied lithium quite a bit and find it a very fascinating drug. You're right that it tends to be mellowing, and even \"zombifiying\" for some. But causing anxiety at that level seems unlikely, at least from my understanding. It's also potentially very protective against stress-- it's believed to modulate the neurotransmitters/receptors that become overexcited by systemic stress responses, which in turn protects the brain from excitotoxicity/damage/depression. So it might actually be helping you get through the stressright now. However I don't want to discount what you're feeling, and if you think it's the lithium, definitely don't continue on a path that is causing that level of anxiety! I always try to stick things out as long as I can but severe anxiety is probably the biggest demon out there...don't suffer if it's too much.The zombifiying effects can be a real problem for some people, so I get that.

I'm too convinced of the \"good\" it can do and scared of the bad my brain does when left to its own devices. Lithium is believed to do many things, including help grow neuronal connections, modulate neurotransmitters/receptors, and modulate aberrant DNA transcription (I find that one really cool!).

It's true this chipping away is what causes dependence, which *is* often discussed, but many people think \"well I don't have a problem with addiction, I can quit when I need to,\" while gradually and insidiously benzos steal your own brain's ability to calm itself. It's not really about what you can handle going in, because they change your brain. In my personal opinion they should only be 'rescue' meds, to be used once a week or less. There are other, less dependency-promoting options put there, but I do fully understand the desperation for something to wipe it all away.

Ketamine greatly affects balance and coordination. It will probably not take 24 hours to recover, but it could take ~2-6. Many people report feeling 'hungover' for as much as 24hrs after, but I was usually ok to drive a car after 1-2.

Any reason to be concerned about not having nearby personal support? My therapist and family will be available by phone/video.This really depends on the person. I wouldn't say it's a true concern, or a safety concern at least, more that it's just \"nice\" to talk to a close friend/family member after. I often come out of my treatments with what I call \"highpiphanies,\" or really powerful realizations that I need to talk out with someone. I find it really difficult to write after ketamine, so a patient ear is nice-- and important. Patient is key, because I just ramble! You could accomplish this on the phone/video though.If your therapist is willing, I would strongly recommend a phone/video session within an hour or two of the treatment (maybe a later one so you know what to expect). The 'afterglow' is a very powerful time in my experience. I've done a lot of my best 'reprogramming' then and would have loved to have a therapist help with that.  Many people who try ketamine for depression say \"I finally understand what my therapist is saying.\" There's a clarity that happens that allows a lot of great work to be done.Don't stress too much about side effects.

It appears to increase seratonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline concentrations in key areas following (or in conjunction with) stress-induction tests. This is important because stress depletes these neurochemicals. Note that ginseng was the positive control they used for these tests (a thing already known to work that they can compare BM to) and it worked as well or better than BM, but they also used a higher dose of ginseng. In memory and learning tests, the rats performed better than controls. These rats also had increases in seratonin, but dopamine concentrations were much lower than controls. This might seem counterintuitive, but I can see how this could potentially be beneficial in those who are prone to stress during some tasks as dopamine contributes to stress. Anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. The authors suggest more research is warranted on this.BM seems to have a pretty impressive neuroprotective and potentially neuroregenerative profile. It also increases blood flow to the brain. But my assumption based on what I read is that it is best as an adaptogen for those who experience chronic stress, for acute episodes of stress, while engaging in unhealthy eating/drinking/smoking behaviors, or possibly for repair if you have certain mild neurocognitive conditions (which could include depression and anxiety, as these can be neurotoxic. Many theorize that \"ADHD\" in bipolar disorder is in fact a result of neurotoxic damage from stress and extreme mood states). I'm thinking if you are a chill person, it's probably not going to do as much, and might make you fatigued. I think the authors even say this, but I'm not finding it now. BM seems to be better suited to modulating overuse of NT's and replenishing certain NT's during/after stress.", "link_id": "t3_89stg0", "time": 1522939537}}

I've greatly reduced ketamine recently due to adverse effects, but it is what helped me reverse depression in the first place. Now I implement other things to stay on track, like a big ol' grandma weekly pill box with 4 compartments for each day.Supplements (don't remember dosages right now): Vitamin D, folinic acid, N-acetylcysteine, magnesium (do not take at same time as lithium), omega-3, B12/b6 complex ( I'm vegetarian), and I eat a lot of probiotic foods. Everything I take (and do) is backed by research.Lifestyle management with high priority to prevent depression:Exercise 4x a week, ketogenic diet, sleep 8-9 hours each night, darkness/no blue light 9+ hours a night, stress management, meditation, social interaction/support, work ahead of deadlines, keep a daily planner to manage schedule, don't be late to things (s t r e s s), be judicious with dexedrine use (pretty darn triggering, but exercise helps), manage physical illness/pain, spend time outside, work toward goals that make me feel accomplished (because good news is as positively triggering as bad news is negatively for me), know when to set boundaries with toxic family members or when to walk away from negative friendships.That's the gist I think! I'm thinking about making a more detailed post about this here, maybe it could help some people. It probably sounds overwhelming, but I don't do all of these all the time.

It's like running a marathon, and just when you get to the end, someone moves the finish line beyond reach.It's so easy to hate ourselves with mental illness and forget that it is an *illness.* The trouble is it hijacks parts of the brain that most people have better control of, so we are left saying *but why can't I do that* and *what's wrong with me.*I think it helps to stop trying to 'fix' and start trying to manage. Take a look at sickle cell anemia as an analogy: If patients get sick and get a fever, their blood can't hold as much oxygen. When oxygen goes down, their blood cells turn into a sickle shape. Sickle cells are then even worse at carrying oxygen, and cause problems by clogging blood vessels, which means even less oxygen in tissues and even more sickle cells more...and so on. This is sickle cell crisis.Bipolar is the same way in that certain precipitating factors-- internal or external-- can start a cascade of events that become self-perpetuating. It takes work figuring out your own 'bipolar crisis' factors and what interventions will work for you. I firmly believe we all have more tools in our toolbox than we let ourselves believe. It's such a painful and exhausting disease and it's easy to believe we're helpless. I don't know what your lifestyle is like, but try to look at bipolar disorder as a systemic disease, not just mental illness. How would you treat your body differently? How much kinder might you be to yourself? People with sickle cell disease don't despise themselves because they have sickle cell. They educate themselves on triggers, prevention, warning signs, when to see a dr, and interventions. I feel if we can take the self-loathing out and see bipolar as an illness to be managed, we'll all be so much better off. Instead of reduced oxygen, the trigger for bipolar is almost always stress-related. Maybe there's something to be gained from figuring out your triggers and best coping skills. What precipitates depression? What keeps you well?Getting out of depression is the hardest part. It's ok you can't shower; you're sick. Just figure out what you're capable of and *do that each day*.

{"dwmz0ki": {"text": "And? Severe, unremitting depression has a complex etiology related to genetic and environmental factors (especially during childhood and adolescence). It is unlikely to ever be totally cured, and it is exceedingly rare for anyone to remit from severe treatment-resistant depression without ongoing medication or booster therapy with TMS, ECT, ketamine, etc. But just because re-treatment is necessary doesn't mean the treatment isn't curative, if only temporarily. I liken my wellness to a spinning top: with ketamine and lifestyle management, I can keep the top spinning upright. But with triggering external factors or even just with time, the top begins to wobble. Ketamine helps me set it right again. Like ketamine, ECT is both neurotoxic and neuroregenerative. Ketamine is believed to work by blocking the NMDA recepto overactive glutamate activity (especially in key areas mentioned in the posted article) and by increasing BDNF, which leads to neurogenesis. However, as with anything in the brain, it gets complicated-- both of these mechanisms can cause improvement in some areas and harm in others.

I also have identity issues/disassociation/borderline traits and saw plenty of dark underside with ketamine. I can elaborate if there's interest. But ultimately, it's been a tremendous net positive.[edit] Elaborating since there's interest! I started with 6 IV infusions which were very light and peaceful, then started intranasal treatments that I administer at home. My doctor's philosophy is that the psychedelic experience is conducive to recovery, so for the first 18 months I almost always used a dose large enough to induce the \"khole\" experience. I no longer believe this is necessary and only experience this once a month or less now.It would be difficult to try to describe the ketamine 'trip,' but since you guys are interested in the darker side, I'll try to cover that:I already, for so many years, felt alien and like an outsider in the world. I had trouble understanding \"who I am\" long after adolescence when that's typical. I was constantly trying to define myself through other people's eyes, and once I was diagnosed with Bipolar II (mostly depressive type), I became really paranoid and preoccupied with the idea that I was 'crazy,' and constantly felt too weird. I was afraid people would see through me to how alien/other I am. Ketamine, both during trips and for weeks or months on end in the first year, made these feelings worse. I became even more preoccupied with people thinking I was crazy or strange or alien. Sometimes when I started treatments with ketamine I would obsess over past conversations and how weird I must have seemed-- I know a lot of depressed people do this, but this was even more than usual (As an aside-- people in my life have been surprised when I explain this is how I feel. I'm often described as an extrovert and am generally friendly and talkative. But I had no sense of how people saw me!). Over time with ongoing ketamine therapy, it felt as if I was putting my own self and identity back together. As if ketamine took me 'down to the studs'-- tore me down and ripped me open so I could put myself back together. That's the best way I can sum up the darkness and why I don't consider it problematic overall.There are also, occasionally, dark moments in my trips, but they feel more bizarre than sinister. I've only ever had one trip (among hundreds) that was 'bad' enough to get up and shake it off, and that was related to things in my life at the time. The disassociative and identity-stripping experiences surrounding treatment have been very uncomfortable and disorienting, but don't seem to happen often these days.Today I mostly do light booster treatments, and even with 'trips' I don't feel that same discomfort I used to. I think that's in huge part due to having figured out my recovery. It's only very rarely that I have been in as deep a depression as I was the first year, so maybe my 'baseline' identity is more solid and not so easily scrambled. I was not a great responder by the way-- some people remit with 1 infusion series, but for me it takes ongoing treatment, dose adjustment, and lifestyle management.

I don't know if I can answer your question about ROA fully, because maybe more infusions could have helped me. But it's the same drug at different levels of bioavailability; I don't think infusions are superior, they're just better regulated/have more oversight...and make more $. Personally I much prefer intranasal because I'm in control of my dosage and regimen (which is exactly why some physicians *don't* like it). I can also create my own 'set and setting' that is more conducive to self-growth. I treat it like my own research project and take it very seriously to get max benefit/minimum harm, so I appreciate that freedom with intranasal. And if I'm suicidal, I can reverse it in minutes without scheduling an appointment and paying $300. Also, interestingly, I have stronger psychedelic experiences with intranasal than IV. Partly the dosage and partly because the doctor's office was a bit stifling of that.It wasn't hard to get intranasal after IV infusions through a local 'ketamine clinic,' where I found my pdoc. They are all different though. I had to demonstrate need and a lack of substance abuse issues. Nothing formal, just a questionnaire and consultation. I did have alcohol and marijuana dependence, but I'm free of those now!Note that I'm a fairly weak responder, and it took a full year of intranasal treatment to figure out what regimen works for me. I also had to quit alcohol and started a ketogenic diet. Ketamine doesn't work alone, but it grants hope and a little more of an \"I can handle this\" perspective so you can do the things you need to be healthy. For some, it eradicates depression. But for me, it helped me learn how to manage it myself, and offers rescue when I'm at the bottom. I still get depressed, but 1/4 as often and rarely as deeply.I'm so sorry you can't afford it.

It's something we tend to struggle with, but it's necessary to reduce stress and improve attention/cognition. The more depressed I am, the more 'ADHD' I feel. And the more ADHD I am, the further things unravel and the more depressed I get. Keep a planner and use it religiously. I use an hourly planner and plan out every hour of studying with breaks. Then I 'check off' if I did what I planned that hour. It helps me stay accountable and feel accomplished. Other days (especially if feeling unfocused) I set goals by pages/chapters read or by notecards completed by chapter. I think setting small goals is key to keeping on track.I use dexedrine sparingly, and my recommendation on stimulant meds is to use them to work *ahead*, not to cram or catch up. Cramming with them just compounds stress and destabilizes. But I think they make a great tool for some of us when used sparingly under low-stress conditions.Definitely get out of a toxic environment if you can. You *have to* treat your illness first, and that means eliminating or managing all triggers effectively.

Will this train of thought possibly cause a bad experience during the infusions? I think this will depend on your dosage. My infusion experiences were very mild because my doctor started me low. I never felt out of control or scared, and in fact I never 'tripped' until the final infusion. And that experience was completely blissful.Ketamine is a really sensitive drug. If you have your eyes closed and it feels too intense, just open them. It is not like LSD or mushrooms where you can't change course. If your dr is one who talks to you during it, you will probably not feel out of control, but you will likely feel a little weird. &gt;2) During th\u00e9 infusions, what should I think about? Should I avoid thinking of traumatic things that have happened to me, or should I try to focus on those things to gain a new perspective?The first time, I would just relax and try to enjoy it. It can be a very soothing, meditative experience. Once you're comfortable with it you might work on past trauma, but don't feel obligated. It has helped me with some past things, but every experience is different, so I just 'go' where it takes me. It's not surrendering control exactly, more like ' going with the flow.'

Just stares out the window. So my fiancee will say \"oh are you sure you want to take your lithium before we go out?! You'll be a vegetable!\" or he'll call them 'coma pills.' It's so silly. Lithium is part of a cocktail that helps me function as a normal human with a normal range of emotions.

Their job is to entertain (and make $ at it...) so they portray it in whatever way is the most interesting, truth be damned. It's the same with so many other areas of entertainment-- how they portray medicine/hospitals, for example-- but mental health is the area that I think this fictionalizing causes the most harm. Not only does it scare people away from treatment, but it also perpetuates a great deal of stigma. This forces us into the 'closet' and further prevents people from getting help.

Nihilists believe there is no objective meaning, but what I believe is that there is no *inherent* meaning. I do not believe we were put here for a reason. But just because we may not have been \"created\" with a purpose, does not mean that we don't have moral obligation or meaning. Morality is inherent to humans and many other animals, and each day you are faced with choices that affect the lives of other living things. In my opinion, the meaning comes from 1) observing that others suffer, and empathizing with them 2) knowing that I can have a role in that suffering, for good or bad 3) reducing suffering where I can. But there are other realms of meaning, like art, creativity, exploration, science. There is plenty of meaning in the actions we take and the effect we have on others. There is meaning in being kind or reducing our carbon footprint. And it will sound counter-intuitive, but there is meaning in recognizing that we are just a very tiny part of a much bigger Universe, and recognizing our insignificance at this level. The meaning is in recognizing that *we don't matter* at that level, but we are still a part of everything, and meanwhile on the micro level, we can have great significance. So that is where I try to operate-- the level of my greatest influence. I don't care as much about dying as some do. It is hard to explain, but Taoism did bring me peace with that, but I feel that any way I say it will sound nihilistic.

I'm just not as caught up in the trappings of my own life and importance.

I had followed the research once I became aware of it, but outside of research studies it was too costly for me to try at first. I would have joined a study, but was not qualified; I was on medication typically, and I have bipolar disorder, which was excluded in earlier studies. A few years ago I moved to a new city, got into nursing school, and subsequently hit a new low that left me looking for \"nuclear\" options. After floundering with depression for so many years, I was desperate for something to bring me back to life before I started school. I should say I was always desperate for something, but getting into an intensive program added extra pressure. I saw an article in the Washington Post on ketamine, and it occurred to me that it could be cheaper now that I was in a new city. It was-- by a lot. My doctor was involved in several research studies previously, and now has a private \"ketamine clinic.\" I paid out of pocket with help from my parents, who although supportive, aren't wealthy by any means, so it took convincing. I sent them the Post article and told them I was going to die without radical intervention. It sounds dramatic, but I fully believe that to be true. They helped, and I was able to get 6 initial infusions, with maintenance intranasal treatment that I get at a compounding pharmacy and pay out of pocket for. Not all doctors are willing to continue maintenance treatment like this (from what I've read on forums), so I'm very grateful I found the doctor I did. Like I mentioned, I'm a relatively weak responder, so the infusions did not have the lasting effect that they do for many others. I know several people who only see my doctor once a year or so for maintenance infusions. That was probably more detail than you needed, but that's the story :)I also used ketamine 15 years ago or so, when I was in the rave scene. Only a handful of times, and only for the buzzy semi-drunk feeling; I never experienced a khole then. But if I had known then that one day I would be getting an IV infusion of ketamine in a Dr's office, and then prescribed vials of my own to take at home, my mind would have been blown! It was so totally crazy to me at first. What I find interesting is that I remember feeling so light, free, and happy with ketamine use, and following it. I felt like a kid again, with a sort of unfettered conscience. I recognize now that I was experiencing the remittance of my depression, but of course chalked it up to it being a fun \"party drug\" then. By the way, I actually find the trips exhausting now, and rarely \"go under\" (I take as little as possible and just hang out instead of closing my eyes). I'm so sorry to hear about your bladder and kidney damage. I've become very paranoid about this, and although it's not the *only* reason, it's become another reason that I have become extremely diligent in managing my lifestyle to manage bipolar disorder. It takes a lot of time management and work, but it's worth it if I can reduce my ketamine usage. That said, I couldn't *even begin* to manage my life like this before ketamine. My doctor calls it a catalyst, and I find this to be accurate. It clears the static, negativity, and neuroticism so that you can think clearly and move forward. Depression is evil.

That's much higher than depression patients are prescribed. On mobile but I'll try to find it.Anecdotally as a ketamine patient for 2 years, I believe it does cause memory impairment long-term. But then so does depression, and my opinion is I'd rather the cure cause it than the disease. I have a life now. I'll take the trade-off, although it is disappointing.It's really tough to say what caused what, but I feel I noticed initial cognitive improvements with ketamine, and then a slow decline. I've been in school for the duration of ketamine treatment, and I feel like I have to work harder. Previously I could cram before tests and ace them, but now I need a couple of days at least...and sleep. This could also be due to aging, as I'm in my mid-30's now. And of course many other factors could be involved, but that's my experience.For reference, my dosing schedule:I'm prescribed 150mg 3x a week, but my Dr encourages me to find a protocol that works best. During bad weeks I take the prescribed course, but more typically I take 150mg 1x-2x a week now (I'm 150lbs. More than double the dose than in the study you posted, but less frequent). If things are going great I might not take it for 14-20 days.

I'm really interested in this too, thanks for starting the conversation.[edit] I forgot to answer other questions of yours. Tolerance: Because of rapid tolerance, it takes, at least for me (a relatively weak responder), a constant adjustment to balance tolerance with benefit. It can be really frustrating, and sometimes it doesn't work well at all, but as long as I give it about 5 days, it will be beneficial again. It doesn't always work as well as other times, but will do *something*.Efficacy: It's a weird drug that seems to have wildly varying effects and efficacy, but even when it isn't working well, I still find my depression does not go as low as before ketamine.

{"dut45ph": {"text": "There are some excellent responses here but I'd like to answer from the perspective of a prescription ketamine patient using it therapeutically for depression. I use 150mg-300mg 1-3x a week (I'm 150lbs; a 150mg dose is common, 300mg is rare and with some tolerance). There are three stages in my experience:1) The come up (open eyes): a bit like being drunk, but lighter. The world starts feeling strange and alien; once I've had a full dose I sometimes feel like time and reality are skipping or swapping somehow, but I rarely hallucinate. I highly recommend staying away from social media or anything that requires much cognitive effort like reading. I like to listen to chillstep and play with the app \"Triple A\" (mute it to use your own music). That app mimics, in a very simplistic way, what a k trip does; your brain will create a music video. Once the world feels pretty wonky, put a sleep mask on or dark cloth over your eyes, get comfortable, and close your eyes. (also pee first and make sure you have a mellow or upbeat playlist cued up; you will not want to get up, and the music will guide your trip)The trip (closed eyes): Relax and let go. You ask about therapeutic benefits: I have been able to work through very painful memories and knots in my psyche with ketamine. The ultra-connected and safe/warm/' everything is ok' feeling it gives allowed me to view things from a meta-perspective, forgive myself and others, and move on. But if I were just doing it once and not as medicine, I would be more inclined to let my brain take me where it wants to and have fun. The great thing about K is it's much easier to bail on than, say, with LSD. If it's too intense, open your eyes, sit up, come back to the world. You'll still feel funny but nothing like when your eyes are closed and you're 'in it.'The afterglow (open eyes): This is, in my opinion, a *crucial* phase in the ketamine experience if you are interested in using it therapeutically. I have not heard anyone talk about this, either, but it could be out there. After the trip dies down and I open my eyes, I often feel like my mind is refreshed; more level-headed, practical, and optimistic (I also feel really dizzy and out of it, so be careful getting up etc). I feel like I can view my problems as a *problem solver* instead of with stress and anxiety. It is very difficult to write after k, so if you have a trusted (and patient) friend or partner who will listen to you talk out your problems *100% do that*. If not, try recording yourself and just talk it out. I've solved so much this way. Literally changed my life entirely.Ketamine is a very safe drug, all things considered. And even a 'bad trip' can be ameliorated by just getting up.. By the way-- After hundreds of them, I only had 1 bad one, and that was just recently, after 2 years of good ones.

{"du9a57h": {"text": " I actually completely relate-- I was one of those vegetarians for many years! Through my teens/early 20's I (sadly) lived on grilled cheese, mozzarella sticks, pastas, and fake meats. Going vegan for 4 years and the book \"Eat to Live\" mostly cured me of that aversion to veggies (honestly I think it's acquired taste, and I was fed canned/frozen veggies as a kid so I never learned to love them). But when I went back to ovo/lacto, again I found myself rarely making-- and *never* ordering-- salad. So I do get that, and would have turned my nose up at \"salad every night\" too!But there's something about keto that made salad a mainstay instead of an afterthought. I think it's just that I'm lazy/overwhelmed with school right now and its easy. And with keto you can add all kinds of fats that make salads really satisfying, like goat cheese, walnuts, avocado, rich dressings, etc. But there's also the change in how you view food: it stops feeling like you're constantly feeding cravings, and feels more like you're just eating when it's needed.  Personally, I cared less about every bite being amazing, I just knew I needed nourishment and ate accordingly. Salads didn't seem so boring and tedious then.And then there's the weight loss. When the lbs rapidly melt off, I think you get a little hooked on that and want to eat what you need to to keep it up!But if you're still struggling to get into veggies, I highly recommend roasted brussels sprouts + cauliflower. I eat this all week! And I think I would have liked it when my diet was all about cheese + bread, too.  Cauliflower rice is another mainstay; once or twice a week I make a vegan curry with this and tofu + veggies pan fried in coconut oil.I lost weight as a vegan, but started gaining it back, too-- but in my case I think the culprit was all those refined carbs. Once I figured out all the convenience foods I could eat (potato chips, tortilla chips, pita + hummus...) I was in trouble. So now I'm trying something between ovo/lacto keto and vegan.

D3 and fish oil are my 2 animal-product nutrient cheats. I just can't mess around with my mental health. That doesn't mean you can't get these from a vegan diet, it's just a little trickier. I take high doses of both and so I 'cheat.' B12: a methylcobalamin sublingual liquid or tablet is best. B12 is best absorbed through the mucosa of the mouth, thus sublingual=better than a pill.  Cyanocobalamin is the much less bioavailable form of b12, so find methylcobalamin if you can.Iron: Yes, there is a lower absorption from plants. Another element/nutrient that is better from animal sources but not impossible to get as a vegan. I don't think the RDA is enough from plant sources, but that's just my own conclusion. (And keep in mind iron can be dangerous at high levels). Eating iron with vitamin C helps absorption, while some dark greens that are high in oxalates (like spinach!) actually inhibit absorption.

{"dr2d7ls": {"text": "Sure, I'll try to give my own version of an explanation on mindfulness. This is how I see it:Very broadly speaking, the brain has two general systems: The emotional system (limbic system), and the logical system (prefrontal cortex). In bipolar disorder, the emotional system gets out of wack and messy and staticky. It gets in the way by demanding our attention a lot of the time. Broadly speaking again, it's difficult to run both systems fully at the same time. Our brain has limited energy. So mindfulness is a way of focusing on the logical, concrete, and physical world in order to take away energy from our aberrant emotional system. When you focus on your physical sensations, observations, and approach things with nonjudgment, you're teaching your brain to operate more from a logical perspective instead of letting emotions do the work. For example, \"I notice that this student never does his homework. I'm not judging it, I'm just noting that this situation exists.\" Or \"I notice that there is traffic. I am moving more slowly than normal. I notice the way my hands feel on the steering wheel, the way my foot feels on the brake pedal, that there is a green car in front of me, that the sky is clear with a few clouds, that my chest is tight, I notice that my breathing is shallow. I'm not judging the traffic, just noticing that it exists.\" Breathing exercises are a great way to be mindful and teach the brain to consciously control something it doesn't normally. Breathing is the bridge between the conscious mind and unconscious mind, because either can take control. With regular breathing exercises and meditation/mindfulness, you learn (or rather teach yourself, and grow the ability) that you have more control over not just breathing, but other aspects of your brain. You learn to quiet anxious thoughts, view things objectively, and \"tune\" your brain to more positive or logical thinking. You stop your emotional brain from taking the reins all the time. That's my quick and dirty low-down. I have to study for a final or I'd probably write you a whole novel-- I'm really interested in mindfulness/meditation for mental health promotion. I highly recommend studying Taoism, this helped me a lot. There are also a lot of resources on youtube for learning meditation, and Jon Kabat-Zinn is a great resource, check out his books and guided meditations. Also, DBT therapy-- it gives more information and guidance on mindfulness than CBT. ", "link_id": "t3_7ixmhu", "time": 1512956064}}

Not to mention that could cause a suspension or loss of medical license. Is it possible he said you're in remission for another reason? Insurance? Liability? He just didn't see the mania? I'm not sure why. But if he isn't seeing mania but you and your therapist suspect it, you need to be clear that you might be in an episode and need a diagnostic assessment.

I know this would likely put me on edge.I'm surprised you were prescribed buspar \"as needed\"; buspar is a medication that isn't very effective unless you've taken it daily for at least a couple weeks. But maybe it works for you? Are you seeing a GP for meds or a psychiatrist?Secondly, I'm so sorry, that sounds so rough. I work with kids and know how hard it is to struggle but need to hide it. At my highest pressure/worst job that was truly traumatic (not with kids) I would tell myself-- maybe this will make me stronger! I guess in a way it did, but it reaches a point where you have to get out. I wish you luck in finding a new position.Third: docs are reluctant to prescribe us the most effective anxiety meds, benzodiazepines. Sometimes we have to get aggressive and creative with treating our own anxiety. *I cannot stress exercise and meditation enough.* I can almost guarantee that one or both will have an impact on your anxiety. As you get better at meditation you will find it gives you more control over your emotional reactions and anxiety at work. Other methods involve rigorous sleep/social rhythm regimen adherence. Go to bed/wake up at the same time every day, and try to eat and do other things predictably.And last- make sure you are getting enough protein, folate/folinic acid, b12, iron, vitamin D (5,000-8000units according to recent research) and Omega-3 fatty acids.Sorry if none of this is news, I hope at least something was helpful!", "link_id": "t3_7ixmhu", "time": 1512953556}}

I have many, many thoughts on all of this-- how it works, if the \"trip\" matters to recovery, what the trips can do for us-- but it's difficult to sum it all up. The important thing of note, though, is that ketamine is not a very predictable or consistent drug. Every experience is different. Every day is different in terms of response. I would try it again, but I would go into with your mind as open and accepting as it can be. Let ketamine be a gateway into those bits of your consciousness that have been lost and shut down with depression. It's possible that you cried and felt heavy because it was putting you in touch with something you've compartmentalized, and need to work through. I call this \"untying the knots\"-- ketamine lets me go in there and work on things. It can be painful and overwhelming sometimes, but I often feel ketamine gives me enough of an overall feeling of wellbeing, that everything is \"ok,\" that I can think about and work on things that normally are too painful.

You tried something to get better, which is something to be proud of. They got it wrong, and that's not your fault. You still have the power to seek the right help and research your illness and take the productive steps. Someone once taught me this phrase: You won't always know or be able to make the \"right\" decision, but you can always make the mature decision. Sometimes that's the difference between moving forward or standing still (or moving backward).I think a lot about guilt and how we all suffer so horribly from it. I've realized this: guilt has a purpose, and that's to keep us from making the same mistakes twice. It also is a sign that we care deeply for others and don't want to harm them. After all, there are people out there who never feel guilt, and they are the ones who are truly not good people.You can accept that you made the mistake, accept\u200b that you feel bad, and thank your brain for giving you the feeling of guilt to steer you in the right direction again.

Then I started gaining tolerance and thought it was over; ketamine just wasn't the wonder drug I'd hoped it was. So in an effort to reduce tolerance I tried spreading out dosages and increasing them, which worked somewhat; now I had a maybe 7:3 well:unwell ration. It's still very disruptive to be severely depressed half the week so I wasn't where I wanted to be.The real key was quitting alcohol.

First step, I'd recommend picking up a book or two on bipolar, because you're seeking a lot of info that might be better covered by literature. It's been awhile, but offhand I remember liking \"The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide,\" \"The Bipolar Handbook: Real-Life Questions with Up-to-Date Answers,\" and \"Loving Someone with Bipolar Disorder\" (more for couples but still a great resource for friends/family).I'm on mobile, but I'll try to answer your questions:&gt;Does exercise help?Absolutely. Most of us feel better with a regular exercise routine.&gt;How much does sleeping affect it?Dramatically. It's theorized that Bipolar Disorder has a strong link to our circadian rhythms and you'll notice depressed bipolar people often sleep a lot while manic bipolar people sleep very little. It's important for us to go to bed at a reasonable time, sleep a solid 8 (or whatever people are best at) hours, and wake up at a reasonable time. Many of us are natural 'night owls' which may not be a good thing. It's possible light--especially blue light-- is very important, too. Read more on that here: http://psycheducation.org/treatment/bipolar-disorder-light-and-darkness/&gt;What about eating? We should be diligent about eating well, but there are many opinions on what is best. Some eat vegan, paleo, or ketogenic ( there are studies on the ketogenic diet + bipolar that suggest it's beneficial). I've been told by a specialist to avoid chocolate, alcohol, starch, and caffeine. I'm doing much better without any alcohol and limited starches but I can't seem to quit the other two. Many of us have major struggles with willpower, which interferes with our wellness in area like  diet, exercise, and substance abuse.&gt;Are you on any medications? Most of us are. There is a small minority who can manage without meds, but they typically have gotten *really* good at lifestyle management. It's generally not good advice to encourage bipolar people to go med-free because it's so rarely doable and we often fool ourselves into thinking we don't need meds...until we end up hospitalized or too depressed to get help.Personally I'm on lithium, seroquel, levothyroxine, and ketamine. There is tremendous variety in combos though.  We're all on different cocktails.&gt;How do they help? Like any medication, they alleviate symptoms but are not without side effects. They're imperfect. The med adjustment struggle is a big one; it often takes years and dozens of meds to get it right. I've probably been on 20ish meds and nothing really worked for my depression until ketamine.&gt;Do you practice yoga, meditation, praying etc? Yoga seems helpful but I've barely tried it. Meditation is a foundational pillar in my wellness. &gt;What about family support? Vital...if we're lucky enough to get it. Another thing-- bipolar is a stress-related illness. We need extra support and understanding during difficult times. Major life events (good or bad) often trigger episodes.And lastly-- wellness really has to come from within. No one can push it on us or guide us to it, and we often react badly if they try to, unless we ask.

But be honest with the dr, say 50mg wasn't working and you were desperate for sleep.I feel like there's another question in your post but I'm not sure I'm following. Therapists generally do not suggest diagnoses, and there are laws governing what they do say, so your therapist's lack of mentioning bipolar doesn't really indicate anything. If seroquel is effective for sleep, it doesn't mean anything. Seroquel will knock anybody out. Its efficacy is not indicative of bipolar disorder.

Bipolar disorder isn't the end of the world. It just means, like with any chronic illness, you must learn to take care of yourself and manage the illness.If you *do* have bp, adderall and effexor with no mood stabilizer in place is a potentially dangerous combo. This type of combo is how many of us had our first hypomanic episode.In fact, there's growing evidence that SSRI and SNRI as well as stimulant use in adolescents and young adults is in part responsible for the recent rise in bipolar disorder diagnoses, and increase in severity of the illness. It's possible that many of us had a genetic predisposition that was 'triggered' or worsened by certain pharmaceuticals. (To be clear, this is not an anti-pharm statement; most of us can't function without medication and I'm hoping to be a psychiatric nurse practitioner some day.But if you think you could be bp 2 and you're on these medications, you need to remain vigilant.)I don't know if you have it, only you and your doctor can figure that out.

Lithium et al have ways of inhibiting this toxicity, thereby protecting the cell from damage or death. Both depression and mania also cause damage to neurons, so lithium and other mood stabilizers may be protective during these mood states, too (and in some models and studies, they have indeed been shown to be). **Neurogenesis** is the growth and proliferation of neurons and neuronal connections. According to current knowledge, the development of brand new neurons from stem cells only occurs in a limited number of places in the brain, such as the hippocampus. However, neuronal *connections* are constantly \"dying\" and \"regrowing.\" This is, broadly speaking, how the brain does what it does; how we learn, adapt, form memories and other schema in the brain. Your neurons each have many branches that constantly attach to other neurons, or detach, and they receive input from the branches of many other neurons.  This is how signals are transmitted and circuits are formed. If a cell is damaged, it may not be able to form new connections or properly use the connections it has. Mood stabilizers increase the production and/or action of biochemicals such as Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, which are like Miracle Grow for the brain-- they help us grow new connections and maybe even new neurons. This is how the mood stabilizers are \"neurogenerative.\" This is very much an ELI5; I'm not a neuroscientist!", "link_id": "t3_65rm9l", "time": 1492401304}}

Even stable, I typically like having sex every night. We used to joke that he wouldn't be able to keep up with me. I feel bad about that now, like I've totally let him down.For the past *year* my libido has plummeted. I have a hunch it's caused by the ketamine I take for depression (BPII), but there's little data on that. It doesn't seem tied to my mood so it's been pretty constant, but I'm trying to work on it.I constantly feel guilty that I can't get into it. My fiancee assures me he understands and isn't upset with me, but I still feel bad. I was once the high libido person dating a low libido person so I know how frustrating it is.There have been times when I tried to push through and get into it anyway, and sometimes this works (sometimes it's easier if we just break out the lube right away so I don't get psychologically hung up on the fact that I'm not getting there, which further prevents me from getting there). Other times I feel...it's hard to explain, but I actually feel abused. Not by him, but perhaps by myself? It's very strange and very uncomfortable. I have for a long time had a hunch that I was abused as a child but don't remember it, so I wonder if it's stirring something up. I'm so sorry about what happened to you with that other guy; I think if that had happened to me it would be extremely difficult to push myself to have sex when I didn't fully want it. It sounds like you haven't fully come to terms with what happened, so I wonder if seeing a rape counselor might help? Could this past trauma also be part of why you're struggling with your own libido?As far as advice, I don't have a ton because we're still working through it. Lately I've been trying to visualize us banging a lot to get excited beforehand and I think it's helping. The most directly useful thing we've found is cannabis, but neither of us like that I need a drug to get into it, and I'm trying to stay sober, so we don't use it much. It does increase blood flow in all the right places though. Another thing we do is this: I will cuddle up next to him, make out a little, and let him touch me while he jerks off.

The best guess I have is it is possible that what we are feeling is changes in cerebral blood flow (I'm not an expert, just a nursing student interested in neuropsychiatry, but would love expert input if I'm wrong). We do have some sensory input from blood vessels, and cerebral blood flow is frequently measured as an indicator of regional brain activity. There has also been at least one study done in which people were able to increase cerebral blood flow intentionally or with thought (I'm having trouble finding that study but will add it if I do). To me this all suggests that blood flow is the sensation we experience as we become more skilled meditators better able to monitor our physical body.It makes some sense that you feel confident \"toward the forehead\" since your prefrontal cortex extends there, and that more fearful, stressed, emotional responses are felt \"deeper\"/closer to the spinal cord since your deep limbic system (responsible for fear and other emotional responses) is deeper and more central in the brain. As each area becomes triggered by a situation, oxygen demand increases and blood flow increases in response.This is mostly conjecture on my part, but I predict you're going to get a lot of \"not possible\" 's here, so I'm offering another opinion.

It's not super precise, but I can't imagine my body is very consistent with absorbing/metabolizing so little anyway.

This includes pretty much everything we should be doing anyway- A healthy whole foods diet, exercise, stress-reduction, mindfulness, meditation, positive social interaction. You can find plenty of research on how these reduce cortisol-- or if it isn't cortisol, there is still plenty of research on how these can reduce anxiety overall.

With the right treatment, my depression lifted and I gained control and motivation. Suddenly I didn't just care about my environment again...I cared a LOT. This has created conflict because my boyfriend had been tolerating my mess for two years and suddenly I can't tolerate his, even though it is arguably more minor than mine was.

After 15 years of being the \"messy\" one, I have no idea who I am anymore.Here's the thing about bipolar disorder:  *all sensory input matters.* When we are depressed it's hard to feel much, but when better, everything we experience affects us. Sights, smells, other pople. And our environment is super important. When my house is organized (I care less about super clean than I do about neat) I feel like everything is right. My mood is lifted. 3 months ago I redid the decoration in our bathroom and started keeping it totally clutter-free, and to this day I walk in there and instantly feel lifted because it looks nice.

When you're connected to disability services, teachers are actually required to work with you. When you're having an episode, the counselors will help you figure out how to talk to teachers and what to ask for. I put so much pressure on myself before-- I don't even want to think about how many times I got behind, became extremely embarrassed and didn't know how to talk to the instructor about what was going on, and just bailed. Stopped going and received a D or F. Disability services put an end to that.Secondly: *time management.* We are exceedingly bad at this, especially because so many of us have comorbid ADHD. You must prioritize \"future you\" over \"present you.\" You need to study in small chunks every single day, even if for only an hour or two. Bipolar is a stress-related illness that needs to be managed carefully. Cramming, all-nighters, and the stress of procrastination will sink you. As I've come to say to myself often \"treat the illness first.\" Eat well, sleep well, study regularly, limit stress, don't drink (or at least limit drinking), don't do drugs, get help when you need it.If you're in college to party, you should drop out. I mean that seriously. You can party and work a full/part time job if you need to get it out of your system, but it's too damaging to party while in school with bipolar disorder. Don't wreck your gpa, because it doesn't go away (at least not easily-- there are ways, but it takes time). Edit: reread your post (I'm on mobile), a couple more things:-you say your family wants you to take a semester off, but you don't want to fall behind and you don't want to explain why you won't walk with your friends. All of this is about what other people think. But what do you think you need?--I can tell you that doing nothing is not good for stability. Imho a full or part time job is ideal, but if you can get on top of school work/manage stress, it's better to be in college than sitting around doing nothing. That said don't be afraid of taking a semester off; it's ok to admit you need a breather. One of the things a lot of 30- somethings such as myself look back on and laugh about is how much time pressure/how old we felt in our early 20's.

Nobody thrives when they see all others as a threat, or women as conquests that prove their worth.

I think most of the large US cities have a ketamine clinic (or two) now. More and more psychiatrists are looking into offering it, but many are scared off by the limited research and the DEA breathing down their necks. I'm certain we will see it in emergency departments and psych facilities very soon. It can (for some people) reverse suicidality in minutes.

I love researching and learning about psychotropics, and experiencing ketamine treatment firsthand has been fascinating.I also had been following its path through clinical trials, but at first it was only approved for unipolar depression (if I'm remembering correctly-- I may be thinking of TMS), and when it was available for bipolar depression, it was prohibitively expensive near me ($8000+ for a round of treatments). I kind of gave up on ketamine as an option, until I saw this article about a year ago:https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-one-time-party-drug-is-helping-people-with-deep-depression/2016/02/01/d3e73862-b490-11e5-a76a-0b5145e8679a_story.html?utm_term=.1ff22300386aThat triggered me to look into it again, and I found a reasonably affordable clinic in my new city.

At higher doses however, it was intolerable; at 50mg I slept 14+ hours a night and at 200mg I was nearly comatose for 16 hours and kept missing work.I am overall fairly sensitive to side effects, so take that into account.

{"dei9gh5": {"text": "Depression is not always sadness, tears, despair, and suicidality. Sometimes (*especially* with BP2) it is emotionless, empty, flat, and prevents us from accomplishing anything or thriving.You should really talk to your pdoc. Being stuck and unable to move forward often ultimately leads to the more despairing, hopeless depression. But more importantly it is its own sort of depression. It's also very common and familiar to many of us with BP.Other things I would suggest:1) look for motivation. Read about inspiring people throughout history who overcame adversity. A lot of times we need some trigger to get us motivated. For me, it's reading about what I just described, researching depression recovery in scientific journals, and hitting rock bottom (I don't recommend that one).2) Learn to set goals for wellness and adhere to them. Find healthy activities that get you active mentally or physically without tv/internet. Go hiking, learn an art or craft, volunteer. Keep a journal and track your goals.3) exercise. It has proven time and time again to increase energy, mood, and motivation. ", "link_id": "t3_5xi3tx", "time": 1488652307}}

{"dec516x": {"text": "Hey there-- I'm BP II and have been working with kids for 15 years. I've worked in preschool, daycare, summer camps, and as a professional nanny and parenting coach for a decade. Here's my opinion:The kid has behavioral issues beyond your scope of expertise. I personally would not work with a 9 year old who was physically aggressive with caregivers without a premium rate and daily or weekly debriefings with the parents about behavioral concerns/progress.You're in over your head ( anyone would be-- you would have to pay me a LOT to work with a kid like that), but it's not your fault. I'm certain the parents know they have a difficult child, which makes paying you a low wage truly unacceptable. It sounds to me like they are taking advantage of you; probably because you are sweet and kind and don't stick up for yourself. I would venture to guess they've lost babysitters and specifically looked for someone who won't walk out and doesn't realize how relatively terrible their kid is. You owe them nothing, but you owe yourself stability. This job isn't worth it and there's a family needing a sitter on every block. I would recommend leaving, but do so without guilt because none of this is your fault. Alternatively, if you need a good reference you could hang in there for 6 months and try to work with the parents. But you *need* to speak up; she's walking all over you and will keep doing it until there are consequences and the parents back you up. For a 9yo I would recommend removing privileges or grounding from friends over time-out, but really it sounds like she needs professional intervention from a counselor to work on solutions ( don't say that to the parents until you've clearly expressed the issues and you all have tried to work them out). If they don't want to work with you, bail-- there are thousands of other families out there.BTW-- 8-10 year olds are imho the easiest age. There's no reason to suffer when there are easier gigs out there. It's a bit of a crapshoot with babysitting/nannying...some kids are a lot of work, some are easy, some parents are a nightmare, some are my friends for life. But if you don't have experience, don't take the hard jobs. Despite what (unfortunately many) people think, there is art, nuance, and a high level of skill to child care. I would definitely not call babysitting as a whole low-stress...just some jobs. Find those jobs!I would highly recommend working in a daycare/aftercare or preschool environment over (before) babysitting, to gain experience and work under a higher authority. You'll learn to be stronger and learn how to use effective communication and discipline. The jobs are often low-stress and fun, and they hire people with little experience. You can find YMCA aftercare programs everywhere. Pay is low, but nobody is pinching you all the time.If you need advice, feel free to PM me!TL;DR: Quit. Find an easier kid or an aftercare gig; there are plenty of better jobs out there. ", "link_id": "t3_5wmren", "time": 1488314308}}
{"deby3kb": {"text": "This is not true-- lithium and other mood stabilizers can be very effective in treating depression (regardless of any manic/hypomanic precursor episodes). They are even used for unipolar depression at times.  Edit: It is also true that many of us respond extremely poorly to antidepressants, so discounting mood stabilizers for depression while promoting AD's is not good advice. I don't mean to be harsh, but it's really important people aren't steered in the wrong direction and that they don't lose faith in their doctors/recovery.
