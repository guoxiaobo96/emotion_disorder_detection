We grew up working on the family farm. My parents had a host of mental instabilities. My dad, while rarely physically violent towards us, would lose his temper often and scream. At us, at the animals. While not physically harmful, it was pretty common, and quite stressful. My mom, while seeming more gentle, may have been worse. Depression, insecure, self-centered. She often told us that we were to blame for her being depressed. If we did something unsatisfactory, she would lock herself in her room for hours. Or get in the car and drive away. And it would be because we were lazy or shitty kids. If we ever criticized our mother, she would break down crying saying that we thought she was a bad mom.   So from a very young age, I adapted. I made myself the perfect kid. Kind, cheerful, obedient. I was the favorite, but not because of who I was as a person. It was because I made life more convenient for my parents.  I grew up loving my family and being very devoted to them. It wasn't until I went away to college that I realized my parents actually didn't give a shit about me. Through years of therapy I've gained the understanding that my intimate relationships are thoroughly fucked. I grew up in an environment where my actions determined how much I was loved, and having a healthy relationship with another person is the hardest thing I've ever tried to achieve.

{"cdsce4u": {"text": "I've been there. My years in college were some of the worst of my life because depression (type II bipolar here) sucked out my interest in fucking everything. Somehow, miraculously, I forced myself to go through the hell of finishing my degree. I'm not going to give you inspirational advice because not only do I not have any, but I could never stand that shit either. The last thing I wanted to hear when I wanted nothing more than the life to leave my body faster was that tomorrow would be better. So I just have some questions for you. Have you talked about this much with your therapist? Has he/she helped much with this issue? If school is triggering your downward spiral, have you considered leaving? What would you do if you left school again? Sometimes what kept me in school was just asking myself what else I would be doing. It was like my inability to care was so significant that I couldn't even bother to find something else to do instead of school. This might not be an issue for you; it's just something that went through my head a lot at the time and was usually what stopped me from going to the dean's office and dropping out.I'm sorry you're having a hard time. Apathy is the worst feeling to have hanging over you, especially when you have meaningless assignments hanging over your head. It fucking sucks. Hopefully the breakthrough will come soon.
