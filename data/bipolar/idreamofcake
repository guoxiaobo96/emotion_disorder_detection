My psychiatrist's solution was two 10mg  instant release tablets to take during the rest of my shift.Her practice got a new director, and they are cracking down on stimulant prescriptions. So we switched to 70mg of Vyvance which lasts about 9-10 hours, and one 10 mg instant release Adderall. The Vyvance is less effective, but smoother than the Adderall XR. It requires much more conscious effort to focus on things, and it's harder to manage multiple stimuli, which isn't ideal, but it is what it is. If you only need a low-medium dose of Adderall, I'd recommend that. It's really great for focus and switching your attention between multiple things.", "link_id": "t3_h9po2w", "time": 1592270812}}

My second is so caring and empathetic, she works hard to excel at whatever she decides to do. They make it a joy to do for them, and give lots of love to us. My husband and I would have been happy to be childless too, though. We would have adventures, pets, lots of silly fun, and made a lovely world of two. I think being willing to accept your life either way is the only way to bear trying to conceive with PCOS. The miscarriages and years of negative pregnancy tests would break you down otherwise.I had three miscarriages before my first child was conceived at age 30, including a second trimester loss. My gynecologist told me I might not be able to carry to term, and my first was an accident, as we were considering being childless. During that pregnancy, severe nausea lasted all day through my first and second trimesters. At seven months of pregnancy I had only gained 5 lbs until I developed preeclampsia, at which point I gained 53 lbs of water weight between 30 weeks and 38 weeks of pregnancy. I was bed rested at 32 weeks, and induced at 38 weeks when my blood pressure spiked dangerously high. After giving birth, all the water weight was expelled, and at my 6 week post-partum checkup, my weight was only 6 lbs more than before pregnancy. My oldest daughter is awesome, so we decided to try for a second child. It took three years and one more miscarriage before she was conceived at age 35.At my 10 week checkup, there was sugar in my urine, and they did a glucose challenge test. I already had gestational diabetes, which usually doesn't show up until the third trimester. They treated it with medication until the 5th month of pregnancy, at which point, insulin became necessary. From there it was a race to keep my sugar under control until the delivery. My doses of insulin kept increasing, I put on 66 lbs, and struggled with constant exhaustion. Because of her size and position, we were scheduled for a cesarean delivery at 40 weeks, which went beautifully. Sadly, the diabetes was permanent. At my physical a couple of months later, my physician found elevated BNP levels from the early stages of congestive heart failure. My heart was damaged from the stress of the pregnancy. With all that said, my overall health is good from following my physician's recommendations and taking my meds.

{"fuwsq28": {"text": "A bipolar person has a responsibility to have their disease managed as best as possible within a serious relationship. Obviously with life changes, med changes, and the occasional random mood swing, there are times when their partner will have to be extra supportive until things are stabilized. But therapy, medication, self-awareness, and a routine are a must to manage bipolar disorder. It is a chronic illness that requires lifelong treatment, and a commitment to stability.The absence of a psychiatrist or therapist that they are checking in with on a regular basis to monitor their illness, combined with their not taking any psychiatric medications, are not good signs. For many people with bipolar, it's very difficult to lose the feelings of grandiosity, connection to a higher plane or religious figure, and limitless potential that come with mania/hypomania. It's common to resist taking medication because stability feels flat in comparison to the epic emotions of bipolar. It's also common for bipolar to twist your view of people's words and actions to reflect your own thoughts and emotions. This is often used to 'confirm' that the bipolar person is especially intuitive or insightful about other's motivations, or that their more paranoid thoughts are based in reality. I used to do this with my husband before my diagnosis, and it nearly cost me my marriage. He would discuss things with me, and I would literally not hear what he was saying, but instead my worst fears about what he thought and felt for me. There is nothing you can do to make the situation better between the two of you until he is willing to manage his illness. There are no words or actions from you that can make him change who he is or how he treats you.If he's not actively taking measures to meet the reasonable expectations of a partner for support, active engagement, positive communication, an atmosphere of caring, and being reliable, knowing that he is bipolar, then that is a choice he's making. One that shows you where you stand and what you can expect from him in the future. You have to make the decision for yourself if what you have with him is enough for you to be happy in this relationship.

{"ftdsres": {"text": "I had 2 children before I was diagnosed, and I've experienced raising children before and after meds. Overall, I would say that if you have a supportive partner to parent with, are medicated, and in therapy when needed, parenting is about as difficult as it is for any parent. And better than it is for a lot of parents since you know about your issues and are actively dealing with them.There is only a 25% chance of passing on bipolar disorder from one bipolar parent. Early treatment from recognizing the illness when it starts, leads to much better outcomes if your child does inherit it. Neither of my children show signs of it yet, even though my oldest is at the age when it started for me, but time will tell.Being unmedicated with my first was difficult, I was too hard on her because I didn't want her to end up like me. But on the flip side, I pushed myself harder to be stable, and cognitive behavioral therapy did help me deal with the hypomania and depression better before my diagnosis. Also she experienced a lot of spontaneous fun with me, during hypomania I would play games with her for hours at a time. Getting her on a schedule helped me tremendously, which you can start doing at around 4-6 months.I was diagnosed shortly after having my second child, and meds were a revelation. She definitely got a more stable and consistent version of me, which gave her better emotional intelligence and more resilience than my first. My relationship with my husband is less tumultuous, and more stable.  I was much gentler with her in general since I understood that what was wrong with me was chemical rather than a character flaw. However, she is less socially adept and confident than my first, as I spent a lot of time with my first at parks, arranging play dates, and playing imaginative games during hypomania. Since I was finally able to work on my education and career goals once medicated, I spent less time overall with my second than my first. A lot of her care after the age of 4 was left to my husband and my mother, who are very loving, but very introverted, and don't push her to expand her capabilities. For me having children has been a joy, and a motivator to be the best version of myself that I can be.

One of the relationships was with a woman who wanted a friends with benefits type thing. It wasn't something where attraction built over time based on who I am as a person, she literally picked me up at a club and took me to her home. It was my first sexual experience with a woman. I was very attracted to her, and incredibly insecure about my body, but am so glad I got over that and allowed myself to be with her. It was such an empowering thing to be with someone who was openly attracted to me as a sexual person. I had always assumed that people who were interested in me were attracted to my personality and overlooked my body. It was wonderful to be with someone who liked me as a person, but was primarily with me because of my sexual attractiveness. She treated me with respect and enthusiasm, and was a benchmark for how I wanted to be treated by a partner. Also it is much easier to explore becoming comfortable in your body and sexual self with a woman than with a man. Men who are attracted to you will not understand your feelings about your body, because to them you are obviously sexy, and are likely to be irritated with it, or brush it off, leaving you even more insecure. Another woman, even a beautiful one, will understand your insecurity from her own experience and be gentle in dealing with it. I would ask your friend for time to process the loss of your virginity while continuing to be with her as a friend, and let yourself be open to the idea of a relationship with her.

Spouse slurping his soup is irritating. That's a perception of an objective truth.  Spouse is slurping his soup to irritate me. That's a conclusion I'm protecting onto that truth. The conclusion is probably wrong, getting defensive is a symptom of my BP.  But the slurping is irritating no matter what, and I don't tie myself into knots anymore deciding if it is *really* irritating or if I'm irritated because of my BP.

I think it was being able to see them actually using all the things I'd been trying to teach them.  There was this giant sense of relief that I wasn't completely screwing them up. They were actually becoming interesting people.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy helped me control the rages with concrete strategies. It also helped me communicate better with Spouse on how he can help me.  It was also essential to have a place I could be resentful and unhappy about motherhood in. Having someone hear me and understand without judgment helped me so much.Carrying my youngest child permanently damaged my body and physical health. If I had known that, I probably would have made a different choice.  But regardless of the choices I might have made, they are here, through the choice I did make.  And they can't help being giant sucking vortexes of need because that's how babies/toddlers are.

But she needed him to help raise me because he understood me, she was a better mom with him there. Those are her words.It was difficult when he had episodes, but he loved us and brought a lot into being a husband and father.

{"ddpfzmu": {"text": "This may not have anything to do with what you're asking. If not, apologies for intruding on the thread.No formal diagnosis for me. Both my kids were diagnosed on the spectrum at a young age.NTs perceive reserved behavior as superiority. Learning that people saw me being quiet not as awkwardness, but as me thinking I'm too good to engage with them was a shock.Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory and Sherlock Holmes being the public representatives of Aspergers doesn't help. They are both portrayed as thinking they're too far above NTs to bother with social graces.Attempting to talk about \"Normal\" things is going to come off as condescending. So best not to try, unless you're actually interested in the Atlanta Falcons or The Walking Dead.NTs are much better at reading cultural norms, non verbal cues, and gauging interest. For me, attempting to engage with in casual back-and-forth conversation is best done with family or very close friends who will be blunt with me, and know my intentions are good.My strategy for social situations is to embrace my strengths and plan for my weaknesses.I avoid B-a-F conversation as much as possible. If in that situation, using generic prompts to keep the other person talking about themselves and quickly disengaging is my go to. It's a low cost/medium reward technique with some small awkwardness during the learning curve.Coworker: Did you see Celebrity on TV Show last night?Me: No. What Happened?!Coworker: *tells story*Me: Really?... Then what?... Seriously? If I can tell whether they are trying to be funny and know they are generally inoffensive, I laugh during the pauses in the story.*after 3 minutes*Me: *makes face* I've got to go do *tedious thing no one likes doing* Coworker: *makes face* Ugh! Good luck with that! *laughs* See you later!NTs enjoy ritualized contact. Providing a couple minutes of routine focused attention once or twice a week that they can anticipate and look forward to is enough to make them feel good about you. With slight variations this conversation gets me through everyday casual social situations with acquaintances.Once you're comfortable with Listen and Disengage you can move to Listen and Engage a Bit which is great for work functions and any social event you just want to get through as easily as possible. It's another low risk/medium reward strategy.For this technique, when someone asks you about yourself you give a honest 1-2 sentence answer, give them a beat to respond if they want, then either way, follow up with a question about them. Use generic prompts to keep them talking for a few minutes. Then Disengage.Cousin's friend: I just started doing yoga. What do you do for exercise?Me: I go for walks after dinner. It's really helped me sleep better......How are you liking yoga?OrCousin's friend: Oh, you have trouble sleeping? I use Melatonin to help me sleep.Me: I'll have to look into that. How are you liking yoga?Cousin's friend: *talks about yoga*Me: *Oh wow!... It does?...I wouldn't expect that!*3-5 minutes later*Me: Well, I'd better go check in on Cousin. *laughs* It's been great talking with you.Cousin's friend: Yeah, no telling what they're up to. *laughs* See you around!If you just want to be thought well of without having to engage too much, those two strategies will do it.If you're trying to meet people for friendship or romance, it's harder. You've got to be willing for things to get really awkward while you find your schtick. It's a high risk/ high reward situation.Storytelling is mine.For social situations with people I am or would like to be friends with, but are not in my inner circle of people I can be myself with, stories and anecdotes are my bread and butter.I think we have an advantage over NTs here. We are more likely to notice unusual things in everyday situations, and focus on the small details that make for a good story. We are more likely to write the anecdotes out, edit them down to a 2-3 minute story, and practice telling them in a mirror to get our facial expressions and timing down. Me: Goes out for walk. Notices squirrel doing something weird. Stops in the middle of the sidewalk and makes up story in my head about what squirrel is doing while people walk around me. Turns story into anecdote.Cool Person at party: So what are you into? Do you watch Popular TV Show?Me: No, haven't seen it yet. I usually take my evening walk then. *laughs* The other night there was this Squirrel...*2 minutes later*Cool Person: *starts making up their own story about Squirrel based on my story*Me: *encourages their story with laughter and generic prompts**5 minutes later*Me: So tell me about Popular TV Show. What do you like about it?*listens and encourages them to talk with generic prompts*I've taken 2-3 minutes of taking about myself, and turned it into a 20 minute conversation with minimal B-a-F. Because they were drawn into my story, even though they did most of the talking, the other person will attribute the whole conversation to me in their memory.Telling a story about a relatable experience invites the listener(s) to either add on to your story or tell their own story. This is especially effective in small groups as each person builds on the story. The act of creating a story together is a bonding experience, people will seek out the people they've shared it with at other social events.This strategy required me to be really awkward while figuring out which stories people want to hear, which ones they don't.. ever, and how they like me to tell them. It required a large initial investment of time and energy, both to create the stories and to learn how to tell them.But once I got good at it, it had huge social rewards, and minimal continuing investment.

It's what motivates me to keep doing the hard work even though I don't get the emotional payoff most people do. Sometimes the thought of everything I could have had, could have done, if my brain hadn't been fighting me my whole life rears up, and it's tempting to lose myself in the dopamine distraction of impulse, the fleeting power high of destructive rage, or the oddly comforting dissociation of clinical depression. The promise of release never goes away, it hovers like an oasis just out of my field of vision, suicide is a permanent solution to a permanent problem. I will never have the luxury, the peace, of an unexamined thought. It is exhausting.In those moments that make up half of my life, it's Joy that keeps me on my meds, on my schedule.

Unless I'm making a conscious effort in a controlled environment, the layers and complexity of music gets discarded, only the words and basic melodies are heard by me. From that standpoint there is little difference between genres. Almost all genres have the same base melodies, and sing about the same things. Rap, Rock, Country, and Metal are similar themes set to different rhythms made by variants of the same instruments. The lyrics all are about common and elemental human experiences sung in language that conforms to an established group identity.For all the flack that Pop gets about being superficial fluff, my top 40 station is currently playing songs about domestic violence, gun violence, being suicidal, drug addiction, falling in lust, falling in love, fear of being vulnerable, PTSD, misogyny, misandry, not giving a fuck, and body dysmorphic disorder.My theory is that unless they are particularly invested in a song or band, most people don't really hear the words of songs in their genre except for the hooks. The music, tone of voice, the rhythm all contribute to the feeling of sharing an emotional experience with the singer and other listeners. It's satisfying and very comforting to hear that you're not alone in feeling large and powerful emotions, or in the lack of them.Having to process new information from a different genre, pulls the listener out of this experience, which is irritating at best.
