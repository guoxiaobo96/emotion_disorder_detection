{"eqyzlbt": {"text": "I was warned by so many people here to not go into nursing. When I volunteered in a hospital 5 years ago I felt most nurses weren\u2019t happy. One nurse told me to go into pharmacy but it\u2019s not that easy to find a job as a pharmacist plus I don\u2019t like counting pills.Were you diagnosed with BP too? I was told by the school psychiatrist that there was a student at my Med school with BP who graduated and went in psychiatry. Happy ending for her! But there were also people who ended up with multiple relapses and had to quit med school with over 200k in debt. If I had the money or rich parents I would definitely go back to school. But I grew up poor unfortunately. How bad is nursing ? I hear that nurses eat there young. When I was in med school I had a really bad encounter with one of the nurses and that was for a volunteer program! She was harsh and bitter to all of us because we were not trained probably in doing ultrasound. Some of the nurses that come to the restaurant I work at now are tough and not the nice type of people at all. I am sincerely scared of going into that route. In contrast most of the doctors (even the surgeons) I shadowed are kind, interesting, patient, and nice in person. I had a wonderful experience in med school. I miss my Med school and my friends so much. I know they are all afraid of me because of my mental illness and I don\u2019t blame them. But I don\u2019t wanna embarrass myself any further with my fucking stupid brain. The full blown manic episode had destroyed everything. I understand I would have to live on disability and be alone at some point in the future since mine is the most serious type of BP. And my poor mom.. she is so scared that I might kill myself one day. She is one of the few reason I am still alive today. I wish you the best in med school. Pls don\u2019t take too much sleeping pills and then drink too much coffee in the morning. Irregular sleeping pattern is the major contributor to breakdowns.
