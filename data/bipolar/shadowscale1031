{"fszsscv": {"text": "I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 while in college. It was definitely challenging, as the chaos of college and the chaos of bipolar don\u2019t often go well together. That said, I still graduated and have done well since, so here are some things that have helped me, although many I didn\u2019t learn until after graduation.-Get established with a mental heath provider early, especially if you\u2019re on medication. It can take awhile, and you don\u2019t want to navigate that system while in crisis. Campus therapists aren\u2019t always great with managing illnesses like bipolar, but they can help with managing stress and the transition to college life.-Take your medication consistently. There were times when I would go off mood stabilizers during hypomania to get a \u201cmanic boost\u201d during a particularly busy time. Don\u2019t do that. The ugly side of hypomania doesn\u2019t take long to come out.-Get enough sleep. Way easier said than done, but I\u2019ve found that my emotional stability is nonexistent when I don\u2019t sleep. This is one I only figured out once I graduated and actually had a regular sleep schedule.-Find what motivates you and make sure it\u2019s somewhere you\u2019re reminded often. I\u2019m a goal-oriented person, so thinking about how what I\u2019m doing (or not doing) will affect those goals helps me stay focused. In college, I changed my laptop background to whatever motivator I needed at the time (gentle support, kick in the ass, funny and relatable, my pets). Phone backgrounds as well. -Find a support system, aka make friends. Join clubs that interest you. It\u2019ll help you feel more invested in staying. Networking with professionals in my field through campus events also helped with motivation, because it helped excite me about what I could do once I had my degree.-Learn your limits. Manic me likes to sign me up for way more than non-manic me can handle. If that happens, don\u2019t be afraid to step back from lower priority things. I once had to resign from an extracurricular I cared a lot about due to academic overload, and I still remember my advisor saying \u201cYou\u2019re here to get a degree, not to be Vice President of this club\u201d. -Learn how to cope with stress. You mention alcohol, and at one point I did develop a problem because I was using it as a coping mechanism for stress. Once I realized I couldn\u2019t keep drinking like I was and still meet my goals (see point above), I changed and learned other ways to manage stress. But I had to hit that breaking point to finally start learning healthy coping mechanisms. If you can, try to find those before you end up too deep in something harmful.-Be kind to yourself. Learning to live with bipolar is mostly trial and error as you figure out triggers, treatments, and coping mechanisms that work for you. There will be a lot of failures and mistakes, but the faster you can get back up and move forward with what you\u2019ve learned, the better off you\u2019ll be.I hope this helps. Good luck!", "link_id": "t3_gwyyfk", "time": 1591378927}}
