{"ftj7m95": {"text": "My psychiatrist called this task initiation anxiety. It's a tricky one. Every little task such as showering or tooth brushing is a struggle. He likened it to the hardest part of getting a boulder to roll is getting it to start moving. You can google tips and strategies for overcoming task initiation anxiety and procrastination/avoidance habits. For me I found pairing it with positive things, so I put a show or song on in the bathroom before I get in the shower so I focus on that partially and not the anxious thoughts that paralyze me from getting something done. I also found that telling myself I don't have to brush my hair, my teeth, wash my hair, shave etc, if I just pop in and wash my body really quick that's ok too. A lot of times making the task as simple as possible before starting helps minimize the feelings of being overwhelmed and then once I start it I tend to be capable of doing more than I told myself I had to do and it gives me a sense of accomplishment at the end. Once I started having more positive reactions to accomplishing more than the minimum I made myself do I found it easier to initiate going forward. I used to be paralyzed by showering, skin care, tooth brushing, laundry etc. I would stand in the bathroom undressed with the water in and not be able to bring myself to step in to the shower. But now I'm mostly able to just get the things done without that overbearing sense if dread and paralysis. I brush my teeth twice a day, I shower regularly, and I do it without a second thought. but I always have a YouTube video of some sort playing during these tasks to distract my brain from overthinking it. I hope this helps a bit. I'm sorry you're going through this. It sucks and is so frustrating but you can get through it. I'd definitely recommend looking up strategies for improving executive functioning and task initiation skills, you may find little steps that make things a bit better for you.

{"fp9b5vm": {"text": "Hiding in plain sight. It's a phrase we've all heard, but most people don't realize just how true it is. And it is this phenomenon that I've exploited to succeed in my career.  I've been the top secret intelligence agent for the United States since the cold war. I've seen many great men and women go down while on secret operative missions around the world. Their greatest mistake was trying to stay covert at all times. Being undetectable on any mission is important, but it's the errors we make in our day to day that takes most spies down. No matter how hard you try it's just a matter of time until you make a mistake, no one can be perfect 100% of the time, it only takes the slightest slip up before foreign operatives can link a suspected spy alias to their daily cover. But I've found a way around that. Back in the days before social media it was a little more challenging to be written off as a loon but I did quite well. I had to get creative so that I was written off as the local nutcase conspiracy theorist. I used my free time between missions calling in to radio shows, writing in to newspapers, and holding protest signs outside of local government buildings. I would go on my missions and come home spewing grand tales about how I just got back from wherever. Sometimes it was stories about commandeering Russian nuclear arms plans, sometimes it was a story about tracking leads on Bin Laden through the desert, or investigating cartel primary drug sources. And sometimes the stories were more fantastical, investigating possible alien technologies that cropped up in Egypt or how I followed up leads on North Korea attempting to find a way to genetically modify the Kim family foetuses to create genetically superior leaders who didn't need to waste time on menial human facts of life like defecation. Of course only some of the stories I've spewed were true. It's a lot of fun touting truth and fiction side by side. In fact most of the time I travel is for leisure and I come back from the Bahamas touting made up tales from war torn countries. It also helps that my parents passed when I was in my twenties and left me a trust to to be paid out incrementally over time, so when I started as an agent the government directed my pay through the private trust as to leave no trail of employment. Nowadays it's easier than ever and I've perfected my art. I post on Facebook incessantly, I love sharing memes about aliens and politics, conspiracy tales, and my own colourful rants. All day long. I follow newscasters and stand behind them shouting and waving signs like those \"End-of-time\" loons you see on street corners. Quite a few times I've been interviewed which is always a fun endeavor. I've emboldened a certain passion into destroying any credibility I could ever have in my daily persona. Over the years I've been tailed a few times by foreign spies, and every time their official reports about some nut job who got a lucky guess amongst the rubbish conspiracies bolsters my pride in my very public cover up. I've been able to accomplish so much more than any other spy known to the American government. It helps that I've perfected the disheveled homeless redneck look and have numerous aliases while abroad to cover my tracks. Abroad and while travelling I am always clean cut and professional, but while home my state of the art coloured contact lenses, lace front wig and incredibly realistic mangled fake beard, special effects makeup to change the shape of my nose, and the dirty haggard clothes a size too big all help keep me from being connected to the secret operative known abroad. I even have top of the line replacement fingerprint gloves that I wear at all times while not on mission so any attempt to connect me to actual events abroad are next to impossible.

{"foef7i9": {"text": "I have bipolar and can tell you this is not just bipolar, I do not lie and I always try to do my part in a relationship. But I was with someone that was exactly like this. He lied about everything, huge and small. He did the minimum and only the minimum and expected praise and reward. If I complained about what wasn't done it was my fault because he did the dishes last week. It was horrible and only got worse with time. For me the lying got worse and worse. It progressed from White lies and taking $20 from me (which I couldn't prove so he wouldn't admit until 3 years later) to lying about being in school when really he had failed a year earlier, was unemployed and collecting welfare which was spent on weed and fast food, while I worked 2 jobs and tried to do everything. Even during that time he did the minimum around the house and still told me I was the reason so many things didn't get done because I was lazy. And even when I collected all the proof and handed it to him he still tried to lie his way out of it. If  you cannot trust someone (which you shouldn't if he's a serial liar) you cannot build a lasting relationship or a future because they will lie about what your future will be to placate you in the moment. As someone who spent 4 years too long thinking things would get better and wanting to believe the nice things they promised I suggest you two get some serious marriage counselling or part ways. Because it will not get better on its own. If he is on meds now that's good, but if you want to stay and make it work know you are with someone who has gotten by with lying and lying is easier than facing hard conversations. You will have to do extra to deal with this, such as taking him to his psychiatrist and counselling appointments and waiting there, and watching him take his meds every day, so you know they're actually happening. Because he will be tempted to tell you he's going to them and when it gets tough he may go straight back to lying and say he's still going.Also wanted to add trust your suspicions and intuition.

He was super awkward, referred to himself in third person repeatedly, sometimes doing so while making a jab at himself which was uncomfortable. He tells me he's newly religious and looking for something serious, and that he's only been with one person before so he's not a virgin (ok...

Dates over and I just get home when I get a text from him saying \" hey so sorry to spring this on you but I have a rather serious question if you have time\"  I ask what's up. He texts back asking if I want children. Wtf. Literally only met for an hour and he's asking about kids. I awkwardly reply yeah one day but why is that something you had to ask right away. He states he doesn't want to fall for someone he can't possibly have a future with. This is a little crazy so I try to make things less awkward with humour about how he needs to simmer down and he's getting a little ahead of himself. He texts back that he knows I'd be a great mom because of my line of work and we could have lots of babies. I text back only if I can leave babies at my work and have a full night's rest and Netflix in peace each night (trying to use humour to handle how absolutely nuts this conversation got). He replies saying that he'd make sure I had lots of night off to unwind and between both our parents the kids can have plenty of sleepovers at their grandparents house. I'm full on freaked out, this is nuts what the actual hell is going on. I cut the convo short and he incessantly messages me over the next few days.

I depended too much on my partner to get me through my anxiety and episodes. At the very least if your relationship is going to work you need to set boundaries and put some time in for yourself. You need to practice self care too. It sounds like the relationship has become very codependent and draining for you. This isn't sustainable or healthy. It's important you have a conversation and maybe plan a few things each week just for you. Express to your partner that you love and support her but you need to do some things for your own mental health. Whether it be spending a few hours spread out through the week where you can practice your hobbies/interests or see friends, or even one evening where you can have some alone time and decompress. Otherwise this relationship will break down and you will continue to be burnt out. It's important that you aren't reduced to a caretaker in a relationship. You need to be able to find a way to sustain the romance and partnership beyond the dynamic you have now. She also should try to access counselling or CBT or something so she is able to better work through some of her day to day symptoms without you, it will make her feel more independent and capable with time, and if she doesn't believe she can do it or that it won't help let her know it really helped me. Knowing I could stand on my own two feet made the bad days a bit easier, and the slightly better days even better. It was honestly the best thing I ever did for myself and for my relationships.

{"fh828d2": {"text": "I mean maybe I'm not a feminist in the modern sense. I don't ascribe with radical feminism or man hating feminism. I do believe feminism is still important because there are still huge parts of the world that still have huge gender disparities and women still face severe oppression. And for a majority of western history women were oppressed and there are still lingering issues (though not as blatant as women not having the vote or being considered property) because societal structures were built on this oppression and gender disparity. But I believe these issues are still pervasive in our societal structures and extend to not only women, but men, minorities, lgbt+ who all suffer because of it and we need to continue to address how to create meaningful change to rid society of biases and prejudice. I feel like a lot of movements and \"solutions\" are either virtue signalling or bandaid solutions to try and force change on unwilling participants. By continuing an inclusive and open dialogue we may actually get somewhere though. I think the us vs. them mentality is harmful to progress . So yeah, maybe a lot of people would say I'm not a \"real\" feminist now a days but I still believe in what was started with feminism and it's intentions and think it can still be beneficial.

It was all a lie, he failed out of school, was unemployed, and lying about so so much while telling me I wasn't doing enough or pulling my weight. I too did not have the heart to throw him out and lived with him for 2 and a half months before he finally found himself a place which was awful for me, great for him. I'm still in the healing process but have been lucky that I already had a psychiatrist due to my mood disorder who helped support me through everything so I didn't get in to too dark of a place, even though I did (and still do) have bad moments or days where the despair and heartbreak creeps in. I'm so sorry for the loss of your fur baby, my cat has been the biggest comfort to me through all of this, it would destroy me if something were to happen.

Hell I wasn't even good at keeping up with my CBT , once the psychiatry student finished her placement  I never booked another meeting to meet the new student because it made me really anxious. But I do want to let you know that it's ok to forgive yourself. Med changes profoundly affected every aspect of your life, and the ways that impacts you shouldn't be minimized or underestimated.  If you still are not on meds that seem to work for you and you're seeing the same psychiatrist, you have the right to self advocate and ask to see a new psychiatrist. Having a good fit with who you are seeing is really important. When you feel you have been able to make some changes and are in a better head space you can always try to reach out to your friend again, it may not mean you guys will be close again, but at least you can get closure by apologizing for what happened. Only if you feel able to of course, because I understand how stressful and anxiety inducing reaching out to someone you were close to after you hurt them can be, and I've had to come to terms with lost friendships because it was too painful for me to reach back out to them after everything. I know you're not ready to talk about things during that time with your therapist but when you are ready, you can talk to them about it, their jobs b is to help you work through the struggles and hard times without judging you. For now you can always ask your therapist how you can go about being a better friend in the future and how to address feelings of guilt you have from when you weren't in a good mental space. I hope with time each day starts getting a little less miserable, until your days are more good then bad. You deserve that. (Apologies for the wall of text.

Also try not to fixate too heavily on what you will be or may be diagnosed with, people convince themselves they have a certain illness all the time but the truth is we are not the professionals and we could say well I feel really good some days but then I'm depressed a lot and that doesn't mean you meet the clinical criteria for mania or hypomania. It's best to leave that part to professionals and for now try to focus on learning self care, and trying to be consistent in taking your medication because medication compliance is very important and it is the best way to determine if a med will truly work for you or not. I hope this helps, if you have any questions or anything feel free to ask, and good luck with your therapist appointment", "link_id": "t3_b9iyn9", "time": 1554422177}}

It might not be rational but my feelings on the situation were still very real and worth addressing. Good luck I wish you both the best. Mental illness can be a challenge in a relationship. It can helpful in a relationship in some ways because once you learn your partners patterns and triggers of depression and you are sensitive to it then you can talk to them and learn very early on what things in the relationship the two of you should work on to be closer and stronger together.

I would pick fights when depressed because of negative and irrational thinking. Little comments I would persevorate on and assume he was meaning it in a hurtful way, even though that wasn't at all the case, but depressive episodes arent rational. Some of the biggest things that helped was him taking the time to learn patterns that I have when I started falling back in to depression. It also helps when he takes the time to check in with me and gives me a chance to bring up things that have me feeling down. And most importantly just being there, supporting me as I cry and just being someone who comforts me even when my thoughts are irrational. You cannot fix depression and trying to correct obviously flawed thinking won't help unfortunately. The best thing you can do is be patient, give your partner a platform to express what shes going through, and let her know you are there by her side through all of it. Asked the boyfriend and he says try to understand that when your girlfriend is depressed what she is saying isn't meant to hurt you. Shes dealing with difficult things going on in her head. Try not to take it personally if she sounds bitchy or grumpy because it's not you, it's not personal, shes just struggling through something. Be sensitive, understanding, and try to keep your ego out of it. Remember you love her all the time and the negative times don't define her as a whole person. It helps to distinguish if sass or harsh comments are because of her depression or because she is struggling with her emotions. He said he's the kind of person who always wants to be right in disagreements and he found he had to put that aside to give me the space to express my feelings and after he did that he found it a lot easier to support me.

My partner, whom I have been living with for 9 months has stolen my bank/credit card 3 times (for a pack of smokes, money to buy pot, and for mcdonalds) he also kept money at christmas that his parents had asked him to give me (I found out when they asked if he had given it to me). I have confronted him several times about the purchases with my card and he denies it was him but they all occured while I was sleeping and my card was always back in my purse afterwards. He swears he never would have done it and he hates that I suspect him and insists he has never told me a lie. I havent mentioned the money from his parents because I'm certain he'll tell me he gave it to me and I just forgot. On top of this he is not perfect, he hasn't gotten a job or gone back to school like he said he would before we moved (he left his job when we moved cities and moved in together) and when I began feeling financial stress because he isnt contributing he said he moved out from his parents because he didn't want to be forced into a job or school, he wants to make his own decisions. He doesnt understand how he could possibly be burdening me even though he doesnt work, barely buys groceries and owes me a ton of money. He didn't pay internet bills he was responsible for and in order to get it turned back on I had to pay $400 which he promised to pay back. He also got a $300 traffic ticket in my car which was a huge fight until he finally said he would take responsibility for it but it was like pulling teeth and he hasnt paid anything towards it yet. The fights are terrible, I never feel heard or respected, he will say he understands but always adds a 'but' that explains why I'm unreasonable. I know he loves me and tries and that the last 9 months have been hard but I've really been trying to be hopeful that we can get through this and he will be the man I know he has the potential of being, but he barely tries at all. It''s so true, there are so many more issues beyond the theft and the lying. He is not perfect. And I dont know if there is anything that could fix that. Your comment has definitely made me realize maybe I'm tired of making the sacrifices and trying to overlook all these issues. I'm tired of hoping he will be the man he told me he was, because it is not the man I've seen since living together. ", "link_id": "t3_5qv1qz", "time": 1485731186}}
