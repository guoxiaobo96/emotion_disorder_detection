{"fosdex5": {"text": "I relate to this SO MUCH. When I was younger I went to church at least 2x a week. Oftentimes 3-4x a week. During my time there I would experience psychosis symptoms\u2014 which I mistook for \u201cfeeling God\u201d. I would hear voices, hallucinate, go through extreme highs and lows, feel rushes of euphoria, and much more. I was undiagnosed, and the church convinced me these feelings were completely normal.I was also obsessed with the whole concept of religion, God and Christianity. I believe this obsession was another symptom. My whole life completely revolved around it in an unhealthy way. I would feel extreme guilt and judgement from members about lots of \u201csecular\u201d things that are very common (and sometimes even healthy) in today\u2019s society. I ended up leaving the church to see how my life would look without such a heavy involvement in religion. That was about 3 years before I was officially diagnosed.I still wish to this day I got out sooner. It was so hard to let go of many of the things they made me think was normal. They made me believe all my symptoms of bipolar were something I could just pray away. I wish SOMEONE would have recognized I was struggling with an intense mental illness and pointed me in the right direction to get help. It was completely obvious that I was not well, but no one did anything to help.Now I\u2019ve been diagnosed for several years and had an intense treatment process that includes medication, and I\u2019ve never felt better.

{"fkj60e3": {"text": "Two years ago in a manic psychosis, I got a German Shepard puppy. This was on top of being a full time college student with 18 credits, 2 part time jobs, a sorority and a serious relationship. I got him because I was paranoid out of my mind, hallucinating and felt like he would make me feel safer. This was right before I was diagnosed. (Not the best reason to get a puppy, trust me I know)He made me feel safe and protected me when I was really out of my mind. I love him so much it\u2019s unbelievable. Soon after I got him, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I started medication and therapy, and my psychosis (&amp; it\u2019s accompanying paranoia) went away. This was when I realized the gravity of the decision of having a dog was. I went into a depressive episode from the wrong mix of medication, and was so low that I was not able to take care of myself well or him. Being newly diagnosed, I didn\u2019t realize this was a temporary episode and that it would subside with the right mix of medication. I had such low energy and was so down that I thought life would be that way forever.Out of my pure love for my amazing pup, I came to the heartbreaking decision to rehome him. I spent several months going over all the options and figuring out the best plan possible. I refused to place him in a situation that wasn\u2019t better than the one I was giving him.Finally I found my pup an incredible home. He went from living with a broke college student in a tiny apartment, to a beautiful family with younger kids and big house and big yard to play in. The dad takes him for morning runs every day, and the kids play with him all day. He is in such an amazing home now, so much better than the home I would have ever been able to give him. When I realized eventually that I was in a depressive episode, I had a small degree of regret that I didn\u2019t stick it out and try and get to a better place mentally to provide for him. My heart breaks that I had to give away my baby, my son, but I know without a doubt now that he is in the best home possible and is living an amazing life. I still miss him every day, and am so thankful for the safety and love he gave me. But, my mental health is significantly better without the extra responsibility of another being to provide for. I wish I could have given him the life I wanted to give him, but I have peace knowing he\u2019s living a better life than I could ever dream of for him.Hope my experience can help. I wish the best for you and your pets! If you decide you can\u2019t handle the stress of providing for them, I would say that is a very selfless decision because you have their best interests at heart and only want them to be in a loving home.

For me, the delusion really subsided when I started taking Seroquel regularly. Not only did it help with my mania but it helped with my overall thought process, and it made me feel like I was physically here on earth and that I was real. It took away the \"cloudiness\" that I felt 24/7. It took several months for the delusion to really subside, but now for the first time in many years I feel \"real\" again and have for almost a year. If I were you, I might talk to a psychiatrist and see if there are any mood regulatory medications you can be put on to help (I don't know much about the med you are taking).

Either way, I didn't feel comfortable bringing it up to any of my friends so I didn't.This was my strategy. Buy a small pill carry container (if you don't have one already) that has different compartments to store your different medications. [This is the one I use](https://www.amazon.com/Opret-Compartments-Organizer-Dustproof-Certified/dp/B073Z85QG3/ref=sr_1_34?crid=21PS02BX8Y106&amp;keywords=pill%2Bcontainer&amp;qid=1567475705&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=pill%2Bcont%2Caps%2C192&amp;sr=8-34&amp;th=1), it's small and discrete and you can throw it in a purse. When it's time for you to take your meds, excuse yourself to the bathroom and re-up.For the food issue, you can either buy snacks/groceries to have in your hotel room, you can persuade your friends to go out to eat with you, you can order (uber-eats, doordash, etc) food to your hotel, or you can make a quick trip out to a fast food stop or any little restaurants around where you guys are staying. Usually, there should be lots of options around. All you have to say is guys, I'm hungry and I'm going to get some food! And I'm sure someone else will be hungry with you, if not, you still have a great excuse to sneak away and grab something.I have the same sleeping schedule as you so I also needed an excuse to get out of late-night adventures. It might be kind of childish, but when it's time for me to sleep, I go into my room and just pass out. My medication keeps me heavily sedated for a nights sleep, so there's no way for someone to wake me up once I'm asleep. I totally used this to my advantage. I passed out whenever it was time for me to sleep, no one could wake me up, and the next morning I would laugh it off and say \"oh yeah I was soooo tired last night.\" My friends weren't \\*too\\* happy, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.Don't let your fears hold you back from an amazing trip!

It sounds crazy, I know it wont happen but the second light is gone...I'm out of my mind.I'm glad you found my comment helpful! I wanted to reach back out because your reply here really stuck out to me. I'm no doctor, and I can only speak from my personal experience, but what you mentioned here sounds word for word what I was going through before I initially was diagnosed. Before I even knew what \"bipolar\" meant, I experienced major paranoia and insomnia every single night just like how you are describing it. I would be so terrified, and I would check my entire apartment multiple times to make sure no one was inside and hiding and watching me. I would cry and beg and plead for my boyfriend to stay with me every night because I was so scared. I would see shadowy figures out of the corner of my eyes, and hear noises that freaked me tf out. I was truly terrified for months on end and had no idea what to do.Now that I am aware of my diagnosis, I can understand much better what I was going through. It turns out, I experience a large increase of mania at night time, and it builds from around 9 pm all the way until 4 or 5 am in the morning. This would push me to a state of psychosis-- which explains why I was paranoid, seeing and hearing things. My psychosis would take me to a state where I was absolutely terrified, so I do really understand what you're going through and I'm so sorry you experience what you describe. I really wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy.What helped me was taking a large dose of Seroquel at night time to forcibly make me fall asleep when I was too paranoid. And my psychiatrist also started me on taking small doses of it throughout the day to slowly lower my overall mania levels. The trick is to go with it-- when you take a large dose of seroquel at night, let it knock you out no matter how paranoid and scared you are. Trust me, just lay in bed (keep some lights on if you want!), get cozy and watch some movies (having another source of stimulation besides my own mind really helps me at night), and let the seroquel take you away when its time to sleep. You will get into a routine of doing this, and your body will adapt (very positively) to the lower levels of mania. If you continue to take a large dose at night and smaller doses throughout the day (or if it's not of seroquel, if you're at least taking something to lower the mania throughout the day) you will find your psychosis will go WAY WAY WAYYYY down. Over time, your paranoia as a result of psychosis will disappear almost completely if your body has only an appropriate level of mania inside it. If you let the mania get out of control, your psychosis will come back and with it the paranoia and insomnia. It sounds like to me you and your psychiatrist are heading down the right path, and you should feel your nighttime psychosis very quickly start to disappear.Cheers to your health and best wishes to your recovery, you are off to an amazing start!

{"eydtiup": {"text": "Honestly it just takes time for your body to get used to it. It destroyed my life for the first 3 months because I was so damn tired. But eventually you get to a place where your body has a tolerance and you don't feel so tired anymore. The hazy, zombie feeling will definitely go away, I know what you're talking about. That will be the first to disappear and then you will start feeling less and less tired each day. I'm on 700mg and have been on it a year. You can do this! Once your body adjusts you will love how effective it is at taking away the mania and anxiety. (side note-- coffee increases mania. I used to drink coffee but I stopped completely because it was just too much. You can drink it to balance things out but be careful not to have too much)", "link_id": "t3_cwj22w", "time": 1567024523}}
{"eyds0yr": {"text": "I'm on seroquel. It is the strongest medication I've ever tried and knocks me out like no tomorrow. It is also by far the hardest medication I've ever had to adjust to. It tore my life apart for the first three months. I slept through class, my job, all of my responsibilities and commitments; basically the entire day. I would feel like shit because I'd go to sleep somewhere between 1-3am, and would wake up at 5pm the next day, missing all of my morning and afternoon meds. Not good, but things were even worse than they appeared. Seroquel was one of the first antipsychotic medications I tried right when I was diagnosed. I didn't realize what exactly mania and depressive episodes were at the time of my diagnosis, and really had no clue how my brain was functioning. And what I didn't realize was how out of control my mania and psychosis was. At the time of my diagnosis, I was experiencing almost nonstop psychosis for around 6 months straight. Once I started seroquel, it took away a LOT of the psychosis I was feeling, and sorta brought me back to earth. However, this medication caused me to shoot into a major depressive episode-- one of the worst ones I've ever experienced. Because I was taking an antipsychotic medication for the first time, my body wasn't used to the decrease in mania. I ended up depressed for six months-- laying in bed, not being able to do anything, sleeping the whole day away for months. I didn't realize I was in a depressive episode until it was too late, and I lost my job, failed some classes, and was at risk of losing everything. As soon as I realized I was in a depressive episode, I ran to my psychiatrist and asked for an antidepressant to balance it out (don't do this, it's super risky, turned out to be an awful idea, but that's a story for another time). I finally understood that to be able to function as a human, at least for me, I needed some level of mania in me, no matter how small. The smallest bit could carry me through the day and allow me to function.Despite these issues that did really take an immense toll on my life, I still would recommend Seroquel. I have now been on it a year, and my body has almost completely gotten used to the sedation. It's all about the right routine and finding the right level of mania that works best for you to be able to function. I take small doses of it throughout the day and a large dose at night to knock me out. Without it knocking me out, I'd be up all night working on unnecessary projects that become meaningless once the sun comes up. Sometimes I can even fight the Seroquel and make it to 3 or 4 am, manic af doing god knows what before I pass out into a sedated sleep.I don't want to scare you, I just want you to be prepared to handle this intense medication. It will make you more tired than you've ever felt in your entire life. It will soothe your brain and remove psychosis, mania, and anxiety. It's very effective. It can cause a depressive episode if you aren't careful and if you take larger doses and cut off your mania supply completely. If you give it a chance, and can stick it out for the first 3-6 months, you will really enjoy the good side effects and the calmness it brings. I tried a few other antipsychotics, but none worked like Seroquel.Best of luck to you, if Seroquel doesn't work out for you-- there are many more antipsychotics to try!", "link_id": "t3_cwl8md", "time": 1567023917}}
