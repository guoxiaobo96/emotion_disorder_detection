My first crush ever actually, and as we talked I'd grab lines from our conversation for the book. In the level 2 dream it was me trying to take this old sand castle. But this giant thing lived there. I had similar powers to Superman and he was more like the Juggernaut. Every dream I would fail and wake up and tell the girl about it, but also grow stronger. In the third time going in I got just as strong our punches hit each other, creating a black hole. From there I was in a future setting similar to fallout. And had to find work.
