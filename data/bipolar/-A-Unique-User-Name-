A large amount of studies have questionable methods, studies that have \"positive\" results are more likely to be published. Psychiatrists probably don't want to admit to these potential outcomes to lessen the stigma around ECT and the fact that it DOES have a high chance of reducing depression quickly (but for the short term). No other psychiatric treatment comes close to the dramatic, quick improvement ECT can cause - it's instant gratification for the doctors who perform it. It's all too easy to discount cognitive dysfunction as a result of the depression itself. Maybe for some people the risk is worth it, but I for one live in fear at the possibility of being forced/coerced into it. I'm not someone who's easily triggered but even though I've never experienced it, I panic when I see ECT scenes in media.

With such few beds available, they have to keep in mind the possibility that the next patient to come in might need the bed more than you.

Extreme pain at the effected joint for a month, clicking (which stopped after a few weeks), pain radiated to the rest of the jaw (but not as bad as where the injury happened). I pretty much couldn't open my jaw at all for a couple weeks. Started getting a bit better after that. Went to dentist and she kept reassuring me it would go away and for once I decided to not be a hypochondriac and tried to wait it out.The strange symptom: I developed muscle spasms that caused my teeth to bite down involuntarily - not just at night but also during the day and I don't think it was stress related it was truly bizarre. This has since gone away. At that time I was taking prozac so I'm wondering if I was getting EPS from that.No migraines. Mostly left side but right side hurts when I overcompensate with that side. No specific time for the pain - worse while eating of course. Some nights the pain is so bad I take Ativan to sleep. I can open my mouth about 20mm but sometimes a bit more when the pain dissipates. For a while my bite was off and it wasn't lining up but it seems\u200b to have become more level but it's still a different bite then before the injury. Not much neck pain. I've developed sciatica 3 months ago which I think is unrelated. Also unrelated chronic wrist strains. Went to Rheumatologist and I don't have arthritis or lupus.
