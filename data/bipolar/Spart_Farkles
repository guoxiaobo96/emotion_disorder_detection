My disorder isn't the first thing I tell people, so usually by the time I tell people, they've interacted with me enough to kinda just go \"oh, okay\" and move on. Maybe it helps that I bring it up so casually like it's not a big deal.I do still get some negative comments. Like my well meaning mother and I were talking about my potential future romantic relationships and my mom said \"well does [person] know you're bipolar? Because that can be a lot to deal with.\" She honestly meant well, but it stung. And then you get ignorant people who say things like \"yeah, this chick is crazy. she never tells me what she wants, must be bipolar.\" But I can handle all that.Edit: This is definitely just my experience.
