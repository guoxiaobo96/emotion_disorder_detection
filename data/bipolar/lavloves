{"ftrofwg": {"text": "I live in the US. This year in February, we found my Aunt in her house, she wasn\u2019t able to move and she was wheezing, she looked like a corpse. Upon her arriving at the hospital and getting admitted to the ICU, she is diabetic and she was in severe DKA with bilateral pneumonia, she had textbook every single symptom alongside with her blood sugar being up past 800. She almost died. All of the nurses up there are positive that she had covid19. Terrible dry cough, glass looking shards in her pneumonia riddled lungs, high fever, gasping for air, etc. She thought that she was just having panic attacks initially before she went out of it with DKA, we actually found her with an inhaler next to her in bed. We both work at that hospital, so naturally we are around lots of sick people often, and I\u2019m one who believes that covid19 was around before the news started blowing up about it or before anybody really knew about it. Before it was even confirmed in our area, our medsurg unit was riddled with pneumonia patients. I\u2019m thinking she could have gotten it from a patient at work. I\u2019ll also mention, lots of family members and friends of ours who visited her while she was in the icu got really sick. My brother got a really bad respiratory cold, including my little sister, mom, and stepdad. My aunt and uncle got sick and described it as \u201cone of the worst flus they\u2019ve ever had.\u201d However, me and my fianc\u00e9 were with her lots at the hospital and she was coughing up in our faces, we didn\u2019t get sick, or at least show any symptoms. At work there was this cold that everybody kept passing around to each other, but only a few people actually had to call out sick from it.

The residents were allowed to do quite a few activities. Their family members could come pick them up to take them out to dinner or lunch, they had their own little hair salon, all of the meals are made from scratch, they had a little ball kicking activity after breakfast, nail painting for the ladies, little activities here and there like mini concerts in the dining room, movie nights ( but only for the ones that were completely with it ). Holiday things like secret Santa and stuff. The residents were spoiled! Which was awesome honestly. I work at that hospital now, night shift, and it seems more like you\u2019re describing tbh!

{"ft78ea1": {"text": "I\u2019m not sure exactly what you mean by your first question so I\u2019ll give you a rundown of what my living situations have been throughout last year. So I\u2019m 21, I had just turned 20 last year when my dad got engaged and told me he was selling my childhood home, so I needed to find a new living arrangement. He offered an apartment and even paying first few months rent. But no, I insisted on living with fianc\u00e9 ( whom was just boyfriend at the time ) and his family, because they welcomed me &amp; I always had so much fun over there. Around March of last year, I moved in with them. At first it was great. I was happy, everything was great and everybody was getting along.. then I wanna say like 3 months in, his mom started every now and then getting snappy with me out of nowhere. Me and fianc\u00e9 weren\u2019t getting along all the time bc his mom started acting like that and he didn\u2019t see what she was doing, despite my constant talk about it. Throughout the months she gets worse and worse, throw in a few huge freak outs on me along the way. She\u2019s accusing me of stupid shit all the time that makes no sense and just attacking me. Fianc\u00e9 finally snaps out of her brainwash somewhat and starts to see things, when she told him that she\u2019s kicking me out &amp; I have to be gone that next day. He texted me while I was at work and said \u201cwe need to find a place to live ASAP\u201d now, fiance didn\u2019t want to believe that his mom was this cruel. She was manipulating everything and of course he was falling victim to it, but thankfully months before she kicked me out fianc\u00e9 had started getting in her face &amp; telling her to quit her shit if she was yelling at me or insulting me. He had tried being calm and collected but she wouldn\u2019t ever listen to him. When he took up for me she would yell back at him \u201cTHEN GET OUT OF MY HOUSE\u201d every single time. Lol.  Well anyways, the next day after he texted me about us needing to find a place, me and her got into probably the biggest argument I\u2019ve ever had with somebody whom isn\u2019t blood related to me lmao. She threw all my shit outside. There\u2019s lots of details to this whole story, I can link my first few posts here if you want. Me and fianc\u00e9 had nowhere to go so we went to my moms for a few months until we were able to financially support ourselves. So from the October to January we lived with my mom. Which was also a train wreck which is why we got out of there ASAP lmao. I\u2019ll mention he started going essentially no contact with his mom once we moved in with my mom, as she was trying to get him to leave me literally every single day. In January my boss started renting out her old house for us, and we\u2019ve been living here since. He proposed in January as well. He has stayed very low contact with his mom and sister still. They may text every so often. Fianc\u00e9 went to sisters graduation because he knew his sister would never forgive him if he didn\u2019t. It had been the first time we\u2019d gone to that town since we left in October of last year. Me and fianc\u00e9 are doing great and getting along, every so often his mom wants to pull some shit but we don\u2019t give her the time of day when she wants to be a drama queen. We live about an hour away from her. We avoid her like covid 19 lmao.

{"fscq43c": {"text": "I work nights at a hospital and it is an absolute world of difference from being in LTC. Think of it this way, essentially all you do during a shift in LTC, You help your residents get ready for the day, you feed them, you change them, you do some activities with them, it\u2019s truly just care. At the hospital, You\u2019re doing most of that, plus some. you\u2019re doing vitals, you\u2019re doing intake outputs, clearing IV pumps, you\u2019re doing blood sugars, helping insert catheters, helping draw blood, wound care, etc. You learn about all sorts of different conditions and medications, you see a lot of gruesome and sometime whack shit. There\u2019s codes, which the aides here don\u2019t really do much but answer call lights whilst all of the nursing staff is helping with the code. I also float to other departments fairly often, and it\u2019s nice to do something different every once in a while and not always the same thing. I\u2019m not gonna lie though, my shift is super laid back, and we have a good time. I wouldn\u2019t go back to LTC unless it was my absolute last option. A typical shift for me, on my designated department, medsurg. the dayshift aides give me report, I go and update boards inside of the patients rooms with the nightshift nurses name and my name as the aide, &amp; pass ice, and make sure the patient is good and have everything they need. From there I will ask all of the nurses if they need help with anything, after that I will go and restock the drawers with items like the medicine mixing bags, IV kits, syringes, etc. I may wipe down the counters with disinfectant if it\u2019s really slow, then after it\u2019s all chilled out I will update the bedboard sheets for the aides, which is essentially the basic info of the patient, how they ambulate, their diet, how often they get vital signs, if they\u2019re incontinent, etc. Just making sure all of the info is correct for the dayshift aides. I will continuously ask the nurses if they need help with anything throughout the night, I help with turns and changing patients of course, and call lights. Since there\u2019s usually 1 aide on the entire hall that has 28 rooms, we aren\u2019t required to get vital signs unless it\u2019s solely to help out a nurse that\u2019s running behind on things. If there\u2019s 2 aides we\u2019re required to do vitals on half of the floor each. Once around 5:00 am hits, I will pass out the new intake output sheets for the patients, I will print out the ISBARS for the day nurses, and that\u2019s about it, I give dayshift aides report and I go home. Unless we have a floor filled with incontinents, people whom need help getting to the bathroom, lots of dementia patients who keep trying to get out of bed, or lots of admits, we usually have quite a bit of downtime and bullshit around with each other.

The best advice I have for you is when you go onto a shift, ask that specific charge nurse what they expect of you, all charges are different so they\u2019ll expect different things out of you, do what that charge expects of you. Also, just make sure all of the nurses are always caught up and don\u2019t need help with anything.

{"fs59d2u": {"text": "I currently work at a hospital in a medsurg unit, I love it and I love the nurses, I\u2019ve had past experience with a nursing home which honestly, I had a terrible time there. I find this really often with new, freshly out of school nurses, they don\u2019t communicate very well, and are very reluctant to ask us for help, or tell us that they\u2019re fine and don\u2019t need anything, and will end up running behind because they think they can do it all, which ends up in the aides helping anyway, it\u2019s fine and I don\u2019t mind at all, but I definitely wish they would just be upfront about needing help so I can help them with what they need when they need it. Some nurses do take advantage of the aides, hogging them for all of their patients, when the other nurses need help as well. Especially when there\u2019s 1 aide on the floor, some nurses will eventually have other nurses helping them if an aide is being hogged. Don\u2019t make me do all of your vitals and I &amp; Os if there are other nurses needing my help, especially if you\u2019re all caught up on charting and meds otherwise. Nurses that absolutely refuse to help the aides &amp; don\u2019t appreciate them and want to make us do all of their work. Sometimes we can\u2019t turn or change a 350lb patient by ourselves, sometimes I\u2019m stuck in another room while your patients call light is going off and I can\u2019t get to it. If I\u2019m having to ask a different nurse to help me change your patient, and you\u2019re not busy in another room, that\u2019s an issue! If there\u2019s a bed alarm going off/pull alarm... don\u2019t sit there and wait for an aide or somebody else to go get it, We don\u2019t care if it\u2019s not your patient, that\u2019s a fall that could occur and you could be the only one able to stop it if nobody else gets to it before you. Get your ass movin homie! If you only care about your patients only and won\u2019t help with anybody else\u2019s, you\u2019re in the wrong profession. Be thoughtful and at least act like you care about your coworkers, don\u2019t be lazy and careless, one night I was helping a pregnant nurse with a combative patient who was trying to punch us, and I didn\u2019t want the nurse to get hit in the stomach, I thought we would be better off having 1 more person to help hold the patients arms so she couldn\u2019t hit while we changed her, and I went and asked 2 nurses for help, and they simply said \u201cjust put mitts on the patient\u201d and completely disregarded what I asked. I had to have the charge nurse help us with that patient, and The house supervisor was informed of those two nurses not helping when we needed them. All in all, I really love the nurses that I work with, but I\u2019ve definitely had my experiences with mean, careless, and lazy ones. Really cool of you to post this though, it\u2019s nice to see nurses that care, Thank you!", "link_id": "t3_grdlyv", "time": 1590710160}}
{"fs54x88": {"text": "I work nights at a hospital, 7-7 and on a medsurg unit, although they do often float me around everywhere. The biggest differences for me, and this could differ from state to state and hospital to hospital, nursing home to nursing home, etc. but for me when I worked at a nursing home, they didn\u2019t let me do anything really except for resident care. I wasn\u2019t allowed to do vital signs, apply powder or creams on to residents, no finger sticks, etc. But now, I do it all, I do vital signs when nurses are running behind and need some help, I do intake and outputs for them, clear the IV pumps, empty foleys, I haven\u2019t been trained for finger sticks but I\u2019m able to do those if trained, I can apply creams and powders if needed, when a nurse is doing an IV or inserting a catheter, or any invasive procedure, they will sometimes have me in there to help hand them things and hold legs/arms if needed. Mainly what I do on my shift, after filling ice and updating the boards in patient rooms and asking if they need anything, I will repeatedly ask the nurses if they need any help and what they need help with throughout the night, if they need help I will do what they need me to do, I will clean around the front desk, stock on supplies like fluid bags and syringes, etc. and of course call lights. You will have an aide train you as well typically, so you won\u2019t go in completely blind. My hospital is relatively small, a lot of times we will only have 1 aide on the floor and the others on schedule will be floated to another department. I often sit for EODs in the emergency room, or for patients who\u2019s had a sitter ordered. I\u2019m also floated to Geri psyche, comprehensive rehab unit, join replacement, etc. if there\u2019s a full floor though, we will from time to time have 2 aides on medsurg and we will \u201csplit the floor\u201d ( which we usually ignore and end up getting each other\u2019s lights and other things, honestly. ) If there\u2019s only 1 aide and it\u2019s a busy night, the nurses are understanding and won\u2019t give you shit for not being able to get that one set of vitals because you got stuck with a code brown in another room. Don\u2019t let them run over you or hog you, other nurses need help too. For sleeping schedule, the first few weeks might be hard, I got on nights because of the same reason you did, I was always up late anyways. Before you start, try to sleep as if you\u2019re working 7-7. Wake up around what time you think you\u2019d wake up before a shift, and go sleep when you think you\u2019d go to sleep. Get as much sleep as you can, 12 hour shifts are tiring and lengthy. What I absolutely love about working where I work, is that the nurses actually help you with patient care, and sometimes even will help you with another nurses vitals if it\u2019s a busy night. We all do the dirty work and we all help each other. When I worked at the nursing home, the nurses absolutely would not help the CNAs and would find any other way for them not to help us, they were rude and demeaning, acted as if they were royalty and we were slaves, they wouldn\u2019t even get call lights for us, they would let them ring until one of us came out of another residents room just to tell us that a call light has been going off for minutes now. Even the CMAs were mean and wouldn\u2019t help us. I had gotten 3 write ups at that nursing home within a span of 4 months. I have yet to get one at this hospital, and I\u2019ve been working here for over a year. But of course that was probably just that nursing home in particular. These nurses rock and I\u2019m actually friends with these nurses. I\u2019m not gonna lie, the nurses at the nursing home ruined me so much so that I\u2019m still very shy and secluded around nurses, even over a year later, but I\u2019m still getting better at it and thankfully they all like me a good bit. If any nurses up here take advantage of the aides, they actually get in trouble and some have been fired before. Your main thing is helping the nurses, annoy them if you have to but just make sure they\u2019re not in need of any help, if they don\u2019t, do something else productive in the mean time!Sorry this was so long, I just find the difference between a nursing home and a hospital so vastly different it amazes me.", "link_id": "t3_grrula", "time": 1590707748}}
{"fs5166h": {"text": "I feel like as a CNA you\u2019re always going to experience dementia patients, I worked at a nursing home when I first got certified and I thought the dementia there was bad- then I got hired on at the hospital I currently work at.

Some can be as simple as they keep trying to get out of bed during the night and they\u2019re not sure as to where they are, and some can be as severe as having to call security every time we go in to change them and having to put mitts on them because they keep beating the crap out of us.

It can definitely be scary and overwhelming at first, and it\u2019s definitely not for everybody. You just can\u2019t take it personal yanno, they don\u2019t realize what they\u2019re doing. In my personal experience, nursing homes are usually ridden with dementia, and the labor is usually really heavy. I\u2019ve heard that assisted livings are sometimes a little easier with labor, as more of the residents are able to get around with standby or x1 assist, not as many bed ridden or lift requiring patients if you know what I mean. You could also try a skilled unit/facility. When I worked at the nursing home the skilled unit usually didn\u2019t have as many residents with dementia.

So She had a full double mastectomy, the surgeon did save her nipples, no breast reconstruction surgery, no implants, she wanted to for a while but then decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. I will say I\u2019m a CNA at the hospital she got the surgery at and the surgeon who did her mastectomy doesn\u2019t have a good reputation, people commonly get really bad infections from him because he does things too quickly and isn\u2019t always very thorough. I didn\u2019t work there at the time or know this, or I would have pushed for a different surgeon for her. The fat that she has surrounding her breast area is what is dimpling up, and her nipple is crusting over, it\u2019s only on her right breast area. When she was first diagnosed it was on her left breast. She often complains about pain in her legs. She takes opioids and has become reliant on them. She also uses kratom to help with the pain as well. So I\u2019m sure those pills could definitely be contributing to why she\u2019s in so much pain all of the time. She did do chemo and radiation, the works. I thought she should have been going to see him, I figured it was like protocol to go back often to make sure everything was going well, she hasn\u2019t been in a long time. Idk how she\u2019s been getting her cancer pills refilled if she\u2019s not going to see him every few months. I know she\u2019s really scared. I think her mindset is \u201cif I don\u2019t know about it I can\u2019t be scared.\u201d It\u2019s really hard for me to get her to stick to anything, she will say she\u2019s going to do something but then will back out last minute. I told my brother what\u2019s going on and he said he didn\u2019t know that she had cancelled again, he said there was a paper she needed to take up there to them but she kept forgetting. ( she has had a very bad memory ever since she went through chemo and radiation. ) he said he was going to persist on her to make another appointment again soon and keep reminding her. I guess that\u2019s all I can go off of right now.

I texted her and I even got to the point of telling her that I loved her regularly. She told my fianc\u00e9 (boyfriend at the time )  that she thought I was the one for him, because I was always there for them and willing to help. I moved in with them eventually. Because I was considered part of the family. Seemingly out of nowhere, she starts trying to sabotage the relationship. Saying condescending SHIT to me, sayin I said or did something when I didn\u2019t, saying my fianc\u00e9 said something he didn\u2019t, making big dramas out of tiny things, telling my fianc\u00e9 Im never gonna be worth anything and that he shouldn\u2019t marry me, she kept obsessing over me \u201ctrying to use my fianc\u00e9 to get pregnant\u201d.

I lost nearly 20 pounds because she wouldn\u2019t let us put food in the freezer and I was just so depressed. She turned into a psycho bitch. . She kicked me out, I mean threw all of my shit outside, she tried to make me homeless, and accused me of stealing her \u201cbaby boy\u201d from her. Whom is 23 this year I\u2019ll mention. He came with me, We stayed with my mom for a few months. And now we have a rent house together and are engaged. Fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t even want to talk to her anymore. He can\u2019t stand her, she tries to get all up in our business and tries to come by uninvited to bother us, she accuses me of not letting fianc\u00e9 talk to her, but he\u2019s fucking choosing not to. She\u2019s insane. Maybe she\u2019s noticing that you\u2019re becoming really important to your boyfriend, and she\u2019s not liking it.

I suggest y\u2019all find your own place if possible after the quarantine. What is good is that your boyfriend is defending you, some won\u2019t talk back to their moms and will actually take up for them. Have you ever asked her why she hated his ex?

{"fmqcfar": {"text": "There are people out there that NEVER realize that they\u2019re an asshole, or manipulative, or just a hard headed person. Either they never realize it or they\u2019ve got their head stuck too far up their ass that they will absolutely not admit to it, or even attempt to see it. This is a VERY goof thing that you\u2019ve noticed. I never really thought about how bad I was in highschool/middle school, until I got on my old iPad ( it synced to my old phone and all of these texts from way back were on there. ) from how I treated my friends, from how I treated the guys I dated, Once I saw those texts, I felt so disgusted with myself. In one convo this poor guy I had dated was pouring his heart out to me, telling me that I broke his heart and had cheated on him, and I was cussing him out in return and calling him all sorts of names. I felt so bad I was in tears, I actually sent him a message telling him that I\u2019m so sorry and I cannot believe I used to be like that, and you know what he said? \u201cWow! This is something I never expected to hear!\u201d. I must have been pretty damn bad. He was very sweet about it though and told me he forgave me a long time ago. I believe I apologized to a few other people as well, and there\u2019s still some I wish I could apologize to, but I\u2019m no longer able to get in touch with them. I didn\u2019t have a very good home life, my parents divorced. Lots of fighting between me and my mom, whom I didn\u2019t live with, me and my dad always fought and argued, I mean yelling in each other\u2019s faces fighting, verbally abusive, he had a girlfriend who was terrible to me, I just wasn\u2019t very happy and I guess I let myself take it out on those who were around me. I was on antidepressants from a really young age, I think 13? I never really thought my home life was that bad, until I started to think back on it a little bit and I realized how broken it actually was, and how it broke me. Just because there were other households a lot worse than mine, doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t terrible. Leaving my childhood home, and moving out was probably the best thing to happen to me in terms for my mental health. I also smoked a lot of weed, which I think also made me reflect on myself and life a lot, I\u2019m not saying you need to do this I\u2019m just saying I think it definitely switched something in my brain lmao. Maybe I\u2019m just permastoned and permanently \u201cchilled out\u201d.I have a way better relationship with both of my parents now, I have had stable friends for years who I love to death, I\u2019m engaged to a great man who brings out the good in me, I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2, which I\u2019m not saying is an excuse to be mean, but it could have been a factor in all of my past assholeishness. I actually think that I still feel so guilty of how I used to be to people that I try to overcompensate when it comes to helping people out, or giving advice. I just want people to know that I\u2019m there for them and that I\u2019ll listen. Because that\u2019s probably what old me needed the most, was somebody to listen and understand. You have a lot of time to reflect and think on this, think of some of the worst things you\u2019ve done or said to people, think of how much that hurt said person, think of how they must have felt.. and put yourself in their shoes. Really think on your life right now, at a glance you may think everything is fine and nothing seems bad, because you may be living comfortably, not struggling with money, parents might still be together, but that doesn\u2019t mean things aren\u2019t going haywire and you\u2019re maybe just oblivious to it. I\u2019m not saying this is what\u2019s happening. If you really want to change, you will. You\u2019re feeling guilt, and noticing your habits, that\u2019s GOOD. Just try to understand yourself more, it takes time but eventually you\u2019ll see how your brain works and you\u2019ll be able to figure out why you say or do what, or why you react a certain way to things..  the rest will come easier afterwards.

So I don\u2019t know if she would even consider that, considering the whole reason she won\u2019t let your dad come along is so she can just bully you, she knows your dad won\u2019t let that shit slide and would probably chew her ass out, not to mention I\u2019m sure she would try her best to make you look bad to your dad.As soon as possible get your SO out of there, get your own place, and go no contact or very low contact.

For all we know she could have google searched how much to take for it to not kill or affect her much, tell her family that she did it and to take her to the hospital. Could be far fetched but I mean idk. She\u2019s showing every sign of just insane manipulative behavior. For instance, threatening to commit suicide and telling you that it would be your fault because you left her.. What you said she does to her parents. I work at a hospital and when we get EODS ( emergency order of detention ) which are suicidal people or people that are a danger to themselves or others, we cannot let them leave and we send them to a facility after an evaluation takes place. I\u2019ve seen those who genuinely seem like they\u2019ve completely given up, and accept that they\u2019re going somewhere to help them get better, they may cry about it but they know it\u2019s for their own safety and health, and then I\u2019ve seen those who come turn themselves in acting like their worlds ending and then once they find out they\u2019re gonna be sent somewhere they do a complete 180 and \u201coh I\u2019m not gonna hurt myself, I think this was just a big misunderstanding!\u201d And throw fits and try to argue their way out of being sent off. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the same way it works in your state, or hospital, but if it is this gives you a chance to figure out what you\u2019re gonna do regarding this situation, and hopefully give her time to calm down. And to conclude, I\u2019m not saying she isn\u2019t a genuine danger to herself, and I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s impossible that she\u2019s actually planning to go through with something. I just see it very unlikely seeing how she\u2019s being very manipulative and I see it all of the time. Hopefully she gets sent to a facility and she\u2019ll think things through. I wish you luck dude.Edit: also, very much so leave her. She seems like a very unstable and toxic person and you need to get out of that before it affects you even further. Like you said, you don\u2019t love her anymore, there is no sense in staying. If she does hurt herself, it\u2019s not your issue, may feel like it.

I hear really good things about L\u2019Or\u00e9al lash paradise. I use L\u2019Or\u00e9al true match powder foundation, I personally don\u2019t care for liquid foundations very much and how they break down on my skin, but that\u2019s a personal preference. This going to be a light coverage foundation so if you want something more full coverage I suggest the wet n wild photo focus foundation. It\u2019s a liquid foundation, use it with a brush or beauty blender. As well as cult favorites like maybelline fit me or L\u2019Or\u00e9al true match liquid foundation.

He slept with me every single night for years and years, he would wake me up in the middle of the night just to get under the covers and curl up next to me and I would be big spoon, or he would nestle up to my neck, He was always there and he was my boy..  he had kidney failure and when we found out, it was too late to do anything about it. I had an appointment to have him put to sleep that next day, but he ended up passing right in front of me the night before. Truly one of the worst pains I\u2019ve ever felt. This sounds really bad, but I\u2019ve had friends pass away before and I got over that quicker than this cat. I will say, it does get easier. This isn\u2019t something that will go away over night obviously, I still find myself breaking down at night when my mind randomly stumbles over him, but it\u2019s starting to die down.  This also sounds bad, but give yourself a month or two, and if you\u2019re up for it, really consider getting another pet. Not to replace your dog, its impossible to replace a close bond like that. But to fill the space so you aren\u2019t always alone and aren\u2019t caught up thinking about it constantly. A tip: let the animal choose you, it assures a better connection with the animal.

I think that her talking down to you while standing over you is symbolizing how she commonly talks to you, talks down to you and just makes you feel little. You may be a little bit afraid of your sister, hence you getting scared of her of course in this dream, and you can tell her all day that you aren\u2019t afraid of her but some part inside of you is. Her sitting on your head and not letting you up and you not having the strength to do anything is I feel showing your submissiveness and you not feeling strong enough to do anything about her behavior and how she\u2019s always interrogating and testing you. It could also be, shes sitting on your head and she tries to GET INSIDE of your head in waking life. Now your mother\u2019s involvement I\u2019m thinking you wish she had more say in what your sisters doing, or took up for you more and stood by your side when your sister is belittling you per say, beating you up. But you couldn\u2019t reach her in your dream for her to save you. Also, not a part of the interpretation but I know MANY people, mostly men, in my person life that have a very similar personality as you. Men don\u2019t usually like to show their emotions and that\u2019s just a fact, some people don\u2019t find jokes as funny as some other people, but considering your sister is going out of her way to MAKE you laugh because she\u2019s testing you, hell I wouldn\u2019t laugh either. what she\u2019s pounding you on is simply your personality and you are NOT a sociopath just because you don\u2019t consistently show emotion.

I\u2019ve always had very few friends, in high school I talked to lots of people but not many I actually considered friends, in recent years I\u2019ve stopped hanging out with people as much, and don\u2019t expect much from those friends I do have.

{"et67d25": {"text": "I have a bunch of recommendations! I too struggle with tangly hair. I have very fine strands, but there\u2019s a lot of them so it tangles very easy. My hair is dyed brown but I have some damaged ends from when I bleached my hair about a year ago. everything that has grown out from then is very healthy. 1- my favorite brush to use is a tangle teezer. The bristles are flexible and it\u2019s painless to use, which especially helps if you have long hair. I swear by these and have been using them for years. They make dupes for these at Walmart and at most drugstores. They come in a few different styles on their website. https://www.tangleteezer.com/us/ 2- sulfate free shampoo! I did this about a month ago and it\u2019s made my hair significantly softer and less frizzy, and it\u2019s so so easy to comb out when I get out of the shower. Shampoos that have sulfates completely strip your hair of all of your good oils. So it makes your hair quite strawlike. Of course there are people that can use sulfate shampoo with no issues, but I really suggest trying it. It will take a few weeks for your hair to get used to it. It doesn\u2019t suds as much as sulfate shampoos and you have to make sure your hair is VERY wet when using it, even adding more water while you\u2019re massaging it in. I recommend washing it twice because it\u2019s very gentle and if you have oily roots it won\u2019t get all of the oils out the first time. It\u2019s also good for colored hair as it\u2019s not as harsh and will gently cleanse, making your color last longer. 3- olive oil. I don\u2019t know what professionals think of this, but I personally have good results. I get some olive oil, enough to cover roots to ends. And I put it in the microwave until it\u2019s warm, not hot. If it\u2019s hot then just wait for it to cool down. And then I massage it into my hair really well and cover my head with a shower cap. I usually do this on a day that I\u2019m not doing anything, so I leave it on all day while I\u2019m lounging at home or cleaning the house. Or you could sleep with it in. Just put a towel down over your pillow Incase your shower cap slips a little during the night. Once you decide to rinse it out, wash your hair twice, especially the top of your head and your roots. Really get in there. When you get out style as usual, I promise you will find your hair much softer and shinier.  You can also do this method with coconut oil, I heard it works well too. 4- leave in conditioner or hair oils. Make sure if you go for the oil route, you\u2019re using one that\u2019s light on the hair, and don\u2019t use too much or you risk making your hair greasy. Don\u2019t put it on your scalp, only your ends. I recommend using it on your hair damp, after washing it. But you can do it on dry hair too. You can usually find some decent leave in conditioners at your drugstore, but definitely do research on which ones are good. 5, my last recommendations, Use as little heat on your hair as possible, let your hair air dry more, get regular trims, as split ends cause your hair to tangle more. Try not to put your hair up too much, or use tangle free hair ties. Use deep conditioners every few weeks! Also, try not to wash your hair every day, let your natural oils build up.
