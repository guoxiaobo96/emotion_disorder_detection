So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.It reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.

My moms side is where I think things come from.  On her side, I have an uncle with alcohol problems and his son (my cousin) is currently having issues with holding down jobs and fighting with parents/leaving home.My mom was depressed for a period of time, but that was more situational because my brother and I were shitheads as teenagers.  My brother has been severely depressed for years after a lot of substance abuse in his late teens/early 20s.The fact that no one in my family is diagnosed is one of the biggest reasons I doubt myself and think I'm making it up/projecting symptoms onto myself.I just remind myself that I had no idea what bipolar actually was when my psychologist first brought it up to me, and I cried when I searched it online because it was so similar to what I'd been saying in the sessions.And I don't have any environmental factors except drugs pretty much.I reaaally want to do one of those genetic tests to have something tangible that says it likely is (or isn't by some miracle) bipolar.

The only way I can get into ketosis is if I'm very busy or have low appetite for some reason and then I'll take advantage of it to get into ketosis.

{"djw8ipt": {"text": "YES keto!! I've had the exact same experiences with it and it's not just psychological.  Once your body changes from using glucose (which is what sugar and carbs break down to for the body's energy) and instead uses fat as energy, everything gets so much easier.  When your body begins to use fat as its main energy source, that's you going into ketosis.  This is by eating approx 20g or less of carbs/sugar a day.  This is where your body goes straight to your fat stores to burn energy.High-fat low-carb meals are calorically dense, but the high protein and the minimal fluctuations in blood sugar keeps you feeling full without cravings.In my opinion it's important to eat a nutritious and balanced diet to reap all the benefits.  Kale, spinach, and other leafy greens are worth adding.  Low-cal fruits like any kind of berries are great, and fresh squeezed lemon water to start the day.  Once you're in a steady ketosis and you can try working in higher carb fruits/veggies like sweet potatoes, broccoli, etc. to see how many carbs/sugar you can handle while still remaining in ketosis.The science behind keto/low carb fascinates me, mostly because it was the first thing to give me the best body I had ever had while also keeping high energy levels and feeling good.Srry I just really love keto. Anyone correct me if anything I stated above was wrong.  Keto makes me more anal about food but it also keeps me skinny with high energy and cognitive functioning.  I could go on forever about it.  When I went crazy keto for a few days, (no more than 5 carbs/sugar a day while also having a 600-700 cal limit) I got so tiny and I still felt healthy with energy.I'm rambling but keto is seriously the answer (especially for meat and cheese lovers)", "link_id": "t3_6lsaga", "time": 1499418880}}
