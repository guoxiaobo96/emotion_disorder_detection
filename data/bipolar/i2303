{"fuuzi83": {"text": "I feel like mental illness is a topic that gives writers some liberties to create situations that are tailored simply to contribute with the plot/character development as opposed to portrayal accurate a representation of reality. That happens, I figure, because most people don't know (can't know, understandably) how it feels.What I want to say is: most of these movies, books, etc. don't want to represent mental illness as it is, because they haven't got anything to gain from it, for their broad audience wouldn't be bothered with a purely fictional representation -- and their stories do gain a lot from this choice.That's why I don't mind on my side. I believe any reasonable person can understand that they can't grasp the concept of any mental illness from watching Joker just as than they wouldn't say they know how is like to be in the police because they watched Die Hard.I wouldn't worry about it, but I do get some people might be offended. For me, it wasn't relatable at all and seemed so much a deliberate fiction (in opposition to other movies like Filth, that, in my opinion, hit a little closer to home) that I couldn't get mad at them.", "link_id": "t3_h940ml", "time": 1592186865}}
{"frlgei9": {"text": "Hey man, I get where you coming from (no cryptic meaning intended here). I'm also very glad you managed to keep rational despite all that you've been through.I think, since you said you've been dealing with this for quite some time, you have an idea of how your kind of possible mental issue work. That is, is very easy to make connections and draw conclusions where there's nothing.If you google about psychosis, you'll find that some fairly common beliefs are that you have superpowers or that you're in the middle of some conspiracy/being followed or watched. Since you say you do better with questions, I'd ask you: how you think your situation is different of those?I think that your safest bet is to try and find the simplest explanation (I do get that a lot of things may seem plausible right now, but which is more likely: that you're going through a tough time right now, or that you, despite the similarities with other people's cases that have been proven to be related to mental health, you are truly in the center of some major conspiracy plot?).I'm genuinely sorry for what you've been through, but again, congratulations for not letting yourself believe in anything and trying to look at your situation as rationally as you can. If there's anything I can do to help, let me know and, I'd suggest, even though I don't think you'll listen (I know I wouldn't listen to anyone when I was feeling a similar way) but you should probably give therapy another go.

But I don't understand (and am genuinely curious to understand how you came to this conclusion) why you sustain the opinion that everyone has a fair trial.The way I see it, a trial is fair if the suspect is judged by what he's actually done. That is, all the court is able to acknowledge most truthful approximation of the events that led to a accusation and act accordingly within a certain legislation.So, if someone that actually did something isn't charged for it due to some technicality, I'd say the trial was unfair.I figure that what you meant is that the elements that constitute a trial are tailored for it to be fair to all parts, but I think that when these elements sabotage each other, as I reckon happened in your sister's case, this fair system become dysfunctional, and thus, no longer fair.If you can, would you care to elaborate (again, I'm not criticizing neither trying to be disrespectful) on how can you believe everyone get a fair trial, despite what happened to your sister?", "link_id": "t3_gnj5q8", "time": 1590039446}}

I'm diagnosed with bipolar and, albeit unable to actually provide you with a yes or no answer as I'm not a professional, I must say you check a lot of boxes.I mean, in my experience, although I experienced highs on sexual desire during mania, I never did anything as risky as you described (not judging, I do get what is to lose control) but I heard other people say that's very present in their manic episodes.As for the lack of sleep, that's exactly the same with me: 3-4 hours and I feel like I just came back from a 6 month vacation on the beach.Buying stuff is something for me too, I don't think about it and even though I understand I'm messing up, spending money I don't have always seem like a good idea.Being less inhibited by social rules is also a thing, just like becoming more sociable and talkative and being less afraid of judgment.I didn't see you mention it, but from my experience and from what I hear from others racing thoughs and difficulty concentrating are very consistent with most cases.Despite all that, I must add that mania is different for everyone, so my what I call mania is not in any way a golden standard. Some people get really really aggressive and irritable, some superfocuse at stupid things, some (myself included, but not everytime) experience delusions such as believing you're being watched or followed (I believe that's something that sets apart mania and hypomania, give it a google if it interests you).Again, I am not by any means a professional, but based in my personal experience, I'd say you have a pretty solid case for a manic episode. I like  for related discussions, maybe more people there can relate to you?Anyways, I'd strongly suggest you seek help, as untreated bipolar tends to worsen with time.Hope I helped, take care!", "link_id": "t3_gn1vvi", "time": 1589951836}}
