I did have a raging yeast infection once that doing the 3 day treatment didn't cure it, so I had to take an oral capsule. My doctor said it was common that sometimes just the tablet won't cure it, but an oral capsule usually does the trick if it lingers.For future, some things I've changed to help with decreasing the frequency of yeast infections:* Only wear pads during your period, and even then, make sure they are \"natural\" pads. I basically gave up pads and only switched my lingers to cotton/more organic* I started using a menstrual cup. The only issue is if you do get a yeast infection while you have a menstrual cup, it is basically gone. Some users say you can boil it and soak in hydrogen peroxide but I just don't want to risk it.* 100% cotton underwear basically all the time.* Decrease yoga pants usage. I did live in them quite a bit but they don't really let your area breathe. Looser / more breathable pants helped* Vaginal probiotics.

As some have mentioned, a common one is to run your finger all around the cup to make sure there are no dents.

Sometimes I'll feel the pop but other times I won't. Then, for good measure, I actually tug at my cup (learned this from another redditor in this sub!). If I pull at the stem and it is giving me resistance, I know a suction has been created. If it feels like I can pull it right out, then the cup wasn't fully open. Sometimes I'll push some more, otherwise, I'll just re-insert it again.It definitely is a huge learning curve and I'm still trying to find the right cup for me!

{"fi0r17c": {"text": "It's an odd time right now as we're more aware of ingredients. As someone that does a lot of research, this is my take on it:There are a few parabens that are a big no-no for sure. However, those have mostly been taken out of everyday products since it is deemed as no good for our bodies. Most parabens you see in products are approved by the FDA, used in small quantities (hopefully) and are there to keep nasty things like mold and bacteria from forming. There are over 100 parabens so people can't distinguish between them, most companies just opt for paraben free. There are definitely alternatives to paraben as a preservative that will also keep away mold and bacteria.FDA also recently came out with a study saying parabens do stay in our bloodstream. What does that mean? No idea. The amount is small and unharmful but that also depends how many products you're using daily, those percentages and how it builds in our blood. They suggest for pregnant/breast-feeding mothers to avoid parabens.For me:  I have the financial means, education and access to products that don't use parabens so I go for the \"better safe than sorry\" route. However, that isn't to say someone that uses products with parabens are obviously killing themselves. It really is about education and deciding for yourself what you are comfortable with.

This way he gets to hunt (as I duct behind tables and counters in my home), stalk (when I stop moving or just move back and forth in one spot), and catch (when he runs after the stick and every few mins I let him catch it). It is also suggested to do these play times before typical feeding, so he gets a good hefty meal from \"hunting\".I also would move the stick so that it goes on the cat tree / couch / bed so he is jumping and exerting more energy. I've also recently started playing fetch with him (though it's more like I throw something, he chases it, and then I have to go retrieve it to throw somewhere else).Basically interact with the cat on top of everything else you're doing.", "link_id": "t3_f0907y", "time": 1581095712}}

{"fgjq7f2": {"text": "I think it is all about expectations and if someone is ready to have a cat. It is a HUGE adjustment and expectations need to be met. So I would sit down and have a serious conversation with your family to see if a cat is appropriate for their lifestyle.Cats get a rep for letting them \"just be\" but especially a kitten, like you said, more training needs to be done.  I would recommend having a litter box at every level of the home. This way, she doesn't need to search for the 1. Like you said, in the beginning, best to confine her to 1 level even until she gets used to things.   The cat HAS to be played with. A kitten has SO much energy and if it can't go somewhere like play, then the couch/doo becomes their toy. That's how things get destroyed. I also invested in some kitty tape where it is double sided, and I put it on items they started to scratch to teach them no. Something I learned from Jackson Galaxy, where you have a \"no\", have a yes. So I would put the tape on my couch corner, but then have a scratching post right next to it. So when they go to scratch, they learn no for the couch but here's something I'm allowed to scratch on. There are bitter apple sprays too for a more short-term thing.I know the spraying bottle method isn't loved by some, but that really taught my kittens to stay off the counters. They still do it now from time-to-time if I leave food out, but in my mind, that's on me. If you put something smelling SUPER good, I'll go for it too.Cats actually love routines. Feeding at the same time, playing at the same time, all of that would let them know it is coming instead of \"searching\" for it if that makes sense.As for allergies, as someone that had 3 cats with allergies, it was a nightmare for a while. But yes to taking allergy meds when needed, washing sheets and clothes regularly, vacuuming regularly, brushing regularly. Also having an allergy pillow and mattress cover made a HUGE difference. I was able to breathe way better at night once I introduced an allergy specific pillow cover. I definitely find short hair more allergy inducing cause the allergen has \"less\" to travel and thus gets into things a lot easier. Long-haired cats are kind of able to \"trap\"/keep it all in a bit better due to their floofiness.

If I remember correctly, a lot of Johnson &amp; Johnson's lawsuit was based on products people used back when it wasn't regulated + they totally did not disclose the use of talc in some of their ingredients, which led to the lawsuit. They did completely eff up on their part but I wouldn't be panicked if my loose powder had talc in it nowadays. Of course, it is up to everyone to choose what they feel comfortable with.I totally agree with you there needs to be more regulation. Look at the recent issue that has come up with chemical sunscreens and how further testing is being conducted. I think another issue is 1 product might be within \"reasonable limits\" of whatever percentage the FDA approves, but no one is thinking what happens if we have 5 products with that same percentage, layered. How does our body react to that? So that 1 product might be \"safe\", but when layered without \"safe\" products, it might be not.I do have to admit that I felt the documentary did a little bit of fear-mongering in some aspects but I understand where they are coming from.

Stay away from eyeshadows though... I find them meh.Lily Lolo is more accessible, a brand from Britain and their products are fine. Nothing out of this world but will do its job.Rituelle de Fille got a lot of hype for a little bit because they have a very edgy approach but I've heard many people say, myself included, that is wasn't worth the price point.

I love their BB cream.If you happen to be in Canada, Urban Minerals out of Toronto is amazing. She's a makeup artist and started with powder foundations (one of the best I've tried and I don't even like powder foundation) and just released some amazing lipsticks.Clove + Hallow has some nice stuff and I do like their liquid lips.

{"ff24ny3": {"text": "Something to keep in mind too that you need both hydration and moisture. Hydration is more \"water-like\" or something like a hylauronic acid serum so you skin can re-hydrate and also absorb what is put on top. Moisture (which is usually an oil or balm) adds but also seals in hydration to keep it from leaving. But if you are super dry, sometimes your skin is compromised and if it's too heavy, it won't know how to absorb it. So it just sits on top, so you need that hydration step so it can pull in all the stuff you put on top of it too.Josh Rosebrook just released a Hydration Booster Serum that addresses people with dry skin and this concept. It's meant to put on as an \"as needed\" basis vs regularity in your routine. Otherwise their Hydrating Accelerator spray is a cult favourite of many.For moisture, look for creams/oils/balms with lighter weight ones like jojoba, argan, meadowfoam, hemp seed, grapeseed... just to name a few. General advice for acne-prone is avoid coconut. Sadly it is an elimination of products to find out what your skin can't tolerate and will break out from.

That isn't to say the organic jojoba oil is bad or isn't good for our skin, but that more nutrient-packed jojoba oil will obvious be of \"higher-quality\". Think of it kind of like getting regular beef vs waygu beef from the grocery store. Both perfectly fine for us to eat, but different qualities and treatments thus difference in price.Basically it is about researching the company and their practices.

Some people prefer a lighter oil during the day, especially if they wear makeup and find it interferes with it, and then heavier oils at night. I personally use the same one for day and night, but switch it up between seasons instead. So you just need to look at weight of oils.However, if you are worried about UV damage, there are oils better suited for day time use when we are in the sun. Sometimes referred to as botanical SPF but isn't meant to block UV rays, moreso teach your cells to protect itself against UV damage (be more resilient). Common ones are carrot seed oil, red raspberry seed oil, or cranberry oil. Best way to think about it is these plants naturally protect themselves against the sun, hence why it has these properties.As for oil or moisturizer first, general rule of thumb is apply lightest weight to heaviest weight. For example, I've had moisturizers before the sink in quickly/more \"gel-like\" texture so it is higher in \"water\" content, meaning I'll put that on first before my oil to seal everything in.

Just a theory, not saying it is.Either way, I would suggest switching to something else that irritates you less and see if it makes a difference?

In the moment if I can't stop myself, I do one of three things:  1) add a bunch of stuff to a cart and sometimes the total amount is enough to make me re-think putting through my credit card  2) make myself get up to my makeup desk and go through items. Even just a simple reorganization usually gets me re-swatching and sometimes I find things I forgot were there so it gives me the \"new\" feeling.  3) I'm on an app called Bunz which is a trading app. The idea is to put stuff you no longer want on there, and if two people happen to mutually like each other's stuff, they meet up and do a trade. I've gotten a lot of new makeup this way and it basically allowed me to get rid of something I no longer want, to gain a new item which then if I don't like, I put it up for trade again.

Now blend this out. No foundation will ever blend away seamlessly into your face and neck since it is different shades, but in this case people go for a happy medium. One that doesn't make either side look grey (too light) or orange-y (too dark or wrong undertone).Trick is to blend face, into hairline, neck AND your chest.

Someone can be really good at their job but if they don't click with me, I find we get no where on my issues because they don't understand how I work or think, so the solutions aren't productive. They'll help to a degree but it doesn't feel like moving forward at all.  I've also had sessions and I went back to my therapist basically saying \"okay, nothing is happening and I don't think this is working\" and then we had a really honest conversations about my needs and concerns and what works for me. This is early in my therapy years where I was still really closed off and not vulnerable, so I didn't realize I was basically giving her nothing to work with and she didn't really know anything else about me aside from my diagnosis. Being actually open and vulnerable with my needs allowed us to make progress.Struggling with self-image is hard :( It took a really long time to get to where I am, and I still suffer from it. Give yourself some slack and even if it's 1 thing a day, try different things that might help you.* Read some self-help books. I loved Brene Brown's Gift of Imperfection as it was a short read and really talked a lot about my self-image on being deeply flawed. There are also workbooks like Mind Over Mood that is more CBT based for at-home activities.* I liked mindful meditation which helped calm my thoughts and bring me back to neutral.* Is it a physical/body image issue? If so (which I struggle with), I picked 1 thing a day that I LIKED about my appearance. I started off so small like \"I like my blush colour today\" (which isn't even about my actual appearance, just something I applied). Or \"at least my hair is washed\". Very simple. And sometimes I would pick the same thing in the span of one week. I just found that helped shift things a bit.* Start a gratitude journal/jar. There are also apps you can do this one but at the end of the day, write something you were grateful for. It's not about self-image per se, but I find being grateful overall, somehow shifts the way you think about things, including yourself.Those are just some basic things I found worked for me.Good luck!", "link_id": "t3_dq405h", "time": 1572619931}}

Not toners based in alcohol or for \"cleansing\" purposes. Also watery or gel serums will add that hydration piece. The best thing is to look for serums with hyaluronic acid or just straight up that like from The Ordinary.Then you need to SEAL that moisture in / prevent it from evaporating. This is also super important at night time as that is when we naturally dehydrate the most. There are products too that are more \"oily/balmy\" that will create a good enough seal against cold sharp winds to minimize wind burns. So basically look for products high in butters + oils.Lastly, don't forget to exfoliate. Once a week at least. If you leave too much dead skin cells (which we are shedding all the time + with dryness we flake faster), the products won't hydrate as it can't get pass all the dead skin cells.

{"f3udmzv": {"text": "Someone explained the differences very nicely so I'll skip that.I recommend an oil cleanser for blackheads, only because oil likes oil. Blackheads are basically a mixture of sebum (natural face oil), debris, dead skin, dust, etc. clogged in your pore and then it oxidized, turning it black. An oil cleanser really gets into the pore vs a water-based cleanser which touches on the surface. The oil will help \"loosen\" and \"wiggle\" out the blackhead. Whenever I oil cleanse, sometimes I'll massage out little blackheads. Warm towel to take off the oil cleanser also helps \"open up pores\" to better get them out.You're on the right track of a BHA as that is oil soluable and will penetrate deeper to also loosen more stubborn blackheads. Eminence has an Acne Hydrator that is packaged in glass (but the pump + cover is plastic) that is 1 or 1.5% salicylic acid that can be applied directly onto problem areas. For super green option (and also expensive), Laurel's blemish treatment is amazing for applying once a day on blackhead areas, for 21 days (which is approx. time it takes skin to turnover) to get rid of blackheads. After that, apply when needed.In the natural world, most salicylic acid is going to come from willow bark extract so anything high in that is great.

We both worked shift jobs which meant the dog had no consistency of times she got walks. My boyfriend also started having major mental health issues, which meant I was the sole caretaker of him, our home, and the dog. Long story short, we ended up giving the dog away to a trusted friend and she's so happy now. She was MISERABLE in our home because I couldn't give it the care she deserved. It wasn't because I was a bad person or didn't love her, but lifestyle-wise, it just wasn't working out.So talk with your boyfriend.

Then there was a point where I would always sleep 12 hours (but that was the depression talking too).Some more tips on top of what some people have given you* No caffeine pass 1pm. Some say 12pm but I find 1 works find for me. That includes tea, chocolate.... anything with caffeine.* Your bed is for sleeping only. This means, no eating on the bed. No watching TV on the bed. No anything on the bed. This makes it so that when your brain sees and feels bed, it knows it is sleep time.* No naps. Under any circumstances.* Exercise during the day if you have to tire yourself out. Never exercise within 3 hours of bedtime though. (This one was the hardest for me because I hate exercising... I find just doing for walks before/after dinner was helpful)* If you can't fall asleep within 30 mins of lying in bed, don't toss and turn to force yourself to sleep. Go read a book for 15 mins. I do crosswords since it \"works\" my brain which makes me more tired.* Do things that set your body into the \"mood\" for sleeping. Warm baths/showers. Scented candles that induce calming like lavender. Sleeping tea. I've even tried a mugwort oil you put on to induce sleep (you try things when you're desperate).* Make sure you are comfortable temperature wise! Not too hot, but too cold, but err on cooler than too warm as cool temperatures induces sleep.As someone has already said, I'm saying it again because I think it's the most important, wake up at the same time every day no matter way. Try to go to bed at the same time but in the beginning, you likely won't fall asleep. No matter how tired you are, wake up at the same time everyday (the struggle is real but gotta force yourself).

Also do your best to switch to all natural make-up (mainly mineral) to avoid further aggravating the rosacea.", "link_id": "t3_d3nv7j", "time": 1568386880}}

Of course, there are tons of exceptions but I've read that from other cat owners + my two boys definitely got along a lot better than my boy + girl.* Slow introductions! Tons of info out there but the best success for them to get along is this method. So feeding between doors, letting the cats smell each other through socks that have been rubbed on each, etc.* My boy cat also has tons of energy and a cuddler, and will purr and love the pets until he wants to play so he love bites. Just make sure to get a cat that kind of matches his energy level as my poor female cannot keep up with his playing. Means I spend a lot of time playing with my male cat to get the energy out so they can both get along. Doesn't mean he won't like another cat, just takes some finessing on our parts.* The \"anti-social\" thing doesn't seem weird to me. My female cat loves to sniff and rub up on people too when she first meets them, then goes hide. Took her a long time to get cuddly with us, and even then, I freak out when she puts a paw on my lap because she is not a lap cat at all.Overall, it doesn't sound like he would've love another companion!

Aether Beauty does eyeshadow palettes that aim to be as zero waste as possible so it is mainly cardboard with no mirror.

To be honest, with the state of the world and everyone trying to be environmental conscious, researching ingredients in beauty products is overwhelming. I've been doing it for 2 years and it still is overwhelming with new research coming out all the time. The research for a lot of things are quite split (parabens is actually one of them, and dimethicone is quite split right now too). At the end of the day, I think all we can do is to educate ourselves and others. Some people don't want to think about what is in their beauty products or produce they eat, or where it comes from, and they either are open to being educated or not. If everyone on Earth were about protecting the environment, the world wouldn't be in the state it is now.", "link_id": "t3_cumwea", "time": 1566657458}}

If you genetically have large pores. nothing can really be done about that.Also using a cleanser with an exfoliate is not going to help a whole lot. A cleanser is on your face on average maybe 10-15 seconds? Exfoliation in cleansers are usually there for maintenance sake. If you want to correct/make change in your skin, I suggest looking at masks with AHA/BHA, or dedicated exfoliation products.Mandelic acid is the most gentle of of the AHAs (short of the newly trendy PHA), so if you can tolerate it well, you might want to go to lactic acid which is a slightly smaller molecule, still gentle but will yield more results as it'll penetrate deeper.

I find it mediocre to be honest. Kind of like drug store quality but not the amazing finds?

Turns out I was more of a cat person since I got 2 more after that one.At the end of the day, I think you bring in a great point about lifestyle. If you are committed and willing to make it work, I think a dog is a great companion. With a dog, it was more interactive. It was a lot about travelling to dog parks, going on long walks and hiking trails I always wanted to explore but a dog gave me a reason to, and much needed reason to get out of the house. They usually cuddle more, want more attention, teachable with tricks, and truly the pet community/stores cater more to dogs. Not to say you can't have cats that do all those things, but it's rarer. I think having a dog made my life more interesting, but I was working full time shift work (so inconsistent play/walk times), my partner was going through mental health issues, and I lived in a one bedroom apartment with a husky. Looking back I probably should've started with a less active breed and smaller-sized dog but you live and learn. She just didn't fit in my lifestyle at the time and it made all of us unhappy :(Where I am in my life, I just much prefer cats due to their independence. I still have 1 cat that can learn tricks, cuddly bud and requires lots of play time to get rid of his energy. Overall, it just makes me feel better knowing I can leave them alone all day and it'll be okay. This might be an over generalization but I find dogs to be pretty standard across breeds in terms of walking, feeding, play time, treat-motivated, etc. versus cats vary so greatly in personality. Not to say dogs don't have various personalities but I generally find cats to be pickier about random things.That's just my own experience so hopefully you can take some things away there! :)", "link_id": "t3_cr6vkr", "time": 1565973752}}

I also throw in some treats in there when we start the trip for good measure.I also loop the seat belt through the handles in case if there is an accident, they don't go flying.Luckily neither of them are the puke-y kind so I've never had to deal with that.Never had to do this but you can also spray a calming spray inside the carrier before the trip. I would 100% suggest a calming diffuser plug-in once you get to your new place. I know both of my cats were super stressed out in the first 2 weeks we moved. One wouldn't eat and the other would meow excessively throughout the night/any time we weren't in the same room. The diffuser helped TONS in them settling in.Just my 2 cents...

If you really believe in it absorbing negative energy and helping you, it also helps to set it on a window sill during a full moon to help cleanse the stone so it has room to help you to continue healing.People also talk a lot about diffusing essential oils.

I have a family doctor who prescribed me medication, go to a therapist monthly (more if I'm having a rough time) and added in a naturopath to help with fatigue that the medication wasn't helping with (after trial and error) and also because I was starting to taper off them after 3 years so I wanted to be in my best health when I did it.With medications, it IS a lot of trial and error and it can be very frustrating and time consuming. However, I wouldn't recommend getting rid of it all togethe trying. I also find with some medications, it took about 1-2 weeks for things to \"settle\" in, but the first 1-2 weeks was all kinds of wacky.A therapist has been the best thing in helping me manage on a daily basis and I don't think I would be where I am now if I just had medication + naturopath support. Most places have long waitlists but it is definitely worth a try.I wish there was a quick and easy fix but with mental health, it is a lot of patience, waiting game (especially with our system), and trial and error. Best of luck!!Recommendations:  I don't know if they are taking new patients and how old your son is, but CAFCO is great and equipped with good therapists.

If everything is prescription, you could be seriously drying out your skin/killing your skin barrier, which causes your skin to over-produce oil, which causes more acne. It's a sad vicious cycle.

I have found a steady routine actually makes a huge difference. * On the lines of the routine, set schedule of sleep time and wake up time. I still struggle with this A LOT but I find when I can sleep around the same time-ish, it really helps my mood.* Job with later start (or flexible start times). I still work my 8 hours shifts but I was able to find a job that lets me start at 10AM. Mornings are super hard for me (takes me a long time to get out of bed, especially when I'm depressed). So I find the fact I can start later, really helps to start the day right without me feeling horrible for being late.* A supportive work environment/supportive boss. I don't call out often because I hate it but having a boss that understands I need to take a mental health day, makes all the difference especially with my anxiety level (which in turn makes me more depressed). Plus having a boss that understands mornings are difficult for me so if I'm 5 minutes late, I don't get a scolding. If she needs to talk to me about my work ethic, it is in a constructive and respectful way. This goes for all things that go wrong at work so I don't spiral into depression when I make a mistake.* A job you love. Nothing made my depression worse than when I hated my job/found no meaning in it. It made going to work harder and it provided nothing positive in my life and mood. I spent majority of my day here... I need to feel good about it/it needs to be part of my life to boost my quality of life rather than just \"grinding\" through it.I hope to find something that works &lt;3 It might take some time but so worth it.

Just keep in mind that Zinc Oxide is the only one that blocks all the UV rays, and Titanium Dioxide does not. So make sure your sunscreen has both or just Zinc Oxide (but most of those with just zinc will give you a white cast). It's also the reason why chemical sunscreens always includes a few to get the job done to protect against all UV rays.As always, sunscreen is not meant to be a one and done deal.

You definitely need some sort of moisturizing as I suspect the \"crepe\"-y look is due to de-hydration. You really want to be moisturizing day and night.For PM, use the shea butter on top (make sure it's raw unrefined shea butter). Shea butter is considered an occlusive, which I think of it as a barrier. You want it to lock in the oil you put on as your moisturizer and minimize evaporation overnight.You need to do some sort of exfoliation 1-2 times a week to help with the blackheads. No more than that as you can over-exfoliate. If you want to combat against anti-aging, I recommend adding an antioxidant-heavy serum. It'll help with free radicals which cause aging early on, mostly due to sun exposure. The sunscreen is a must for anti-aging too. Look for all natural sunscreens that have a bit of tint to avoid the white cast or consider a purely mineral sunscreen (powder).With Vit C, I would be careful. Any \"affordable\" vitamin C might not be made in a way that actually benefits your skin. Some evaporate instantly and some won't drop to a more dermal layer to do the hard work.

When it was finally obvious he was fully blind, I was referred to an animal neurologist, where an initial test was $700. I could have kept going to find out what was wrong, but the results was pretty bleak. Fast forward a couple of months, and he passed away. Insurance wasn't able to compensate his cremation and urn (my choice), but they gave me back the adoption fee. So if it wasn't for insurance, I would have been in a lot of debt. This doesn't account for 1-2 emergency visits over the years from my other cats.Basically, if you're unlucky and things happen, insurance is well worth it.
