If you shrink the size of the government, buisness will simply step in and take more power over the lives of the working class. Can they 'legally' do it? No, but they can put every single employee who stands up against unfair and unsafe working conditions on a black list and refuse to hire them anywhere. What is a severely cut down government going to do? Sue them? Then bribery takes place and the government again becomes a pawn of the corporations, except this time they can't even put up a fight.Is your argument that greed is unavoidable and corporations are going to be immoral no matter what we do?

Always leave your enemy a way out, which is why I believe economic sanctions are the best form of defense against Russia, esspesialy putting pressure on Germany to begin cutting back heavily on use of Russian Oil. In the end Russia will never use the nuclear option so as long as we do not invade, and outside of that the only reason Russia has the ability to create close knit alliances in the middle East, is our own involvement in the area, i.e Saudia Arabia vs Iraq. So perhaps supporting less armed conflict. Although I don't think that's a sure fire anwser. For an important note I think Oil rich Nations in the middle East falling into Russian spheres of influence will actually be by and large a good thing. The Russians are sure to play their hand strongly and cause expensive and politically costly deals for oil trade. Which will create political and economic incentive for Western Nations to invest in things like Nuclear. Reducing our need to get involved in far flung conflicts.My counterpoint to the amount of Chinese students would be a personal anecdote. Yes I know anecdotal information is to be taken with a grain of salt. But as far as my experience with Universitys go, Chinese students go together and stay together. They often close themselves off from other students. And my economics teacher has recounted similar experiences of Chinese students cheating rings (I think mainly due to their educational culture). As well as the fact, if you come back from China and start protesting for Democratic change (I.E the Umbrella Protest a bit ago) the government will censor, and even arrest you, even in Hong Kong. You are not allowed to have subversive ideas. Not to mention there is lots of evidence of Chinese companies paying for better media coverage of their nation.
