I was super anxious and depressed all the time, would cry at pretty much anything, had massive mood swings, and was super insecure and sensitive. While I had been struggling significantly with anxiety and depression for the past few years, I never used to be so overly sensitive or tearful. I also had some drama in my personal life that seemed to be the reason behind my deteriorating mental health. However, I eventually changed my bc as I felt it wasn't really working for me, and very soon after I felt much better, less neurotic, and less of a crybaby. But that change happened around a similar time that I was started on new anti-anxiety medication, whereas I was quite minimally medicated before. I also made some positive lifestyle changes, including cutting out unnecessary people, and trying to look after myself more.

Unfortunately I haven\u2019t had that great an experience with my ex fwb. We got along great and said he didn\u2019t have any expectations or want any commitment, and I took his word for it since he seemed like a genuine, straightforward person, like me. Later tho he developed romantic feelings for me, became cold and distant when I didn\u2019t instinctively know how he wanted me to show affection, and became jealous when I told him about the dates I had been on even when we were both seeing other people too. Since then I\u2019ve felt incredibly paranoid and anxious about having fwbs or dating casually bc I feel like I can\u2019t trust what people say, but lack the social skills to work out what they really mean.", "link_id": "t3_c4e8h3", "time": 1561386877}}

I would sit for hours watching documentaries, ever since I was ~3. When I was a bit older I would do research and compiles files upon files of notes on these topics.* Hated hard plastic toys. I collected a tonne of soft, fluffy toys.* Nearly always played by myself, with my own vivid imagination, and hated team games and PE at school, because of the social aspect. * Was very uncomfortable being hugged, hated crowded spaces, loud noises, and bright lights. I remember being brought to tears and hiding behind a chair when my family popped party poppers at me at one of my birthdays (~4/5 yo)* Mimicked my 15 yo sister's personality when I was 6 bc I didn't know how to act around people, and was subsequently bullied for being \"too mature\" and \"like a teenager\". * Refused to wear anything with tight, itchy elastic* Started questioning religion at age 5; my family is Christian* Starting asking existential questions about the nature of consciousness and reality around 5/6 y/o. My brother who was in med school jokingly diagnosed me with paranoid delusions.

I was never evaluated as a child; my family thought my angry outbursts, complete disinterest in socialising with my peers, and sensitivities to certain sensations or noises was just me being a stubborn child. I excelled at academics tho. But even as I grew older and learned how to \u201csocialise\u201d, spending time around people just drained me, I rarely went out, and didn\u2019t do any sports or extra curricular activities. I also always got stressed really easily about a lot of things.

I struggle to go out, to go to class, to take public transport, I still can\u2019t drive, I can\u2019t work, and I hide in my room 90% of the time. It didn\u2019t seem to make sense bc my upbringing was great, my family have always been amazing and we\u2019ve always gotten along, and I\u2019d never experienced any trauma (eg death of a loved one, or abuse). Then one of my drs suggested Aspergers, and the more research into it I did the more I realised it fit with my experiences.Getting that diagnosis validated so much of what I\u2019ve experienced, and had changed my approach to how I handle my own shortcomings, and has allowed me to be kinder to myself.

However, Farouk does take on or control different forms and personas to manipulate David, namely Lenny, The Devil with Yellow Eyes, The World's Angriest Boy in the World, and David's childhood dog 'King'. Lenny was a fellow patient and friend of David's at Clockworks. David also had another friend before he was institutionalised called Benny. When Lenny died, Farouk/The Shadow King altered David's memory, to make Lenny and Benny a single entity, creating a separate, part truth, part fiction personality within David's mind. This way, David would be more likely to trust Farouk masquerading as 'Lenny'.The Devil with Yellow Eyes, the World's Angriest Boy in the World, and King were childhood manifestations of Farouk/The Shadow King. Unlike Lenny, they were simply masks, and not fleshed out personalities. This is why, in season 1, there is a scene showing 'Lenny' transforming between TDWYE, TWABITW, and King, because they are all manifestations/controlled by TSK. We only saw TSK in Lenny's form in season 1 because that was his primary disguise to hide his true identity and to be able to manipulate David.

He says something along the lines of:\"Your power is kicking in to save you; it created me - you did.\"&gt;While this 'creation' by David's abilities is a manifestation of himself, I think this is hinting at his ability to have/create multiple personalities. The very fact that the Shadow King could live inside David's mind for so long also suggests that his mind and his abilities were built to accomodate more than one 'mind' or personality.&gt;The scene between David and Lenny as the SK in ep 8 where David asks \"what am I without you?\" also suggests that the SK/having this second mind or personality is integral to who David is.&gt; Thus, I think, with the trauma and drama from being abducted by the orb thing, and with the vacuum left by the SK, David's power will finally manifest into creating/absorbing multiple personalities to fill this void, thus fully and truly transforming him into Legion.", "link_id": "t3_637obu", "time": 1491239528}}

Similarly, when Syd enters the room and rushes over to Amy, who is sitting staring dead-eyed at the mirror, it is Lenny who jumps her, to whom Syd screams. Lenny then appears to telekinetically drag her with an indivisible rope over to the wall where David is also lying, passed out.

It also helps, for me, at least, to quell a lot of speculation and the different theories floating around. From watching the first episode multiple times, reading the pilot script, and other people's theories, this is what I have gathered:* The interrogation scenes are 'real', or as real as we will get in a show like this* Lenny was real, and when she died, she became one of the personalities or voices inside David's head.* Sydney is not 'Cyndi', one of David's personalities from the comics with pyrotic abilities. The script clarifies that it is one of the other mutants who does this. * Sydney is 'real', as in she is not just one of David's personalities, although I do support /u/conkub's theory about many of the characters having 3 planes of existence so to speak. But I don't think she is 'real' every time she appears in the eps; some of them are flashbacks/memories, projections, or David's delusions. I also think it would be a bit cheap, and while interesting, doesn't make much sense to make one of the core characters 'just a figment of David's mind', especially since Noah Hawley has also said in interviews that he wanted to write a love story. * The Demon With Yellow Eyes is probably not Mojo (sorry guys), as (among many other things) it is described in the original script as more of a black blob, not the fat man we see in the actual episode. Also the 'spider like legs' that were silhouetted behind David's bed before he telekenetically wrecks his room upon inspection looks more like someone doing gymnastic poses, and flipping their legs over their head etc., and thus probably isn't Mojo's mechanical legs, but just a horror element. * Melanie Bird is most likely real as well. I think I read somewhere that she is not or it is not likely that she is also a mutant, but just a normal person who is studying and helping mutants.* That being said, the other mutants could be other personalities, but given that Sydney introduces them to David, it could go either way.
