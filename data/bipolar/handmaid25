I think a lot of the reason that politics and political party affiliation is so polarizing can partly be blamed on these news shows that show the other side as stupid or uneducated (like CNN shows reps) or as flat out dangerous people who are antigovernment radicals (like Fox shows us). I\u2019m not an undecided voter. I\u2019ll be voting Biden for sure in November. That\u2019s not likely to change. I follow the Joe Biden and the Democrat subreddits, but the other day I ventured into a republican sub just to see what they were saying. I didn\u2019t agree with any of their talking points, but I couldn\u2019t help but notice that they talk about us in the same way we talk about them in our subs. They use the same insults with slightly different words. It was an eye opener to me.

If I as a catholic married in a baptist church that marriage would not require an annulment because it was not within my faith. But if a Baptist is divorced (was married in the baptist church) and they convert to Catholicism they ARE required to get an annulment because they were married within their own faith.

I am a divorced and remarried woman who is NOT in full communion with the church. Things like my situation used to result in excommunication. That changed with Vat II. People not in full communion can still come to mass and participate. We don\u2019t receive sacraments, but we are still members of the church. Also, if you do your research, the old rule specifically stated the CATHOLIC church. The newer version of the CCC does not include that. This leaves it open to interpretation that it includes any Christ based church, and that was done intentionally. This is also from the Catholic Church doctrine...The Church has also declared that \"she is joined in many ways to the baptized who are honored by the name of Christian, but do not profess the Catholic faith in its entirety or have not preserved unity or communion under the successor of Peter\", and that \"those who have not yet received the Gospel are related to the People of God in various ways.\"That means that the saved in the view of the Catholic Church includes Protestants too.", "link_id": "t3_gvrvxf", "time": 1591213036}}

I still view him as the leader of our nation, but he doesn\u2019t act like he wants to lead me. I wanted so badly for his reaction to the covid virus to be measured, mature, and helpful. I wanted so badly for that to be the time when he cemented his legacy as an actual leader. I listened to his speeches and waited to hear some semblance of a leader. That never happened. He went on and on about his ratings, how well he was handling the crisis, constantly boosting his own ego. And now here he is, calling for more violence from the very people the protests are against. If you think Biden doesn\u2019t have a chance, you are kidding yourself. Trump is digging his own grave through his actions and his rhetoric.

{"fsj9jf1": {"text": "So here\u2019s the basics of the electoral college system. Each state is allotted a certain number of electoral votes based on population size, representation, etc. Whoever gets the most votes in that state (regardless of victory margin) gets ALL of those electoral votes. The policy began because hundreds of years ago communication was an issue. It was easier for voting districts to report to their state who then tallied the numbers and sent the winning results in to the federal level. But that isn\u2019t an issue at all now. Voting results could EASILY be tabulated on a national level. The reason the electoral college is still around is because the candidates like to just focus on \u201cbattleground states\u201d where the margin of victory is much slimmer.

When I get pulled over by the cops I don\u2019t have to start thinking to myself \u201cDon\u2019t resist, don\u2019t get shot.\u201d  It\u2019s completely unfair and racist. A friend of mine on Facebook described it so well.  It\u2019s worth reading.....\u201cToday was exhausting. The Arbery case got people fired up and some for the wrong reasons.  Some people will just never get it. The hypocrisy and condemnation from some folks is disgusting. Literally DIS. GUS. TING. The truth is some folks  will never be me and I will never be them. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to live in anyone else\u2019s shoes. Regardless of how much people wanna spin the case, the kid died. If what drove the participants in this killing was race, then the conversations need to continue about the prejudices that exist in certain communities across our country. In the last week, I saw so many people across my feed speak up against what happened to Amaud Arbery. I was so moved by how many have said enough is enough. Y\u2019all the real MVPs. I have also had heated conversations with people who were convinced he was a thief and \u201che shouldn\u2019t have been doing that because otherwise he would be alive.\u201d Huh?! What?! I was called a dumb something or other in Spanish because I was \u201cmisinformed\u201d because the boy was thieving. Then today \ud83d\ude29 bruh. Today literally was \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Why lose my peace right? Well you see, I have 7 sons and 4 grandsons and although I hate to even have the convo with them, my sons, all at one point wanted to know why they were called certain words, or why certain comments are made, or why I ask if a girlfriend\u2019s parents are ok with them talking to their daughter, why I won\u2019t let them just go about as they please, or why I grill them about everything they do outside my home, or why we practice being stopped for a traffic violation, or why I go CRAZY if they don\u2019t use sir or ma\u2019am &amp; all the crazy other things I will address until I die. Some are normal parenting things. I get it. But some are specifically because they are black and because their dad has had experiences, I have had experiences and they themselves have had their share of incidents that warrants these convos take place. Does that make me a racist as some have suggested? Does that make me a victim of \u201can agenda\u201d. Or does that make me a parent who is very aware that prejudices exist &amp; they may fit a description? I know how much my kids are loved by y\u2019all. No question. I had a friend call me and tell me \u201cthey had no idea that black kids have a talk\u201d ..like \u201cthe talk\u201d. She was so genuinely intrigued by it. She said there\u2019s no talk like that in their home regarding race issues because they just love everybody. That\u2019s very true by the way. The love from them is real. However, not every household in America is like them and for that reason the talk takes place here. I used to think that if I avoided the convo then I would avoid even making race issues a thing and they would live happily ever after. Well then, they got called the N word at school and on the field. They were told by females they couldn\u2019t talk because they weren\u2019t white. That made avoiding the convo hard. So as uncomfortable as it is and as much as avoiding it feels good, talk to ur kids regardless of what color they are that mean people exist and will judge them or others because of the color of their skin. If you have avoided the convo or dont think it applies to your kids, please consider it. If any decide to judge me by this status, please stop thinking that racism isn\u2019t a thing or that people who say it\u2019s happening to them are on some agenda, misinformed, and or are racist for talking about it. Educators especially need to know that these talks exist and that some kids are guarded from jump because of trust issues or past experiences. This goes both ways. I would LOVE to believe that we live in a world where little kids aren\u2019t being taught hate but that\u2019s not reality. Do your part to listen and to talk when it\u2019s needed. Most importantly ABOVE ALL ELSE make room for LOVE. Love pushes fear out. **Do not and I repeat DO NOT engage me with your \u201call white people are racist crap &amp; all blacks hate whites crap\u201d because that\u2019s not how I\u2019m coming at my kids with \u201cthe talk\u201d.
