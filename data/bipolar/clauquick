The 120-day ban on evictions in this state only applies to government subsidized housing and landlords with properties with federally-backed mortgages \u2014 so I\u2019m not included in this. HOWEVER, even if they presented me with a notice (I haven\u2019t paid rent yet bc my roommate was laid off in response to the virus), it would basically only be valid when the stay-at-home order is lifted on April 30 because the courts are closed. I\u2019m pretty sure that order will be extended, too. Also... Idk how I would even move my things... I don\u2019t have personal help and I don\u2019t imagine moving companies are operating because, obviously, there\u2019s a stay at home order. I\u2019ve been looking at other places and no one is providing tours. Which is definitely understandable. There\u2019s just so many things standing in the way of me moving. Could be a good or bad thing for me. I\u2019d like to believe the landlords are being considerate, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019re not.
