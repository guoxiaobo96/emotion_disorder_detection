When people thrive on causing a reaction, they absolutely cannot compute when they get no reaction.

It's definitely a struggle to keep myself moving forward and contributing to the household as I should be when I go between despondent, to angry, to numb, often in a very short span. I'm incredibly blessed to have my husband who has been with me since we were teenagers, and he has learned my signals so well. He can usually tell when I'm going up or down before I do. My biggest advice is MEDS MEDS MEDS.  Your value isn't negated by having an illness, mental or otherwise. Your value can be affected by your response to the illness. Are you following your doctor's instructions? Are you at least trying, even if it's rough? If it's all you can do to get out of bed and dressed, then do that. Get therapy to help get a game plan for daily life as well as long term. Make sure you're practicing self care when you might be feeling like it doesn't matter. When I'm in a down cycle I have a tough time wanting to shower, wear clean clothes, cook, etc but I try to make it not about me. I get myself moving by thinking of my husband and how he appreciates when I'm clean, with brushed hair, and not in dirty sweats. If I'm not up to wearing makeup, a clean face and hair is just fine. If I'm not able to cook something nice, sandwiches or omelette for dinner is just fine. He sees me trying and often steps in and looks after the house and cooking and gets our teenagers to as well.  I make it about him and my kids and that gets me out of bed, because even if I don't feel like I deserve those things, I know they do.Hugs to you.", "link_id": "t3_gocxgi", "time": 1590172083}}

She was unnecessarily rough during the bath.  When we rolled the patient onto her side to wash her back, rather than lowering the patient down gently onto her back she just let her flop back down. I always tried to make sure their hair was smoothed down, ears weren't folded, etc because just because they can't respond doesn't mean they aren't feeling. I learned quickly that when I couldn't find her, she'd be in any available person's room watching TV. She refused to do her share of cleaning because she was pregnant. But, me and another CNA were both pregnant also (lots of jokes from some patients about not drinking the water, lol) and we worked our freaking butts off. She was seriously useless, but I was afraid to say anything because she'd been there a while and I didn't want to make waves, plus she had a personality that made confronting her very unpleasant.

It greatly enriched my life caring for the dying because I always asked my elderly patients about their lives and how things changed during them, etc. It made caring for things like hygiene and toileting much less awkward for the patient, because we were having a genuine conversation while I was caring for them. I received great advice that I still use today. I was pregnant with my son (now 15) when I worked there and all the little old ladies were thrilled to give advice for a new mom. Lots of belly pats and misty eyes. After my son was born I brought him over to see some of my patients on my day off (only the ones without anything communicable, obv). When some people whom is grown close with passed away, I missed the chats but was glad they were not hurting. I was also very privileged to be present at many deaths and to care for the people as they were readied to be moved to the funeral homes. Some passings I was present for by happenstance, but there were a few where the family or the patient themselves asked me to stay. I've seen beautiful, peaceful passings and I've seen ones where the family members were yelling at each other in the patient's room and didn't even know the person had died until a nurse came in to check on the commotion. No, I don't still work there. I spent 2 years in the radiation unit doing the logistical desk stuff while working one day a week as a nurse assistant at the hospice one day a week. I left to work at the hospice full time after I realized that's where my heart was. After a couple of years at the hospice, the management changed. The new regime was totally focused on finances above all. They wanted to change the scheduling so fewer nurse assistants worked each shift (less $ to pay), and to make that work they started discouraging spending 'unecessary time' with the patients (talking, doing foot rubs etc, helping organize photos and paperwork, etc). Quality of food being purchased went down. Free food in the fridge for visiting family members stopped. The management began hosting wine and cheese receptions in the dining room for doctors and other people who might send them people.. while we had grieving families sitting on the sofas in the next room. But the kicker for me was when we had a teenage boy pass away, and his parents left to go have a break before going to the mortuary. Myself and another carer prepared him for transport and waited for the funeral home person so arrive. The manager came over and said that a VIP was being admitted (a minor local politician's mother in law) and they wanted that specific room, immediately. Since the mortuary hadn't arrived yet, she told us to wheel the kid's bed into the utility room to await them while we cleaned the room. I wanted to puke. I finished my shift, went home, and put in my notice. 2 nurses left with me and a month later the entire staff had turned over.

But she had an incredibly high GPA and got a full ride to our state school, with the understanding that she was going to be pre-med and eventually work in an underserved part of the state. She was very wholesome and clean-living with incredible potential. She made it half a semester until she discovered partying. She met a guy on campus and was insanely jealous and suspicious of every girl he knew. She began skipping her own classes to sit with him and read novels in his classes because she was afraid girls were hitting on him (and he was NOT a catch in any way).

{"e9q40y8": {"text": "I went to one that was just odd. We got there at the time the invitation said, but there were no decorations or anything to tell us we were at the right place (park pavilion). We wandered around until we finally saw the groom, wearing regular clothes, and he said \"oh, you can help us if you want.\" My husband, kids and I decorated the whole place for the wedding because somehow we were the only ones who arrived at the time on the invite. The bride didn't arrive until 2 hours later because apparently her mother had left her ( the mothers) earrings with their luggage at the hotel 45 minutes away and insisted on retrieving them. It was outside at a park, and since the wedding started 3 hours late, it was pitch dark and chilly. Once the ceremony began the officiant called the groom by his recently deceased brother's name (Jonathan instead of Joshua) repeatedly. Just odd. BUT....they are easily the sweetest, most in-love couple ever. Another wedding was for a friend of my husband, where they were on a very tight budget. That's not something that makes it a 'bad' wedding, but it was like there was total disconnect between the bride and groom. The bride wore a very simple, classic white lace dress and sandals. The bridesmaids wore pastel sundresses. They were very simple and inexpensive. Bride did her own hair, makeup, etc. The groom, groomsmen, and ring bearer somehow decided to splash out on full pinstripe zoot suits- long jackets, fedoras and all. I was expecting someone to pull out a tommy gun. I'm talking theater-caliber Chicago gangster costumes.  With their tight budget it seemed very odd to spend a big chunk on those.  Photos basically consisted of the females  standing smiling while the males postured  and posed in these  bizarre costumes. The reception was in the same place (school gym) as the ceremony, and right after the kiss they put the music on. It varied wildly from Christian pop to really misogynistic rap to Nickleback/Creed stuff (this was 1999). The first dance was to a sweet country song and the groom kept trying to grind on his bride the whole time  It was like being at 2 different weddings. ", "link_id": "t3_9x0hdq", "time": 1542252445}}

I was quiet and definitely NOT cool, but I was an orbiter of her group. She picked me out as her other half, which meant I was basically the chihuahua in her handbag that she carried around so she wasn't alone. I had a driver's license and a car so she used me to drive her to see her sketchy boyfriends. She had no concern for my safety (RED FLAG). More than once I had to sit in a room with guys that made me very uncomfortable while she banged her boyfriend in another room. She convinced me to hitchhike, take pills \"some guy\" gave her, hang out in bad parts of town for teenage girls, etc.  She was completely self absorbed, but she DID threaten to kill my abusive boyfriend. I had a serious eating disorder, and it took months before she even noticed, and even then she made it all about her (RED FLAG): \"How could you do this to me? You're my best friend, that should be enough for you\". Everything I did had to put her in a good light.She talked about herself and her future and how she was going to do XYZ constantly, and never asked what I wanted to do with my life (RED FLAG). I graduated high school and went off to college in another city (she stayed at home), and outgrew her as soon as I experienced how real friends acted. She was in my wedding (for old times sake), and was mad that we didn't consult her before picking a date. I saw her occasionally after I got married but she mostly just called me to ask medical advice (I worked in the medical field, and she was a hypochondriac). She never asked how I was. (RED FLAG). The last time we spoke, she called me after 5 months of not talking because she had a bug bite and thought it was definitely a poisonous brown recluse bite (very rare where we live) and wanted to know if she should go to the ER. After listening to her talk about herself for a good 30 minutes without a break, she finally paused enough for me to tell her my beloved Oma had passed away, my husband's aunt had OD'd, my mom was critically ill, and I was expecting my second child. \"Oh, that sucks. Anyhow, I/me/me/me....\" I hung up on her. Last time I googled her, she was on a county most wanted list for drug offenses and identity theft. She had twins whom she lost to the state.

The older lady told her kids to shut up and stop being so disrespectful. Now that she knew he spoke Hangul, she was much more comfortable talking to him and he got his information he needed.

{"dqqky3a": {"text": "Very long story.... essentially, I was raised in s non-denominational Christian Church, and unfortunately the pastor there was very good at NOT practicing what he preached. My baby brother was dying in the NICU and my mom asked if the pastor would come be with them and he said no, because he \"didn't like hospitals.\" I attended Christian School with kids who would share their testimony at chapel service and then discuss how wasted they got the previous weekend while they left the service, and other things. That and struggling with eating disorders and bipolar disorder made me very disillusioned with God (who I thought should not have created me to be broken, right?)  and especially with his followers. So when I left for college I sought a religion that I could do 'without other people'. I studied and read and meditated and did everything I could for 3 years but never felt anything but empty. Never felt any comfort or connection. But I was determined that I didn't need anything or anyone in order to be spiritually fed. Again, long story but after I had my son I was in a total pit of despair, with unresolved postpartum depression on top of the other stuff. I was constantly terrified that I was not doing something right and would mess him up forever. Then one day I was sitting in my parked car in a Dairy Queen parking lot, sobbing while my 18  month old son screamed in his car seat, feeling like it would be better for me to kill myself so my son could be given to a better mom, when I heard God's voice as clearly as I could hear the car radio. He said \"This is MY child. Why won't you let me help you?\" My son stopped crying. I stopped crying and listened, and again He said loud and clear \"This is MY child. Why won't you let me help you?\" I prayed out loud and decided to let God guide me in being a mom, in getting myself healthy, and in feeding my spirit. He guided me to a Baptist Church my parents had attended casually years ago, and through them I met some of the best friends I've ever had, who have walked with me every step. My husband (avowed agnostic) began coming with me and ended up being baptized with me. I've never felt more \"home\" spiritually. ", "link_id": "t3_7ha3dj", "time": 1512366578}}
