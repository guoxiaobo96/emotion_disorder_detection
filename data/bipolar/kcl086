A conviction won\u2019t deter cops from doing their job. Placing your knee on the neck of someone who is under arrest, compliant or otherwise, is not proper procedure for any officer or department anywhere. If he is convicted (and rightfully so) bad cops everywhere might think twice about acting outside the law. 2. No judge worth their salt will stop someone who is guilty of a crime like murder from serving prison time when that\u2019s the prescribed sentence for the crime. Cops shouldn\u2019t get a free pass because they\u2019ll have a hard time in prison. If they don\u2019t want to go to prison, they shouldn\u2019t commit crimes like, oh I don\u2019t know, murder.

I should have known that it was going to end poorly when the guy refused to push back my starting date from the Thursday after we got married to the following Monday because he \u201cneeded me right away\u201d. Whatever, we made it work. Anyway, when I was hired he told me I\u2019d be working in the back doing actual baking work but when I arrived for my first day, he was training me he was showing me all the front counter stuff. I asked and he said this is where he needed me so it\u2019s where I was going to work. Again, whatever. It\u2019s a job so I keep my mouth shut. I put up with an absurd amount of shit from him (refusing to let me go home after I had intense vertigo and fell down, he yelled at me and accused me of stealing and told me his insurance would make him have me arrested when the register came up short and then laughed to me about it the next morning after he\u2019d found the money behind the drawer) but I drew the line when I saw him treating customers like scum. A little explanation first: this guy was a micromanager to the extreme. He took all the wedding cake orders and relayed them to the decorators. He never let the couple and the decorator speak. If you\u2019re considering a bakery who doesn\u2019t let you talk to the decorator for reasons other than there isn\u2019t one in house at the moment, DON\u2019T BUY A CAKE THERE.Anyway, this couple (C) came in and told me they were dissatisfied with their wedding cake so I grabbed the owner (DN for douche nozzle). Somewhat paraphrased for length. This whole exchange was probably half an hour. DN - what\u2019s the problem?C - we are really upset with how our cake turned out. We have pictures of what we got and a copy of the order. They\u2019re not even close. We even had people at our reception ask us if the cake was finished being decorated.DN - let me got get your order.   *gets order and comes back to look at pictures*   I don\u2019t see the problem. This cake looks exactly like what you ordered. I took this order myself and I know this is what you asked for! You got the cake of your dreams!C - Well, we don\u2019t feel that way at all. Like we said, we had people at our wedding asking us if the cake was even finished. We were very dissatisfied and would like our money back. DN - That\u2019s ridiculous. You ordered a cake and you got exactly what you wanted. It\u2019s clearly made to your specifications. This is a $400 cake! If I refund that, I\u2019ll go out of business. You\u2019re asking me to go out of business! Why are you doing this to me?C - *in shock*Me - *stares in horror and mouths \u201cI\u2019m SO SORRY\u201d when I make eye contact with the groom*Eventually, he ended up cutting them a check for $15. Yes, $15. When they left and he walked back around the counter, I told him it was the worst display of customer service I\u2019d ever seen and I couldn\u2019t work there anymore.

{"ec3naop": {"text": "Oh FFS. I can\u2019t with this. 1. Veterans don\u2019t want the VA privatized not because the government is SO GREAT at healthcare, but because they want doctors who are familiar with veterans\u2019 issues (hearing loss from war vs. from age, unique mental health issues, amputation, etc.). If the government set up a plan to turn the VA into a non-profit without the government red tape and the same hospital system/doctors that specialized in treating vets instead of just sending them to private doctors outside the VA, I would bet a whole crap ton of money that they\u2019d be perfectly content with it. Arguing that vets almost unanimously oppose privatization should have absolutely no part in the universal healthcare debate because their opposition isn\u2019t due to the **government** being good at what it does. It\u2019s due to the **specialized care** they receive, something a private, dedicated veterans organization could provide, and more effectively without all the government oversight. 2. I understand that $3,382 is less than $4,522 and I have no delusions about where the $19,616 come from. That doesn\u2019t change the reality that in the vast majority of cases, when both people and businesses stop having to pay out a large chunk of money for something and can instead keep it, they don\u2019t want to turn around and immediately put it toward something else. If you\u2019ve finally paid off your car that works just fine and that you like, you\u2019re not going to run right out and buy a new car just because you have the money to take on a new payment. Same way with businesses: they\u2019re going to pocket that money or put it toward another business expense instead of raising salaries. You\u2019re acting as if companies consider health insurance premiums as actual employee salaries. They\u2019re two totally different expenses, even if they both fall under the compensation umbrella. Back when unions first started negotiating health insurance as part of the total package, it probably led to decreased salaries, the impact of which is obviously seen today because inflation and rising costs and all. But changing things now won\u2019t cause salaries to increase because businesses aren\u2019t going to put that money back in the salary bucket.As far as average taxpayer cost, those countries are healthier than America (who isn\u2019t?) and their systems are set up completely differently. Either we lose all the benefits of private healthcare in lieu of state run care (fun fact: I have a friend in Canada who told me they don\u2019t have urgent care centers at all. When her newborn was sick, she had to go sit and wait at the ER since her family doctor\u2019s office was closed.) or we keep private care and that $4,522 figure just goes up with the government eating the cost to insure all 300+ million of us. Also, never mind the devastation wreaked on the economy when everyone employed by medical insurance companies no longer has a job.
