Being disgusted by periods is complete nonsense. No one is asking you to orally consume this material, or sniff it directly. Therefore any complaint is socially constructed - and if you\u2019re gunna argue there isn\u2019t a massive social construction around menstruation and how it\u2019s viewed, you\u2019re completely nuts. Colon is an idiot and a pathetic little man child lol grow uppppppp it\u2019s a fuckin HUMAN BEING MACHINE inside me, it\u2019s so much more incredible and amazing than anything Colton will ever do in his life literally. No offence but creating another human being inside you is fuckin unreal and so much of the disgust around menstruation and pregnancy, not to mention female pleasure, comes from fear and intimidation of the process of life, which is honestly fair. It\u2019s terrifying and awe inspiring. But men throughout history have felt the need to control the womb - and for fair reason, babies are no joke - and whether thru structural means like abortions being illegal or through framing it in a disgusting way. Obviously I am talking about this fear in an extremely broad macro theoretical way. But Colton\u2019s melodramatic position on one of the most natural things on planet earth is a prime example of how these massive structures and constructions function. *whoopie cushion noise* ", "link_id": "t3_b87yrd", "time": 1554166374}}

When I realized chores were on the same level as like basic hygiene of teeth and face washing it rly made a difference. Like I just cannot neglect them or everything crumbles sooooo fast. Nothing makes mood worse than a dirty apartment. Making your bed is an absolute must - duvet covering sheet, pillows at one end, that\u2019s all. Takes ten seconds and it improves your space so much. It\u2019s like the maintenance of tiny jobs here and there that make it so much easier, being aggressive with taking out garbage and then riding cleaning waves as far as they will take u when u maybe do like a weekly attempt at a deeper clean. Like ok for half an hour or one hour I will be cleaning, what that is will depend on what needs to be done the most. Also get used to doing small loads of laundry (this sort of depends on ur laundry situation tho) like get a small hamper and when it\u2019s full it gets into the wash. It\u2019s aoooo much less intimidating to put away than three loads. And finally I cannot express my deep pure love for clean sheets.
