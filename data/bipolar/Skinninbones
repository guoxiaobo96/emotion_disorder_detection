Later I was put on extended release Depakote. Anti psychotics have helped me far more than SSRI's have. If anyone is having repeated issues with their SSRI meds and you haven't tried anything branded as anti-seizure or anti-psychotic, I strongly urge you to discuss doing so with ur psych.

Bipolar (at least for me) causes a lot of paranoia about how I am acting around others, because I need to act \"correct\", so I cant calm down from that if people are constantly around. I guess that's one thing to remember about your friend is sometimes she might be fine but sometimes she might be really, really faking it in order to seem neurotypical. She has to second guess every thought that comes into her head and decide if it's something someone neurotypical would do. It's hard and it's lowkey like acting kind of. You just choose the best parts of your personality for the day and hope no one sees the ugly bits you're dealing with below.She will always see any confrontation as an attack. Her fight/flight response is incredibly heightened already due to her condition and an unexpected confrontation can really just be the spark to the powder keg. In the future I would suggest maybe a disclaimer before the conversation. Like \"hey girl, ive noticed some stuff going south in out friendship and I'd love to fix it with you\". Positive wording and the emphasis on 'us' is key, because when you confront her she is going to feel very, very alone and you need to remind her that friendships are a team effort and you love her.I hope this helps.
