What you're saying here is \"one can accept that there are trans people and also accept that there are some straight men who are disgusting\". ?&gt;Jo literally says she believes that trans women are equally as vulnerable.Jo literally says she is scared trans women will harass \"natal woman\" (again, her words) in a bathroom. Where does \"equally vulnerable\" fit there?&gt;At the same time, I do not want to make natal girls and women less safe.

That is the simple truth.May I also point out how ridiculous this logic is? Why would she think a bathroom door with the drawing of a woman in it would stop a rapist? Which also answers to this comment below.&gt;The argument is that if anyone can just claim to be a woman what\u2019s to stop a cis straight male from claiming to be that to get access to gender restricted areas.  &gt;  &gt;When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he\u2019s a woman \u2013 and, as I\u2019ve said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones \u2013 then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth.Let me re-explain.A human born with biological male organs who believes or feels they are a woman *is the definition of transgender.*To be transgender, they *don't* need to undergo surgery or hormonal treatment. That's a choice. That is the first large mistake in her narrative.Her second large mistake is, later on saying that, despite through her eyes the only way of being trans is undergoing surgery, surgery is also wrong and they might end up regretting it:&gt;I\u2019m concerned about the huge explosion in young women wishing to transition and also about the increasing numbers who seem to be detransitioning (returning to their original sex).Why exactly is she concerned about the apparent *huge explosion* in young women wishing to transition? Also, unfortunately numbers are not on her side here (nor anywhere else in her manifesto, really) as there are [studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0092623X.2017.1326190?src=recsys) that show that the rate of regret versus satisfaction is actually pretty low in comparison (6% vs 94% to 100% satisfaction).Lastly, let's say I feed into your bathroom concerns. You ignored a point I brought up. What about trans men? Born biologically female, but transitioned to male. If we follow this \"safe bathroom restricted logic\" in which people go to the bathroom according to their genitals, that will mean trans men will need to go to female bathrooms. So, what would stop a cis man to pass as a trans man and enter a bathroom?This is wrong in so many levels I don't even know where to begin. It has been studied for *years* that most victims of sexual assault know the victim, and they are usually a **family member or friend**. The \"rape in bathroom stalls\" or \"alleyways\" are the lower percentage. In that lower amount, even lower are the ones perpetruated by trans women.Do you not see the fallacy of her logic?She's saying the following:\\- I care about trans women, but\\- trans women are only trans if they fall into my definition of trans (surgery/hormones), otherwise they are just men\\- but if trans women undergo surgery, they might end up regretting it!\\- and it's also concerning the high amount of women wanting to transition! (again, why exactly concerning?)\\- so, I want trans women to be safe\\- BUT\\- trans women present a risk to \"natal\" women (so, therefore, trans women aren't \"natal\" women, or \"real\" women).Is it a bit clearer now how many times she contradicts herself in her own speech? The second she said \"I love trans women, but\" all hope was lost.", "link_id": "t3_h11tf0", "time": 1591938021}}

JK says she's scared trans women (who haven't had surgery, which she also opposes) will attack \"natal women\" in shared bathrooms. Do you:a. honestly believe a bathroom tag will stop a rapist? What makes you think that cis men will be stopped by non-shared bathrooms?b. realize you're leaving out trans men out of this narrative? If we have toilets separated by genitals, this would mean that trans men are forced to go to the women's toilet. So, what would stop a cis man from pretending to be trans and \"rape a woman\"? Do we need genital barcodes?Defined terms are debatable, are not the same in every country, and are progressively changing as we progress mentally. I have no idea where this whole concept of trans women posing a risk comes from. All I've seen are cherry picked articles, wrong data and misinformation. Which to me just screams irrational fear, or phobia. Transphobia.", "link_id": "t3_h11tf0", "time": 1591915109}}

I always appreciate a discussion with people like you.I don't have much to add - other than she did explicitly say, twice, she only considers trans those who undergo surgery or hormone treatment. My biggest issues with all of what she wrote is that her comments are baseless. She is pulling numbers out of thin air, but when you dig deeper you find out she's actually very wrong. So, she didn't take the time to do research which is very insulting to the community.If she had, she would have found that most cases of sexual abuse do not happen in bathrooms by strangers, let alone by transexual strangers, but rather by people the victim knew (often family members or close friends).She would also have found the number of people who regret transitioning are quite low (according to this [dutch study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2012.653300?src=recsys), 6% versus 94% to 100% satisfaction).She would also have found that transexual people who are denied their identity often suffer psychological distress, consistent abuse and in many cases ends up in their suicide. And, finally, she could also have found that sex and gender are not the same, and should not be treated as such. Anyway, thank you for at least reading me. I'll be happy to share more resources on this topic, if you are interested.

{"ftnlayw": {"text": "&gt;if an intersex child looks more feminine, it is likely that their biology more closely resembles a female and therefore they identify as a womanNope. [Please read this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex_medical_interventions).&gt;Intersex medical interventions, also known as intersex genital mutilations (IGM) are surgical, hormonal and other medical interventions performed to modify atypical or ambiguous genitalia and other sex characteristics, primarily for the purposes of making a person's appearance more typical and to reduce the likelihood of future problems.  &gt;  &gt;Specialists at the Intersex Clinic at University College London began to publish evidence in 2001 that indicated the harm that can arise as a result of inappropriate interventions, and advised minimising the use of childhood surgical procedures  &gt;  &gt;In a study in L\u00fcbeck conducted between 2005 and 2007 ... 81% of 439 individuals had been subjected to surgeries due to their intersex diagnoses. **Almost 50% of participants reported psychological problems.** Two thirds of the adult participants drew a connection between sexual problems and their history of surgical treatment. **Participating children reported significant disturbances, especially within family life and physical well-being \u2013 these are areas that the medical and surgical treatment was supposed to stabilize**.  &gt;  &gt;Reports published in the early 1990s state that 20-50% of surgical cases result in a loss of sexual sensation.  &gt;  &gt;Parents may be advised that without surgery, their child will be stigmatized, but they may make different choices with non-medicalized information. However, there is no evidence that surgeries help children grow up psychologically \"normal\".  &gt;  &gt;Studies have revealed how surgical intervention has had psychological effects, affecting well-being and quality of life. Genital surgeries do not ensure a successful psychological outcome for the patient and might require psychological support when the patient is trying to **distinguish a gender identity**.I can keep going, but to sum it up. To date, most people who are born intersex go through surgery without consent. And, as stated above, almost 50% of the patients who got surgery to \"biologically assign just one sex\" reported psychological problems and disturbances later in life.Where am I going with this? That basically, biological sex doesn't define your gender. Biological sex is not just female/male genitalia - and intersex people are one of the best examples when it comes to cases like this, to help separate one from the other.Biology, genes, chromosomes, hormones... all of these do not fall into male and female according to science, but rather into a large spectrum of diverse results. An intersex human born with both genitalia might get surgery and be raised as a biological sex, then later in life face psychological repercussions because they do not identify with said biological sex.So we can conclude from this that biological sex =! gender.Therefore, gender is recognized as \"*the self-perceived identity of each individual*\". Indeed, if a person born with \"male genitalia\" perceives herself as a woman, she is by law recognized as a woman in many countries. Not in all, unfortunately, but this is the fight that trans people are going through.If you wanna read more, [read about the gender identity law approved in Argentina in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Identity_Law).

There are probably men who would like you, but you would run away thinking they don't. That fat women can't date is a myth.I suggest surrounding yourself with more body positive content. There's a model I love from my country called Brenda Mato, very overweight. There's Sarah Rae Vargas as well, whose channel I enjoy. Surround yourself with that to start erasing the concept that overweight = ugly or overweight = unlovable.And sometimes, things like doing your hair, dressing up, putting on some make up... they make you feel more beautiful. Which isn't shallow, it's part of self-love. Of course, only as long as you enjoy doing these things. In conclusion, look for women who will inspire you and not bring you down. In most feminist forums you will find a space for learning about body acceptance and stories of girls similar to yours.

Why are you choosing to focus on that as a negative, instead of the hateful people who make open racist comments against you? Like I said in another post, if they had to donate and acknowledge every problem going on in the world, that'd be a damn long Instagram post. I do not mean to offend you by this as I fully support your cause.

A lot of people don't even know anything about us or our culture. Do you know Chile also had massive violent protests going on before covid? Should I condemn an idol for not donating to every cause going on in the world?And the same applies for many other countries in the world. Be civil, spread information, but stop expecting money from people. Donating is a choice and you can still very much support a cause without donating $$$.

{"fsjscxt": {"text": "I think people worry too much about the meaning of stanning, being a true fan, having an ult, etc. It's just a music genre. You listen to ir or watch it cause you enjoy it. Sometimes, you feel propelled to support idols in other ways - but there is no obligation for you to do so. Even if Twitter accuses you of a war crime for not rewatching your favs latest MV until your eyes bleed, you can do whatever you please.I've been a fan of Kpop since 2011. I bought my first album in 2020, no shame in admitting it. I like the music but this is my way of being a fan/stan/whatever you wanna call it. Building a shrine with gum chewed by your favorite idol doesn't make your \"fan\" level go up, so if it stresses you, just enjoy the videos and the music :)", "link_id": "t3_guli6v", "time": 1591035151}}

Como necesita cuidadora full time y el depto solo ten\u00eda dos habitaciones, me vine a vivir a Pcia con mi vieja para dejarle el lugar.Mi abuela est\u00e1 mejor, y lo m\u00e1s c\u00f3mico de todo... la cuidadora es la ex de mi padrastro, con quien comparten hijos. Y es una buena mina, que necesitaba laburar y no ten\u00eda un mango. Con medicaci\u00f3n, paciencia y acompa\u00f1amiento mi abuela mejor\u00f3 un mont\u00f3n y ahora se acuerda de mi nombre. Al principio no se acordaba de m\u00ed, y eso fue muy duro.Pero m\u00e1s alla de todo... estoy bien. Contenta. Medicada y con terapia, pero contenta. El a\u00f1o pasado a comparaci\u00f3n estaba super deprimida. Creo que tanta muerte te hace cambiar un poco la cabeza.Y estoy rezando mucho, aunque no soy religiosa, porque lo \u00fanico que quiero es que mi padrastro y mi mam\u00e1 tengan 20 a\u00f1os m\u00e1s juntos. Que puedan jubilarse y disfrutar de la compa\u00f1\u00eda del otro. Har\u00eda lo que sea, dejar\u00eda 20 a\u00f1os de mi vida si supiera que puedo cumplir ese deseo.Mi mensaje final creo que es, la vida cambia cuando se le canta y como quiere. Disfruten lo que tienen. Amen a los suyos mientras est\u00e1n y si\u00e9ntanse agradecidos. Eso no significa que no pueden estar tristes, pero hay cosas m\u00e1s importantes en la vida.Abrazo general a quienes est\u00e9n pasando un momento de mierda. La pandemia ya va a pasar y se lo contaremos a futuras generaciones.", "link_id": "t3_gqb5o9", "time": 1590420468}}

I wouldn't even be here if I didn't enjoy life simulators! My problem is EA constantly removing or half assing content while upping prices. I think The Sims is probably one of the most expensive games ever, at a whooping USD 800 for the whole game.Using your own point, why don't you just ignore the comments and continue playing? I personally never shat on someone for liking the game. It does have good features. But lest not forget had not we openly complained, we wouldn't have toddlers in the game.  Every game ever made will bave negative reviews, and I think even if you love the game you need to accept it if a large portion of the gaming community doesn't and wishes to state their opinion.

What he did was incredibly horrible and he knew he was harming you.You didn't lose your virginity or the money. You chose to have sex with him at the time, because it's what you desired. Because you didn't know better at the time and because we cannot predict the future, only learn from the past. So forgive yourself first of all, because you got screwed but *you* didn't screw anyone. You had good intentions that were unfortunately put in the hands of someone who didn't.Why did he do this? He's likely a sociopath. He chose you for a reason - you were younger, more gullible. An easier victim. This is a common pattern. My advice for you is get angry - incredibly, incredibly angry at him for what he did to you - until you realize you were wronged and guilt has no place in what you feel. And when you get so angry that you realize the piece of turd you were dealing with, you can grow stronger and flush the toilet for good. Then wish him a good life and let him go.We were all innocent at some point. We were all screwed, so don't feel alone. I can assure you if you ask women in Reddit if they went through this before, most of them will have a story for you. You'll be fine and you'll meet better men.

I've been there too - my dad used to threaten to kill himself whenever I did something he didn't like.The fact that it was his friend who told you, and not your father himself, just adds an extra layer of red flags on top of it. It is likely your dad asked them specifically to tell you so you would feel guilty and contrived on what to do.My advice to you based on my own experiences is the following:\\- You are \\*not\\* responsible for him, for his happiness or depression. Even if he went through with the suicide, which I hope he doesn't, it is not your weight to carry. You don't deserve to be carrying someone around, even less so if this is someone who hurt and abused you.\\- If you truly feel you can't deal with it, trying sending him a written message. By phone or face to face he will try to control you, but by message you can just sincerely tell him how you feel without needing to face him. \\- Who th is this friend? This sounds like a toxic person, involving you in your dad's problems. I think what he did was pretty out of place. Your friend himself, if they are worried, should have called a hotline. Lastly, I would talk to your mom about it. I'm not sure how she feels about him, but she might be able to offer you advice or comfort. Don't carry this on your own, and block that friend.

The main issue comes when there's a \"power play\", which is when one of the people sexting is a minor and the other is not.I doubt your mother is actually gonna go through with it, and I think it's more a strategy to control you. Honestly, and don't take this as me telling you to do it, *you* could put them in a lot more trouble than they could because you are the minor. I would take it as a threat to gain control, which is what a narcissist is afraid of losing.I believe you are living in an abusive household, and your parents are what's called a \"narcissist\". There is a very cool subreddit for you to check, to gain perspective, get support and advice called  [/ on to your specific situation, this is my advice:\\- Perhaps this might sound awful, but lie. The way your parents act is pushing you to lie, so lie to be on their best side. Be smart about how you go around them, take advantage of blocking apps and of the fact that you probably know technology better than them. I believe helicopter parents eventually push their children to hide the truth from them.\\- Find a support network outside of your house, and don't be afraid to reach out. Even if you are stuck, contact your friends often. Let them know you need to call or that you're going through a rough time.\\- Make plans to leave ASAP, maybe for college, maybe to live on your own. Perhaps you will have to wait until you're legal, so these are some of my suggestions as coping mechanisms and strategies.And finally, I wanna remind you this is not your fault. You are stuck in a very awful situation, that will leave scars but that you will be able to push back once you gain more independence.

Jumping straight into penetration is kind of underwhelming and will probably be less enjoyable than building up your way there.A few tips:- If you're not sure you're ready, don't push it. There is no hurry.- Talk to your partner and make sure you're having sex with someone caring. You don't need to be dating them, but it's not pleasant to have sex with someone who is self absorbed and won't listen to you.- Inform yourself about the female anatomy, myths about virginity (the hymen doesn't \"break\") and how to feel comfortable with your own body. I recommend sites such as twoxchromosomes and Adam Ruins Everything. Look up feminist forums for tips and information about your body that will make you feel more confident.- Optionally, if you want to try on your own first, buy a small dildo and try it yourself.

I just want you to know you deserved none of the things that happened to you. You deserve to be loved and cared for, and the things you did are because you weren't loved enough or the right way.It can get better. It can also get worse. The world will not be any more fair or merciless - but you find ways to crawl away from the constant doubt and darkness that surrounds you. I like to think of it as recruiting a small army of things that will help you when the world inevitably hits again - a person you love dearly, a pet, a book, a place in the world, a hobbie you like. And the more of these things you find, the stronger you will feel when it hits again.I think right now you could consider the possibility of joining a therapy center and living there for a while, if this is something you can do. You should consider this, as it's a place away from the abuse of your mom and where you can spend some time just with yourself. Loving yourself. You won't be able to get better if you are surrounded by the people who caused this in the first place. Check out  to get more insight on this.You can get yourself back on your feet. You are AMAZING for having made it this far despite the things you suffered from in your life. But the most important is that you deserve it - you deserve happiness and peace. Perhaps proper rehab, medication and a support group of professionals will help you navigate the path until you can find your way on your own.

Can we not immediately like everything they do just cause they're BTS?You know if BTS is an option they're gonna win. It just bothers me when an idol explodes so much they become unreachable.

It's just as bad or worse in terms of glitches and bugs, and I see little to no effort to improve this.

People encompass you where they like - a little box that says \"judgable\". If someone points it out, they defend it with \"health\".Sure, health is a concern, but it doesn't make it okay to attack someone's self-esteem or personality, simply because you have a prejudice that all fat people are one way or another. I believe in reddit there are way more people who fat shame than those who say being fat can be healthy. So why don't I see more posts talking about that? Fat shaming doesn't make anything better. Someone implying you can accept yourself even if you're fat doesn't mean you have to get your health pitchforks ready.

So if this is a relationship you want to stay in, you should keep that in mind.Talk. Talk instead. Talk a lot and in a calm but serious tone. Throwing a tantrum is not going to make him react like an adult. And it's not a you vs him. Do try to find out and uncover what's holding him back - maybe you would be surprised.", "link_id": "t3_7aw2v1", "time": 1510179645}}

They have tried patching it up but it doesn't go well when they invested so little in the base game. I've always thought if you're gonna make a sequel of a game like this, then it should probably be an improvement of the last game. They took away too many things that made The Sims 3 an amazing game, and I think players of the Sims 3 struggle to enjoy it for that same reason. For me, they have deleted a lot of things that made the sims feel like they were alive, and you can only achieve that through a large pile of mods.The excuse of \"improving performance\" doesn't sell it for me. I've actually run into countless bugs in the sims 4 and had my game crash at least once every time I play. When I use the forward time button, it starts getting laggy.

{"dn3u5vb": {"text": "It bothers me so much. You enter a porn webpage, the first thing you see are women being fucked in very uncomfortable positions,   looking very uncomfortable themselves, in questionable contexts, restrained and denigrated. The title is always \"slut gets gang raped\" \"whore gets fucked hard\" \"teen fucked by old man\" or something worse.Porn is centered around the male orgasm and pleasure, ending right after a man orgasms, while the woman cums loudly and repeatedly (heh) just from penetration. But sex in real life does not end when a man orgasms, nor is it the main and only objective of sex. You are not limited to tits and a pussy - there are other erogenous zones in our bodies that cause just as much if not more pleasure. There is not just one way to get a woman off.A woman can enjoy sex without being a slut or a whore. A woman deserves to feel pleasure in the sexual activities she partakes on, just as a man does, and constantly showing porn in which women are clearly not having a good time while being treated like an object is not sex positive. No part of porn reflects the need to include women's sexuality into the mix. At best, we're shoved to a \"softcore erotica corner\" and told to stop complaining because \"our brains are wired differently\".And finally, a lot of the porn out there is published without consent of the people in it, something most of the viewers seem to not even think about or consider twice. Sometimes, celebrity nudes are leaked without permission, and a whole subreddit gets dedicated to publishing and distributing them despite said celebrity clearly stating their disagreement.So I absolutely agree with you that the current porn industry is awful towards women, that it's not positive nor healthy, and that it needs a lot more change to a point in which we can say it is. I'm not saying porn shouldn't exist - I like good porn. But the current industry is fucked up and that needs to be adressed. And no OP, you're not a paranoid monster for not liking porn - you are entitled to have your own opinion based on your views and experience, and not because a random bunch of redditors say you're wrong does it mean you are.", "link_id": "t3_70gmj6", "time": 1505609737}}

{"dmm69e4": {"text": "1- Argentina does indeed have a strong italian and spanish mix because of immigration during the second world war. I am daughter of an italian myself, and so was my grandfather (if I'm not wrong, he was from somewhere around Lombardia). I would say you can find a mix of Italian and Spanish descendents, as well as many immigrants from other latin american countries (specially Venezuela and Colombia). This has to do with Argentina having free public education. However, as years go by, this mix with Europe is starting to be less and less noticeable. Oh, and there's hardly any dark skinned people here, the reason why I'm not sure of. Argentinean sounds nothing like spanish from Spain - in fact, nowhere in latin america will you find that sort of spanish. The argentinean dialect is fast paced, soft spoken, and uses a lot of slang (specially sexual). For instance I can think of at least 8 ways to say butt. Our way of communicating, as you will notice if you visit our subreddit, uses a lot of irony and sarcasm. We insult each other as a way to show affection. The typical Argentinean is a jokester who likes to screw people over, but has fun in family.2- It is true laws and regulations are lesser - but so is safety and protection by the state. You are likely to be screwed with no consequences, repeatedly, by different companies/people. That is why in Buenos Aires, you trust nobody. On the other hand, we still haven't achieved true freedom from the Catholic church and its influences, and thus things like legal abortions or weed are still a topic  of discussion.It is however extremely common for people to smoke weed, and unless you want to get in trouble, you can easily avoid getting caught. When it comes to drugs, yeah, they're quite common and not too hard to get, but pretty expensive. When it comes to law, to be honest, people do whatever they want and hardly ever face consequences. A small example is traffic - people go over the speed limit, take turns without any signal, and go as far as skipping red lights and all of this in front of patrolling police cars.And about where to live... avoid the city centre. It's cheap, but dangerous and full of tourists and yuppies. I personally prefer the northern part of the capital (Belgrano, Nu\u00f1ez, Saavedra). It requires a bit of a longer trip to get to your workplace, but it's definitely worth the sights and the peace.If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.", "link_id": "t3_6xsq1b", "time": 1504655158}}

Un familiar m\u00edo trabaja en las villas hace varios a\u00f1os, haciendo talleres y dando clases a nenes. Conoce las internas de casi todas las villas,  y Nadia era una de las nenas que acud\u00eda al taller.Lo que me cont\u00f3 por testimonios de conocidos es que es sabido que es una red de trata, que atraen a las nenas a la salida del colegio invit\u00e1ndolas al boliche, y en el boliche las coptan y se las llevan.Se sabe que la cana est\u00e1 metida en la red de trata as\u00ed como un preceptor del colegio, y que esta nena (y muchas otras) no s\u00f3lo estaba bajo amenaza sino que viene de una familia pobre que se fue de viaje a su pa\u00eds de origen en las semanas en que la nena desapareci\u00f3, dejandola sola.A lo que voy es, ojal\u00e1 fuera un cuento. Estos casos no son casualidades ni son aislados. Hay gente que lucha todos los d\u00edas para que se reconozca que es una red de trata y no casos separados. Las organizaciones de izquierda pueden hacer poco contra una red que involucra a la propia cana.Lo que se suele hacer es mucho quilombo, para que la gente se entere. A veces, eso hace que las devuelvan (como menciona uno de los art\u00edculos que mand\u00e9). A veces, eso hace que las maten por generar demasiada atenci\u00f3n, o porque ya no sirven para prostituir. Y nunca dejan de estar bajo amenaza, las nenas y toda su familia.No s\u00e9 si este sub entiende a qu\u00e9 nivel las villas son territorio de nadie.
