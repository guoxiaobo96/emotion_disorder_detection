I developed anorexia. I lost a ton of weight, I went from 190 to 140 in the span of 3 months. Doctors didn't like that, so they sent me to therapy, they put me on medication. SSRIs cause serious weight gain. By the time I was 16, I was 300 lbs. The eating disorder never went away, and every doctor told me if I'd lose weight my PCOS would go away. a few years ago I was diagnosed with hyperinsulinemia, which is different than insulin resistance, but they are related in a way. Insulin resistance is your body making more and more and more insulin because it can't lower your blood sugar correctly, hyperinsulinemia is my body making triple the amount it needs for no reason, as such I suffer from hypoglycemia as well. &amp;#x200B;I was started on Saxenda which is a different type of drug for diabetics, it handles glucagon peptides instead of insulin. I went from 270 to 230, but I lost my insurance and have been off Saxenda since late Feb, and now I am 255 again. &amp;#x200B;How much food would a person need to eat to gain 25 pounds in the span of 6 weeks, and it just keeps going up? WHAT would a person need to eat to gain that much weight that fast?I drink sodas very, very rarely. I drink tea, coffee, water. I have been eating more sweets the last couple weeks because I'm stressed and I bake a lot. but I would need to eat like an entire cake a week. maybe even more than that. there is no way a person could just gain that much weight that fast without TRYING.but people don't believe me.", "link_id": "t3_fxwysv", "time": 1586456941}}

I have so many triggers around it and I've been in therapy pretty much since I was 7.The PTSD though comes from a situation similar to yours... My fiance was killed in 2013 and it changed me. I don't really remember what I was like before then, but it stacked even more triggers on top of what I had. I'm still in therapy and on medication.But..... It's gotten a little easier.

So I went back a day later, apparently a piece of the filling dried to my damn gum and it was cut open. They fixed it, gave me antibiotics and sent me on my way.&amp;#x200B;they told me, \"in about 6 weeks, all the pain and discomfort should be gone\"(it's 2020, pain and discomfort is NOT gone)So the entire time after that, it was painful to floss around those 3 teeth. I just dealt with it, up until about 6 months ago. I finally went to a private practice.all 3 of the fillings had serious overhand, which caused the discomfort when flossing.all 3 of the fillings has DECAY underneath the cavities.To be fixed, all 3 fillings have to be completely removed and redone. They fixed the worst one, but it still hurts all the time and the dentist told me that it's so close to the nerve, that it may not heal and I may have to have a root canal later.the other 2 have not been fixed yet because I don't have insurance anymore, and while it won't be $1600 I still don't have the money laying around.thankfully they did tell me it was amazing how good shape my teeth were in, since technically I hadn't had a cleaning since 2010 (Aspen did not do a cleaning)Will never go to Aspen or any other corporate dental office.

I was 18.this other time, when I was actually an employee at a walmart, I was stocking shelves. an old hispanic man came up to me and cornered me. He started talking about how beautiful I was, again talking about my breasts. It scared me and I couldn't escape because I was literally in a corner at the dairy/meat section. I dropped what I was doing and side stepped him, hurried off just anywhere until I could find another employee. I told the employee what was going on, an older man I worked with, and he walked back to the section with me but the old man was gone. I was 21another time I was in walmart in Alabama, I was buying just a few things. but a guy was standing behind me and it seemed like he watched me put my pin code in for my debit. As soon as I walked away, he started following me. My hair stood up on my neck, and I just walked up to a random construction worker that just happened to be near the exit door, and started talking to him about random shit, confused the hell out of him and I saw out of the corner of my eye the guy following me went out the door.

{"fcrzu9s": {"text": "It started 3 weeks ago. The Dr snapped on me and told me I needed to \"get it through my skull or stamp it on my forehead about how we do things and go read the policy manual because it's not my job to teach you yours\" and it made me cry. I left work 5 minutes early. I called my supervisor and told her I left work 5 minutes early and this is why.I read the policy manual. I found certain policies about scheduling and check in. I emailed my supervisor my questions and she confirmed that I was doing everything the way I was supposed to and not to worry about it. Fast forward last week. My supervisors supervisor comes in with the HR supervisor. I'd never even met these 2 people yet. They have a discussion with the doctor. I don't know what is said. After whatever they spoke about they came and asked me about my \"emotional outburst\" referring to when I left work and called my supervisor crying. I tell them the truth I have bipolar disorder and the doctor made me upset. They ask how everything is going and I say it's fine (it is not fine)....And then they leave.Well now the bullying is incessant. The doctor tells any other staff member in the office how she wants to get rid of me. She is sick of me, she's not going to put up with me. \"What a little tattle tell, she must think this is middle school, wah wah wah!!!!\" She says these things in the nurse triage room so that I can hear them. She makes a point to do this throughout the day. Yesterday we got into it about my lunch time. My direct supervisor told me to go at 12. The doctor wants me to go at 11. My supervisor came in the building and asked me why I was not at lunch at the specified time. I told her the truth, Dr. Does not want me to leave the desk unattended.My supervisors supervisor then emails us telling us that we are all to go at 12 and to lock the office door.This starts another thing. She comes down the hall and says \"whenever she getst it through her head she's supposed to go at 11...\" And I spoke up. I said no, I was told to go at 12. And she says \"whatever do what you want, I'm sick of this bullshit, you don't run this place\" and that's what set off my descent into this situation I'm in now. I have cried and cried and cried. I thought about taking myself back to the hospital again. Nobody understands these feelings if they don't have them. And everyone telling me to suck it up and get over it, I don't deserve to work in these conditions. I haven't done anything wrong. I don't even know what I did. My supervisor, her supervisor, and the HR guy all told me to keep doing what I'm doing because I'm doing it right. They point blank told me to not confront the doctor, it isn't my battle that I'm responsible for. But I can't keep going through this. It isn't fair to me and it's really fucking me up.I don't know what to do except quit but I can't just quit, I have to pay my bills somehow. It took me a long time to find this job.

This guy came in and he's looking at them and he's like, I think my wife would like one of these because she loves wine. But I can't decide on what size. So I'm like well how often does she drink, does she always have a huge selection to choose from, does she only have a few bottles etc. So finally he decides on the mid size one. It's not super heavy but we need a hand truck to move it up front so I go get one and walk up there with him with it. We get to the front and she sees it and she says, \"who is that for, you better not be getting that ugly thing for me\" and the look on his face I'll never forget. It hurt him because he thought he was doing something great, he really thought she would enjoy it.Never met these people and never saw them again so I have no idea what their relationship was like.My point of this is, I don't know you or him and I don't know what your relationship is like. But what if it was just something he saw that he really thought you would like and the girl in appliances helped pick him out?I hope your leg heals fast because I've been there before, was in a cast for 6 months after breaking my leg.

I think not being able to drink should be the least of your worries but every person is different, alcohol does nothing to me in regards to bipolar. It can interact badly with some medications. Bipolar is diagnosed by the amount, severity and length of mood cycles. I have bp2. Again it's different for everyone. I haven't found a trigger for my hypomania. But there are many triggers for my irrational anger and depression. My lamictal prevents hypomania which makes me a little sad because it's like I'm on speed and can accomplish everything. Like 6 weeks of college coursework in 24 hours (because I don't need to sleep) but with mania comes a bad crash. This is not to say I don't still have some episodes.I experience more lows because I have so many triggers. I'm on Wellbutrin for the depression, this combination has been a life saver for me, literally and figuratively. I've suffered with these mood swings for 15 years and Dr just kept giving me ssri drugs which should not be used to treat bipolar depression. I think you should focus on learning what your triggers are. I have shitty coping skills so I won't indulge but once you find the triggers it is easier to develop healthy coping. CBT is a good therapy, haven't done it in several years because I don't have insurance. Even talk therapy is helpful.Explore medications, explore therapies.

So because of this combination, I didn't date and I stayed celibate for 4 years.I didn't date/have sex because of the HSV2 but also because I was grieving. When I was first diagnosed I cried and felt dirty and ashamed. \"great I've lost the man I was going to marry AND now I have an std that I can't get rid of, my love life is over\"but I just kind of set it aside. I guess I started trying to date again about 2016, 3 years after his death. I didn't put a lot of effort into it. Disclosed a few times, was rejected each time. one rejection was terrible, he was disgusted and told me \"I have a cut on my lip and you didn't tell me!!!!!!!!\" dude first of all that ain't how this works. second of all, fuck uSo I just kept doing me. I went to school, worked 2 jobs, I didn't need no man. Didn't really have desire for sex...

While an inpatient, they were treating me for a diagnosed UTI and what we thought was a yeast infection(both are unrelated to hospital visit). In the days after the hospital, I started developing itchy and painful bumps everywhere down there. Like the chickenpox. I went to regular dr, she did some blood work. She told me while we waited for bloodwork to come back to was going to give me something to help with the symptoms (cannot remember what) .. 3 days later she called and said to come in to discuss, and told me I had HSV2. She rx me some acyclovir. For about 10 days I had \"chickenpox of the vagina\" .... it itched. Itchy. itchy itchy itchy... so itchy. And then of course I was trying not to scratch them but some \"burst\" and became the lesions, which then burned and stung. It was terrible.And then, it just went away. they were all gone.I've had less than 10 outbreaks since 2013. None have been bad, most have lasted 7-10 days.

The failed accesses from both apple and bestbuy are minutes apart. One at 00:05 and then 00:15 est. So that's when I started looking at accounts that legit visited bestbuy or apple and were calling in for just a regular call. The access is not failed and it gives tons of info.

If we took all the money we spent on dinner dates for the year, I'm sure we would have about $1000. $1000 is not going to be enough for a down payment on a house. $1000 is not even enough for emergency savings. So we choose to spend $1000 a year for some element of happiness.  Yet SOMEBODY, SOMEWHERE, is going to tell me, \"well have you thought about spending less?\"  I work 60 hours a week. If I want to go to the local mexican restaurant and get fucking smashed every Friday, I worked to fucking be able to do that. I deserve to SPEND MY HARD EARNED MONEY on one thing that makes me happy. And the advice is, stop having fun, stop doing things that make you happy, put that money into a savings account and in 10 years you will have a down payment for.....like, maybe a car or something.", "link_id": "t3_czpaj2", "time": 1567662122}}

{"etupax1": {"text": "Here's c/p of my response earlier---    Just having your phone number isn't going to let them know who you bank with. I think that information is gathered first. because like I stated, sometimes phone numbers that get stolen aren't even the phone numbers tied to a bank account. I've seen ipad numbers stolen, and (like mentioned in my post) the phone number of an 8 year old. The person doing the theft has the last 4 of the SSN, the pin, the address, and a name on the account. It might not even be the name of the account owner.    I'll give an example, with names changed for obvious reasons.    Jenny calls in because her number is gone. On her account she has 2 authorized users, her husband Anthony and her daughter Cassandra. However her account has 6 total phone numbers, 2 of which belonging to her other 2 children. The number that was stolen belonged to Melissa.    Viewing notes on the account, the timeline went like this:    Someone calls in and tries to impersonate one of her daughters, Melissa. Melissa is not on the account. The representative marks the account that \"Melissa\" tries to call in to get the account information, but info is not given. A short time later there is another remark that \"Anthony\" tried to call in, but the caller could not correctly identify himself. The third time is when \"Cassandra\" calls in. \"Cassandra\" correctly identifies herself, and the rep remarks that the account information was given.    Looking at timestamps, within 10 minutes of \"Cassandra\" calling in, one of the phone numbers is gone.    That phone number belonged to Melissa, who was NOT listed on the account. Melissa then had her bank and her credit card company contact her citing fraudulent activity. Jenny then calls us after this fact, wanting to know why Melissa's phone isn't working.    How did the callers know that Melissa's phone number belonged to this account? They put Anthony's first and last name, the last 4 of his SSN, and address on the port request. Melissa lived in a completely different state. Her SSN and name was nowhere on this account.--------Porting is the process of moving your number between carriers. If you are with Tmobile and want to go to Cricket, or if you're at Metro and want to go to Sprint, but you want to keep your phone number, you would use the LNP department of the carrier you're going to (local number portability). All companies under the Tracfone umbrella (total wireless, straight talk, simple mobile, page plus, and 4 or 5 others) are resellers of all the big 4. What this means is, the number is in the number inventory of the big carrier, and since Tracfone resells for them, it takes mere seconds for the number to move. If your number belongs to Verizon, and you legit want to go to straight talk, the port takes 10 minutes. (the exception to this is ATT, it takes 24 hours to move from Verizon to ATT's straight talk and vice versa) This is why the phishers will move your number from one of the big 4 to tracfone.", "link_id": "t3_cd70lo", "time": 1563217245}}

If I want to port my number I will go show my ID at the store\" If you have a prepaid service like Metro, Simple Mobile, Consumer Cell, etc .... I am not aware that they offer port protection.Port protection/port freeze is free, it affects nothing on your account except to prevent numbers from leaving.

There isn't a single day I don't have at least one person call in about their number being stolen. Do I know how they're utilizing the phone numbers to get into the banks? No. But they are. It is not a coincidence that everyone that calls in regarding their stolen phone number, they had bank accounts, emails, and credit cards accessed in some way. One customer had a new line of credit opened at Macy's. One customer had an old credit card account, and magically a new credit card was being mailed to some address he'd never heard of, in a completely different part of the country.They specifically steal the numbers to access personal info. I can see the address on the port requests. They don't always match the account. Customer from MN calls in and the port request has a Tampa, FL address? And actually, you can't really just take a sim from one phone and put it into another. The sim isn't linked to that device ID. It won't activate properly. You might be able to make outbound calls with it at best, but you won't be able to use the phone fully. Incoming stuff probably won't come through.", "link_id": "t3_cd70lo", "time": 1563170292}}

Nobody will be coming off calls to help the new people until our stats improve.\" guess how many of those new people quit within the first week? umm... all but 8 of them.Started with 25, and by the end of the first week, 8 are left.And they're expected to just get it. The training shows us how to use the software, but it does not tell us how to actually solve the problems. We are told to \"use our resources\" which is the company's version of google. Yes, there's a ton of info in there. But you cannot find the answer to the problem. There is no, \"How to solve x\" ... you just have to figure it out.And they're new, they don't know how to do that. And if we try to help them, we are told to stop.So our stats as a whole is pretty bad, we are incredibly understaffed. We should have 60 people in the department and we have about 35-40 and cannot meet goal. Maybe if training wasn't so terrible, fewer people would quit.It is very low paying, so being told to just figure it out? OK I'll just be figuring my ass out the door and not coming back, see ya!Tonight the project coach jumped over a new girl, she's only been here 2 weeks.

{"eqh29p9": {"text": "so, I had to have 2 surgeries and a transpalatal bar. The transpalatal bar is a piece of metal that is placed for spacing while the permanent teeth grow in. My problem was I had a tooth coming out of the roof of my mouth, and the baby tooth was still in place. Definitely hereditary, my brother had the exact same thing on the exact tooth, and the exact tooth for my mom except she still has her baby tooth and the permanent one never came in.&amp;#x200B;The bar cut open my tongue. I still have a scar on my tongue, and that's from ... jees. 19 years ago. I got it in 2000. (holycrap) and again my brother.. SAME thing. granted his was 14ish years ago.&amp;#x200B;Anyways, yes when you first get them they are clunky, uncomfortable, they hurt. &amp;#x200B;You're gonna end up cutting your lips and tongue on them. There is a scientific term that I can't remember the name of, but basically your brain hasn't registered that there's extra stuff in your mouth. Normally, your brain knows exactly how much space you have between cheeks and tongue, so that's why you rarely actually bite yourself while chewing/talking. It knows when to subconsciously move or flex the muscle to get it out of the way. Now when you do bite your tongue or cheek, it swells up, and then you end up biting it over and over until your brain \"catches up\" with the fact you have some swollen tissue.  Same thing applies to braces. Your brain needs time to adjust and to realize it needs to adjust for the extra stuff in your mouth. Gonna take some time, possibly days or weeks, depending.You'll have to be more conscious and careful with your mouth activities until your brain figures it out. &amp;#x200B;I had mine on for 6 years. but that was because of the problems I had with my surgeries and my tooth growing in the wrong place. I only had the bar between the first and second surgery(which included getting rid of my wisdom teeth), after that it was removed. I hope you don't have to have that, it was the worst part of the entire experience, especially because I still have that scar.", "link_id": "t3_bye7fl", "time": 1560047309}}

I can think of 7 women off the top of my head that I personally know that have had an abortion, women I have worked with, women I am related to, women I went to high school with. I was unaffected. YOU were unaffected. Every person in existence was unaffected, except for her. It was a difficult decision, but she did it anyway so she could continue her life. And if I listed their names, you wouldn't know them. You wouldn't even know what you were doing the day she had it done. Your life puttered along, so did hers. You lost absolutely no sleep over any of those women having an abortion. That's 7 \"potential babies\" that don't exist, and the world didn't stop, and won't stop, because of it. Every day a woman miscarries an embryo before she even knows she's pregnant. Do you feel more for the apparently nonviable embryo than you do for the woman? Maybe some of them even wanted a baby, some were planned, some were not. Some probably feel relief when they miscarry. Others, of course, do not. But you are still unaffected. Because you don't know them, and they are not you. If you don't want to have an abortion, then don't get one. But not every woman wants or can have a baby.

{"enjytru": {"text": "I think that people should really educate on why women seek abortions in the first place. I have never met someone who had an abortion just because they wanted to. It isnt an easy decision, that you wake up and say \"ok today is the day let's go abort.\" And anyone who does feel this way has some serious mental situations going on. Women like me are not in position to care for an offspring. I don't want kids, I dont plan on having any, and me and my hubs has discussed getting a vasectomy. But until that time comes, the fact is that all precautions will sometimes still fail. We can do everything right and it still might happen. I do not want to have a baby and if it does happen, I am not carrying it to term. We are doing everything right to prevent it from happening, but it is not fair that I'm told if I get pregnant, now I have to live with the consequences. A baby should not be a consequence. A baby should be wanted, loved and cared for. A consequence is a negative result of an action. Babies shouldnt be negative. So that is a huge reason why we pro choice women feel our bodies are being regulated. Pharmacists dont have to fill our BC if their religion says so. Only women are part of the bill in GA that we can be tried for murder, not men. Women who want a tubal litigation cannot always get one because doctors don't want to perform them but my husband could make an appt today and have a vasectomy done next week if he wanted to. These are specifically the regulation parts that many of us are yelling about. Someone else shouldnt get to decide if I cant have bc because their religion says it's wrong. My uterus belongs to me, not to a 60 yr old male catholic pharmacist that moonlights as a priest.I am not personally trying to tell you to stop being pro life, even though I disagree with it being murder.

I dated, but dates never went anywhere after the disclosure, so I just never had sex with anyone. I dated a guy for a few months in 2017 and he was the first sexual partner I had. I had disclosed to him really early on and he was ok with it. Well he was also sleeping with his coworker at the same time.So here's kind of how that went... Broke up with O, was very depressed because he was the first guy I'd been with since 2013, so it was understandable I'd be pretty upset. So I made sure to find the boyfriend of the girl O was sleeping with and I told him, \"You don't know me but our SOs are sleeping together, I have HSV2, I recommend NOT sleeping with her when he's done.\"   So fast forward a month I guess. It was the week after my 29th birthday and I had a date to go see the new kingsman movie. Well he stood me up.So I was browsing plenty of fish and someone had viewed my profile, but he didnt message me. I messaged him because we had a lot of things in common. He wasn't really my type physically so I didn't expect it to go anywhere at all. After a couple days of texting back and forth I asked him out to go see the kingsman movie. He was super weird and I didnt think we'd see each other after that, honestly.Well my coworker said to give him another chance. So I guess a couple weeks later, I agreed to go out with him again. This date he was a lot more relaxed and more himself, and he kissed me on this date :-)Fast forward I guess a month. We'd gone out several times. Finally, I told him that I was expecting test results back from my DR because my ex was sleeping with his coworker. Which he knew about my ex, so it wasn't a lie because I did go get tested for everything again.So.. I get my results. And I did have an infection they gave me antibiotics for. Vaginosis or something. Anyways, that was when I said, \"umm.. I also have hsv2.\"He asked me about it, I told him everything I knew about it. he decided to research it. When he came back later and told me he still wanted to go out with me, I was like OH GREAT CAUSE I KIND OF LIED ABOUT THE HSV2 A LITTLE..

He is trying to treat bipolar2 first, and if my symptoms don't improve, he will consider treating ADD symptoms.  As a child, I struggled. Something was wrong with me, but nobody seemed to understand, because I couldn't explain it. I can't speak for every child. Everyone's symptoms are different. But I do believe that general hyperactivity in a child is normal. Lots of people will laugh and joke, \"oh I get so distracted, I'm so ADD\" but... that isn't entirely how it works.  There are 20 thoughts happening in your brain at any given moment, and you can't complete any of the thoughts. They run together. My notes looked just like that person's do. Notes all over the place, only half finished, moving on to a doodle because I'm bored of writing a sentence, then going back to a note, then coming to do another doodle. Then pick up my phone because the note and/or the doodle reminded me of something I was thinking about earlier.  But the part that a lot of ppl don't really seem to get, is the brain zaps and memory loss. Imagine you are speaking a sentence, and your brain blanks out, and you forgot what you were saying, and you move on to a next sentence, never finishing the first or even remembering you were doing the first sentence.  My best real world example that I like to give people, is when I was a cashier I would get so overwhelmed I would forget how to count change. I would also forget if I was giving or taking money.  I'm the cashier, I've rung up your purchase, you're handing me money to pay for it. My brain zaps, and I forget.... am I taking it? or am I giving it? And then I'm trying to physically pry the memory out of my head and I can't. I can't bring the memory back. It's gone. I don't remember what the fuck I was literally doing .5 seconds ago and you are standing there looking at me like, \"umm.......\" and then the anxiety sets in and I start to panic. Because I don't remember what I was doing. The thought and the memory is gone. I have about 3 seconds to figure out context clues to remember what I was doing.  This is the part where my psychiatrist hasn't differentiated between a separate ADD diagnosis, or is it a symptom of my bipolar2. Because the symptoms overlap and brain zaps go with pretty much every single mental illness.&amp;#x200B;Not a doctor, just telling you my experience.

{"em04gb1": {"text": "You will be okay. I had lots of rejections also. I was diagnosed in 2013. I tried many different ways to disclose. but the truth is, it really doesn't matter when/how, because if you're rejected, they just werent the person for you.I tried some on the first date, some on the 2nd or 3rd. In person, over text, over facebook. Eventually put it in my online dating profile bio(Still got men sending me messages that didnt read the bio lol)Worst one I guess was this guy that I told multiple times, not having sex. I guess our 2nd date he invited me over for a movie. Stupid me thought we were actually gonna watch a movie lol. So he ended up taking my clothes off and I said, I am NOT having sex!!! And he starts trying to guilt trip me and shit. I tell him, I have herpes! I wanted to wait but you're making me tell you now!And you know what that asshole said? That 35 yr old grown ass man?? \"Ew! I have a cut on my lip!\"you dumbass.I cried, it was so embarrassing. I left and seethed angrily for days.that was also the point where, even tho I was lonely, I decided to just stop looking.Few months after that I met someone, disclosed immediately, we still kept talking. We did end up having sex and dated for about 2 months. Then I learned he was also doing one of his coworkers, who had a boyfriend. I reached out to the boyfriend of the girl and told him, \"My boyfriend is fucking your girl. I have herpes. Please don't have sex with her, because she might have gotten it from (my boyfriend)\" he was incredibly grateful... and we've been facebook friends since.. LOLANYWAY fast forward beyond that nightmare, I finally met my boyfriend. I really, really, really liked this guy. But you know what? It didn't matter how much I liked him, because the disclosure was going to go either good or bad. So, our 4th date, I told him. but here's kind of the thing, I lied and didn't. He knew 100% about my ex that was cheating on me with his coworker, and I told my now-boyfriend, \"He cheated on me a lot. I'm waiting on test results from the DR about anything I might have.\" That was 100% true also, because I didn't know if he could have given me anything.So, around date #4, I texted him and said, \"I didn't want to tell you until after you had gone home. I am so embarrassed. but I tested positive for HSV2(sort of true) and vaginosis(true).\" he asked me about both. At this point I knew everything there was to know about herpes so I told him everything I knew about it. What it's like, the meds the dr prescribed, how often it (can) happen. I also told him about vaginosis, which is just a mild infection that they rx an antibiotic for.And.. he said he wanted to research them both. Fast forward a few days later and he told me, \"I still want to go out with you and see where this goes. But I don't want to have sex right now.\" that is totally fine!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D (spoiler: we totally fucked the next time we saw each other)That was 2 years ago. We have been together ever since. He is still negative, and I haven't had a bump in over a year. actually scratch that, one popped up last week but it's healed. I haven't had an outbreak in over a year. (lesions, pus, pain, itching)And if you're wondering, YES I told him the truth afterward that I kind of lied about the HSV2 part, and then that's when I told him how I got it, etc.", "link_id": "t3_bieq8m", "time": 1556479910}}

{"elzw3sb": {"text": "As a female that is obese, I understand that you cannot just make yourself be attracted to someone if you aren't attracted to them.As a female with terrible coping mechs due to mental illness, I will tell you that telling her to stop is not the right way. A coping mechanism develops out of habit and desire to make something negative go away. Food is a huge coping mechanism for a lot of people. Therapy is required to stop these coping mechs. Shaming her is not therapy, ultimatums is not therapy, and even the \"inviting for a walk\" is not therapy. There is something deep and underlying that a professional needs to assess. In her case, food is giving her endorphins, the feel good hormones.Although I am obese, food was not my coping mechanism. Mine is self mutilation(body focused repetitive behavior BFRB) Hurting myself brings the endorphins, and the endorphins bring happiness. But the difference between how she and I cope all point to the same desirable end result: more happiness and less hurting.You describe that she eats candy during your outings and she gets upset when you tell her to stop doing it. That is 100% a habitual coping mech, you are trying to change her habit, and mentally(not necessarily consciously) she knows without this habit she is going to be hurting.I recommend that instead of trying to change her habits yourself, or give her ultimatums, suggest therapy or couples counseling.If she is not responsive to therapy or counseling, then it is beyond you. A person cannot change if they do not want to. I have been to many years of CBT and have had to develop many different other coping mechs to make myself stop hurting myself. It's not completely gone. Nipping a newly formed habit in the bud is much easier than nipping 15 years of habit.", "link_id": "t3_bi93xn", "time": 1556474062}}

My family would always ask me, \"why are you so mean? where did my sweet little girl go?\" I remember that day we were in the car and I was throwing a tantrum and my grandma said that to me. I started directing my behaviors to myself in the form of self mutilation. I developed trichotillomania and dermatillomania and that has persisted my entire life. I'm 30 and have CPTSD(childhood), PTSD(5 years ago an accident left my fiance dead), OCD, bipolar2, anxiety, and ADD.  I wished, I begged, to not have to go to school. I would have been so much happier. I wasn't allowed to quit school either as a teenager. My life was fucking hell. I tried suicide at the age of 11, I became anorexic. I developed OCD and started showing symptoms of bipolar2. Still not sure if the ADD is genetic (my dad and sister have it) or if it is symptoms/side effects of the bipolar2. I fucking hated my life. I still do, but I have been through a shit ton of therapy. No therapies ever really worked for me in changing my behaviors, I had to develop my own coping skills.

I developed a pattern: any time I had to participate in group projects, or I had to do a presentation and received ANY sort of criticism, I dropped the class (after losing my mind either publicly or  alone) I never knew why I was doing this, but it was a pattern of impulsive behavior. And I was told over and over to *just grow up*. You/they/them don't understand what it is like to be trapped inside of your mind.What causes me to fall apart is also a pattern: Criticism, whether real or perceived, being told how to do something. Being told \"You HAVE to do it this way\" and then I perceive \"or you will be fired\" no, you can't fire me, because I quit.Having to work with a group of people that are so much different from me, it bothers me.

{"e5oilrv": {"text": "so basically, the root of all the issues is I have bipolar depression, which if you don't know what that is, it's a combination of manic highs(I can conquer anything and you can't stop me) and depressive lows(Why do I bother, I should just kill myself)&amp;#x200B;So during my manic highs, I am on top of the world and I get shit done. Anything/everything that needs to be done, it gets done. The problem however, is I also have symptoms of ADD. (currently the dr doesn't want to officially diagnose me and treat me as if I have it, because it is possible the symptoms are from the bipolar and will go away when we figure out the meds I need) This means that I would start 10 projects during a high, and leave them all over the place. My boyfriend was 100% aware of this fact, and pretty much would pick up after me. This would start arguments with them, \"Our son is not your maid!!!! You're an adult, clean up after yourself!!! We are not your parents!!!\"  During my lows, obviously I slept for 16 hours a day, or stayed reclusive in our bedroom. \" Get out of bed, go outside, stop laying around, take a shower, do something!\"&amp;#x200B;I moved from north Alabama to south Alabama to be with him. I left everything behind, my pets, friends, family and a job I enjoyed. I had to take a shitty job. I couldn't be without a job. So I started working for a retail store. I hated it. it really aggravated my depressive symptoms. I wanted to kill myself every day. and his parents told me. \"We had to work jobs we didn't like, it's part of life. Stop complaining, be grateful. If you hurt yourself you're just a coward.\" Finally I found a new job (my current one.) However, I bailed during my 2 week notice. I worked 10 of the 14 days. I just couldn't take it anymore. His parents lost their minds. It was the worst fight we had. I really thought that was the day I was going to kill myself or I was going to have to check into the ER to keep myself from doing it. it was terrible terrible terrible. \"We're not raising you! our son is not supporting you! you need to grow up and be an adult! you need to stop blaming your problems on everyone else! you are in this situation because you put yourself there!\"&amp;#x200B;Even though I do like my new job, we were still living at his parents. And I was still having depression. On my off days, all I did was sleep, and his parents had issues with that for not contributing. I finally told him, this is it. Either we go together or we don't, I don't give a shit if you come with me, but I'm getting the fuck out of here. So I started looking for a place to stay. I have no problem living in HUD or section 8, so I started there first.&amp;#x200B;I think that was the moment it dawned on him, that I was so unhappy and I absolutely was going to leave him if he didn't do something. So.... he finally made the commitment to jump ship with me. The apartment is a bit out of our budget, we were trying to stay under 650, but we're paying 700 for this one. We had to tighten our budget, but the best news of all of this is I get to have my cat.

Never did any std tests though! Didnt even think about it. They gave me a script of antibiotics because my body was obviously fighting SOMEthing.after a week of those strange symptoms, life was back to normal. Fast forward to oct 2013, I was in a very bad accident. While in the hospital, I asked them to test me for a UTI because I was having a lot of burning while peeing and I had some discharge. I was positive for a UTI. Took a round of antibiotics, but my other symptoms just didn't go away. After I was released from the hospital I went to my primary doctor and asked for a yeast infection test. Well she tested for that plus all STDs. and I was positive for HSV2. She told me that it was either the stress of the accident or a coincidence that I had that initial outbreak. It was terrible. my whole vulva was sore. my ass was sore. it itched. everywhere itched. I wanted to scrub my pussy with sand paper.And then.... I guess about 12 days of terrible itching and sore, it went away.Since then I've had maybe 10 outbreaks in 5 years. on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the initial outbreak, all the rest were like 1s or 2s.", "link_id": "t3_8leysa", "time": 1527038150}}

As she becomes more aroused, the body naturally expands everything expecting penetration because, well, we are animals and the body anticipates the breeding..... Anyway, I don't know what it feels like from the man's point of view, but you can definitely feel it when you're bumping into it, as can the female. Personally I love the feeling, and it feels the best to me when we are first getting started... the longer we go, the more wet, sloppy, and hot it gets in there and I don't feel as much.", "link_id": "t3_7ip9o9", "time": 1513017274}}

I had to gently ask him to be a little less \"open mouthed\" during kissing (I didn't want to bruise his ego!!) Little nibbles on the lips, closed mouth pecks, teasing kisses (kiss around the mouth like the corner or nose but never on the mouth)me, I like it rough, so when he man handles me and grabs my throat and hair it really gets me wet. but your girl might not like that, and he was afraid of hurting me when we first started having sex and I had to convince him I wanted it even rougher. he still isn't as rough as I want it BUT we have roommates and it makes him nervous we'll be too loud. :-P", "link_id": "t3_7iszvs", "time": 1513016851}}
