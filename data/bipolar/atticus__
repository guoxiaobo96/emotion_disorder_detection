{"elbc588": {"text": "This ended being way longer than expected and probably rambles a bit, but here ya go:For me therapy helps by giving me a space to be able to unload all of the thoughts that build up in my head. Saying things out loud and getting constructive feedback and guidance helps untangle things and keep me in a good headspace. My therapist also gives me methods for dealing with symptoms, like controlling anxiety and grounding techniques to bring me back into my body when I get a bit dissociated. For anhedonia specifically, having the other symptoms under control (using techniques from therapy) usually helps it lift. I learned through therapy that the best way to want to do something is to force yourself to start it. It\u2019s a case of \u201cfake it \u2018til you make it.\u201d When I see my therapist she\u2019ll ask what I\u2019ve been doing with my free time and push me to try a little harder to do things if I\u2019ve been slacking. It\u2019s a little bit of accountability that helps keep me on track. For meds I take a few. Lamictal keeps my mood stable. Wellbutrin is an antidepressant. The two keep me in a (usually) good spot mood wise. It still goes up and down (I\u2019m bipolar), but instead of so depressed I\u2019m in bed for a week and so up I think I\u2019ve achieved enlightenment, I stay between manageable depression and good. I also take Latuda, an antipsychotic, which was added in specifically to help with anhedonia. It has antidepressant effects and so far it\u2019s the only med I\u2019ve found that helps. I think what it specifically did was help give me a little more motivation to force myself to \u201cfake it \u2018til I make it.\u201dAll in all I find meds help take the edge off of a lot of different things so I can catch my breath and put effort into doing things like therapy and self care.

Honestly, our stories sound pretty interchangeable.I try to educate myself on my illnesses and such. Alcohol depresses, as I\u2019m sure you know, so it just makes things worse and worse. In the long term that is research suggesting alcohol changes the brain in ways that can make depression start in people without it, and worse in those who already have it. This is the vicious cycle of depression and alcohol we both know so well.There are also studies suggesting that the longer bipolar disorder, and I believe major depression, go untreated, the worse and worse the symptoms become.So combine the two and it\u2019s a recipe for disaster. It all blew up in my face and I hit bottom almost a year ago.  Before then I was drinking a large bottle of wine a night, smoking at least one bowl, abusing adderall, and doing party drugs fairly regularly. (I also don\u2019t get all the effects of psychedelics at the dosages most people do, which is interesting.) I NEVER thought I\u2019d feel like a normal human again. I honestly didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it to 30, my whole life had become a reckless game of \u201cIf I OD on something and die, then great.\u201dI did a lot of therapy in that time. And tried meds here and there. Things seemed to help, but never in the long term. Since a year ago I finally did a 180. I\u2019m almost 11 months sober. Smoke weed on the weekend once a month or less. Psychedelics rarely, but with respect and in a spiritual way. I found an amazing psychiatrist, got back into therapy. I work out. I sleep regularly. I\u2019m trying to eat better. I never miss my meds. It\u2019s A LOT of work just to feel \u201cnormal\u201d but it is so worth it. Sometimes I fall into the what-if game still. If I never took that first sip would my illness have gotten so bad? If I got help sooner what could I have achieved in my life? What would I feel like now if I didn\u2019t fry my brain for a decade? But, this is where we are now. We have to look ahead and make the best out of our future and work with what we have. Human bodies are incredibly resilient. And so is our spirit. If I made it out, you can too. Side note, it seems odd your doc would switch meds so much and fast.

Every once in a while I would drop a ton of weight and \u201cget my shit together\u201d which would inevitably end in a huge blowout and my life would fall back apart and I\u2019d end up in a huge depression. Finally hit rock bottom in January. Lost a great job. Had basically no friends left. This is when I got serious about finding a good psychiatrist and getting serious about stopping my self medicating. Turns out I\u2019m bipolar 2 which explains why I could get my shit together now and then, drop 50 pounds in 2 months, but couldn\u2019t maintain that for the long term. It was when I was hypo. Then I\u2019d crash into depression.Year ago me\u2019s typical day: Wake up and pop an adderall because I was so hung over and tired from drinking until 2 am. Have a cigarette. Get ready in 5 min (usually only showered twice a week). Stop and get a large coffee with 2 shots of espresso and a breakfast sandwich to eat before the addy kicked in. Chain smoke on my way in. Survive until non. Chain smoke for my lunch hour. Pop another addy to get me through the second half of the day. (It wasn\u2019t uncommon for me to get to work and pass out in the bathroom) Get out. Get home and pour a large glass of wine. Start binging Netflix for the night. After a couple hours smoke a full bowl so I would get hungry and be able to eat. And maybe be able to sleep. End up getting ravenously hungry from not eating all day and getting the munchies. Eat a whole frozen pizza or absurd amounts of takeout. Around midnight pour the last of the large bottle of wine, pack one last bowl and head to bed. Finish those off and pass out around 2. Rinse and repeat. I was spending $1800 - $2000 a month on wine, weed, adderall, and cigarettes. On weeks where I\u2019d go  to the bar a couple times that another $200 or so. Add in all the fast food and it\u2019s creeping towards $3000. Me now: Wake up at 6:30. Make coffee. Meditate. Shower. Have a cup of coffee and oatmeal. Take coffee to go. Listen to interesting podcasts on the way to work. Get to work and put in a solid, productive 8 hours. Get out. Go home and actually *do stuff*. Read, play video games, screw around with my raspberry pi, whatever. Eat a decent dinner, rarely take out. In bed by 10. I\u2019m 100% sober and quit smoking. Stable on Lamictal, Wellbutrin, and Latuda. I feel like a person again. I can\u2019t believe I actually got here, I was starting to give up.

Same deal, plus a bunch of tragedies happened really close together and I made it about a week. At this point I almost knew the book word for word. 10 days ago I decided to really, fully commit. I was done. I hate it. It makes me feel like garbage. Winter is coming and I don't want to stand in the cold every 2 hours. I *really* read the last few chapters - the summary and final instructions. With determination. I'm already getting the \"aha\" moments. Actually, this morning when I got to work I realized I hadn't thought about smoking all morning.

Intense with both the good, and the bad. Not all that healthy, usually involves a lot of impulsive and risky behavior. Lots of drinking and drugs.* Dating someone who is neurotypical - Can be great, but the lack of being able to comprehend what is happening in your mind when your illness acts up can be frustrating for your partner, and having to provide support for extended periods can be exhausting.

I'm bipolar, she has depression and anxiety.

Whenever I have down time, I tend to end up in one of two head spaces:1.\tI feel this overwhelming guilt that I should be doing something productive. This usually leads to little or no relaxing, then burn out. This started in middle school, I could always go over my homework one more time and make sure it was perfect, or study just a little more, then mayyyybe I could play video games.2.\tI can\u2019t decide what to do with my down time. I will go over all the options in my mind and none of them feel \u201cright.\u201d Even if I pick one and start doing it, it feels \u201cwrong\u201d and I\u2019ll do something else. Similarly, I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m not in the right place, and *need* to be somewhere else. Sometimes I\u2019ll get in my car and start driving, thinking I\u2019ll end up somewhere that feels \u201cright.\u201d Sometimes it gets so bad it feels like my body is trying to get out of itself.. that\u2019s the best way I can explain it. The source of 1 I uncovered and learned to manage through therapy: OCPD. No matter how much I do or how well it\u2019s done, I can always do more and do it better.I recently came across two terms that shed a lot of light on 2: indecision and restlessness. These are common in those with depression / bipolar. So, for me, putting names to my feelings, and finding others with the same experience, helped tremendously. I know it\u2019s not just me. Plus now, if I can\u2019t relax because I feel like I should be productive, I stop and remind myself that I\u2019ve done enough, and it\u2019s time to relax. Sometimes making a list of the things I \u201cshould be doing\u201d helps, that way they don\u2019t keep popping up. If I\u2019m feeling indecisive I can recognize it now, and realize there isn\u2019t some perfect thing I can do that will \u201cfeel just right.\u201d I just pick something and go with it. The restlessness is still difficult at times, but usually keeping busy helps. Or going out for a walk to get rid of some energy. As for wanting to be home while going out.. for me, I\u2019m just a homebody. I do go out now and then, but I always can\u2019t wait to get home. I do try to engage with the world when I\u2019m out in it, and I do have a good time. But my favorite recliner is always beckoning me.

Depression can amplify this as well. It creates a feedback loop of negative, self hating thoughts.

I don't think either way is right, it's whatever helps you get through it, it's your experience and you can frame it how you want.I also believe it is a form of ego death. Again, existing in the midst of it is terrifying, but also leads to an awakening. From wiki:&gt;  Ego death is a \"complete loss of subjective self-identity\". The term is used in various intertwined contexts, with related meanings. In Jungian psychology, the synonymous term psychic death is used, which refers to a fundamental transformation of the psyche.

I was mentally and emotionally manipulated and abused by my father basically my whole life until about 3-4 years ago (31 now). He had me brainwashed really well. I went into therapy for many years, but never really brought my dad up; sure I knew it wasn't the usual father-son relationship, but it was special and no one would understand it.Things started getting really bad, as he mentally deteriorated from years of heavy drinking and drug abuse, and it became so draining I finally started to bring it up in therapy. I initially framed it in terms of \"my dad needs my help but I don't know what to do anymore.\" The deeper we went into things the more I realized what he was doing to me was destroying me, and how much of my \"fucked-up-ness\" was a result of the way he treated me over all those years.Suddenly, I had something to blame all of my shit on, and I did HARD. My major personality flaws (perhaps actual disorders), passing along the bipolar gene then really fucking me up to ensure it reared its head, and so on. Now my drinking and drug use was justified (in my head), and I became SO angry at him and the universe for dealing me this hand. It just wasn't fair.I just fell into this role of the martyr and got stuck there, I wanted the world to pity me and leave me to my destructive devices. Then, someone close to me, who I trusted gave me this advice. My initial reaction was along the lines of \"I can't believe you would say that to me, you know what I've been through! You of all people man!\" But then I as I ruminated on what he told me, I started to snap out of it and realize he was right. I started to realize that yeah, he fucked me up bad, I suffered a lot because of it, **but I didn't have to anymore**. It was time to move on and find myself and rebuild my life around me and the people I love.So, I guess this isn't advice, rather an anecdote of what it was like for me.

Perhaps the permit is scanned for each purchase, and the log of what you buy is protected under HIPPA, and if you look like you\u2019re heading for trouble you\u2019ll be contacted and urged to reassess your usage.But then, what about the heavy hitters like meth, heroin, crack? Should they be sitting in the dispensary, one purchase away from quite possibly destroying someone\u2019s life?

I lean towards books that aren't so much instruction manuals but can give insight, inspiration, and direction without saying \"DO X,Y,Z AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY FOREVER!\" Some that come to mind:- Man's Search For Meaning - Victor Frankl- Meditations - Marcus Aurelius- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - Robert Pirsig- The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are - Alan WattsMy general advice would be to start a journal and write down where you want to be and what you want to accomplish. This way you have a defined goal to work towards. Start small, you will not make all the changes you want over night. Write about your progress, both the successes and failures. Go back and read your successes to remind yourself how much progress you've made. Read your failures to remind yourself it happens, but you can overcome them. Celebrate the little victories. Have compassion for yourself when you fail - don't beat yourself up.Write down your fears and worries - having them on paper helps keep your mind from ruminating about them. Brain storm ways to overcome these fears and worries. Sometimes, for me, it helps to write them down and tag them as such:- Completely Imagined - Usually anxiety about the future. In my case running through endless scenarios caused by my social anxiety. Managing my social anxiety was the solution.- Real And Immediately Solvable - Anxiety can be removed by taking an action now. In my case feeling bad that I haven't reached out to a friend in a long time, and keep thinking I should. Picking up the phone, or even a simple text, removes that anxiety.- Real and Long-Term Solvable - Anxiety that can be removed with long-term effort and persistence. In my case, anxiety caused by being overweight, and the fear of the impact it has on my health. Sticking to a long-term lifestyle change with healthy habits will remove that anxiety. - Real but Inevitable - Fears about death and such. It will happen, it can't be stopped, so why worry?I feel like I'm just kind of bumbling at this point haha. I hope you can take some useful tidbits from this.

Why am I even bothering?\" I didn't see myself actually enjoying the house, or my sudden influx of free time once done. I'd also get bad anxiety over the fact there was so much to do. So between wanting to crush that anxiety, and working on the house being my only distraction from depression, I went harder and harder.. Vicious cycles... This all lead to some hefty Adderall abuse and eventually a very nasty burnout.This mostly went away when I got my depression in check.

This nagging \u201cyou should really be studying more\u201d voice crept into my head. It was still manageable though, and I could at least overcome that voice and do things. Fast forward to college getting a Computer Science degree, at a school notorious for its difficult CS program. I was suddenly in a position where no matter what, I could study more. I could put extra time into homework and projects. They told us straight away that having As in high school wasn\u2019t going to necessarily follow us into college. Bs were more than acceptable. Not for me... I was obsessed with getting that 4.0. I started to have meltdowns if I was stuck on something. A B made me feel terrible. Anything lower and I would have legit meltdowns. When a semester was in session all I did was work my job and work on schoolwork. Wouldn\u2019t see friends for months at a time. In the end, I got a 3.7, and still felt like I failed. I knew it wasn\u2019t quite normal, but rationalized it as being extremely important and \u201chey, I really enjoy it anyways!\u201dThis followed me into work where it got even worse. Now it was real, any failure could really affect my career and life. Especially being the kid out of college, I had to be perfect and prove myself to move up that ladder. Getting stuck on a problem or failing at something would destroy me for days. I\u2019d bring it all home with me and ruminate on it nonstop. So I started working until I was at a \u201cgood stopping point.\u201d Then started working from home. Once again it consumed my life.

My only regret is not getting on meds sooner, they have been life changing. It isn't a magic pill but will help you be better to deal with things and get your life back.Mindfulness meditation was very helpful for me. One of the biggest hurdles to get over with meditation, which I struggled with, and you are too, is realizing there is no goal to achieve. Trying to achieve a goal is the exact opposite of the intent of meditation. Simply sit and follow your breath. You mind will wander off, and will feel frustrating in the beginning. The absolute most important thing to do is return to the breath and not judge yourself for wandering. Each return to the breath is a success, and will become more and more frequent. It helped me to think of mediation as a \"laboratory\" for observing my thoughts and learning to acknowledge them, and return to the breath. This will trickle into your daily life, then more and more you will have moments of mindfulness throughout your day, which you use to ground yourself.Keeping busy as best you can helps. Movies, music, reading, cooking, whatever you are into keep at it. Even if you don't find the same enjoyment you once did because things feel so off, \"fake it til you make.\" The enjoyment will return in time.Keep up on self care. Eat well. Exercise.

I try not to let it get out of control though, or things get weird. I also have severe depression and anxiety (possibly bipolar, finding out this Thursday), so I smoke to help get out of my head. When I\u2019m baked I can actually sit down and watch a movie and be interested in it, without a million thoughts rushing through my head. I\u2019ve learned to control the introspection, and distract myself with things outside of my mind. I think being high is in a way comforting because things are SUPPOSED to be different and weird. As for using drugs to find your way out, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s feasible, trust me, I\u2019ve tried. I think the best way out is to deal with the underlying trauma / mental illness that brought this about as a coping mechanism. I resolved a lot of the shitty things that happened to me leading up to it through therapy. I\u2019d say I\u2019m 60% better than 7 years ago. I am now trying to work on a correct diagnosis of my mental health and will be trying new meds. I believe the last 40% is the lack of interest in the world from the depression, and the unstoppable chatter from the anxiety. The world seems distant and foggy because I am not able to fully engage in it. I don\u2019t think we can ever get to 100% \u201cbetter.\u201d When I\u2019m feeling optimistic I appreciate the experience, there are many aspects of my self that wouldn\u2019t exist without it, and I learned so much.
