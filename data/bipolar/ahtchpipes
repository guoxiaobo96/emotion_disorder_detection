I\u2019ve recently ran into some money issues so I\u2019m getting back on the horse. His only concern with me dancing is my safety. He worries because I travel out of town to one of my honey holes, that\u2019s not in the best area.. I know he doesn\u2019t like me dancing, but jealously isn\u2019t an issue. Because we trust each other, he knows that stripping is like any other job. It\u2019s just a job. Just like how you could meet a coworker at your gas station and cheat, it\u2019s no different from stripping. But when you\u2019re in a solid trusting relationship that isn\u2019t a concern.Lying should never be an option when you\u2019re in a committed relationship. It\u2019s a huge red flag. And from your OP it seems like you haven\u2019t sat down and had a serious conversation about you going into this field. Since you haven\u2019t danced you may end up hating it, you may end up not making any money, or you could love it, and crush it. But since you\u2019ve only joked with him about the idea (men don\u2019t usually comprehend nuance) I think having an adult conversation where you both can voice your options is crucial. What\u2019s alarming is the statement \u201chave the fight and pursued him\u201dIf you are both mature adults you can talk it through without fighting. But you may not like what you hear and you might \u201cnot be allowed\u201d to go. But if you really think this guy \u201cis the one\u201d you\u2019ll have to take that into consideration. But lying to your future husband is a pretty strong move. I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t like him lying to you about anything.

What I think men don\u2019t understand is about this profession is; it doesn\u2019t matter how sexual a woman is, or how prude a woman is. Any woman can be a stripper. Eg. whether you are a freak or not - \u201cYay I get to go to work and grind on a bunch of dick and get hit on by drunk guys who disrespect me all night!\u201d Said no woman (including strippers) ever. This is a game of manipulation. How much can I drain from every man I talk to tonight. I\u2019m going to do what it takes to get every penny from you. That\u2019s where the fun is! Money is the name of the game hunny. If any woman was going to cheat she could do it without having to go to these lengths. That said. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with her grinding and asking dirty to other men for money that\u2019s kind of on you. You may want to look into why that makes you feel insecure. No man likes it, my man isn\u2019t stoked. \u201cOh guys are going to treat my girl like a piece of meat all night\u201d but he understands that I\u2019m going back to school, and I\u2019m paying for my living expenses. We get paid to make men believe what they want to believe. That\u2019s it.  Your wife if banging btw ;)", "link_id": "t3_9a0c7u", "time": 1535172624}}
