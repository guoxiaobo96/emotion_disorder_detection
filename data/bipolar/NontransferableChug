That's a lot to process.I've seen some comments saying you might just have to accept you are low libido but that might not be the case - you might be for now but working with your MD to find a right birth control fit for you can help. However your SO needs to understand and be patient. Also, if my husband tried to have sex with me at his parents house I would also be incredibly uncomfortable.It seems like you are both under a lot of outside stress and it's happening early in the relationship.

My SO did not have that luxury. Instead his mother weaponised his ADHD and it made it so much easier for her to manipulate him. His dad is definitely the one with ADHD, I think that's what makes him a good enabler for his wife. I really think he is so tuned out he can't see that he's supporting a woman that is incredibly toxic and abusive of her children. We've been together 11 years. We've both been in the fog when it comes to his mother. I truly wanted to have a good relationship with her, but that's off the table now. I can only hope he's coming out of the fog.

His parents were told to get him tested when he was a child but refused because he's his mom's special little man. It makes me so fucking angry thinking she purposely kept him disabled with ADHD because it's easier to confuse and manipulate him when he can't focus. That's also why I have a tiny sliver of hope. He's never been in her presence while medicated. I'm hoping it helps him see what's going on.And he usually takes his meds every day. Occasionally on the weekend he'll take a half dose or skip if he's just relaxing. Otherwise he gets frustrated in having nothing to do.

When they visit they stay in a hotel and rent a car. Before they visit they ask us what dates work. If they don't work it's not big deal. I think a great example is a story from one of each of their past visits:His family visited around Xmas once. There was a light show I really wanted to go to but we decided to wait until they were visiting to take them. Last weekend of the show, told them we wanted to go and his mother let's out a petulant \"no, I don't wanna\" and crosses her as over her chest and pouts. Then laughs and says she has decided she doesn't have to do anything she doesn't want to anymore. So we don't go.My parents visited and there was an event DH wanted to go to that some of our friends would be at. He didn't want to ask my parents (probably.because he thought they would act as above?). I casually mentioned and they enthusiasticly agreed.
