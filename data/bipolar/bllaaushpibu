He didn't appreciate who I was at the time. He only wanted the girl he was trying to shape me to be down the road. He got angry when I wanted to take the physical side of the relationship slow. Big red flag. The first time he got my shirt off, which I was hesitant about but ultimately fine with, he moved his hand to down below, over my pants. I wasn't comfortable with that, so I made a noise and moved his hand. He interpreted this as rejection and stormed out of the room. As someone with a history of being assaulted and he knew this, it traumatized me. Love yourself, guys. Your partner wanting you to always work to better yourself, and wanting you to change into who THEY want you to be, what they think is good, even if you don't like it, are two completely different things. I could go on but won't. If you don't feel right about something in the relationship, you aren't crazy. It's perfectly valid. If you don't feel completely comfortable in the relationship and the way it's moving, they aren't respecting you and you shouldn't be with them. Be with someone who loves you because you are amazing.
