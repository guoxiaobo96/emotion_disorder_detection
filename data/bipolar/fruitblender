I do jobs, write them up on an invoice which I send at the end of the month, and get paid at the beginning of the next. Here's some things to consider. What kind of work is it? I am a translator, and when we initially talked about it, it was nearing the end of the month anyway, it was only a handful of small jobs that I did for him and invoiced him for. He paid a few days later. I've been doing it for a few months since then and get paid every time. I ask him to take a small job or two and process it through upwork so my profile stays current, and he is more than happy to do this. If you can break it off on a couple of jobs that wouldn't be a huge loss if the client did turn out to be a scammer, you could do that to test the waters. If its a big kind of job, maybe see what you can do about making a contract and having more information about the client. You definitely have to be careful.

{"duxr3yv": {"text": "This is quite the situation you have here. I interned for a health insurance company in Colorado, so let me see if I can help out. First off, marriage is a life change event that lets you change your health insurance. So, looks like you got a good plan, however read the fine print if you intend on using it in Belfast, because it will very likely not cover you outside of the US. Once you get a job you can report the change to connect for health and essentially cancel your insurance (assuming your wife is ready to move over with you). You will have to report your income anyway during tax time next year (even if you don't pay taxes), so they'll know. And if you're playing games with getting massive tax cuts you shouldn't have been getting, you will have to pay them back. However if you intend on working longer before she moves with you, she will just have to report that you moved and drop you off the insurance. Then her tax breaks will change as well. Also give a consulate for northern Ireland or the uk a call and ask about being taxed and a dual citizen. Make sure that you won't be required to pay taxes for both countries on your income (I know my limit is up to 100k USD/year, that was clarified when I picked up my German passport at the consulate, but the women made it sound like all countries aren't like that. Definitely double check.)Hope that helps, feel free to send me any other questions. Good luck!", "link_id": "t3_80qty6", "time": 1519780687}}

I aint diagnosing anyone just speaking what my experience is! See a real doctor! I've been on hormone replacement for a little more than a week. I don't sleep 12+ hours a day anymore! There's still some tweaking that needs to be done to find the exact right dose (right now I am having some unpleasant side effects) and it takes a few months for everything to get back to normal but this is already night and day for me. Whats crazy, is at first I thought it was from my job. I worked night shift, and sleeping during the day sucked. Then I moved to Europe. I figured, it was my 10 hour work days that started at 6am and jet lag. Then I had some other stuff happen in my life that made things extremely stressful. So I thought maybe stress was the cause of it. This constantly feeling tired and not wanting to do anything just kept getting worse and worse and I made all these other excuses for it. Finally, I told my doctor I don't know what to do anymore and she took a blood test, for some other stuff on top of the hormone that comes from your thyroid, and with that simple test we found the culprit. So definitely worth taking a closer look at your own body. Mental health and physical health go hand in hand.

So, when you're feeling anxious, or any other \"negative\" emotion, its your body trying to tell you something is wrong. Sometimes, our bodies over do it, but usually they are right. Think of it the same way as when you bump your toe and feel pain. Take a moment to sit down and see if you can trace back to why you are feeling anxious about something. I know its kind of difficult for me, as I get a lot of panic attacks for no reason. Lifestyle does have a huge impact on the frequency of panic attacks for me. I find I get them more often if I'm drinking a lot of caffeine, or not sleeping well. I just started a night-shift job, so both of those are factors right now in my life. I'm working right now to try and get a regular sleep schedule down, which is a bit challenging. But take a look at your lifestyle. See if theres a small change you can make, and see how it affects your mood. My new pdoc suggested that instead of worrying about how much sleep I get, focus on waking up at the same time every day, as an example. ", "link_id": "t3_4jzomy", "time": 1463656165}}

The hardest thing to do when you're this depressed is to justify putting any work into yourselves. Trust me, I'd make excuse all day long to not get up. To not take meds, go to therapy, exercise, go socialize, or anything.  Our feelings love themselves and they love to feed themselves. So if we don't put a wrench in feeling depressed (angry, anxious, whatever), we'll spiral to a dark place. Its unfair, because some of us are more susceptible to this spiral than others. We never did anything to deserve this. It will take one small step at a time, but you gotta keep at it. You're seeing a doctor, don't stop. The medication carousel is really frustrating and discouraging at times, but you gotta keep at it. Feeling this depressed isn't normal. And guess what? There isn't anything wrong with you! I promise! Our brains sometimes don't keep up with chemical production. Thats what medication is for. Hang tight, you'll find the right fit. I'm sorry about your experiences with this guy. You know what though? You don't really know what went through his mind or why he stopped contacting you. Maybe he got wet feet? Maybe he's scared of dating someone? Maybe he thinks he's unworthy of being with you? You don't know for sure, you don't live in his head. Don't make assumptions about what he's thinking, its a scary path to go down and generally ends up being way inaccurate of what actually happened. Please PM me if you want to talk more. I feel like I've already rambled on a wall.  I'm here for you, friend.

I had read that there are studies of modafinil helping with specifically that kind of depression in bipolar patients without inducing mania. Anyway, one of my previous pdocs told me that its very common to have both. My current pdoc is very anti-stimulant though, she says its \"today's opium\" and it does more harm than good so she refuses to prescribe them. I ended up going to a weightloss clinic that prescribes phentermine (I know the risks I'm taking here) and it feels like night and day. I used to have issues with just staring off into space, I wouldn't even be able to finish reading a single article, I would constantly bounce around tasks and never be able to get anything done.. Now, I can get stuff done, I do so much better at my new job because I can focus, its a huge difference. I was able to try adderall sometime ago, and I had the same thing with the crash. The phentermine for me lasts all day, I just have increased anxiety with it (and yes, I'm actually in a hypomanic phase because of it). So, I feel you, but I have yet to have a doctor that can see this though, and I don't really have much choice due to only having medicaid at this point.

Its just something I don't throw around, and I know people that will just say it to anyone which leads to very awkward conversations with me. My best friend said it to me a few weeks ago, and I was just dumbstruck, I didnt know what to say back (now I've gotten ok with it and I can say it to her). My SO, I've been with for just under a year, we haven't mentioned that word to one another, so it'll take time with him.
