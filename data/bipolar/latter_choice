I've only ever had one manic episode and a few psychotic depressions (with lots of mood lability -  mostly depressed - between them all), and maybe some mixed episodes but I'm horrible at picking those out. I denied my diagnosis so hard that I actually asked my psychiatrist to send me to a second psychiatrist for a second opinion.The second psychiatrist was great. He confirmed it was bipolar disorder as indicated it could be either BP1 or BP2 (because the manic episode was high but not psychotic, and because I've had more of an issue with depression) but the only way to confirm would be to wait for another episode like the first and thats not a great idea! He said it is a common misconception that people with bipolar always experience more highs, many experience mostly depression - even people with BP1. I'm sure thats part of the reason why it's acceptable to diagnosis someone after one hypo/manic episode and one depression.Doctors are also shifting towards a spectrum of mood disorders - ie. bipolar and depression are not two entirely separate disorders, but having some bipolar changes consideration for treatment (with antidepressants for example).If you are concerned about misdiagnosis it's always worth talking to a specialist in mood disorders to get a more in depth review and explanation as to why this diagnosis fits your symptom profile!", "link_id": "t3_9jsez7", "time": 1538233240}}

For example, my partner has SNPs in a dopamine receptor associated with schizophrenia, but he does not have schizophrenia, or many other mental illness. Many disease-associated SNPs regularly occur in the general population (that's also the reason why large study populations are needed to identify disease associated SNPs). In order for these SNPs to have any effect, there need to be many of them present, possibly in different genes, and environmental factors will influence the effect they have. That's why for diseases like bipolar disorder, it's difficult to pin down the cause to a single gene/SNP and why researchers believe it results from the accumulation of many SNPs in many genes, as well environmental factors.It's possible that if you have bipolar disorder, your SNPs in GSK3 may contribute to your disease.

{"e45gjxa": {"text": "Hey there!I was in a similar situation as you, so here are my thoughts:1. I think it's awesome to want to help others with bipolar disorder. Who has more insight into bipolar than someone who actually has the disorder? You have a pretty good idea of what the person on the other side is going through. You will likely have more patience and empathy for people going through an episode than someone who's never been there. These are some advantages to having bipolar in a medical/research field where bipolar and other mood disorders are the focus.2. You may very likely learn more about yourself and how to better yourself by studying bipolar disorder. Wanting to learn more about it and yourself can be part of your goal, in my opinion. But I think it's healthy to have other reasons to be interested in bipolar disorder too. Varied views of the same topic can help to keep it interesting, and healthy.3. As you are in research, I'm sure you know how well controlled a study (especially a clinical study) needs to be. Things like current medications (maybe even past medications), past brain injuries, ECT, etc. all need to be taken into consideration when studying cognition. This is especially relevant with Alzheimer's because all of those factors can affect cognitive function (again, I'm sure you already know this!) and skew the results of the study. It doesn't mean that the study co-ordinators/PIs think of less of those people, it's just an important factor to conside note of.4. There may very well be discrimination or comments of bad taste made about mental illness. Sometimes it helps to put it in a different perspective (eg. person 1 must be making a joke about that person 2's mental illness because that situation was difficult for person 1 to handle and this is how they are distressing). It doesn't make the poor comment right, but it helps to realize that the experience of mental illness can be a difficult topic to grasp for people who are fortunate enough to not have one. They might not always be considerate of your experience and how those little offhand comments may affect you.5. You don't have to be open about your illness unless you want to be.  If you choose to be open, you could open up to only one person, or a few, or even the whole research team. But making that decision is very personal and is a whole other topic!

{"e45avpa": {"text": "To answer your first question: Yes, there is research that suggests that people with bipolar disorder experience eating disorders (and vice versa)  more frequently than the general population. Without reviewing the research, if I recall correctly, eating disorders with impulsive traits like binge/purging anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating occur more often in people with bipolar disorder. That's not to say someone couldn't have a restrictive eating disorder and bipolar disorder though, or that the rate of restrictive disorders isn't higher in bipolar disorder than the general public (it probably is higher). If you're interested in doing you're own research, I'd suggest doing a general google search with the terms \"eating disorder\" and \"bipolar\". You can also use pubmed ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)), but many articles are behind paywells (if you attend university or college you can likely gain access through your school's library). You can also try scihub ([scihub.org/search](https://scihub.org/search)) which provides free access to scientific articles.To answer your second question: I have bipolar disorder (probably II maybe I ) and I've been treated for restrictive anorexia in the past. My timeline is similar to yours. I struggled with a restrictive ED NOS (around 13/14) before I was diagnosed with bipolar (at 18). The ED NOS resolved on it's own (I never sought treatment) but I often struggled with disorder thoughts about my weight afterwards. When I had my first elevated episode (16) the thoughts disappeared and reappeared after it finished. After a serious episode of depression (psychotic features) that resulted in my diagnosis, I read that a healthy diet can help manage bipolar. I had already lost weight while depressed and wanting to prove to myself that I wasnt bipolar and that I could control my mood, I took healthy eating to an extreme and also starting restricting. My home life and relationships fell apart (out of my control) shortly after, and I started restricting more heavily. Eventually I was referred to an outpatient group treatment for my ED where I was also medicated for my mood disorder (which was essentially in overcoming the ED). I can't stress this enough, but CBT is extremely helpful for challenging and overcoming ED thoughts and behaviours. Mindful (and mechanical) eating also helped to retrain my hunger signals. A few years ago (at 24) I had another really serious episode of depression (re: psychotic features) and I found especially at the beginning of the episode, that I really focused on my body and weight and how I was unhappy with that. As it got worse though, I had more dark thoughts that became the focus and the disordering thoughts took the back seat. I still struggle with ED thoughts. They always increase when my mood is low. Properly treating my bipolar (currently I only take lithium) helps reduce ED thoughts and behaviours, but it doesn't get rid of them completely. I'll be starting a group CBT program soon and I hope to refresh my thought challenging skills!TLDR; There is a higher frequency of eating disorders in people with bipolar disorder than the general population. I had a restrictive eating disorder, and still have disordered thoughts, and these thoughts increase during lows and decrease during highs and when my bipolar is well managed.", "link_id": "t3_96vxjh", "time": 1534208214}}
