After my spiritual awakening I weened myself off the psych meds with the help of a homeopathic psychiatrist.  The only difference between a manic episode and a spiritual awakening is lower back pain, first manic episode I ever experienced and that damn pain controlled me during that time.  I temporarily lost my mind.  My hypersensitivity became unbearable briefly.  Since then my entire perspective has changed I don\u2019t drink or do drugs or take psych meds and I\u2019m fine.  I eat mostly healthy, meditate, run and work out and read.  If you\u2019re going to do it I recommend doing it the natural way.  I don\u2019t know your age but I hope you\u2019ve learned all the lessons you\u2019ve needed to learn.  After this all happened I read anatomy of the spirit by carolynn myss.

The first \u201cmanic\u201d episode happened to me once I started working out, quit doing drugs, quit humping every girl who would let me and quit playing with myself and started eating fruits and vegetables instead of just processed premade gmo food and lots of water.  I also quit being a social media/phone face addict.  Started to avoid tv as much as possible, I called it the babysitter.  Basically I applied moderation to all of my bad habits and other areas just fell into place.  Started to read books, took up hobbies, started to actually enjoy life and the people that were in it.  Then the dark night of the soul hit.  So many strange things happened no one could explain to me.  \u201cDon\u2019t know why your sternum perturbed out your chest or why you vomited and the pictures you showed it actually looks like dookie instead of puke, or why your lower back hurt so much.\u201d  Yeah I lost my sanity temporarily, but too many events that my spirit wouldn\u2019t let me shrug it all off as just coincidences.  Started learning about the sacred secretion.  Read the book anatomy of the spirit and it reassured me I was in fact sane, just discovered something I didn\u2019t know existed.  Since then slowly weened myself off all of my psychiatric meds with the help of a homeopathic psychiatrist.  I haven\u2019t been the same since then and don\u2019t doubt my choice.  My friends and family haven\u2019t doubted my choice either.  Now when I get depressed it\u2019s just for a day.  I just try my best to meditate and exercise every day.
