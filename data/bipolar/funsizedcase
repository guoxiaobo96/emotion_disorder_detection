However, all of those can be potential signs/symptoms of bipolar. I moved within the last year and began seeing a new psychiatrist. She put the pieces together for the bipolar diagnosis (I received it last August)and started me on the two medicines I listed above (trintellix and lamictal). I was medicated incorrectly and misdiagnosed for 9 years. It sucks, but I am grateful my current psychiatrist was more knowledgeable and able to help me feel so much better. She also explained any side effects I may experience prior to when I first started those medicines, and that after about a month, they would subside. I think it\u2019s important medical professionals explain what to expect versus what\u2019s not normal before they give anyone a new medication to try. Whatever is the next step for your wife, I really really hope it is a night and day experience for her!!! If she ever wanted to discuss anything about her experience, I\u2019d be more than happy to talk with her.

Even if you don\u2019t feel this way, please remember to be gentle with how you respond. This is a very sensitive area. My personal answer is yes. I have major depressive disorder, bipolar 2, anxiety, ADHD, and insomnia. They all suck and I\u2019m on a cocktail of medications. I abhor it. I am 27 years old and hyper aware of symptoms. I analyze every. little. thing. that I do in my day. My brain likes to occasionally be a bitch and tell me \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d and begins having the intrusive thoughts of using my mental illness for attention. I\u2019ve learn to combat these thoughts with the fact that if I were to stop taking the medications, I KNOW the extremely dark and hopeless hole I spiral down. That feeling is real and I can\u2019t think of a worse place to be. And that is a terrifying place to be bc NOTHING can help me when I am in that place. I can\u2019t even produce a conscious thought that my life is worth living and I should keep fighting. On the flip side, when I take my medications, I do have some sort feeling. Do I feel \u201cnormal\u201d? No. But having a mental illness and having the goal of feeling \u201cnormal\u201d isn\u2019t realistic for all individuals. I\u2019m sure there are some ppl out there who have a mental illness and have achieved what feels normal to them and I am happy for them. And envious lol However, for me, that\u2019s not realistic right now or maybe ever. My goal is to reach a feeling of being content and not apathetic about everything/constantly having instructive thoughts of suicide or experiencing frequent anxiety/panic attacks. Summed up, yes my anxiety likes to kick my ass and interrogate me on if I\u2019m faking it. But Imposter Syndrome is real. And I know my mental illnesses are real. I\u2019m validated by finally being able to recognize the immense difference in my feelings, thoughts, and actions when I am taking my medications versus when I refuse to. It took me 9 years to learn it this way. Kind of the hard way. I know that was a lot, but I hope at least a piece of that was helpful. Sending good vibes your way and know that you are not alone.

{"evmji6e": {"text": "Yeah, of course. Background info you\u2019ll need: I have some childhood trauma. At the time of this therapy session, I was in graduate school. I have a bad habit of bottling things up and trying to hold it all together. My therapist was helping me process and understand what happened during my childhood. At the time, I was under a lot of stress from school and general life stress. But I walked in confident with a list of things I wanted to go over with her and tried to look all put together. She called my bluff and told me to put my list away. Then she had me close my eyes and imagine growing up and how certain things effected me, shaped me, and how my current stressors were weighing heavily on me. She had me answer simple questions about these things and my voice began to crack because the tears were coming. So I stopped talking, knowing that I would cry if I continued. She encouraged me to continue to talk, even if I cried. I refused. She had me open my eyes and she told me it was okay to cry and I told her no it wasn\u2019t. She continued to positively and gently educate me on how suppressing everything wasn\u2019t healthy and letting it all out alone can be beneficial, but it is also okay to allow others to see you cry. I was tearing at the seams by this point and she said, \u201cjust let it go. Allow yourself to be human. You\u2019re not getting through this session without crying in front of me.\u201d *note, she said this with good intention and not - in any way - a threatening manner. And I had a meltdown in front of her and sobbed hard. It was about ten minutes of silence while I cried. When my breathing became a concern and I was borderline going into a panic attack (or it felt very similar to one), she began walking me through deep breathing to help ground me and calm me back down. I know it sounds kind of mean, but I am thankful she helped me feel more liberated to cry instead of constantly bottling it up and exploding when I got home alone.
