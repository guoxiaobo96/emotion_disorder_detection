My parents were going through a spectacular divorce throughout my pregnancy (including the 21 year old mistress) and still, for the next 10 or so years I kept looking.I had a hysterectomy at 27 and don\u2019t tolerate HRT. So having no sex drive really really helped me lose interest in men and sex with men. My daughter was also about 8. We had an old pedophile neighbor living next door and I decided I didn\u2019t want her to have a stepdad. Single moms boyfriends and new husbands are the most common abusers of their children. So that plays a big influence.It\u2019s been almost 10 years now. I dipped my toes back into dating last year and it was depressing. One guy wanted sex immediately, another was angling for a new wife and a mom for his three small children. At this point, I have no interest in raising more kids. I have a cozy little home full of plants and natural sunlight. I read and listen to music, walk my dogs and see my friends. I hang out with my kid. I visit my family. I have autonomy and agency. I have no desire to adapt myself to living with another person when it means more dishes, more laundry, more appointments and stresses and his feelings and emotions which tend to take priority over my major mental illness. If I want to move next year, I can move. If I want another dog, I will get another dog.

{"erw9x53": {"text": "In my own experience and anecdotal conversations and research into both disorders has lead me to some soft opinions on their similarities and differences.Yes, you can absolutely have a borderline personality disorder and bipolar, which is a mood disorder. Personality is a mix of innate temperament, humor, curiosity as well as coping skills, relationship templates and societal conditioning. So when things get derailed in formative years people develop survival skills that can become toxic and maladaptive when they become ingrained.Bipolar is more in the category of an organic neurotransmitter and affects sleep, energy, creativity, goal setting, executive functions and has aspects like delusions and psychosis. It can\u2019t be fixed through learning new coping skills, learning how to self soothe and self care - bipolar doesn\u2019t give a shit! When you think you\u2019re the sister of Jesus you\u2019re not going to bother with unfamiliar challenging things that threaten your reality.I think that bipolar disorder when it kindles and becomes active looks a lot like bpd, especially as teens and young adults because the brain is still immature and not done developing. I was never diagnosed with BPD, but it was often considered a diagnosis when I was young and self destructive and self medicating with drugs and alcohol. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 24. And have had many challenges and episodes in the 12 years since then. My therapist and I really explored my fear that my personify was toxic. In between episodes my personality is fundamentally healthy. With medication for the bipolar I was able to develop a healthy personality. So, personality disorders and bipolar looks really similar during adolescence, which is why they aren\u2019t diagnosed in adolescents. BPD and many personality disorders respond to dbt therapy, and can lose the diagnosis of BPD. That is really really good news. Having bipolar and coping with it poorly can lead to developing unhealthy personality aspects and can lead to meeting a full diagnosis. Bipolar is extremely treatable but is chronic, requires medication and treatment and is life long.One takes learning and the other takes managing. We have ways to cope with both!", "link_id": "t3_c4fbw0", "time": 1561337418}}

The best thing I did for my daughter was take care of my mental illness. Therapy, meds, hard work, the whole deal. If I am stable I can then be stable for her. But, this is bipolar. A serious reoccurring condition that is lethal.When my mood was off my daughter would stay with her dad or one of our moms while I received treatment. We had a couple of these disruptions during her life. A safety net for you guys is absolutely vital. Make friends, lean on your family if you can. Make a plan in writing on what happens with your daughter if you become incapacitated by your illness. My daughter doesn\u2019t have bipolar so far, but she has struggled with depression, anxiety and self harm for about four years now. The absolute hardest thing about being a parent has been seeing her suffer. She has her own therapist, and has been in therapy off and on but mostly on since she was twelve.

And I keep getting injured or migraines or like now, a horrible fibromyalgia flare.So, what I do is pull out all my coping skills. I take a hot epsom salt bath. I do deep breathing, the 5-7-8 breathing exercise works best for me. I do yoga and really stretch my body out. Swim if I can manage it. My appetite disappears when I\u2019m under stress so I will force myself to eat something. I let myself sleep because what my body needs most is the time and space to repair itself. I do dbt therapy and have learned a lot of these basic coping skills and they really do help. Oh! And I planned a girls night at some hot springs nearby. Having something to look forward to also helps me a lot.When you are feeling a bit better take a look at what is causing you stress and do as much as you can about environmental/social factors. This will pass and the best thing about life is that it never stays still, it is always changing.To address letting minor things ruin my day:I keep locking my keys in my car. Even my spare set of keys. So work all day with small kids and it\u2019s cold and snowing and my car is locked tight.

{"egf75gd": {"text": "Long term early childhood professional here, I will weigh in on this. I had a three year old boy in my class last year. Dad traveled for work and mom worked full time, the little guy and his older sister were in school from 7:30-6pm every day. We worked so hard with the kid. He hit, he stood on tables and threw food, knocked over shelves and furniture and did a lot of biting, hitting, screaming and scratching. We made behavior plans. We had extra teacher support. He had one on one support for months. We had meetings with mom and daily communication. And still, between being loving and smart and funny and engaging, he would bite and scratch and attack. He needed professional intervention at the level we could not provide at my center. I quit over him, but after negotiation agreed to stay. I wasn\u2019t his teacher this school year, but they enrolled him and kept trying to help him for another month or so.There was an escalation of aggression, unreasonable requests for attention and he just needed way more way earlier in his development.The school eventually had to have him leave. Mom had hired a nanny last I heard and he was eventually diagnosed (at 3 1/2) with ADHD.So, back to your son and your situation as being the parent. First, I\u2019m sorry. It is so hard to be the parent of the kid causing chaos in class. Second, even though they are twins your children are not identical. Developmentally they sound on track as they are a boy and a girl.Is he in pre-k or earlier preschool? It sounds like a fairly academic program If it has homework, worksheets and periods of time requiring being silently attentive. A girl has a bit more impulse control in the early years, boys lag in this area. But they excel in building, like your son.He sounds like an active normal little guy in a school that is a poor fit for him. He probably needs to be running around, getting messy, building forts and singing songs. Learning comes naturally to kids if they have the opportunity to discover it through exploration.  I\u2019ve been doing this for twenty years and raised my own daughter, so I\u2019m not just talking out my ass!Anyway, there are a couple things that could be happening with your son-A- His preschool is a poor fit and contributing to his behavior issuesB-ADHD or another atypical neuro condition could be present and he needs to see a doctor.See his doctor anyway, come to think of it. Honestly, he sounds like a frustrated little boy that needs to run around and get dirty. I know you probably can\u2019t swing two different school schedules/pickups but it sounds like your daughter will thrive wherever she\u2019s planted and I doubt a move would hurt her this early. Remember to breathe. Make more time on the weekends to spend time together. Dad and son should be playing games and reading books as part of their routine. And MIL shouldn\u2019t be play fighting with him! Wrestling is cool and throwing his boy around is good for him, but tablets and nerf guns and violent play aren\u2019t doing you any favors.Also, feel free to ignore me.

But I also experienced significant abandonment trauma at 18 and 19 (brutal year) but I\u2019m also highly sensitive with my sensory systems. So even if someone else with the exact same bp profile will become jealous and clingy in a relationship I\u2019m more likely to just bail.Pretty much it\u2019s a nature/nurture thing.

I\u2019ve always been her primary parent with her dad having her about 6 days a month. While in the hospital I admitted that I can\u2019t parent her full time. She\u2019s highly emotional and struggles with anxiety and depression (treated for both). When I was that depleted there was no way I could handle work, a child and a shitty living situation.She she went to live at her dad\u2019s full time. I had her on weekends only for a few months and now 6 months later we alternate weeks. Admitting to myself that my mental illness drastically affected my ability to be a present and healthy parent was devastating. I cried in the hospital for two days. I cried and it felt like a deep hollow ache my chest for a month after that. But it gave me time to recover. And her an opportunity to live out of poverty. Our housing has drastically improved since then, I am able to work full time and we have much healthier food since I don\u2019t have to feed her all the time.Having bipolar is brutal and it\u2019s so hard to accept our limitations when we want to be and do everything. But we can\u2019t. And that\u2019s okay. Can you stay somewhere else for a bit while you get your bearings? I\u2019ve worked with verbal and nonverbal autistic children on and off for 15 years. It\u2019s exhausting and frustrating and even \u201cnormal\u201d parents are sometimes just unable to do it. So after all that, I suggest backing off. Hire someone to care for them if you can afford it. Call in family if they\u2019re close by. Whatever you do, tend to your health.
