{"fuux30x": {"text": "So kind of a long story. Bm lived with her elderly and sickly parents. (Her father has since passed and she lives with her mom and controls her life and money. Its disgusting). We always knew there was a lot going on in the home (violent arguments, neglect, lack of education) and we filed for full custody in October of 2016 I think. We always tried so hard to work it out with bm but when she left our state and moved across the country without telling us we lost it and filed. Its kind of a long story how she ended up in our state and then eventually moved back with her parents who live across the country so I wont go into it. She was living across the country for a while and she wouldnt let ss visit us without her. She is completely co dependent on her children but pays no attention to them at the same time. She would keep them up all night so she didnt have to be alone but she wouldnt feed them and she would sit on her phone all night.anyway, we were documenting everything especially the parental alienation and we were moving forward with taking her to court. We didnt really have a good chance because we didnt have that much evidence UNTIL her elderly father called my dh. He started going on and on about all the neglect. My dh IMMEDIATELY got a tape recorder and recorded the whole conversation. Bms father said that she left all the time saying she was going to the store and wouldnt come back for weeks because she was with random dudes. Her father said that he was too old anymore to give ss a proper home. He said bm wasn't helping with schoolwork, and was fighting violently with boyfriends and her parents in front of ss. In one argument she ripped the shirt off her mother and then ss went after bm with a board of some sorts to hit her because he was trying to protect his nanny.. because his nanny and poppy are who raised him and he has more allegiance to them than he does her. He basically told us how she is fighting with her boyfriends too in front of ss and it was totally toxic. She was either not around or inciting violence around ssWe immediately called CPS. At first they completely blew us off.. thinking it was just a custody battle. Then my husband transcribed the whole recording and sent the recording to the cps worker. The cps worker called us and said how disturbing the phone call was. We told the cps worker that we were scheduled for ss to come see us in a few days. She said she was going to let ss come to us. She tried multiple times to get a hold of bm but bm kept dodging her. Ss came to us and bm finally went down to the cps office a couple days later. She must have said some really dumb ass shit because ss sibling got taken from her right away. The cps worker called us and told us NOT to send ss back to bm because he would get put in state custody. We never had a court ordered custody agreement so it was not illegal to just keep ssWe continued with the custody case and had her own parents and cps ready to testify against her. We documented EVERYTHING. Bm knew all the evidence  against her. We flew to the other side of the country for court only to have bm sign over EVERYTHING, including legal custody, that we wanted at 4pm the day before courtDocument everything. Get cps involved.Sorry this story was so jumbled. I have a hard time talking about it without becoming angry and frazzled because my ss has so much trauma and it pisses me off. There are also so many more details to this story. But basically.. DOCUMENT AND GET CPS INVOLVED", "link_id": "t3_h93o5o", "time": 1592185409}}

So what I did is wait until I was somewhat stable to start ttc. I've been trying to conceive for about two years, I've been fully stable for about a year of that and only mildly depressed for another year. I used to freak myself out thinking I could never be a parent due to my mental health issues but then my stepson moved in with us full time. He was 7, he is 10 now. I am more like his mom than his stepmom because his mom is a piss poor excuse for a parent and is barely involved. So I've really had to step up. I was going through some really bad mental health issues when he moved in with us and I was SHOCKED at how well I was able to manage parenting him with all of these issues. I just love him so much so I would just push through my issues to be there for him. Now, there have been times where I've been irritable and lost my cool with him due to my own issues. I always apologize during those times and try to explain that I wasnt feeling well. He seems to understand and is forgiving. But i think every parent loses their patience every now and again, so it's not the end of the world. But for the most part I've been an awesome parent, despite my issues. I'm loving, emotionally invested, good at discipline, good at keeping up a routine, I feed him healthy things, etc. When you love someone like you love your child you just put your issues aside and do what you have to do. And its rewarding. I call my stepson my little buddha because he has saved my life and made me get up and get going despite intense depression and anxiety. It's been good for me to have a child. So in raising him, I've gotten over my fears of having a baby. I know I can do it and so can you. I always thought I would screw up my kid too with my own issues but I think my issues have actually made me a better parent. My stepson has anxiety depression and ADHD and he knows he can always talk to me because I'm so understanding.

I barely had any withdrawal symptoms and cravings have been nothing but minor inconveniences except for really triggering situations.. which has only happened twice to me so far. The first two days were really tough but after that it's been smooth sailing. It was pretty awesome too because even though I didnt quit for those two months I was on it I just magically cut down to 5 cigs a day without even trying. I just didnt crave cigs that much.It's a great drug. I have mental health issues and I didnt get any suicidal thoughts or depression.

{"fend407": {"text": "Oh gosh, my SS10 is a chatterbox too and is also very sensitive. I do believe his teachers have asked him if he ever stops talking. My SS blurts things out in class ALL THE TIME (we believe part of that is ADHD. We've had him evaluated and are considering meds). Was your SS talking at an inappropriate time? Perhaps you could e-mail the teacher to find out why she said this? If he was talking at an inappropriate time, then you have the perfect window to talk to him about it. \"SS, we can't always be talking, sometimes we need to let others talk\" etc, etc... whatever you want to say. If she just said it because he was having a conversation during free time then I think that was pretty rude of the teacher. I think your husband's approach was great.I've learned with my SS that even though he is sensitive, we still have to discipline and teach him appropriate behaviors. It may make him cry, but it has to be done to help him grow. Talking too much isn't the worst behavior and you can point this out to SS in the beginning of the conversation as a strength. Example: \"SS, you are so social and you love to talk to others and we LOVE that about you! And sometimes others need a turn to talk, and sometimes it is not appropriate to talk.. i.e. during class, during a movie, etc\" Our approach with SS being a chatterbox is that we have made it into a joke in our house (we discipline him for talking during class time though). For example, my SS takes FOREVER to eat because he is super picky. So at dinner we try to encourage him not to talk so much and to concentrate on his food. He can't do this lol. He talks so much and so we always end up saying something like \"Hey chatterbox, eat your green beans!\" And he laughs and we laugh and we all know it's in good fun. We've told him he's a talker numerous times in a light hearted way and he doesn't seem to be offended by it. I don't think you will be able to joke with your SS in the same way, he seems to be a little more sensitive about this subject than my SS is. Best of luck, seems like you guys are already handling it great!", "link_id": "t3_eq0368", "time": 1579282118}}

It's great that you guys will be getting sole custody. My stepson was almost removed by CPS but he was sent to us for regular visitation the day before his little sister was removed (different dad). So we just never sent him back to BM and we got sole legal and full residential. Best thing that ever happened to the kid but 2 and a half years later and he is still struggling with the change. He misses his grandmother (who he lived with also) and his little sister. BM, not so much. BM just had two kids from another dad and SS is having a hard time with not being there with them.

And we ended up piecing together a lot of my issues. My stepson's (lives with us full time, his mom is an egg donor and that's it. I won't go into any more details but she is NOT a parent) mother is pregnant..... WITH TWINS. She gets pregnant with any man she's with after a couple of months. She has lost multiple babies (that is the only thing I feel for her on) and she has LIED about multiple pregnancies to keep men from breaking up with her. She wants the child support. She doesn't want to be a parent... just wants child support or a man to support her. Currently, she lives off her elderly mother's social security. She's too lazy to get a job and support her kids so this is her life plan, just get pregnant. She is due any day now and I AM LIVID about it. My therapist straight up asked me last night \"How pissed are you that she can get pregnant so easily and you're struggling to have kids\" and I started crying and practically screaming about how unfair it is that someone like her who neglects and emotionally abuses her children can have kids so easily. IT IS NOT FUCKING FAIR. I swear to God I'm going to lose it when she has these kids. I don't want to see one picture or hear about it at all from my stepson, which is going to be hard because these are his siblings. But I know he's going to get on facetime with her (once in a blue moon because she rarely calls) and he's going to want to show me the babies. I can't tell him I don't want to see them because they are his siblings. I don't know how I'm going to react. BUT I WANT TO GIVE HIM A SIBLING. I don't want to hear ANYTHING ELSE about her kids. I want to give my stepson a sibling that he actually lives with. He's already too old to have anything in common with the baby if we do have one (he's 10). I don't know where I'm going with this. So much is running through my head after I expressed myself last night and I'm just SO bothered and frustrated today. &amp;#x200B;Anyway, my homework was to write a letter expressing my anger to my stepson's \"mother\".

So dh signed him up and bought him 90 dollars worth of equipment. Dh was ready to go to his first practice that night (2 hours away mind you) and then he found out through the grapevine that bm left the state with ss without telling us AND returned the equipment for the 90 dollars. We now have full custody.. sole and residential. Some of these parents just dont see the benefit in extracurriculars and the need for commitment to a sport. They are shitty parents.Is there any way you guys can get ss to his practices? It's important to show him that he committed to a team and he needs to be there.

It's just the way these kids are... they will agree with anything their bio parents say.. particularly BM. They feel allegiance to them. It sounds like BM is saying nasty things about you guys and your SKs are picking up on that and it's taking them a while to come around when they're with you. Do you have a court order? We do and one of the things is that neither parent is supposed to disparage the other parent in front of the children.

She moved to our state for about 6 weeks then promptly went back to across the country without telling us. She was a total parent alienator. Shes always been unstable too. So after she pulled that shit dh filed for full custody. We started writing down everything she did wrong. We were just waiting for court to come. Then one day her elderly father (who she lived with.. he has since passed) called us and told us that shes never home.. disappears for weeks at a time.. called ss a fucking ass hole.. etc etc. My dh recorded the whole conversation, transcribed it and sent it to CPS. CPS went out and she didnt answer the door and blah blah blah. At this time, ss came to visit us for 6 weeks. Cps finally got in touch with bm and took her daughter (from a different father) away. CPS told us if we sent ss back they would take him into state custody. So.. we never sent him back. Bm lost her shit.. sent the cops to our house and everything. But we didnt have any co so we weren't doing anything illegal. After two mediation hearings it finally went to court 6 months later. The day before court... which we flew to the other side of the country for.. she called Dh lawyer and said she wanted to concede. She signed over full legal and residential custody. Only thing she ever did that was good for him. We had a lot on our side especially with a cps worker and bm own parents who were all going to testify for us. But I dont think we would've gotten full legal custody if she didnt sign it overSs was very upset when we told him he wasnt going back to live with bm and his grandparents and sister. Kids are always attached to what they know. Two years later and hes 10 now and he says he doesn't even want to visit bm because shes such a shit parent and hes finally realized it. Now hes a healthy, well adjusted little boy which he would not have been with her.
