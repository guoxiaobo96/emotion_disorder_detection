If she was raised in a sex negative household or led to believe sexual feelings about herself or others were somehow wrong, this could possibly be quite the overwhelming negative experience. Do you guys converse about any private topics? Or do you feel she is pretty guarded from you? If the latter maybe even just an exercise in couple strengthening, decks of cards or games you can get on Amazon are sometimes good. Just to spark conversation. Start with some more intimate deep feelings that aren\u2019t sex related and progress. You could also talk about things that are attractive to either of you, sometimes that evolves towards more of the bedroom stuff. Happily a company has a date box curated by a marriage therapist and her husband. Lots of relationship building activities, some more fun and some more risk\u00e9. Another thing I have seen is tantric yoga. Don\u2019t be afraid of the word tantra, but google a series of beginner poses and take time to do them and try to exclude any other thoughts or feelings but the awareness of your partner in that very second. It causes you to both be vulnerable and explore a vulnerable part of your partner. It\u2019s something new for both of you so you\u2019re on even footing. After relaxing and connecting that way, discussion may flow more easily. Lastly, if she doesn\u2019t drink, see if she won\u2019t consent to a massage. In whatever degree of unclothed she\u2019s comfortable with. That is a great way to loosen me up!

I set it aside again.  DNA was newish at the time and though we had a match, neither of the people had the pedigree charts or trees to back it up, so it was hard to make sense of.  Fast forwards a few more years, I started to tie up a couple of loose ends, and/or rule some possibilites out, though I still couldn't break through the wall.  Maybe got a tiny peephole from time to time.  Well I finally put all I had out there on this subreddit, along with a theory or two.  Redditors in the country of origin helped me come up with a name.  It was actually a historically prominent name, but local history had not been recorded much online, but this time, this time I could find biographical info about him, lots of relationships and fill in a bunch of dates.  It also placed my ancestor definitively as a pin on the map.  With this info to fill in some gaps, I WAS able to make sense of the DNA match!

{"ele4v3h": {"text": "Several thoughts on this one. Being no stranger to antidepressant affecting sex myself, here\u2019s why I like your idea.  Often people report the decreased libido- desire to engage in sex AND blunted sensation.  Men seem to experience the sensation issue more than women, but it still happens.  A toy like this could offer her more targeted sensations.  Also, when this happened to me, I was very susceptible to distraction. So even during amazing oral one minute change in pattern or pressure could throw me back to the starting line.  A Womanizer type toy could offer better consistency than a human.  I know a lot of movement also threw me off when I was going through this too. I always always had to have him stop moving to climax.  I know it was crazy hard to fight his impulse and stay still but it helped. Have you tried any toys? Does she like porn or erotica? She may think she\u2019s well arouse for sex, but if you can take it beyond that, it helps! A full body massage with teasing was good for ramping up arousal beyond the usual. And lastly, another vote for a possible medication change.  I don\u2019t know about her totally weaning off it if she finds it helpful.  As stated in other replies, Wellbutrin tends to have this side effect reported less and I have also heard one of the best, at least for men, so maybe women too, is Vibryyd.

I was a SAHM to a demanding child for many years and now I am a nurse, I work 8-5, but 5 days a week. My husband travels frequently and I do the majority of the parenting just from that. He is a wonderful engaged parent when he is here. It\u2019s just the nature of our life. I was not able to make myself compromise in this way because it made me and him feel dissatisfied.  He wants to see me enthusiastic as well and I just couldn\u2019t put myself there mentally and physically a lot of the time. This ended up in an almost dead bedroom. I think that you are compromising in a way, but also not doing him or you any favors.  What we had to do was find ways to be intimate and feel emotionally connected when sex didn\u2019t happen. Sometimes that is just cuddling. Sometimes it is me offering something like a blow job and then just being done after that. Sometimes it is both of us masturbating together, this is usually quick. Sometimes it is just him masturbating and me being physically near.  Sometimes it\u2019s schedule sex. Sometimes it\u2019s masturbating with video calling app of choice while he\u2019s traveling.  We had to look at sexual intimacy as a spectrum and not just sex. Because if we looked at it as just sex, we came up against countless barriers.  It took a mental shift. We do get a lot of pleasure and intimacy out of all these things as well as sex. And it really keeps the desire and wanting alive. You having to compromise may eventually lead to you resenting him. Him getting unenthusiastic sex can lead to the same for him. Lots of good advice, good luck! ", "link_id": "t3_ba5y4s", "time": 1554604046}}

Without him taking blame or you placing blame. I am the low libido partner in my marriage. I was hearing my husband tell me how he felt but I was *hearing* him, and really thinking about what this meant without me spiraling in to guilt and sadness.   Actually hearing other people explain it, in very much the same terms as he did, like on here helped me understand because it wasn\u2019t so emotionally loaded. I would know I was going to turn him down, so to try to make it better I convinced myself I would just be aloof or cold or not touch him at all because I didn\u2019t want to lead him on. What I was doing was trying to make rejection easier for him to take by pre-rejecting him. Sounds ridiculous right?  I also learned that because of my frequent rejection he had to \u201cde-sexualize\u201d me, which I sensed and of course that doesn\u2019t feel good, but I can see how he\u2019d do it as a protective mechanism. Our relationship operated in extremes, it was either sex or absolutely no intimacy at all. That isn\u2019t going to work. I feel guilty, he feels rejected. We\u2019re finding ways to maintain intimacy, even if sex doesn\u2019t happen. So he feels that his needs are met on some level and I don\u2019t feel like my boundaries are pushed. I\u2019m totally fine with that.  For us that might mean just cuddling, kissing, me watching him get himself off while being near, us both getting ourselves off, doing something over the phone if one of us is away. The big takeaway I seem to get from all these discussion is that sexual intimacy is a spectrum and it isn\u2019t always just \u201csex\u201d. If it is limited to that, we\u2019ll reach barriers more often.  But having and honest, frank conversation is the hardest part.  Consider writing?  It\u2019s been uncomfortable for us at times, but we\u2019ve been together  almost 16 years and don\u2019t plan on separating so we owed it to ourselves to do this. We\u2019re still working on it.
