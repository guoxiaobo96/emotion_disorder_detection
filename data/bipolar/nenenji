If you want super competitive play and playing with try hards, go and play ranked. I just think that when I see players shitting on other \"bad\" players and insulting them left and right, it's pretty petty. Being an asshole in that situation won't help you win, the \"bad\" player won't play better after getting ridiculed. This just seems to be someone liking putting others down to feel better about themselves. If you see someone on your team or the enemy team playing very bad, try to help them!

My way of doing it is washing my hair and then towel drying it until it's damp, then I put the colour bomb in my hair and MAKE SURE! to get everything evenly covered. I usually do this on weekends as I can stay inside and have it in for long.

Antorus the burning throne is currently the raid that you should focus on. One thing that you can aim towards is getting the 'ahead of the curve' achievement. You get that by killing Argus on heroic mode (you will get a dope mount from that as well). The easiest way to do this would be to join a raiding progression guild.Beside from raiding there is other PvE content like doing mythic+ dungeons. There you can try to complete different levels of difficulty (You can read more of this on icy veins or other similar wow sites). This is a great way of gearing up!If you feel tired of doing PvE you can do some PvP as well. For example you can grind up your honour level and reach higher prestige levels. This is done by collecting honour points form PvP world quest and battlegrounds. You can also get mark of honour that can be spent for transmog gear. Another thing you get is honour talents that you may use in PvP combat, as well you can get som artifact appearances.If you enjoy collecting mounts and other things there are many factions that you can grind reputation with for a variety of rewards. (Allied races for example) getting achievements are also a part of endgame content. Working towards the pathfinder achievement to get broken isles flying is thing of interest.

Now I don't say that you can't joke around with \"mean jokes\" but there has to be a mutual understanding of what is ok and what's not. Me and my best friend can jab at each then some times but our friendship is very strong and we know where the line goes. These kind of jokes are very tricky to do right so if you don't know the person extremely well, don't joke around that way. There are funny \"mean jokes\" and there are plainly just mean jokes. Which joke goes where is very personal. But to answer you question, yes they really hurt me because I don't find that jokes about my appearance and intelligence funny. I'm a very a sensitive individual who wears my heart in my sleeve and take everything to heart.
