In grade school, I was the kid who would get sent into the hall for talking when everyone else seemed to know how to keep their mouths shut when the teacher asked. When anxiety kicked in, the person who constantly had their mouth running would disappear and a very fearful person would take his place - a person who could barely string together a coherent sentence when the time seriously called for it. I resonate with that girl. Trying to put together an answer when I was nervous sometimes just wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t happen. I would stutter on certain words or certain sounds I had to make and would choke on the thought I was trying to convey. It was extremely embarrassing and I felt a lot of shame because a lot of my friends in high school performed exceptionally well in events like debate, the ACT, socializing, not blurting out unfiltered thoughts at the wrong time. I\u2019m now 28, have been medicated properly with a beautiful cocktail of pills (had to get hospitalized from an alcohol overdose at .5BAC first, of course), and no longer stutter. In fact, I actually work over the phone setting appts for a solar company from home and talk with people all day. I became very good at my job and completely spun my stutter into a strength that will give me my career. It gets better.", "link_id": "t3_fjwx0v", "time": 1584477320}}

Long story short, I'm on 70mg Vyvanse, 4mg Intuniv and 30mg Adderall IR daily now and I feel functional all day and experience pretty minimal side effects - probably because I've been on this dosage for a few months now and my body is pretty used to what the medication does to my brain and has adjusted. I don't feel like I need to take more and I oddly don't really feel like drinking alcohol (my drug of choice to combat my adhd and other associated symptoms - depression/anxiety/hypomanic states, etc.).

{"eaf4hmo": {"text": "Hopefully this gets read, but sometimes I can feel one coming on a few days in advance. I'll be minding my own business, when suddenly an uninterrupted thought comes into my mind because my anxiety decided one day to just fuck with me. Tiny little thought that eventually turns into an explosion of emotion.I've kept a journal of these emotions, which has helped me to quantize and process them. I don't perfectly know myself, but I can now recognize patterns in myself, which help me from making worse decisions and help me to make better decisions. It's years in the making.Could have been because I saw some news article, heard somebody talk on the bus or even watched a video story that somehow related to an event in my own life that has stuck with me in a bad way. Causes chains of memories to be triggered over a period of time which can lead to an eventual thought that feels so intense that it literally feels like you are being attacked by something. Your brain sees any \"threat\" as a threat and it makes your body act like it's being seriously hurt. Fight or flight kicks in hard and you basically start attacking the threat, even if it has been somehow constructed by your own mind's confines. It can get pretty bad.This has happened to me before while taking a bath and listening to music and/or thought contemplation. Lots of hyperventilation and a very real pain response. I don't like to let my panic attacks win, because I'm a competitive mother fucker, so I generally look whatever issue has come to the forefront of my mind right in the eye and face it until it's over, but that doesn't mean that it's not terrifying. I can't in anyway compare this feeling to the actual front lines of war, but for me it has felt like the front lines of my own war. These events feel incredibly real while you are feeling them and anyone who says they aren't real should seriously re-evaluate their stance.Panic attacks come in a lot of different varieties, but I definitely know the type that I experience. Edit: I would like to add it is possible to overcome them and it is important to recognize when one is coming on. Just like a color palette, they can express themselves infinitely and may need a specific method to handle them. Do not be afraid to talk with someone you trust about this candidly. Talking about it could save you years of heartache and could save your life.", "link_id": "t3_a03q2y", "time": 1543137579}}

I ended up quitting that job for my current job (I'm working with a close friend) and now make close to twice what I was making before, which has made me buy all sorts of things that I've wanted for a long time.

For some crazy reason, I'm a top performer in the company and that really helps my paycheck. I can barely keep my emotions in order, but I suppose the manic side of me demands that I perform well, so I do. Mostly because I hate losing.
