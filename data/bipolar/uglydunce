I\u2019m 17 currently and wherever she is,, she\u2019d also be 17 too around this time ... Her 18th birthday is approaching now.  I was super upset the night it happened.. Usually I\u2019d be down for sexual intimacy with my partner but a family member of mine had died.. I asked her if I could come over because she had an emotional support dog who I loved with all my heart.. She said yes, and started off pretty romantic. She walked to my house to walk me to hers and held my hand and kept me close to her because I was crying.. She took the dog too and we walked him on the leash. We got to her house and at first I was a little confused because nobody else was home and typically I was never allowed over with no parents over because they knew about her and I\u2019s relationship and were religious and homophobic... She closed her door and told me to sit down on the couch and hold the dog.. I did so.. She began changing her clothes in front of me and just smiled, I smiled back , and didn\u2019t think much of it. Then she took my hand, completely naked, and said \u201cI know what will make you feel better, c\u2019mon.. get up\u201d and I told her I wasn\u2019t in the mood and pulled my hand back so I could rest it back on her dog. She then got irritated and yelled at me in rage... Saying things along the lines of \u201cHOW DARE YOU NOT AGREE THAT I UNDERSTAND BEST WHAT WILL HELP YOU!\u201d  Of course it caused me to cry more. I was used to my ex girlfriend yelling and being violent so I put my arms up to shield myself, scared she\u2019d hit me..and her dog stood up infront of her and began barking as if he were protecting me. He jumped on her almost aggressively and she shoved him off and threw him to the wall., She then kicked her dog out of the room and locked the door and she grabbed my hand again and forced me to come to her bed.  She took my clothes off. I didn\u2019t fight back because I was scared, all I could manage to do was cry. She performed oral acts on me without consent. Inserted objects and her fingers inside me. Forced my mouth on her body parts such as her tits. I said \u201cno\u201d countless times and this infuriated her and caused her to grab me by the throat and choke.. It didn\u2019t feel like sexual play either.. I felt real panic and like I could die but all I could do was sit there... I tried to scream for her dog but he couldn\u2019t come in and I just heard him scratching at the door and whining.

Suddenly their happiness began very important to me. I\u2019m not sure what happened but my ability to detect a better person from a not so great person never changed. Typically, I can figure that out in just a few days. After dating an abusive ex I decided that I didn\u2019t deserve that, and now I\u2019m dating a fellow INFP boy who\u2019s a total SWEETHEART... Sometimes I wish my ex would contact me and tell me how they\u2019re doing though. I worry about people, even when I shouldn\u2019t.", "link_id": "t3_d5lur3", "time": 1568753867}}

Let\u2019s start with the time she faked a seizure for attention. - She just suddenly collapsed, and began acting as if she was having a seizure. I ran and told her mother. Her mother put her in the back seat of the car and began driving on her way to the hospital. I was BAWLING my eyes out.. I was scared I\u2019d lose my girlfriend. Her eyes were rolling back and she was absolutely losing it in the back seat. I clutched her hand tightly and reassured her it would all be okay and that I loved her... And that I thought she was absolutely gorgeous.. When we arrived at the hospital, my ex girlfriend suddenly jolted up and stated that she was fine. I froze. Her mother simply sighed, as if she was used to it and drove back home.  It scarred me mentally. Never fucking do that to someone who loves you.- She raped me, and had several rape allegations from men. I asked her if we could hang out and if I could visit her pet cat for comfort because I was super upset and depressed. She said yes. She actually came to my house to walk me to hers, hand and hand. Once we got there, I sat down on her couch and picked her cat up and began petting him. She began removing her clothes. I thought nothing of it.. Thinking she was changing or something. Then she grabbed my hand and yanked me forward and put her teeth on my shirt, trying to pull it off. I laughed and I told her \u201cHey, I\u2019m really not in the mood for this today\u201d she looked at me with a fake sad expression and just insisted \u201cNo, this is going to make you feel better!\u201d And she tugged the rest of my clothes off. I told her no, I actually told her no multiple times. Then she pinned me to her bed and began performing sex acts on me. At this point, I began to cry and scream that this wasn\u2019t what I wanted. That caused her to get angry so she wrapped her hands around my throat and squeezed as tightly as she possible could. I didn\u2019t fight back, I didn\u2019t want to hurt her... but damn, I fucking should have. I am out of this relationship now, and I am happy.

{"ezsijjn": {"text": "This is going to be a long one. Sit tight. I\u2019ve always been a girl targeted for bullying, elementary through high school.  I was bullied for being overweight, unattractive, being weird... Etc.. I didn\u2019t do much about it. Honestly, I just didn\u2019t have enough respect for myself to say something. I began dating this girl when I was sixteen years old (MISTAKE!!) . She had tons of issues mentally, and was a horrible person. I had people I didn\u2019t even know begging me to dump her when we began dating. I was a kind girl though.. I wanted to give her a chance. First thing I noticed, super rude to my friends. Cursing at them for even introducing themselves. Acting like she loved and appreciated the gifts I gave her and then yelling at me and complaining about having to carrying them around . Cheating on me over three times with evidence and me forgiving her. Multiple personalities. Never knew which girlfriend I\u2019d get. She had multiple rape allegations from men. She had even confessed to faking some of her mental problems for attention and certain drugs. Anyway, yeah.. The b#### was crazy. Months after we broke up she began telling everyone these huge lies about me. It was centered around my suicide attempt. She told everyone that I \u201cclaimed to be bipolar\u201d and that it offended her because she\u2019s an actual bipolar and that I was an attention w#### because of it.. I never claimed to be bipolar, I told her when my psychiatrist diagnosed me with a mood disorder that she believed was bipolar and that was it. She said that I lied to her and cheated on her, I never did. She did that to me. She said that she was there when the police came to my house after the overdose when she was at school . She said that the police tackled me and I put up \u201ca little fight \u201c .. It wasn\u2019t true. I was completely out of my mind because of the way the meds were making my body react so I answered the police\u2019s questions and willingly went with the ambulance because I was scared. Minor detail, but she told everyone that they pumped my stomach but instead they made me drink two fat liquid bottles of charcoal to absorb the medication. She then claimed that I tried to kill myself over her and that I was making her the villain when it was never about her. She told everyone that I refused to let her call me at the hospital because \u201cI was scared of her breaking up with me\u201d. I honestly didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone, I was in a bad state of mind. I wasn\u2019t worried about that at all. After my 14 day stay, I got out.. Then she proceeded to dump me saying \u201cit\u2019s disgusting that you\u2019d give up on yourself like that\u201d and I just said \u201cyeah, I expected us to break up\u201d in a completely calm voice.. It pissed her off, so she told everyone that I began breaking down crying and begging for her back. (Btw this was all coming from a girl who lied about having 9 suicide attempts for attention -My ex-) . Obviously that never happened, but her story continued. She said that I kept stalking her, wanting her back so bad that it drove her insane to the point of her checking herself into a mental hospital to get away from me.. That never happened . In fact, soon after my hospital stay I began dating my bestfriend who I\u2019m still 7 months strong with.. So I was completely happy and wasn\u2019t even thinking about her... AND NOPE, didn\u2019t end there.. Then she claimed that I tried to check myself into the same exact hospital as her to win her back.. :/ . Welp,, I have lots more horror stories about dating this nightmare but- I finally had enough, and wasn\u2019t going to let this b#### lie about me. I made a huge post about everything she did to not only me but like 20+ other people who didn\u2019t like her.. I even texted her mother everything as I still had her number. She currently doesn\u2019t have a phone. I was pissed, honestly I didn\u2019t know I had the capability to be that angry.", "link_id": "t3_d22tpe", "time": 1568092922}}
