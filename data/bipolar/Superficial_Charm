It took my ages for me to realize that I was blacking out and re-dosing my meds, causing me to experience their unpleasant overdose effects, such as extreme dry mouth.At the time, I was in a very abusive home situation, which probably made the blackouts worse.  The episode ended with me being unable to sleep for 3 days, at the end of which I was bordering on psychosis.

{"feksacv": {"text": "I don't honestly see myself ever being unmedicated in the future, as I am so non-functional without my medication that I would likely have to be permanently hospitalized.  My tricyclic antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic have allowed me to live in an apartment on disability, and still feel human.  The risk of going nonfunctional is too scary.A few days ago, I accidentally missed a part of one dose.  Within a day, I dissociated, accidentally almost burnt the apartment down, had two breakdowns, and picked a fight so hurtful with my closest friend that I almost lost them.  I ended the next day with suicidal ideation and a panic attack so bad that I vomited.   I'm recovering now, but boy was that awful.Cocaine was my biggest demon, I 'only' did meth for the four months before my current ten months of sobriety.  Stimulants, particularly meth, would make me feel level-headed and 'tied-together'.  Before either of those substances, I did a lot of. MDMA.  The first time I did it, I didn't feel 'high' in the traditional sense; just calm, collected, and finally in control.  All those little gestures and words that never came easily to me, suddenly did.  I was complete.  Until it wore off.  And as Hamlet says, 'Ah, there's the rub'.During my meth use, I had not yet been diagnosed with ADHD, but I should have suspected it.   I would often do a line of it, quickly get sleepy, and have a nap.  Paradoxical reaction to stimulants, absolutely, but every bit as harmful.I'm a 32-year-old woman who used to excel in school, although it took so much effort that it almost killed me.  The ADHD diagnosis was therefore delayed, yet explained so much, and helped me realize that I'm not lazy or stupid.I had just escaped from many years of abuse when I relapsed.  I was more manic then depressed at the time, but cared little for my life.  A mixed state, perhaps.  For the first time in ages, no one was controlling me, but the abuse had destabilized me so severely, that I didn't know which end was up.I definitely relate to the idea of neurodivergence, yet at the same time completely acknowledge that I am mentally ill.   These diagnostic terms are at best approximations for issues that we as humans are only beginning to understand, but they are helpful approximations.  Mental illnesses tend to come in groups, and I've actually encountered a fair few internet folk with many of the same diagnosis.Hope this helps.", "link_id": "t3_epetls", "time": 1579206558}}

The very first recorded incident of mania will result in a bipolar diagnosis, even if there is no evidence of a depressed episode in the person's past.It is supsected; however, that the small subgroup of people with bipolar disorder who do not experience depressive episodes will eventually experience one down the road, or already do experience them, yet have such minor ones that it does not occur to them to consult a professional.  A third possibility is that these people suffer from more mixed episodes, with elements of both mania and depression, owhich can manifest as the irritability that you described.So it's entirely possible to have bipolar disorder and experience your symptoms.

My best friend and sponsor has saved my life a few times, and provided a safe, non-judgmental environment in which to get clean.  I owe them the world, and their stoic outlook on life inspires me to keep sober. I take my meds for bipolar and OCD as regularly as possible.  I still miss the occasional night, but have got better at making it a necessity and a habit in my own mind.I don't attend meetings or therapy, although I'm planning on finding a psychologist soon.  I do exercises in a DBT workbook because I also have BPD.  BPD and bipolar together are intense? that's for sure.  I use two mood apps, eMoods and Daylio, every day.I do a vigorous exercise routine every morning, and try to walk often.  I listen to music constantly to fill the emptiness and boredom that comes with BPD and addiction recovery.  I drink a lot of coffee and tea, and vape nicotine, the latter of which I switched to from cigarettes over a year ago.This next is definitely not for every person with bipolar disorder, but I also smoke cannabis, and take CBD oil with a legal prescription.  I find that it helps ease my PTSD startle response, and tends to balance my mood out, instead of triggering mania, like it does in some people with bipolar.  Everyone's different, of course.  I guess some people wouldn't call me sober at all, but since 9 months ago, I was doing copious amounts of meth, cocaine, and crack, I see the softer drugs I still do as harm reduction.Above all, I keep a sense of dark humour about my experience, and try to follow more animals than humans on social media.

I'm 31 years old; and, since I was 16, I've used the term 'drug addict' to fill in the empty space where my identity should be.

This unhealthy coping mannerism has been hard to kick.I often joke that I'm not really a person.  Behind the mirroring and chameleon effect that come naturally to me, I am mostly just a young child's fear, rage, and basic desire for comfort.However, people like us can recover, even though that word is laden with heavy connotations.  And although the label of 'recovering addict' leaves something to be desired as an identity, it sure is a better option than 'active addict'.  There's a whole subculture that comes with recovery too, from the meetings with free coffee, to being able to bond with others in recovery over shared struggles.  I find that having a subculture to belong to helps.A few weeks ago, I was having a hard time, and kept splitting on my best friend and sponsor.

It also doesn't hurt that INTJ's are usually good sounding boards, as they tend to be soft-spoken, yet are equally devoted to the logical analysis of a problem as is an ENTP, if not much more so.As someone who studied languages in university, I also love the feeling of verbal discourse.  The way that words physically form in the voice box and mouth, how they feel rolling off one's tongue, and the varied sensations associated with different linguistic patterns are endlessly fascinating to me.I saw a mbti meme regarding 'things the types say', and some ENTP phrases were 'I enjoy banter', 'listen to my wacky ideas', and 'listen to my funny quip'.

From a simple Google search of narcissism, one easily finds terms like 'evil', 'soulless', and 'demons'.What these emotionally-charged vignettes miss is the suffering of the person with the personality disorder.  Neglect and abuse are common in the childhoods of those with NPD.  Narcissism can be a poor defence mechanism from having been treated without respect or dignity, from a very young age.Another common myth is that people with NPD can *never* be aware that there is something wrong with them.  Especially in the case of the covert narcissist, the house of cards from which narcissist's sense of superiority is constructed is very flimsy.  Underneath their self-love is often self-loathing.For myself, admitting to likely having NPD (I have already been diagnosed with another personality disorder) was one of the deepest narcissistic injuries that I ever had to give myself.  It wounded my pride to see through my thirty-odd years of denial.  To those narcissists that actually achieve self-awareness, the next battle is fighting the slew of stigma directed towards anyone with the disorder.", "link_id": "t3_covlvj", "time": 1565563346}}

It is theorized that Dahmer likely had borderline personality disorder (BPD), as opposed to a more psychopathic mindset.It is crucial to note that almost no one with BPD does anything remotely like the things Dahmer did; nor, for that matter, do most psychopaths.  Nonetheless, it does help explain his peculiarities in the years of 'My Friend Dahmer'.BPD is thought to be partially caused by early childhood trauma, which was touched on in the graphic novel.  His fear of abandonment, impulsivity, and substance abuse, point towards the BPD diagnosis.As someone who has also experienced early childhood trauma and some resulting borderline symptoms, I relate to Dahmer *BEFORE* - and only before - he committed his crimes.  He was a damaged individual who made very horrific choices.  Derf Backderf, who wrote 'My Friend Dahmer', had it right in saying that the man was a tragic case, up until he took his first life.", "link_id": "t3_aqg7fc", "time": 1550125931}}

It seemed like the most ridiculous joke in the world, but I gradually fought back the denial.   After so many years of self-deception, I would not throw away this struggle to suddenly become neurotypical.  I am not violent or threatening, and I think that I have a right to exist.Of course, when you bring criminal offenders into the conversation, this topic gets more heated.  But consider the Milgrim Experiment of 1963, which demonstrated just how easily empathetic  people will commit horrific acts when under the right pressure.  There needs to be more research into just how much of a danger 1-4% of the population actually poses, when compared to other demographics.  Doctors, nurses, judges, police officers, and soldiers, all have higher rates of psychopathy and sociopathy than do people in most other professions.

The Milgrim experiment of 1963 is my favorite real-life example of the horrors capable by humanity.  Volunteers were shown a man in an room adjacent to them, who was hooked up to a system of shocks.   Another man in a lab coat would then sternly instruct the volunteer to administer shocks in increasing voltages.  Little did the volunteers know that both men were actors; no shocks were actually given, and the man in the other room merely pretended to receive them.Milgrim's peers had hypothesized that almost none of the volunteers would give shocks of much voltage whatsoever.  Milgrim proved them wrong.  The majority of these mentally-healthy people, when told to 'follow orders' by a authoritative, lab-coat-wearing actor, went up to the highest possible shock voltage available, even after the other actor screamed out in mock pain about his heart condition.For this reasons and others, I am fascinated by the idea of the 'ticking time-bomb'.

These people all worked within a public health care system.  When I was first put on benzodiazepines, the prescribing doctor mentioned that they could be habit-forming, but not with much conviction.As opposed to opiates, benzodiazepines don't tend to cause euphoria, so the latter are seen as relatively harmless. But one only has to look at nicotine to see a drug that is not hugely psychoactive, yet is extremely addictive.  Speaking of opiates, I spent years nodding off at random times of the day, due to taking the suggested dose of my prescription.  I could not trust my ability to stay awake anywhere.

They are talking about the essential 'goodness' of a person, their character, and even, for a lack of a better term, their soul.  If one has trouble feeling how others feel, even if they strongly care how others feel without being able to feel it themselves, they are automatically less human is some people's eyes.The are reasons for this stance, but if I was able to go three decades believing that I knew what empathy was when I didn't, I would not be surprised if others had similar misunderstandings of its actual definition, whether they possessed it or not.", "link_id": "t3_ami6ik", "time": 1549227338}}

{"eejebi9": {"text": "Obtaining this data is a catch-22: to determine who is psychopathic, one usually has to utilize the criminal justice system.  Successful, high-functioning psychopaths rarely admit to their nature.  For example, in my real life, almost no one is aware of my traits relating to this condition, however sub-clinical most of them may be.  Still, to use American data:- about 700 out of 100 000 Americans is incarcerated, and about 25% of these individuals are psychopathic, resulting in approximately 0.2% of America's population being criminal psychopaths- between 1% and 4% of the American population, both incarcerated and nonincarcerated, are thought to be psychopathic- although the data is skewed due to both percentages including incarcerated individuals, the difference between 0.2% and up to 4% of Americans is still significant Secondary psychopaths are often fearful of punishment, making the risk of serving time a useful deterrent for these individuals.  Instead of criminal activity, working in fields such as business, law, and medicine, can sometimes be suitable methods for a pro-social psychopath to profit.  Lack of fear and calculating logic are two desirable traits for these professions.For example, the difference between the amount of psychopathic CEOs in America, and the psychopathic average in America, is thought to be as much as 3%.   Although more research on this subject is definitely needed, it is likely that most psychopaths do not live the fantastical lives that the availability heuristic would encourage people to believe.  Even though the following point is anecdotally derived from personal research and experience, I find it important: most psychopaths prefer to be left alone, so that they can live their lives without severe social repurcussions.", "link_id": "t3_ahxo61", "time": 1547998288}}

They tend to be cold and calculating. They experience a narrower range of emotions, and rarely feel anxiety or fear.  Less prevalent than secondary psychopathy, primary psychopaths are simply wired differently from birth.Secondary psychopaths can feel empathy, fear, and remorse.  Their empathy 'switch' is usually turned off; a survival mechanism from early childhood trauma.  Other psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety and depression, are often comorbid.  They are highly impulsive, and tend to be less 'succesful' than primary psychopaths, having difficulty holding down a job or blending into society.Neither term is mentioned in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version five.

If you are under 18, and in a place where it is also illegal in general, it is risky when it comes to legal repercussions, but I assume that you already knew that.  Psychologically, it is more complicated than just being a helpful herb or a evil drug.  Before I say anything else, I will admit that I am a (legal) cannabis user, who started using it as a teenager.The absolute BIGGEST danger that cannabis can pose is:Its potential to increase the severity, and/or to reduce the length before the onset, of schizophrenia and/or other psychotic disorders in already genetically predisposed individuals.  That is, if any of these conditions run in your family, or if your genes are otherwise organized to have you develop psychosis (the latter being admittedly much more difficult to determine), then cannabis is very dangerous.  The fact that psychotic disorders most often develop in sufferers late teens and early to mid-twenties, which is also the time that people tend to start using cannabis, makes this even more risky.All that being said, however:Cannabis definitely can open the mind to different ways of thinking, and altered states of perception.  It is mildly psychedelic, and had been said to provide a slightly spiritual experience to some.  This altered state can be positive, negative, or fairly neutral.  It can also reduce or increase levels of anxiety and paranoia in someone prone to it, in a way unrelated to developing psychosis.Because of the change in how one interprets information that is perceived by the senses, formerly nonsensical auditory information can often be misinterpreted as meaningful, such as hearing arguing when there is none.  It could absolutely be tied to how important these sounds are to your particular social and familial situation.  It does NOT mean you are going crazy, or even have to be a bad thing.Personally, I have used cannabis for the last fifteen years, and it has never made me in the least psychotic.  It has; however, increased my anxiety and made me perceive sounds differently than I otherwise would.  This effect is very common, particularly in highly sensitive people.If you do choose to continue using cannabis, I would recommend choosing strains higher in CBD and various terpenes, and lower in THC, of this is possible in your area.   Note:  I am NOT recommending cannabis, merely a modification of use that is already present.  This combination has drastically reduced the anxiety and paranoia that I experience, both under the influence of cannabis, and in my day-to-day sober life.  I take it medically for alleviating symptoms of PTSD, among other conditions.So cannabis is an eye-opening substance, in a myriad of different ways.", "link_id": "t3_ahq2wb", "time": 1547971685}}

Of course, minimal empathy does not a serial killer make.
