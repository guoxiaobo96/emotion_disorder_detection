Talk to a lot of guys, go on a lot of first dates, figure out what does and doesn\u2019t work for you, and use the process of elimination until you find someone you click with AND also shows signs that you are compatible. You\u2019ll get a lot of duds like the guy you\u2019re talking about, but with each failure you\u2019ll gain a bit more insight. The dating scene nowadays is fucking brutal. A lot of matches on tinder just seem to blur together. It\u2019s important to put the face to a name. Like even if you can\u2019t meet up, just FaceTime a little when you have the time. I\u2019ve found that to be helpful. I was able to find a great guy by not allowing myself get attached until I figured out if he fit what I was looking for. Yeah there were some guys that I got hung up on, but each time it happens you learn how to get back up faster.

Play the game. That phrase is commonly used by ass clown pick up artists, but it\u2019s true for a lot of aspects in life.

Trauma isn't processed like \"if this then that.\" It would make things a lot easier if it were as simple as that. The human mind and how it processes trauma is something that is *still* being studied because it affects everyone differently and we need to learn how to treat all manifestations of it. Don't play the pain olympics. Don't say, \"My pain was worse therefore your pain doesn't count.\" How would you feel if i said, \"I was brutally raped and tortured by a kidnapper from ages 14-22, your father didn't actually hurt you.\" That's a pretty horrible thing to say. Because your father *did* hurt you in a way that is still affecting you today. Your pain is valid. Everyone's pain is valid.

Our president is openly trying to bend the law to his will, openly attacking freedom of press by vilifying the media, and praises authoritarian dictators. 9/11 gave us a glimpse of what it felt like to be completely exposed to attacks.

He may not be her legal caregiver and therefore not responsible for her, but his codependency is one of the many factors that can lead to her being seriously hurt or even killed. Did she take off with the gun? She can easily be shot by the police if she\u2019s deemed dangerous enough. And the fucked up part is that you\u2019ll be the one he blames.

Mental illness is so hard for everyone involved and it has torn families apart easily. Being pragmatic about everyone\u2019s mental health here is so important. Preventative care is much more effective (and cheaper) than picking up the pieces when it all falls apart.

{"dx20xez": {"text": "I realized similar things about myself around that age. I was just a shitty person with ulterior motives that was always thinking about what I could gain from a situation. I think a lot of it is just getting older and learning empathy. When you get older you gain more insights on life and how you view yourself and others. You learn how to put yourself in others shoes and you start recognizing patterns in your behavior, just becoming more self aware in general, you know? I have BP II and I traced a lot of my shitty behaviors to lack of impulse control that I experienced while manic or hypomanic. So getting my mental illness under control was a huge part of growing up. I needed regular therapy because my reality had been so warped by my illness and the toxic environment I created for myself. I\u2019ve had a lot of relapses and struggles but things have been steadily getting better in general. I got my diagnosis when I was ~16 and I\u2019m 24 now. So I\u2019ve spent a decade dealing with this monkey on my back. For people like us, some of the decisions we make can have some serious consequences like setting off an episode, so it\u2019s essential for us to be self aware of our actions and behaviors if we are to survive. I recommend therapy and possibly some sort of journaling. Setting an amount of time at the end of the day to self reflect on the day\u2019s events or my behavior has allowed me to observe patterns that may be indicative of an oncoming episode. So you\u2019re on the right track. Make the conscious effort of trying to think of the long term consequences of your actions. Eventually it\u2019ll become completely natural!

But the older man DOES. These men, as adults, made the decision to tell a little girl what she wants to hear just for their own sexual pleasure. Think about that. It\u2019s so fucked up. He took advantage of your naivety as a child because he wanted sex. I am just barely coming to terms with the fact that I was victimized for four years by an older man who had the upper hand the entire time. It\u2019s messed with me a lot. And I thought that the past is the past, but seeing his face again made me realize how much this man hurt me. Seriously, go to therapy and just try talking about it. And dump your shitbag boyfriend.

I craved intimacy so badly but wasn\u2019t emotionally mature enough to find it in the right places. So I put myself through these hook ups and thought I was taking control of my sexuality and that I was so sex positive. But I was just lying to myself. I was using sex to replace actual intimacy and I was just fucking myself over. Because there was always inevitable that ONE guy where feelings just snuck up out of no where when I let my guard down. Of course these feelings were never reciprocated on the same level. Each time it hurt so bad but I always played it off as it was no big deal. Then around your age I spiraled out of control, used drugs and sex to cover up how fucking unhappy I was and ended up going to rehab. Honestly six months of no physical contact paired with having to finally face my problems killed any sort of cravings I had for the intimacy I was constantly searching for. I learned how to be with myself. Alone. Alone but not lonely. I\u2019m not in any relationships now (haven\u2019t been for about a year) but I feel ok. Sometimes I want to have sex so I go have it, but I make sure that I have it for the right reasons. That I\u2019m having it because I want sex and not using it as a replacement for real emotional intimacy. And there are times where I feel myself slipping into old habits so I have to proactively choose to stop it. I think you should just stop. Stop with the hooking up and maybe withdraw from the world a little bit to figure yourself out. The world isn\u2019t going anywhere. Boys aren\u2019t going anywhere. That\u2019ll all still be there after you\u2019ve taken some time for yourself. I needed years of therapy and medication to get to this point. I think everyone should go to therapy but I understand if that\u2019s not possible at the moment. I honestly thought of it as fast food.

After years of telling her he\u2019s holding her back, offering a place to stay if she needs, and hell, even offering money if she needed to leave him, she insisted on staying with abusive douchebag! I made myself very clear that I did not like him and thought the relationship was unhealthy and destructive. For the sake of the friendship we just both ignored the fact that I despised him, but it slowly became impossible to see her since he controlled who she could and couldn\u2019t see. When she asked me to be there for the wedding I was done. I just said \u201cno, I don\u2019t support this marriage. I\u2019m here if you ever need help\u201d and that was that... I think she left him but immediately hooked up with some other controlling deadbeat. I don\u2019t consider her my friend anymore. It hurt too much to be emotionally invested in someone bent on hurting themselves. People leave addicts for this same reason. She\u2019s codependent. He is literally her drug. And no matter how many times you offer help to help themselves, if they\u2019re insistent on continuing to use there is nothing you can do. I personally see being her maid of honor as the same as handing a heroin addict a needle. She\u2019s lost in the throes of addiction. I know it sounds over dramatic to be calling her an addict but her relationship with this man is very similar to an addicts relationship with drugs.

Personally, Reddit has everything I need in one site so for a while I didn't browse anywhere else. Then I realized how wrapped up I had gotten into it and all I could see was just fucking Reddit. A lot of these guys get stuck in the Reddit bubble and think that the regular sexism, rudeness, vulgarity, and all over douche bagness is the norm. Don't get stuck in the bubble. I did and I turned into a raging b*. I was cynical and dealing with asshole trolls every other day and finally I was like, I'm getting too wrapped up in this and it's affecting my actual life. So I deleted the app for a bit. So other than the usual things of being a good person (being respectful, tolerant, kind, etc), you gotta stay self aware and don't stay in the Reddit bubble.
