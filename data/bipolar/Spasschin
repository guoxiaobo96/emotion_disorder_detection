You know there are actually hormones out there specifically engineered to act on some receptors and not others?

I'm only still replying to this because I have absolutely nothing better to do in between classes. I'm assuming you're telling me you're a trans woman and I can't possibly see how you took offense to anything I said above unless you're picking and choosing what you actually read in my replies. My response was 100% about nb biological men and I know you knew that when you replied. The point being made was that nb people do not want to be seen as men or women, it's absolute fact that estrogen doesn't do as much for biological men as testosterone does for biological females, meaning a biological female nb person going on testosterone at a low dose will still 100% eventually end up looking like a man unless they stop hormones (microdosing is not being discussed here because it IS harmful). Biological males who are nb who go on a low does of estrogen will most likely never end up looking like a woman because there's a lot more involved in transition when you're a biological male taking estrogen. Even trans women have to do more than trans men to pass so a nb person who is biologically male will not take those extra steps to look female which means they will never have to worry about looking like a woman. I didn't say a single damn thing against trans women so get off that. &gt; This is laboring under public misconceptions. I use transgender, because the term 'transexual' makes my skin crawl. People associate you with Frankenfurter immediately, or with any one of a huge number of phobic-as-shit media portrayalsI truly snorted out loud when I read this shit. How old are you to think that anyone today hearing the word transsexual will automatically think of fucking rocky horror picture show. Most these days dont evn have a clue as to what that is unless theyre in a very specifc group and people 30 and older that do know what it is probably have never seen it or didnt enjoy it enough to have that as their sole reference to the word transsexual. You're more likely to encounter people who think of silence of the lambs before rhps. Both references are absolutely fine anyways seeing as one was a cross dressing alien and the other wasn't even a trans woman, he was just a serial killer and they even make that clear in the movie and book. You're just reaching at this point and I seriously think you should stop to stretch before you pull something.

If a biological female nb person goes on testosterone they will end up looking male eventually, even if it\u2019s on the more androgynous side and a biological male who goes on estrogen will honestly probably end up still looking 100% male because they don\u2019t feel the need to put in the effort trans women do in order to pass as female because they aren\u2019t female. That\u2019s just how it is, you can\u2019t start binary hormones and expect that to make you nonbinary.

A certain amount of \u201coh you identify as a tree?\u201d or \u201cyou use emoji pronouns?\u201d will make anyone resent the internet fad. Yes transphobic people will always be transphobic but this specific brand of transphobia has gotten worse the bigger tumblr genders become. A lot of binary trans people find it insulting because the only way for those genders to be valid is for them to just be a fun identity or label with no real biological basis. You can not biologically be a tree or a star, you can like trees and stars but that is your personality, not your gender. When you compare that to binary trans people who have biological factors causing their transness, tumblr genders do just seem very silly. As I said before, I don\u2019t really care what people do or what they call themselves but I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t find it annoying that those people are considered to be the same type of person I am.

For example, someone had recently come out who was considered an adult and they decided they wanted to go to therapy to work through what they were feeling. The therapist told them they could either take this pill that would 100% guarantee their gd was cured or, they could transition however much they wanted which ultimately could lead to much of the same outcome. They would still get a choice but I can imagine transition would be less popular among trans people than it is now. I only bring this up because I feel like there\u2019s probably a lot of trans people who would want a guaranteed cure for their gd, especially if it was someone who either transitioned as felt no relief or decided not to transition because they knew it wouldn\u2019t be possible to ever be cis.

If so one way to really determine if your feelings about being trans are real is to completely isolate yourself from that. Don\u2019t go to online trans spaces such as this, don\u2019t look at transition photos, don\u2019t research transition, nothing. The internet is a very influential place and getting into a hole where you\u2019re really focused on the trans community and \u201ctrans pride\u201d will make you believe you\u2019re trans. It\u2019s hard to accept, when I was told this I didn\u2019t believe it at all but over the years I\u2019ve seen others do the same thing and just living life without seeing trans pride everywhere, successful transitions and people loving being trans made them realize they only liked the idea because most of the people online today make you believe being trans is the best thing anyone can ever be and that is false. It\u2019s a very hard path to take and transition of any kind isn\u2019t for everyone trans or not. The other bit of advice which is to picture yourself on an island all alone. You\u2019re the only person that will ever be on that island and no one else will ever see you. Do you still feel the need to be another gende or could you live on that island until you die without needing to be another gende If it\u2019s the last one, you\u2019re most likely not trans. Being trans isn\u2019t just social, it\u2019s not just disliking how others see you, it\u2019s genuinely knowing you\u2019re not meant to be your biological sex/gender regardless of what others see and it\u2019s absolutely needing to be the correct sex/gender in order to live.", "link_id": "t3_dyy1gd", "time": 1574237251}}

When I first came out as a teenager I went by Aiden because it\u2019s pretty much the male version of my birthname and then later, after a few years of trying out names online, I told my irl friends and family I was changing it to Sebastian because it fit with the names in my family more. Basically I told my parents by just coming up to them and saying \u201chey, I\u2019ve been thinking about this name instead, what do you think?\u201d And then listened to what they had to say. Over the course of a few months, they started using it more and after awhile it truly felt like I\u2019d never gone by anything else. I still think my original advice can help you out because you\u2019re young, by the time you\u2019re my age other names you like will have come and gone as well.

{"f44kh04": {"text": "So, I always like giving young trans people advice on their names because I struggled a lot with mine when I was just starting to transition as well. I changed my mind about my name about 4 times before I settled on my current name. My first bit of advice is to try your names out online in a space where people are understanding before you start using it in your daily life. What I mean by this is to join trans groups online everywhere they\u2019re available, Facebook has some really good ones where people do this often. Another bit of advice is something I had to learn the hard way and that is that we as trans people have been given the opportunity to start fresh. Oftentimes we think of this as sort of \u201cnew name new person\u201d which is fine but then, we throw in the freedom we have of choosing any name we want to and it can be difficult for a lot of people. We start coming up with multiple names we like, we narrow it down and then think that name is the one we will love forever only to find a new one a few months or a year later that we like more. The fact about this is that there will always be names we think of that we might like more than our current name but that doesn\u2019t mean we should change it every time. My name is currently Sebastian, that\u2019s my legal name and it\u2019s been legal for almost 3 years now, I still stop and think about names I may have liked better but, after 3 years I would never change it again. The point is that if you\u2019re set on changing it now, do it, you\u2019re early into your transition and you can get away with it. Spend a lot more time on it this time though, think about the future, think about what you\u2019re going to look like fully transitioned and 60, 70, 80 years old, think about if you\u2019d want adult you to have the name you\u2019re choosing. Consider all that and then test out the names in a space that doesn\u2019t really matter. Do this, choose your new name and then accept that there will most certainly be a time where you feel you\u2019d want something different, even if you continued you rename yourself over and over.
