From some quick google searches I\u2019ve gathered that the comorbidity rate is pretty high, but it\u2019s interesting and kinda cool to see how much I\u2019m not alone in this. Currently not taking meds for either due to insurance issues. Had a rough couple of weeks. Will likely have a rough couple of more at least. I was diagnosed ADHD about a year after BD2. First apparent hypomanic episode was triggered by bupropion; ADHD has been clear as day throughout my entire life in hindsight but no one caught it for some reason. Been frustrated about that lately. I\u2019ve felt really stupid my whole life because of my terrible memory, poor decision making, short attention span, and chronic procrastination. Depression has compounded those. Or maybe those problems have compounded the depression. It\u2019s hard to tell. I feel like if maybe the ADHD had been caught earlier I\u2019d have developed better coping mechanisms than \u201cjust try harder!\u201d but I understand that stimulants can possibly make the BD worse, and some meds for BD can make the ADHD worse to a degree, so it\u2019s easy to feel hopeless about the whole thing. I\u2019m really happy to see some of you have found relative success with your med cocktails/lifestyle changes. It\u2019s easy for me to get discouraged when I feel like my brain and a society that punishes deviation from the norm are conspiring against me.

I\u2019ve heard that mental disorders aren\u2019t generally diagnosable unless it distresses the patient. I also grind my teeth because of my obsession with symmetry and the number four (put pressure on the right side of my mouth once, do it twice on the left, then one more time on the right again). My gums are receding a lot faster than they should be as a result, which is a huge problem, and may lead to further problems down the road. I also feel the need to walk over cracks in the sidewalk in this same pattern or else I get unbelievably stressed. But just trying to make the pattern work with my normal stride takes a lot of mental effort. One time I found myself running down the sidewalk so I could reach each crack at the right pace. This doesn\u2019t cause me physical harm except for cranking up my anxiety. I try to skateboard everywhere whenever it gets really bad so I can glide over the cracks without thinking about my stride too much. If I were you I\u2019d ask yourself why do engage in your compulsions. Try going a few minutes, an hour, a day if you\u2019re adventurous, without engaging, and see how it makes you feel and where you feel that feeling.

In elementary school I got suspended once for snapping and beating up a kid who disagreed with me about a call in a game of pickup football we were playing on the field during recess. My parents were P-I-S-S-E-D. I remember feeling like a criminal being held in jail as I waited for my mom the pick me up from school that day. When it came to my grades, since elementary school until I graduated college just a couple weeks ago, they were either tanking due to my apathy or rising slowly because my parents found out about my shit grades and I had to fix them. The process of fixing my grades always went as follows:1) Parents find out2) Parents get mad and tell me to do better3) Parents take me out of extra-curriculars for at least a month, or until I get my grades upOnly on three or four occasions was I doing well in school for an entire term on my own volition. Why didn\u2019t I just clean up my act and do my homework or pay attention in class? I did! Until I stopped caring again and they sank.Then there were my older brother and sister who seemed to just snap at me for existing, which sucked because I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. In elementary school I eventually started assuming people were always mad at me, even if nothing was immediately wrong. I vividly remember walking down the hallway to class with the terrible feeling that I was about to get yelled at and I didn\u2019t know why. I was pretty sure I did something wrong, I just couldn\u2019t remember what it was. The reality was I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong but I was probably so used to somebody either catching me not doing what I was told or assuming I had done something wrong that I lived in a constant state of fear. My dad had a knack for getting mad at me for not doing my homework even if I was doing it right in front of him (he had the worst memory) and whenever my mom was angry at anyone in the house my twin and I learned one of the only surefire ways to avoid her wrath was to start cleaning our room or else she\u2019d chew us out anyone along her path.

I\u2019m definitely more the creative type but I\u2019ve always had a mind for science. But I\u2019m no scientist. For a two week period in fall of 2017 I filmed 22 of my friends\u2019 pupils dilate as they performed basic cognitive tasks. I was collecting footage that I would analyze at a later date. I\u2019d use my analysis to write a revolutionary paper on the field of cognitive pupilometry\u2014a field I know virtually nothing about. I\u2019d daydream about different experiments I could perform and form hypotheses instead of paying attention to my lectures. I\u2019d imagine myself getting the Nobel prize in physiology or something. I really thought I was breaking new ground, both personally and scientifically (lol). After those two weeks I got swept up in my junior thesis for film school, and five weeks later, after working harder on it than anything I\u2019ve worked on in recent memory, I crashed so hard that I started drinking again and stopped doing anything else. I really fucked over the people who helped me make my movie by telling them I\u2019d get really important things done like submitting the permit requests or finding locations, but instead I drank and stewed in my own BS. I had to take a medical leave of absence the following semester because of the depression. Even though I was pretty delusional about the pupilometry stuff, there was something really special about those two weeks. As someone prone to crippling self-doubt, suddenly becoming top-of-the-world confident made me feel like I had finally been \u201cfixed\u201d.
