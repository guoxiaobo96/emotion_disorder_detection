I believe that because the Meds helped me associate more the anger came back out. That may not be the case for you. But for me it was honestly empowering because anger at least has force behind it, it created a sense motivation. It was also a release as that was what the depression was covering for for years. If I remember correctly the anger was very intense for a few weeks and then went away, and now the meds leave me just feeling generally more stable. In my personal opinion if you do get angry, just try to take note of it and react accordingly. I had to remove myself from situations to cool off. An effective way to deal with anger is to move, so I would go for a walk and my head would be clear in 15 minutes and I could rationally discuss whatever angered me.

{"fqek1x4": {"text": "I read all of this. Firstly, I\u2019m glad you found us. I relate to you in a lot of ways, specifically in your feelings because our life experiences have differed. I know what you mean when you say you just thought something was wrong with you. I also felt that way and was incredibly relieved that it wasn\u2019t just the way I was always going to be. I\u2019m happy to see you\u2019re able to identify the true causes of your feelings. We behave based on feelings, based on \u201cprogramming\u201d - learned experience. And you started off on the wrong foot by no fault of your own. I cant imagine the pressure you felt to be \u201cthe golden child.\u201d I\u2019m sure your mom wanting you to fix your dad had at least a subconscious affect on you, too. Our society has unfortunately normalized trauma as a \u201cpart of life.\u201d What everyone seems to fail to understand is that normal does not mean healthy, and it doesn\u2019t mean acceptable. What you have experienced may be a common experience (even if you haven\u2019t met anyone who\u2019s been through things you have been through, there are tons of them out there) but it doesn\u2019t mean that it was \u201cok.\u201d It doesn\u2019t mean you just have to suck it up. What you\u2019re describing sounds like you have plenty of reason to consider this trauma. It\u2019s good to recognize the source, be more forgiving with yourself as you were a child and it was your parents fault. They did fail you. That being said, it\u2019s also important to balance that with a sense of understanding for them. Not excusing their behaviors but understanding they did the things they did not because of you - but because they had their own issues. I also heavily relate to the \u201csmart quiet kid\u201d the \u201cwell mannered\u201d kid who doesn\u2019t cause any trouble and the loneliness you\u2019ve been feeling. I\u2019m 21, have also missed out on pretty much every normal social experience I should\u2019ve had by now. It sucks. And when you\u2019re lonely, and have nobody to depend on and you finally have someone, it makes sense that we would become codependent. Of course this doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t try to work on this issue, but it has an explanation. I know for me I\u2019m in the current situation where I\u2019m also too codependent on someone. And I\u2019m aware I need a larger \u201cnet\u201d but it\u2019s hard to build that at this age - and especially so when every \u201cfirst person\u201d gets scared because of my intensity. You mentioned not knowing why you took your loss of friendship harder than what happened with your dad. And I think you answered it yourself. If I\u2019m wrong feel free to correct me as I\u2019m not trying to impose my view onto you, but take this as something to consider - your friend was your first experience with everything you were lacking as a child. All you knew was the pain your dad caused, it wasn\u2019t a big deal because that was \u201clife\u201d to you. But you had actual proof, not just promise or talk, that that\u2019s not all there is, and that the love you have always needed and deserved is out there. A good, simple way to explain this is you can\u2019t truly miss something you\u2019ve never had. You also mention feeling apathy at traumatic points in your life. In my opinion as we continually go through trauma after trauma with no support before or after, we learn that there\u2019s no point in expressing pain because it will not be attended to anyways. Sometimes holding it in is too much, and one way we could respond to that is by turning off. I\u2019d say that could have begun as a child and that\u2019s why you were seen as so \u201cwell mannered.\u201d That\u2019s how it was for me. I apologize if I\u2019m being overly presumptuous. Please know that I say these things aware that this comes from my personal experience and it may not be at all how you feel. That\u2019s okay, too. Regardless - I see that you\u2019re in pain and I\u2019m very sorry to hear you were treated this way. You aren\u2019t alone in your feelings and experiences. You are not what you\u2019ve been through. I know it may feel like these things are your fault, that you don\u2019t have any control over the past and inherently your feelings and behaviors. And you can\u2019t control the past but with time you can heal, which will help you have more control over your feelings and behaviors - and the first step is realizing what is real vs what you were taught, and the second step is reaching out which you\u2019ve done with this post. Unfortunately the hands we\u2019ve been dealt are very hard ones, we have been given a responsibility to raise ourselves - a responsibility that never should have been ours.

{"fpue6qr": {"text": "I hear you. I\u2019ll address firstly the whole remembering some things quite clearly and others fuzzily. That\u2019s very typical of trauma and I think it happens as your brain wants you to remember some things so you can avoid the danger in the future, but blocks out a lot of details that may not be as relevant or information that is *too* painful. I barely remember any of my childhood. What little I do remember were the times I was feeling a lot of pain.Secondly, you\u2019ve been through a lot, and you deserve/d better. I also have very complicated feelings concerning my mother but it\u2019s in a very different way than what you\u2019re describing you went through. What I\u2019ve learned is it\u2019s important to let yourself see the gray area. Yes, she did awful things and truly failed you as a mother what sounds to be most of the time. Thats on her. But as you said she did give some moments of warmth to you. That was the same person, and we are all capable of acting in such polar ways. You can miss her knowing she hurt you, and you can feel any type of negativity toward her knowing she did show love at some points. In the same vein - children\u2019s minds usually separate the concept of their \u201cmean parent\u201d and \u201cnice parent.\u201d It\u2019s almost as if they could be two different people to them. I\u2019ve found even in adulthood I\u2019ve experienced that. Loving my mom and idolizing her for the good she\u2019s done - completely ignoring her flaws, or only seeing reasons to hate her. Like I said, knowing that there\u2019s a middle ground might be helpful. She also was your mother. People are capable of developing attachments to captors, let alone the person they\u2019re biologically programmed to be attached to. I think for some people, even if their parent was nothing but abusive, they may \u201cmiss\u201d them in the way that they grieve over what they could have had. They miss the small moments when they did feel loved by their parent even if that was for unhealthy reasons. You can still feel loved by being abused. A parent is a parent and everyone craves their parents approval. Even if they go on to completely hate them, that\u2019s because they wish things were different, they wish they\u2019d been loved. I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t helpful or doesn\u2019t make sense. I was giving examples of my experience just in case you could relate, so I hope I didn\u2019t blab too much about myself.

{"fptsjpw": {"text": "Not saying you have to believe this of course, but my idea of god is less of an identity, and more of a feeling.

There is no objectively good and objectively bad. God, to me, is less of an over see and more of a common thread in us all. I think if we tap into that piece of ourselves is when we can find more and more peace in our lives. And if we all did it the world would be a better place, because we would all have more compassion for ourselves and one another. But the thing is love isn\u2019t forceful. So this part of us isn\u2019t going to claw through. We have to look for it. Love in my opinion is inherently neutral. Idk if this makes sense. I do consider myself agnostic because I could be totally wrong but this idea makes the most sense to me because I really do believe there\u2019s something more to everything. And it also doesn\u2019t make me awful when bad things have happened to me because my god isn\u2019t going to interfere. It just isn\u2019t. I have to access that mindset in me and do what I can in my situation to find peace. And sometimes that doesn\u2019t mean changing the awful circumstances. It means adapting, accepting. Because that is what love is. It\u2019s coming to terms. Sorry if this sounds woo woo... I admit I used to be but I\u2019m not now. I have a more scientific and biological way to approach this idea, too that cuts out the whole \u201cenergy\u201d talk.

It\u2019s often used to treat PTSD/trauma and I\u2019ve been in CBT for a few months now and I find it to be very helpful. My therapist is incredibly validating, gentle and sensitive to any triggers and how her behavior and language could affect me. And I think most CBT therapists would be trained in that way.

I think that\u2019s largely why I am not really angry at him. I know the source is truly that I need a wider support net as you said.The main issue focusing on him is that when I express the need for more support from other sources and making it clear I don\u2019t expect him to do it all - he still feels not good enough. It scares me because even when I tell him Im not saying he needs to fill those holes, it doesn\u2019t matter and we run the risk of him getting over whelmed and leaving. I don\u2019t have control over abandonment and those are both separately triggering. Anyways, that is just me venting again and I\u2019m sure you understand that. The solution is still that I need more support from other sources. That all being said it\u2019s a struggle in and of itself to find support. I don\u2019t want to just keep making excuses, but there are a lot of other factors in my life that make finding support very difficult. The specific factors don\u2019t matter because underneath it all I am held back by fear. I was raised to be afraid, and that on top of ptsd just makes taking risks impossible. I have a lot of trouble with accountability and responsibility, there are lots of things in my life I desperately want to change and I have the ability even if it\u2019s difficult. But my fear will always convince me why I can\u2019t. And I can logically know otherwise but it\u2019s never enough. As I said I\u2019m in CBT which seems to be helpful but I\u2019m starting to wonder if this really is just about forcing myself to do it even when I feel I cant. I don\u2019t want to make excuses. I feel my best bet is trying to take risks in baby steps but the pressure is difficult because I am in need of support pretty much asap.

{"fo8s63c": {"text": "Not everyone experiences all symptoms to a high degree. And there is a good chunk of people with ptsd who don\u2019t have flashbacks at all - flashbacks are rare. I went 7 years being misdiagnosed with just depression and anxiety when I actually have ptsd and adhd. I personally think it\u2019s partly because mental health professionals find it easier to say people have depression and give them drugs and depression usually isn\u2019t something you can completely heal from, because it is partly biological. Mental health professionals are just people, people with schooling, yes, but they still have room for human error. And not every doctor actually cares about their job. Secondly a symptom of ptsd is downplaying your own emotions. I thought everything I was feeling was just life and I had to suck it up, I was just weak - which caused my depression because living life in fear nearly every moment is miserable. But it turns out those were not normal feelings. And they\u2019re not part of depression but they were never properly acknowledged by both doctors and myself. I was a kid, too. In the environment that was actively traumatizing me - I got the diagnosis of depression and it made sense. (Actually it took me attempting suicide for any doctor to properly acknowledge I had depression.) I didn\u2019t question it because I thought I could trust the adults and doctors in my life, and nobody else did either until maybe a year ago. Also ptsd has ways of hiding itself. It often worsens when you begin to go to therapy and become more associated with your body. There are people so far removed from their trauma they not only don\u2019t remember but it primarily shows up in physical symptoms that are random and seem to have no cause. Because of this they\u2019re also likely to never even seek help in the first place. There\u2019s truly a myriad of reasons people would be diagnosed with depression instead of ptsd. And as I said depression is a symptom of ptsd so I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re entirely different. Quite frankly ptsd has a lot of overlap with things like depression, BPD.

Men are commonly seen as non monogamous, women \u201cweigh them down.\u201d Where women are supposed to settle in with one man. And women do often want that! Why do women have to be faithful If it\u2019s acceptable for a man to not be? At the end of the day there is no quantifying the pain cheating causes. Some women may take it harder, or easier than a man would. This isn\u2019t something you can make any definitive conclusions on. It\u2019s not fair to either sex. While I\u2019ve yet to meet a man who isn\u2019t more interested in sex than honesty or loyalty, I do think there are men out there who would be broken over their partner cheating. But I think most women - at least in my experience - want a monogamous, committed relationship. Why wouldn\u2019t we take it as hard as a man? If not harder? Cheating at the end of the day is telling your partner they weren\u2019t good enough. Nobody wants to feel that. When you enter a monogamous committed relationship and someone cheats, it\u2019s breaking trust within the context of what was supposed to be a sacred commitment. (I\u2019m not talking marriage.) It can be traumatizing in a way. There are people who get on for years having affairs before their partner finds out. I\u2019m sure many in that situation would not know what to believe moving forward. At the end of it, my point is that in the context of traditional gender roles, I don\u2019t see how that would be true. But the reality is everyone is an individual with our own sensitivities and needs and something like cheating will more often than not be painful to varying degrees, no matter who is doing the cheating and who is being cheated on. We\u2019re all people with feelings. Even if we don\u2019t want to admit that. And it does make me pretty angry that the act of a man cheating is considered to be acceptable to any degree. Especially when it\u2019s stated that a woman doing it is worse. Because we\u2019re women? A rose is a rose is a rose.

There is nothing wrong with you and just because you\u2019re not the one with cancer doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not impacting you. I have gone through very similar things. At 15 (I\u2019m currently 21F) my mom was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. I felt numb. On the outside I seemed to be doing great, I was doing the best I had in years in school. My social anxiety seemed to shut off. But emotionally I was completely shut off. Sometimes the pain is too much to handle in the moment and our bodies go into shock. It took me years to learn that pretty much the entire time between that period and present day I was living in shock. I am in trauma therapy for it now. Sometimes your body turns off and it waits until you feel safe to feel it. For me that\u2019s been in therapy, making the choice to look at it. But I\u2019ve also had 5 years between the event and present day. It might be hard to work through this in therapy right now because you may not feel it\u2019s over, and subconsciously your mind won\u2019t let you feel anything. I believe you don\u2019t feel anything or not much anyways. But there will come a time where you have the chance to feel what you are subconsciously blocking out. It is not easy, but I can say from personal experience it has released so much emotional pressure and pain. You are not alone, and this isn\u2019t just a form of trauma - it just is trauma.

It cemented to me that even if I was uncomfortable with it that I had to do it. And that\u2019s just not true. I was very young and what i had seen of oral just seemed degrading to me. And again i was young, hadn\u2019t even kissed a guy before him. I didn\u2019t want to have sex or anything because what 13 year old who\u2019d never even come close to it would? There are so many things about my perception of sex that were screwed up because of him, but I wont get into it. The boyfriend after that didn\u2019t pressure me but I did not like going down on him. I pressured myself because my first boyfriend made me feel that\u2019s where my worth was. I began to think it was just me, and that Id never like it. It sounds like the guys you\u2019ve dated are pricks. Head should not be a deal breaker if you truly love a person, or want to develop that with them. Especially if there are ways around it. My last boyfriend - I didn\u2019t go down on for almost a year. I communicated to him that it was something I felt very uncomfortable with and that I will do it on my own time. (I made it clear that I didn\u2019t want to be asked about it) Of course communication will only work if a guy is honest as to whether or not he can wait or just go without it. That partner actually said he didn\u2019t need it at all. And I think once I had that pressure taken off of me, it gave me a chance to feel free to do it when I was comfortable if I ever would be. I eventually figured out I liked it a lot. I still struggle with my perceptions of it though, and I\u2019d never go down on just anyone. I need to trust them. A guy should be willing to build that trust with you. Even if you never really like it, that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to. And my current boyfriend - he\u2019s made me quite fond of certain attributes I hadn\u2019t really been attracted to before. My point in that is I feel, again, a relationship should be about the connection with the person, not just their body. I think after that\u2019s established you begin to find lots of things to love about their body even if it might not have been an initial preference. A person should see ways to appreciate little things about their partner. And just because some guys act this way, doesn\u2019t mean that all guys will. Of course I know it won\u2019t change how you feel. Trust me, even though I have a very positive view of my partner, I struggle to imagine he feels the same about me. I definitely feel pressure - not from him - to be capable of certain things when being intimate. I know how hard it is, how much it can hurt to feel inadequate.

Everyone has some level of trauma, even if the thing that \u201ccaused\u201d that traumatization as a child seems insignificant now, or something that we\u2019ve all been through or just a part of life. We can dismiss painful things all we want but the fact is children are fragile, you can traumatize a child when you\u2019re doing everything \u201cright.\u201d A child could be traumatized by things in their environment outside of the home. Trauma doesn\u2019t always have to be this awful awful thing. Let\u2019s say a child is consistently exposed to media that makes them question their role in society, they eventually conclude something specific is expected of them. But what if that\u2019s not who they are or what they want to do? There begins an opportunity for the growth of self deprecation amongst other feelings that can lead to depression. And I\u2019m not saying everyone is walking around with something like ptsd, but I am saying everyone has trauma and that trauma may well lead to depression. There are countless factors in developmental stages that could lead to a child developing depression or some other mental illness. I also think the way society is currently structured is not how our biological minds are \u201cprogrammed\u201d to function. We live in a very isolating society, one which bases value on productivity when that is only one piece of the puzzle. People survived as a species by being communicative, by being social and brining together different skills from different people and creating a more powerful and productive society than one person would be on their own. We took care of each other. And I\u2019m talking about cave man days. Not only do I believe the environmental factor of depression exists, but I think it is far more common than it being genetics alone. Another thing about genetics - generational trauma exists. My grandmother had severe depression and so did my mom and so do I. While some of that may be genetic I also realize we have all dealt with very similar traumas that was passed down from my grandma to my mom then onto me. And I could explain what that looked like if you want more clarity. Im sure my grandmother probably had trauma passed on to her from someone in her life but I don\u2019t know enough about her life.

{"fi1red7": {"text": "So people tend to make the mistake of thinking that just because something works for them in a certain way that it should work for others in that way too. I am definitely guilty of that, but it\u2019s just not realistic. I understand suggesting she get some additional help but it can be super disheartening to hear someone say you\u2019re not trying hard enough. I\u2019m seeing two therapists and taking medication. Sometimes my boyfriend would ask what I\u2019m doing to get better and it would really hurt. He only understood when I asked him that question when he was expressing similar feelings of depression. Again, she\u2019s probably trying what she can. And if that is not enough for you you do have the right to leave. Emotional issues can cause people to treat others unfairly. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s an insult, but It sounds like it was said in an inappropriate way with malicious intent behind it. It sounds like she was upset and got defensive, being accusatory and you responded by being defensive. It takes a level of maturity to function in relationships where people are mentally unhealthy. And I can assure you a person can be mature and mentally unwell. If you do want it to work there are going to be times you have to be the bigger person if she won\u2019t. You\u2019ll have to notice when you\u2019re getting upset and try not to react completely from emotion. If you\u2019re not comfortable with what\u2019s going on you can tell her calmly and respectfully and ask for what is that you need. If she cannot give it, you don\u2019t have to stay. You\u2019re allowed to feel how you feel and so is she but as soon as both parties begin to react emotionally it can get really messy really fast. Someone has to put their emotions aside at some point and I do not think only one person should have to do that. Again, there has to be a sacrifice and compromise from both sides. I have been severely suicidal for a few years and i did attempt once. I am no longer suicidal (well anywhere near to where I used to be, and probably would never attempt again in the current state I\u2019m in.) When I was that suicidal i could not maintain a relationship, and my boyfriend at the time left me close to after my attempt. Whether or not she attempts again is not your responsibility. I know that that is hard, and again you do not have to put yourself through that. If you want it to work I\u2019m sure it can but it would take a lot of setting aside your own emotions for it. If I\u2019m being blunt - and keep I\u2019m mind I barely know anything about either of you or your relationship, but In my opinion I see some unhealthy reactions from both sides. In short, I think both sides have their unhealthy tendencies and it will take a level of conscious and committed compromise to make it work. And it\u2019s absolutely okay if you don\u2019t feel the level of compromise required isn\u2019t healthy or worth it for you.

However I don\u2019t think that means you have to take the emotional toll of this. You can talk to her about your fears. But her insulting you feels a bit extreme. I am 21f, my boyfriend is 21, and I have cptsd and consequently severe depression. Does it get in the way sometimes? Yes. sometimes we argue about it, sometimes it gets bad because we both are young and have to learn now healthy relationships work as we both never witnessed that. No matter how nasty things get I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever personally insulted him? Again theres been the occasion where things get pretty heated due to our issues but we always resolve them and apologize if necessary. I think the worst it\u2019s gotten is me being bitter because I am jealous due to trauma. And again, we talked it out even if it was hard at first. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any excuse to belittle someone for how you feel. You can be honest with someone if you feel maybe some irrational or selfish things, but a person should have the ability to understand the reality of it. I hope her intent was not to be manipulative when expressing gratitude, but it does being to cross a line when it sounds like you\u2019re responsible for her life.

You give that to your doctor, and you both talk about what accommodations you need. For me my place of work lets you come in anytime before 9, and as long as you get your 8 hours in you\u2019re okay. When I first started I was even allowed to make up hours within a week so if I worked 6 one day I could work 9 the next two days. Eventually I was told I couldnt do that when management changed and my therapist knew how hard work was for me and that I was out of sick time so she suggested it. There were days where I couldn\u2019t stop crying and my only saving grace was that my job is not a social one, sometimes I go days without talking to people. Anyways, our stipulations were I get 2 hours off of Monday, I tell me bossed about when I need time off for appointments and then if I have what\u2019s referred to as a \u201cflare up\u201d I am allowed to leave if I notify my bosses, no questions asked. Your HR person is the only one that is allowed to know about your condition - they can\u2019t ask you anything about it. Your job is also protected so you won\u2019t get fired no matter how much time you need. The \u201cdownside\u201d is that this is not paid leave. And some of the finer stipulations are up to the HR person to decide. For example, our hr person quit recently so she was replaced. The first one required I use any sick or vacation time I had left before I got unpaid leave. I asked more about this as my therapist explained I shouldn\u2019t have to use that. Again I\u2019d already been out of sick time but I didnt wanna use my vacation time. After that she mentioned a way to work around that. Quite honestly she wasn\u2019t very nice and I don\u2019t know why she was in HR. After she was replaced, the new person explained everything in greater detail and the first one had been flat out wrong about some things (it\u2019s too complicated to explain at once, if you have questions I can tell you about what I know.) but now my FMLA time off is separate from both sick and vacation time.

I am a 21 year old woman and when I was young (13/14) my first introduction to intimate relationships with men in the real world was with an 18 year old who told me of his rape fantasies and his favorite porn star who would vomit because of how hard she gave head. It ruined so much for me. I used to watch porn but as time has gone on I\u2019ve realized how not okay it is. How vile and degrading it is. Honestly I\u2019ve always known it\u2019s degrading but I was very much under the impression that I had to learn to like it. And even now, subconsciously it\u2019s engrained in me. There are things I do not want to happen to me that my boyfriend expressed mild interest in and he reassures me constantly that it doesn\u2019t matter to him. But in my head, I feel like I have to find ways to be okay with it. He seems to be one of the good ones. But like you said, no matter how sweet - we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing when they\u2019re alone.

I cut myself for two years and it did get bad. It started for attention. I was 13, too. People say its bad to do it for that reason, but it\u2019s a cry for help. If she\u2019s looking for attention, give it to her. She\u2019s expressing a need. The fact that she\u2019s told you means she wants help. She is cutting because there\u2019s another issue at hand, and until that issue feels not as overwhelming to her, she will still find a way to hurt herself if it helps her. Let her talk it out with you. I did not feel able to be honest with therapists at that age, either. I was so afraid of going to a hospital, or getting my freedom taken away. I also know that I didn\u2019t want to put in the effort into getting better. And if she feels that way, the only thing you can do is offer support. Over a few years I finally have decided to work to get better and I am. I\u2019ve still got some ways to go but it can get better. I have a therapist now, I\u2019m 21 and feel safe to tell therapists when I have urges to hurt myself. I hope she can reach that point sooner than i did. It\u2019s hard being that age. I hate to say it\u2019s just a phase. It may not be, but I know for myself although my pain was very real, I just didn\u2019t know how else to cope. And you begin to learn alternative ways to cope as you get older. So my cutting was really just a lack of resources to get help. Which was partly because I was so young. Try not to pressure her to stop. Unless she\u2019s really gashing herself deep, small cuts shouldn\u2019t be life threatening. If she feels pressure to stop, she might want to do it more. It is her body, and she can do with it what she wants - as scary as that is. Also, there is a difference between suicidal ideation and having a plan for suicide. A lot of people have suicide ideation, and it\u2019s to be taken seriously but it also doesn\u2019t mean a person would go through with it. A plan is dangerous, and if she\u2019s putting herself in immediate danger, tell someone. You are 16, please don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself to make her feel better. I\u2019m glad she has a sister that loves her so much. You can offer support But at the end of the day, your parents need to be the ones to provide the most resources for her.

And I\u2019ve gone on with my life too after some time. But part of me is stuck because I wasn\u2019t allowed to grieve over her for a lot of reasons. Maybe you didn\u2019t let yourself grieve completely, or maybe something else got in the way. Either way, healing trauma involves feeling the things you didn\u2019t get a chance to. Which sucks sometimes but you get to let go of things that are hurting you, like intrusive memories. Of course this is just my opinion based on the small perspective I have based on what you said.

{"fgjpruq": {"text": "No it\u2019s not weird to want a diagnosis at all!!! For me my diagnosis was a relief because - relating to what you said - it confirmed that these behaviors and feelings I have are a result of a condition rather than a defective personality. I\u2019d been in therapy for over a year and we never really discussed diagnosis, but in events earlier in my life I had been labeled with major depression and anxiety. My first piece of advice is to do your own research, but don\u2019t self diagnose. You\u2019ll notice a lot of diagnoses look and sound the same. It took me 21 years to be diagnosed correctly! I say that because as a kid I definitely displayed symptoms that were dismissed as a \u201ctroubled child\u201d thing. It was in puberty when I began to be crippled with depression that it was acknowledged that I might have a mental health issue, and even after that it took 7 years for me to find the right diagnosis. And I\u2019m not saying I jumped from diagnosis to diagnosis. I maintained that I had depression that whole time. It turned out to be something bigger. So like I said, research, don\u2019t self diagnose per se, but don\u2019t take just one doctors word as law. You can get multiple opinions if you don\u2019t feel it fits, use your own discretion. It always felt like depression wasn\u2019t enough of an explanation for me. I was right, but was not educated enough to know how to advocate for myself and ask the doctors the right questions about the right things. I know that sounds tedious and daunting. But the patience and effort will be worth it. Since you\u2019ll know what\u2019s wrong, and you can treat it accordingly. You don\u2019t HAVE to have a diagnosis to start healing, either. I encourage to ask yourself if there\u2019s things that have happened to you since you\u2019ve been born that might be causing you to feel this way. Or do you feel like this is purely a chemical issue? Go from there. That was a big factor that made me feel my depression was not just depression. Whichever it is I can near guarantee your personality is not what\u2019s at fault for how you\u2019re feeling. Your feelings and your thoughts are not representative of WHO you are, they are fluid. They can change. You are you. And that can change too, but a person is not defined by their conditioning, things out of their control. A diagnosis will depend on the doctor. You have every right to ask for an evaluation, and if they\u2019re not qualified they can and should say so. You can ask for a recommendation for someone who is qualified, or another opinion. I\u2019m in the US and from my understanding any mental health professional is at liberty to diagnose. My therapist and I never got around to it. I\u2019m not sure if she didn\u2019t want to or I just didn\u2019t ask. Regardless, how you\u2019re feeling seems completely normal and I\u2019m happy you are thinking about getting help. I hope it goes well, and don\u2019t give up because I promise there are answers out there. In short, I recommend research, advocating for yourself, asking for multiple opinions and the understanding that a label, while it has value, is not the end all be all.", "link_id": "t3_eyvp3k", "time": 1580848986}}

I was recently diagnosed but prior to that I was told I had depression, and have always been interested in psychedelics. I did heavy research into it and my goal is to try mushrooms and lsd, and possibly ayahuasca. It does scare me a bit, but I also know and have heard bad trips are often the most insightful. I am only 21, with minimal connections to anyone who would have any of these substances, as i don\u2019t really do anything of that sort. That being said I\u2019ve still done my research and have tried a low dose of mushrooms and it wasn\u2019t super intense but I definitely had some insight into myself and can totally see the potential to help heal trauma. The link below is to a vice documentary you might\u2019ve already seen but in it the man who runs these trips explains that it often isn\u2019t a \u201cfun\u201d experience. The goal from my understanding is to show ourselves our shadows, the darkest parts of ourselves so we can understand, forgive and heal them. My hope is wherever you\u2019re taking ayahuasca there are people who can make sure you\u2019re safe, because even if it\u2019s unpleasant you\u2019ll still probably get a lot of insight and no matter how awful you feel you will be okay. I\u2019m sure you know psychedelics have been used to treat ptsd effectively, I\u2019m pretty sure specifically with veterans.

{"fg4vtc0": {"text": "So a few things! 1. Therapists can\u2019t prescribe medicine. 2. If your therapist is a good one, they would only recommend medication to you if they felt it was necessary. Most good therapists should work with the boundaries patients set. You absolutely don\u2019t have to take medication. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve been severely depressed for 7 years and always felt deep inside that I did not need meds to improve. I didn\u2019t believe they would help me. For maybe 4 of those years I didn\u2019t really care to improve anyways. But even in the past three years, wanting badly to feel better and willing to put in work - i saw a therapist and I didn\u2019t want to take meds, so it wasn\u2019t in the conversation. Part of my stance was it didn\u2019t feel like my depression was just from unbalanced chemicals, it felt like my depression \u201cmade sense.\u201d As I put it. (Meaning I, like many others with \u201cdepression\u201d had a bad childhood.) I certainly made a ton of progress in those years without medication. A few months ago though I hit a wall that I could not seem to overcome, partly due to circumstances I currently can\u2019t change such as where I live. It was then after a lot of thinking I realized I needed more help than what I was getting from my therapist. Because while she helped me improve a lot, she couldn\u2019t give me the energy or the motivation to get things moving in my day to day life. I finally decided to see a psychiatrist (which it wasn\u2019t the first time, as a minor I was told many times to just medicate myself, and was given medication.) But just talking to the psychiatrist helped. She and I both had the belief that medication is not a cure all, that it is a temporary tool to help give you the energy you need to do the necessary work to heal yourself and your life. And it\u2019s because of this that I know I won\u2019t ever end up relying on my medication. This psychiatrist also got me in contact with an additional therapist who focuses on trauma. The medication has helped me a lot so far and I intend on going off after a while. I\u2019m glad I didnt dismiss it as an option for myself, even though in the past I had been adamant I didnt need it. My point is, regardless if you have strictly a chemical imbalance or if your depression \u201cmakes sense,\u201d I would encourage you to not dismiss it as an option whatsoever for all time. I completely respect that you don\u2019t want it now, you absolutely do not have to take it. If you feel that\u2019s what\u2019s best, you probably know yourself better than anyone else. But if there\u2019s ever a time where you start to consider it because you need extra help, there\u2019s nothing wrong with reaching out for help in a way you never had before. This is coming from someone who above all else would strongly encourage therapy before deciding to take meds. Do what\u2019s right for you!

{"fg2gb8q": {"text": "I see some parallels in your story with mine. It\u2019s mostly different but the big things are 1. I lost this person 5 years ago. 2.

I did have a few things happen to me that reflected the loss that did begin to trigger the grief around 17/18. I am 21 now and it was just a year ago that I truly started to look at my grief. I have cptsd in part because of this loss, so I\u2019m seeing two therapists - one specializing in trauma. Regardless of if you have a certain diagnosis or not, my belief and my practice with my main general therapist is that if it feels significant in that week, then we\u2019ll address it. I think repressed feelings come up as you\u2019re ready to handle it. I personally think expressing my grief to my therapist has been really important. It\u2019s up to you if you want to or not. To answer your  main question - I think for a lot of people who don\u2019t get a chance to process the loss right away or don\u2019t get adequate support - they find themselves almost retroactively experiencing the pain.

Don\u2019t feel obligated to respond or anything)) I see two therapists a week, I think I do a good job of not making him my therapist and just requesting support. As really all I want when I\u2019m upset is to not be alone. I think things get sticky though when there are problems within the relationship itself. Right now I just ignored I suppose, like he brings stuff up that he knows bothers me deeply at very bad times like when we\u2019re at work and can\u2019t discuss it face to face. I don\u2019t expect him to filter everything he ever says, but I do think there\u2019s a time and a place for things and while we\u2019re at work just seemed inappropriate for him to bring it up. I got upset and he could tell but when he asked about It I responded childishly because I\u2019ve noticed this pattern of being so incredibly upset and having a genuine inability to know how to express it in words for a while. But in that time frame I\u2019m not able to continue on as normal. I have to sit and be upset. He gets frustrated when i don\u2019t tell him how I feel right away when sometimes I don\u2019t even know, I just end up being snappy or sulking until I figure it out. So I ignore him until he asks if we\u2019re not talking, and I say I don\u2019t want to when really i do but I cant 1. Because I don\u2019t have the words and 2. We\u2019re at work and it\u2019s not appropriate. And I absolutely hate myself for acting that way, it\u2019s why i want to hurt myself. I mean am I 13???? And i know my emotional self makes his responses seem apathetic when really I\u2019m pushing him away. I have what I\u2019ve been told is a higher than average level of self awareness for my age (I\u2019m 21) but I\u2019ve just recently began to dive into healing my trauma and there are some times where my emotions absolutely refuse to let go of their grip on me despite what I \u201cknow\u201d is right. As I\u2019m talking through this and thinking of more adult ways to respond or pick up the conversation, my emotional self is just screaming to not let this go because he needs to prove himself. It\u2019s just a constant battle. I think the root of it all right now is that I\u2019m hurt he didn\u2019t have the consideration to bring it up at a better time, and I\u2019m hurt that he doesn\u2019t see why I\u2019m hurt about him bringing up said thing at all. (This doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d expect him not to talk about it all, just at a better time. It was like he was adding insult to injury.) We\u2019ve had a number of conversations about it in the past. And I\u2019m well aware both of these things could\u2019ve just been mistaken oversight on his part. You asked if he needs guidance and absolutely he does. I guess it feels like I\u2019ve explained it several times to him and he\u2019s still not grasping it which again isn\u2019t exactly his fault, I\u2019m aware it all boils down to what my trauma has taught me about myself. I want an apology, really. And an attempt on his part to understand what\u2019s happening better. I struggle to decipher what\u2019s reasonable for me to ask of him.

I\u2019d say it\u2019s up to you and your doctors discretion as to what you have (obviously.) But I think if these things are distressing to you and affecting you in any way similar as described in a ptsd diagnosis, it still matters no matter the label. My cptsd can be boiled down to a bully older brother and shitty parenting. But there are a lot of nuances in my childhood, and a lot of others childhoods that took a situation some people could cope with and turned it into something that felt horrifying and would stick with them.

I personally think trauma is defined by the person going through it. One thing I didn\u2019t clearly explain in my post was that I\u2019m not saying everyone had ptsd. But that sometimes their feelings, especially those strong and recurrent enough to be classified as something like depression or anxiety, may stem from trauma. I definitely feel ptsd is another beast than trauma alone. I also agree that people can come from good circumstances but maybe they\u2019ve ended up in not so great ones. Also, a parent could be doing everything right and a child can still be traumatized. I do think In those situations it would not be classified as ptsd or cptsd, but that the cause of their mental issues still comes from trauma. I have questioned why it is i have cptsd to both my therapists. Because my childhood wasn\u2019t \u201cawful.\u201d It certainly wasn\u2019t great but I\u2019m sure many people would brush off whats happening to me. I thought it was because I was weak, or less resilient. Regardless, one explained that when you have repeated traumas that are similar, it\u2019s harder to cope. In that same vein, my other therapist explained people are more likely to develop ptsd when they lack support after the trauma occurs. Nobody ever noticed my emotional distress and so the cause of my distress was never changed and I never got the support I needed when I would go through it. I appreciated their input as they both have some trauma experience (one is literally a trauma counselor.) it made me feel like it wasn\u2019t so embarrassing to have this diagnosis when my trauma didn\u2019t seem to be \u201cbad enough.\u201d Since as you said, lots of people walk away relatively okay, or just fine.

Some professionals are wrong. Some people don\u2019t spend enough time to look at all the factors of why someone is feeling a certain way. It\u2019s easier to say someone is depressed and give them meds. Sometimes even professionals aren\u2019t experienced enough to identify certain things.

I\u2019ll say I can see his point in this lesson, but I feel your implication was that you feel you\u2019re being punished because perhaps you\u2019re not being \u201cgood.\u201d Forgive me if thats an incorrect assumption. But even though I know you don\u2019t believe in god, (I don\u2019t either obviously) I think especially still being in school, someone who is supposed to be teaching you is implying certain things on impressionable people. Impressionable minds can take god out of the equation if that doesn\u2019t fit their story. They will hear whatever their brain wants them to. I definitely think some cases of depression are \u201cbad luck.\u201d A mix of genetics and a random chemical imbalance. But I do believe some cases are part of a bigger issue. Sometimes, people are born into situations they have no say in. Sometimes, these situations teach people at a very young age very skewed perceptions, that cause a lot of pain. Like \u201cyou\u2019re experiencing something bad because YOU are bad.\u201d And you\u2019re not. Bad shit happens to good people. Good shit happens to bad people. I don\u2019t disagree that when someone commits truly harmful acts they are not doing so with a healthy mind. But even then, at the end of the day - hurt people hurt people.We are animals with biological programming. Sometimes this programming glitches. In a lot of ways our hardware has not caught up to our software. And this has caused a lot of problems, even though our software has a lot of potential. This isn\u2019t about god. It\u2019s about our brains. It\u2019s about our biology. And believe it or not, our emotions serve us the way our bodies do. Sometimes our feelings/brains don\u2019t work the way they should - the way sometimes our bodies don\u2019t always work the way they should. Psychology is something I feel we don\u2019t understand anywhere near as well as physiology. Also, You don\u2019t gotta be grateful for anything. I definitely think gratitude is a helpful tool and can improve mood but not when it\u2019s forced. If you\u2019re not grateful for anything, that\u2019s okay. Like I said. There are a lot of things we didn\u2019t ask for that we go through - especially as kids/young adults. I\u2019d say work on identifying the cause of the depression.

In situations that spark intense emotions it\u2019s undoubtedly crucial both parties take responsibility for their feelings and actions. But also should come to a compromise. I didn\u2019t make my boyfriends mom feel bad, I wasn\u2019t even mad at her. I just asked that next time if she sees food she knows isn\u2019t hers, she asks before eating it.

I was quite spiritual for a while and I had I think one dream in which I suspected a possible visit. All I remember was she looked a bit younger, and she was wearing a beautiful dress and her hair and makeup was done. She was beautiful. And she was happy. Every other dream I had for years was either her returning from some unknown vacation or something. I can still feel the excitement from those dreams.

Even if it wasn\u2019t 100% her. As time has gone on and I\u2019ve had to begin to really process her death, I\u2019ve had some awful awful nightmares.

{"fdkjusb": {"text": "That\u2019s not the point of medication. I highly recommend seeing a therapist in tandem with medicine. Medicine, in most psychiatric cases, is used so you are able to make the proper mental progress to where you can be functioning and happy without the medicine. I am 21, I\u2019ve had severe depression since I was 13, most of those years I spent daydreaming of Killing myself. At 17 I attempted. This entire time I was resistant to medication not even because I didn\u2019t want to get better but because I thought I could get better on my own. For a few years after my suicide attempt I did get better but at 20, my progress slowed and I finally decided to try medicine. I saw just a therapist for over a year (and definitely made progress in that time) before making the decision to get medication. I now see two therapists and a psychiatrist. In my opinion Medication should rarely be used as a life long fix. I decided to make the choice because I needed more help and recognized that. I don\u2019t intend on taking it forever, but it\u2019s only been a few months since starting and it\u2019s been important in my progress. It won\u2019t fix everything. But the idea is that meds give you the ability to function a little better so you can have the opportunity to work on the emotional stuff that\u2019s going on- that normally impairs function - with your therapist.

If I\u2019m upset about getting a \u201cright gift\u201d from anyone else it\u2019s usually bc i get upset when people waste money on me and i wanna avoid that. Like if someone bought me a tv when i don\u2019t watch the tv. I\u2019d say thank you so much but save your money. Which might be rude but i don\u2019t think that\u2019d happen with anyone i wasn\u2019t already close enough to to bring that up with.I get people are imperfect. I just wish people were more considerate about if they\u2019re actually capable of caring for a child. My dad was emotionally absent. Yes he\u2019s human and I cant expect perfection but he agreed to be a dad without considering what that entails, and he wasn\u2019t a good one. He wasn\u2019t awful and i love him and am grateful for him. But I\u2019m just recently realizing In what ways my childhood has hurt me, since It\u2019s something I\u2019ve mostly forgotten. I know I\u2019m an adult now, but my emotional self is still evidently quite immature and I\u2019m learning how to navigate that.I cant explain how much this isn\u2019t about anything tangible, I just want him to care. He could give me a post it note saying he loves me. That would feel more personal to me. I am starved of affection and support. I know he will never be my mom, he\u2019s not my mom. My mom had her share of flaws too. I think my expectation of him is just to be a parent. But He\u2019s only ever been my parent financially. That is literally the extent of it. And he\u2019s always explicitly expressed that\u2019s his only role as a father. I wrote a novel of a post and still don\u2019t feel I accurately conveyed the extent of his indifference toward me. I\u2019m not expecting him to change, I\u2019d say I\u2019m not expecting anything anymore. I\u2019m more so just wanting the right to be sad about what I\u2019ve lost and the fact that my dad doesn\u2019t meet my emotional needs. I agree with you, being upset over it and having expectations won\u2019t fix anything. But i do feel a need to process what I\u2019ve felt, as i was never allowed to as a kid. My feelings didnt matter. So maybe that\u2019s why what I\u2019ve said comes off as juvenile. I think this is partly me finally regurgitating all the hurt. Im admittedly not in the place where i care enough to get to know his girlfriend. I hope to be moved out soon. I am somewhat closer to my dad, but even now he\u2019s said things that make me feel completely unable to open up to him. Point is, it\u2019s clear to me there does need to be distance even though i wish there didn\u2019t need to be. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m hurting over and expressing. I feel incredibly alone in everything since my mom died and I do feel parents have a responsibility to be parents. This all does revolve around my diagnosis, too. So it is very hard for me.

I do think being isolated from people outside your family is actively NOT good. It sounds like it was numbing for you, and I totally see why having the pain of someone feeling something toward you would be desirable. But neither situation is optimal, or fair. People need to grow up with some sense of community outside of their family, it\u2019s important to be exposed to diversity and learn how to coexist. It\u2019s important to get opportunities to make mistakes. But parents should also not let their children do whatever they want. I feel I\u2019m ranting at this point.

One thing I\u2019d like to mention is just because someone has it worse than you doesn\u2019t mean your pain isn\u2019t valid, or intense. What I usually say is that just because \u201ckids are starving in Africa\u201d doesn\u2019t make you less hungry. On another note, I\u2019ll point out that the fact that you\u2019re at a point where you can say \u201cI need change\u201d is important. Whether you consider yourself to be at rock bottom or not, I know in my experience it took me being tired of hurting to want change. And it came. I think the first step is asking yourself what you want and need. What kind of change you\u2019re looking for. I\u2019m not sure if you meant therapist vs psychiatrist (because psychologist is basically the same thing as therapist) but if psychiatry was on your radar, I\u2019d recommend start with therapy. If you believe you\u2019re struggling with trauma (regardless of having PTSD or not) then you might want to look into a trauma specialist. If you just want help taking some first steps, any general therapist I think is a great, straightforward first step. And it\u2019s at that point where you can ask yourself if you need additional help (like a trauma specific therapist or psychiatrist) and consult your therapist. I started off with a holistic therapist. (she is still properly certified and she follows scientific evidence. When i say \u201cholistic\u201d it\u2019s because she is willing to consider any option you might feel works for you as long as it\u2019s healthy.) She looks at everything going on for me, my day to day or my past that is haunting me. Sometimes we do trauma work (usually through hypnotherapy which is similar to emdr, something a lot of trauma specific therapists use.) sometimes we talk about my week. After a year of seeing her, I added psychiatry and now I\u2019m going to start seeing an additional trauma counselor.Also, if you can think of long term goals you want to achieve, break it down and ask what habits can you start to develop to get you closer to those goals.

I am in therapy currently and have started medication and seeing a psychiatrist but it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s helping enough in regards to my cptsd. I\u2019m not aware of many resources to help target these issues.", "link_id": "t3_e8mb18", "time": 1575958610}}
{"facg678": {"text": "It seems to me they\u2019re just looking for someone to listen/ show some empathy or understanding. Which I feel that\u2019s what friends are for. You\u2019re right, friends aren\u2019t therapists but I think there\u2019s a difference between asking for support/someone to listen vs someone to try to help and advise the situation. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s inflicting anything on others to talk about it, if you ask someone explicitly what they\u2019re comfortable with. At that point it is in their hands to set boundaries with what they\u2019re comfortable with or capable of handling.  And even with the friend, I still see the value in just expressing it. Some people just want to be heard, though that\u2019s totally not for everyone.", "link_id": "t3_e8hdld", "time": 1575938861}}

For me I will notice clear connections to what\u2019s arbitrarily occurred in my life that day, as well as some creative liberties my mind might take that I may find unpleasant. I think dreams are a way of filtering what\u2019s gone on consciously and subconsciously for someone recently. I think if you\u2019re progressing \u201con the surface\u201d there\u2019s some gears underneath starting to shift, and would maybe cause the night terrors. But I definitely understand your fear, and if your guts really speaking to you that you\u2019ve got more to work on, that stuff will make itself known when it\u2019s time to work on it. If you want to go looking for it, maybe writing it down could give you a new place to process the dream as well as let you put the weight of it somewhere else.
