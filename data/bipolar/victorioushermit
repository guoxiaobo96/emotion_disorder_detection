I also understand, though, that my diagnoses are subject to change depending on how my symptoms present themselves over the course of my lifetime, and as my needs and priorities change. So I've also directly inquired about the accuracy of my diagnoses when I notice that something seems off about how my symptoms are presenting. Some people, though, don't handle knowing their diagnosis very well.

This is simply a matter of how people and their needs differ, not in any way a judgement of those needs.If you want/need to know your diagnosis to better progress in your treatment you should ask your psychologist directly. They may want to have a conversation with you about why you want to know and what you hope to gain from knowing it, but they should also be open about your diagnosis and how they determined it to be most accurate. Feel free to ask any questions you have regarding it, for example how this impacts the treatment they've been providing you.

It's pretty common with schizophrenia to experience the full range of emotions but have a flat affect that people interpret as lack of care/emotion. There's not much we can do about that, though. That said, it doesn't sound like there's a very healthy dynamic in your relationship. Relationships are supposed to be two way and really only work if there is open communication. It's clear that you don't feel like your needs are being met, and from the sound of it he may not be gaining anything from it either. In general I don't recommend trying to \"train\" your partner to do anything he isn't willingly on board with. That's a recipe for disaster and resentment later. It sounds like you have an idea of what you want from the relationship, so it's time for you to evaluate your boundaries in the relationship. Work these out before speaking with him, it helps prevent you from getting emotionally swept up and losing focus. What are your wants and your needs (both are valid) that he should be providing? What are you and aren't you willing to give to the relationship? At what point do you walk? Once you've figured these things out, you need to sit down and talk with him about it. He may not be able to engage with that conversation when you first try to approach him, but you can communicate that it's important and it's on him to then tell you when he's ready to have that conversation. I recommend setting a hard deadline for that, rather than letting it fall off and never happen. Communicate consequences that will follow if he doesn't bring it up. If he's not willing to have that conversation at all then that tells you something important about your relationship, too. A good way to communicate is to not make accusations or statements of blame. Ask questions. Maybe he doesn't realize how his behavior is making you feel. Maybe he doesn't even realize he's doing it.  When you make statements format them like, \"when you do \\_\\_\\_this\\_\\_\\_ it makes me feel \\_\\_\\_this\\_\\_\\_.\" Unfortunately he may lash out anyway.

{"fpx07m9": {"text": "While what you experienced does sound like psychosis, if your only symptom was hallucinations then you probably don't have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. A diagnosis of schizophrenia requires you to present with multiple psychotic symptoms. There are a number of psychotic disorders other than schizophrenia, and it may also be that you were experiencing a single episode and will never experience psychosis again. Antipsychotics are prescribed for a number of reasons. Obviously, by the name of the class of drugs, they are used to treat psychosis, which is a symptom that can be caused by a number of psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, PTSD, anxiety, BPD, etc. Sometimes they are also used to treat conditions such as treatment resistant depression, severe anxiety, OCD, tourettes syndrome, insomnia, and many other conditions without the presentation of psychotic features. So if you weren't told that you have a diagnosis of schizophrenia you should tell this to your current mental health provider. In answer to your questions:1) Yes. The themes of hallucinations and delusions tend to be heavily influenced by the person's culture, and some people have generally positive or neutral hallucinations.2) Schizophrenia is a lifelong condition. Not all psychotic disorders are, though, so it's possible that you may be dealing with only a single incident of psychosis.3) It's possible to only have hallucinations in a psychotic episode. From what I know, and I'm NAD, this is more commonly seen in conditions like mood disorders that are presenting with psychotic features than with psychotic disorders. I wrote that without understanding your question. Some people only experience psychotic symptoms during a psychotic episode, yes. While others experience some degree of psychotic symptoms persistently, with them increasing in severity during an episode. 4) This is a hard one to come to terms with. The short answer is 'you just do because (for some) life with psychosis is worse than life without it.' You'll find your own way to accept it, and eventually they'll become the new normal for you. Or they won't and you'll stop taking them (I do take meds, but I understand why many people don't or stop taking them). I do recommend looking up the side effects of your medications, though. Some of them can be really scary, but it's important to be able to recognize when you start to experience one of the more difficult or dangerous ones. For instance, you should watch for signs that indicate that you're starting to become diabetic and tell your doctor if they're happening. Some people don't really experience bad side effects, and some do. It's really a toss up. Don't let them scare you off, but you should be aware of the risks involved.

It's scary to know that your condition may significantly deteriorate, I've been there too, but your prognosis is not you and doesn't dictate what will actually happen to you. Some people are able to improve their prognoses through the decisions they make and how much success they're able to achieve with treatment. And some people aren't able to improve (despite whatever attempts are made), but they also never experience significant deterioration. And, yes, some people experience significant deterioration.

You unfortunately can't convince someone with a delusion that the delusion isn't true. When I'm experiencing delusions I find it helpful when the person I'm with validates my experiences, \"I know this feels very real and scary to you...\" before challenging it, such as \"...but this doesn't sound right or true to me.\" But it's different when you aren't already aware and haven't accepted that you have a psychotic disorder. In that case, as you've experienced, a number of problems can come up, such as them suspecting that you're taking part in the delusion or are an enemy, and (especially) the delusion becoming more complicated and fixed as they explain why their delusion is real and true. Basically you start thinking more specifically about all of the reasons it must be true, so it becomes much harder to get rid of the delusion when you finally seek treatment.

There are symptoms that can indicate you\u2019re in this state, such as extreme impulsivity in all things (financial decisions, sexual activity and sexuality, major life choices such as moving to another country with no notice), goal oriented activities (starting a LARGE number of creative projects, opening a new business, signing up for new classes, quitting and/or finding a new job), agitation, fast or pressured speech, not sleeping, low or high appetite, racing thoughts. Instead of an elevated mood, some people instead, or also, experience irritability or rage during mania. That\u2019s part of why I say it\u2019s a matter of high energy, because it\u2019s not always happy or positive. This state needs to last a minimum of 4 days for hypomania, and a week to be considered mania (unless it\u2019s severe enough to require hospitalization before then).

{"fkz5tos": {"text": "I can\u2019t say for sure but I can speculate. A bit of it is that there are outliers that sort of counterbalance each other: there is a group of people with late onset schizophrenia. Sometimes you hear from a few of them on this sub, but not often. But then the majority have an onset between their late teens and early 30s. Some people have an early onset but they remain unobserved by a doctor and thus undiagnosed for a long while. That can be due to a number of factors, including the person\u2019s insight into their symptoms, the relative severity of their symptoms, and how well they\u2019re able to cope and function to at least some degree so their condition doesn\u2019t become suspicious to others. And there is some debate among doctors about whether you record the onset of these cases from the stated time of onset (whatever age the person recounts themselves as being), or from the time they\u2019re diagnosed by a doctor (say, in their 20s or 30s). I think the main thing is that most doctors are unwilling to diagnose children and young adults. I\u2019ve heard several reasons for this, from: it takes a while to be certain the mind has matured enough that it\u2019s actually psychosis, to the severity of the illness and the stigma associated with it being too much to place on a child. I\u2019m sure there are others. But you\u2019ll hear a lot of stories about people who presented with symptoms, and their doctors waited to diagnose them until they were 16 or 18. That is bound to skew the numbersAnd then you have the people who were misdiagnosed before finally being diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder.", "link_id": "t3_flkplq", "time": 1584663434}}

The reason to withhold a schizophrenia diagnosis from someone is because it's been shown that in the short term there is usually a deterioration in functionality due to the stress of being diagnosed with a highly stigmatizing disorder. That's just in the short term, though. Overall it's still better to be transparent about the diagnosis. But to then tell her to not get a job doesn't make sense. You withhold the diagnosis to prevent a deterioration in functionality. Telling her that she can't have a job without even trying is itself holding back her ability to function. It's true that stress is difficult to manage with schizophrenia and can trigger episodes. But it's possible for some people to have schizophrenia and still maintain a job. It's not easy, but it's doable. My psychiatrist is very supportive of me having a job because overall it's better for my mental health to have the structure in my daily life. I do need workplace accommodations to maintain my job, but she is more than willing to help me get and keep those, and my workplace is friendly to people with disabilities. It sounds like your sister is struggling with internalized stigma. It takes a lot to work through that. It will be necessary for her to do so in order to have a happy life. It's possible to have a happy, or content life with schizophrenia if your treatment goes well. But to do that she needs to be able to embrace her diagnosis instead of internally rejecting it and expecting others to reject her for it to. Some people will reject her because of it. Those people are shallow assholes who can't see past a diagnosis to the actual person. They're not worth the energy to fret over. But to come to terms with all of this she needs to socialize. It's really the only way to see that there are people out there who won't judge her for her diagnosis, assuming she even tells her she has schizophrenia.Good luck with everything.

{"fjnohfw": {"text": "Sometimes it's difficult for doctors to tell the difference between severe mania and psychosis, so it's not unheard of for someone who is bipolar to be misdiagnosed with a psychotic disorder, or vice versa. Psychosis is a symptom that is composed of other symptoms. It often accompanies an illness rather that being an illness in and of itself. It includes the symptoms of delusions and hallucinations, and sometimes catatonia, disorganized speech, and disorganized behavior (although these last three are more often associated with schizophrenia spectrum disorders). Mania doesn't always include psychosis. It is a heightened level of energy and euphoric affective state that can affect everything you experience and do. You start to become incredibly impulsive and make dangerous, sometimes life threatening or illegal, decisions; you become hyper sexual and hyper social; your thoughts race, sometimes too quickly for you to track; usually you stop sleeping or start sleeping for very short periods; your appetite might change; you might talk or move very quickly and agitatedly; you take on multiple new tasks at once. All of these are indications of mania. Sometimes mania is accompanied by psychosis of any degree of severity, from minor hallucinations, to total psychotic breaks. When you're manic your psychotic symptoms tend to reflect an elevated mood. You might experience delusions of grandeur and believe you are God, or a famous rock star. Hallucinations tend to similarly reflect a euphoric state. It is not uncommon for someone who is not manic but is psychotic to experience some degree of agitation, and disturbances in sleep cycles. And sometimes when you are psychotic you make decisions that are impulsive or, to others, unreasonable (although they tend to be internally consistent). For this reason there's the overlap I mentioned when I comes to misdiagnoses of bipolar disorder and psychotic disorders. Also, it is possible to have bipolar disorder as well as schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder. It's believed by some that there is a spectrum between the psychotic affective disorders and schizophrenia, although this is still being studied.Sorry for the long response.

Then an episode starts and I regret not acting on it sooner, so I try to just stay vigilant.Tips and tricks: \\-start identifying the initial changes that indicate a mood shift. Does your sleep pattern change? Your appetite? Do you suddenly start socializing more? \\-Pay attention to stress and triggers that may start a mood episode. Not all episodes are triggered, but in my experience many are, even by small things. \\-Also, sleep hygiene is essential. Make sure to get enough sleep every night.

There are some things that I think make sense to respond because they're easily accessible over the internet. Despite the class name antipsychotics are used for more than just treating psychosis. These days they're also used to stabilize moods, and some of them are prescribed to help quiet anxiety. They're even sometimes used to treat serious insomnia. I can't say for sure why your doctor prescribed you an antipsychotic, but if I were to guess, it probably has to do with helping to smooth out the turbulence you experience with your moods.  As to your questions:1. I don't know how common this is but it doesn't particularly sound like hallucinations. Most auditory hallucinations are experienced as hearing an external sound, not an internal one.2. This is definitely one to talk to your doctor about. Although the question with it is really how fixed these beliefs are. If they pass pretty easily and quickly without medical intervention they probably aren't delusions. And if you can in any way, to any degree, experience doubt about them or be dissuaded of them then they aren't delusions.3. This sounds more similar to dissociation than psychosis. As I recall, some degree of derealization is actually a pretty common with BPD. A lack of a solid sense of self is kind of a signature of the disorder.4. Drug induced psychosis isn't in any way an indication of a psychotic disorder. If you started experiencing these symptoms persistently for months while sober then the question of a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder might be raised5.

Having goals and working toward them is excellent, but you need to have a plan for if/when this causes a psychotic episode.

But to be trans it's more about gender euphoria, when experiencing gendered things feels good and validating, than the feeling dysphoric. I realized I was trans before I realized I was schizoaffective. After being traumatized by my psychologist and psychiatrist when I was a teen I avoided all therapy and mental health treatment until I wanted to transition, at 28. It was some time before I trusted my therapist enough to talk about my experiences with psychosis (although I didn't know that's what it was at the time). Also, some time before she saw me in a full manic episode.  I wasn't properly diagnosed by a psychiatrist until I was 32.Yeah, most children who experience gender dysphoria don't grow up to be trans. But being a tom boy, liking stereotypically masculine things, and identifying as another gender are two different things. For instance, I like the color purple, knitting, and baking (and I'm learning to sew), and I also have a very nice beard that I've chosen to grow because I find it validating (and I always wanted to be able to grow a glorious dwarven beard). I can't imagine what hormones you would give a 4 year old that are related to their gender. I mean, growth hormones, sure, but that's unrelated. Typically hormone treatments don't occur until puberty hits, at which point (with parental approval) the child is put on hormone blockers, which are safe for the period of time that they would be on them. They stay on blockers until they're old enough to decide whether or not they truly want to transition (usually 16-18 yo).

There are is a higher percentage of people who have mood and anxiety disorders than people with schizophrenia --although many people underestimate just how common SZ is.

People can understand the idea of feeling deeply sad (not to say that's what depression is, but it's how people think of it), or of being easily and deeply scared (same thing for this as depression, it's how people think of it). There isn't really an experiential framework for most people to understand psychosis or the other accompanying symptoms of schizophrenia. You've either had that break with reality, or you haven't. And that idea of losing your grip on reality, and your control of your responses to the world around you scares a lot of people. They don't want to identify with it because of that fear, therefore they can't empathize with it and rally for it. They don't want to consider the possibility that they might ever develop it, they're scared by the prospect of knowing someone with schizophrenia. This isn't everyone. There are some good people out there who care for us and empathize with us. But it's hard to make a movement in support of something that scares so many people and not have that movement be about curing or obliterating it. It's, in fact, the same problem seen in trying to create awareness about autism. The largest movement related to autism is Autism Speaks, which centers the experiences of the families of those who have autism, and focuses on trying to find a cure, rather than supporting and uplifting the voices and lives of those with autism. Do I want a cure for SZ? Many days I do. It's demoralizing, degrading, and degenerative over time.

In the DSM, which is the diagnostics manual used in the US, a diagnosis of schizophrenia (among other things) requires 2 symptoms, one of which must be either hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech, but the second could also potentially be negative symptoms, disorganized behavior, or catatonia. Usually there is some degree of disorganized thinking involved with schizophrenia, but I believe (NAD) that can be seen in sub threshold disorganized speech, or lowered cognitive function. That said, negative symptoms are extremely difficult to differentiate diagnostically from symptoms of depression. The distinguishing characteristic of depression is often considered a low mood, but it is also expressed as numbed or flattened emotions. For this reason some doctors would be hesitant to use negative symptoms to diagnose schizophrenia until they have an established relationship with their patient and have a better handle on whether there is an affective aspect to their situation, rather than it being more strictly a psychotic disorder", "link_id": "t3_f4hi9n", "time": 1581809184}}

I don\u2019t know if this will help you cope with your fears of being violent, but my therapist has reminded me that the one major indicator of violence toward others is a history of violence.

In terms of your doctor taking things seriously, some doctors are more aware that it\u2019s possible to maintain the ability to communicate while psychotic than others. It\u2019s not particularly common to maintain that degree of coherence, especially before being properly treated for psychosis. It took working with my doctor for months before she really became aware of how serious my symptoms could be while I could still communicate. For me, part of the issue is that my ability to communicate is actually seriously impacted by psychosis, but this takes the shape of my working vocabulary becoming significantly reduced, and an inability to stay on track while talking. If someone knows me well they\u2019ll immediately be able to tell the difference, but to others with whom I don\u2019t have a history it just sounds like I\u2019m a spacey person.

It is extremely difficult to begin to speak openly about psychosis. It is a vulnerability, and often demoralizing since, if we do have insight we understand that we sound crazy. That carries all of the weight and stigma that is imparted by our culture. And we come to rely on our providers to normalize this experience so we can better accept it, to better accept ourselves.

Also, many of the first generation APs have been studied extensively using modern techniques.As I said in another comment, though, it is really a problem that we don't and can't know the effect of being on an AP for a lifetime, since we're only now just seeing people who are in the later stages in life who have been on them for decades, and we don't have a control group to compare them to. This problem isn't exclusive to APs, though, because medicine as it is practiced today is very new. There are many classes of medications whose full lifetime effects can only be seen now, if that since so many are newer. Long term studies are considered ones that span 5-10 years, not 30-40 like you see with a truly chronic condition. Hell, the first and 1.5 generation of women on hormonal birth control have only recently reached the later stages of their life, and there is a significant increase in the rate of breast cancer seen in that group. You're right that it hasn't been studied through the most modern medical practices (or the most ethical, far from that), but we know what schizophrenia looked like before there were APs. And it used to be that we could expect to spend half-to-most of our lives in institutions due to the persistence of psychosis. I'm very concerned, scared even, by how little is known about the effects of long term use of APs. I want more and better studies about the effects of APs, ones that could hopefully provide conclusive answers about the permanence of cognitive effects of using APs, and their other long term impact.

But I try to keep in mind that the medications are the reason that being schizophrenic no longer means spending a lifetime in an institution. The first generation of APs practically cleared out the halls of the mental institutions, and after what study has been been put into it many of the meds are often better than those meds were. I would rather have the ability to have my freedom and the potential for better years than I would have being lost in psychosis. It also makes me really think of how new modern medicine really is. We're only now seeing the truly long term effects of spending decades, a lifetime, on specific medications because it really hasn't been that long since most of them have been discovered. And, like those medications, we're only now getting to the point of seeing the long term effects of APs. The problem is, because the medications are so effective (for many people, not all) it is considered unethical to withhold them from patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders. So we really don't have the ability to compare the course of those treated and those who haven't been treated with medications over that span of time like we do with many other medications.

[link](https://www.reddit.com/ So I'm going to copy and paste in what I wrote then:&gt;I guess I'd like it to be more common knowledge among practitioners that psychosis looks different from one person to another. Symptoms shouldn't be compared from one patient to another, but to the benchmarks of functionality the patient previously achieved in their life or expect of themselves. Some people with serious problems with psychosis can still have insight and be aware how off their thoughts and behavior are. It's less common, but some people can sound and be surprisingly lucid even while psychotic. This is especially true for highly intelligent patients. This doesn't mean their symptoms shouldn't be taken seriously, though, or they should be disbelieved.  &gt;  &gt;If I had known these things earlier I might have sought help much sooner, rather than waiting until I'd lost almost all functionality. I can lose access to approx. half of my vocabulary as I become more ill and still sound like a relatively normal person, albeit someone who will start talking about somewhat bizarre things. This has made it hard for me to access emergency services when I need them.Something I would add, though, is that trust and trustworthiness are paramount. It's incredibly difficult opening up about this stuff. It takes a careful balance of being  open to what we're saying so we don't feel invalidated, because what we're experiencing is VERY real, but also being a grounding person that we can rely on when we know our judgement is off. I have two people in my life who I trust enough to tell me when I'm delusional even when I don't know that I am, and one of them is my psychiatrist (who is also my therapist). Do your very best to be entirely open and honest (within whatever professional boundaries you have, obv), because this amount of trust requires that open communication. Don't hide things even out of a sense of benevolence, because many of us are sensitive enough that we'll figure out something is off (and some of us are already paranoid) and that will impact our relationship with you.Also, talk to us at the level we're able to communicate at. Some people need things to be broken down very simply in order to understand it and accept it. I need to feel like I'm not being talked down to in order to take what's being said seriously and actually act on it. So while one person may not want technical jargon, I do, if only because learning new things helps to give me something to grasp onto to claw my way out of the chaos in my mind.

It has nothing to do with the actual themes of the psychosis. Just like paranoid schizophrenia has nothing to do with paranoid themes in the psychosis, but is rather about whether the primary symptoms are hallucinations and/or delusions, rather than disorganization. Affective disorders (with or without psychotic features), from what I understand, usually are not accompanied by disorganized symptoms the way schizophrenia often is. Accusatory themes would be appropriate to depression in general, though.

But what you're saying is that because of that bad interaction it is acceptable for mental health providers, people who are supposed to understand those who suffer with psychotic disorders, to stigmatize these disorders and treat those who suffer from them as less than human. Stigmatizing language is used to dehumanize groups that you consider \"other,\" or \"lesser.\" But psychosis is a human thing. 1% of people have schizophrenia (and more than that have psychotic and schizophrenia spectrum disorders); 3% of people have bipolar disorder, about half of whom experience psychotic features; an estimated 20% of people with depression experience psychosis. That's a large population to shuffle off into \"institutions set up for these people.\" With how common it is, yes, it should be normalized, as much as any mental illness is normalized, including depression. It shouldn't be treated as something disgusting for which the person experiencing it should be blamed. Those who experience it shouldn't be treated as lesser people for their illness. They still have rights, personalities and opinions, families, everything that every other person has.  And too many people, our society as a whole, is too willing to file them as unimportant because psychosis is scary and inconvenient. Indeed, it's scary for those who witness it; the person experiencing it appears to be acting erratically, and it's as scary  to think that our understanding and experience of reality could be so easily compromised without our even being aware of it (in a comparable manner that someone who experiences dementia is unsettling due to their lack of awareness about their inability to recall their life and others). But it's been shown over and over again that when someone with psychosis is treated compassionately, with understanding and respect, they're not violent. The **same** statistics for violence has been observed among schizophrenic patients as non schizophrenic patients, including when you take into account socioeconomic status, and illegal drug use.The stigma against psychosis is real, and harmful. Removing schizophrenic people and those who experience psychosis from society is both a non viable option, and unethical. Too frequently it's attempted solely because the person experiencing psychosis is considered inconvenient by those in their life, and by society.

{"fcrcns6": {"text": "\u201cImpaired awareness of illness (anosognosia) is a major problem because it is the single largest reason why individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder do not take their medications.  It is caused by damage to specific parts of the brain, especially the right hemisphere.  It affects approximately 50 percent of individuals with schizophrenia and 40 percent of individuals with bipolar disorder.\u201d [citation ](https://mentalillnesspolicy.org/medical/anosognosia-studies.html) , by the same author as \u201cSurviving Schizophrenia: A Family Manual\u201d 2nd ed, 2019. This means half of people with schizophrenia have insight. The higher estimates of people suffering from anosognosia comes from the fact that symptomatically anosognosia is a spectrum of awareness, not only a total lack or full awareness of illness. And partial anosognosia still means having insight (technical term, not my pet word). No one is saying you\u2019re wrong overall. But you\u2019re not speaking accurately when you discount the possibility of being aware of your illness. And someone might read your comment and think they don\u2019t need to actively pursue help, that it isn\u2019t serious, because they\u2019re aware of their illness.

It\u2019s different in every person: some people have more frequent problems with psychosis that can occur from more minor mood changes, and some people only experience psychosis during their most severe mood episodes. In terms of genetics, there\u2019s a notable overlap between bipolar disorder with psychotic features and schizophrenia, where people with BP in their family have an increased likelihood of developing schizophrenia, and people with schizophrenia in their family have an increased likelihood of developing BP. So I guess I\u2019m saying is don\u2019t be too alarmed if your diagnosis remains BP. In something that more directly addresses your question, I was initially diagnosed with BP1. After a year working with my current psychiatrist and months of my moods being stable while I continued to have problems with psychosis my diagnosis was changed to schizoaffective disorder. Not much changed because of this. The treatment plan for schizoaffective disorder is the same as for BP1 with psychotic features.

These disorders do not require psychosis in order for you to receive that diagnosis. In these cases, the psychotic symptoms always exist during an episode of the illness (such as a depressive episode) rather than psychotic episodes occurring absent the defining symptoms of the disorder. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are a set of disorders included as psychotic disorders. The disorders themselves are defined by the presence, number, severity, and duration of the psychotic symptoms. While it\u2019s possible to have comorbid schizophrenia with another disorder, in that situation the psychotic episodes also occur without the presence of symptoms of the second disorder, and often the psychotic symptoms are more severe than is seen in a disorder with psychotic features. It\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t any potential between schizophrenia and mood disorders with psychotic features. Some people have mood episodes that are accompanied with psychosis, as well as psychotic episodes absent mood elements and of the same severity seen in schizophrenia; this is called schizoaffective disorderEdit: clarifying sentence in the second paragraphEdit 2: Psychotic features typically only include the psychotic symptoms of hallucinations and delusions.

As long as one isn\u2019t bullied or poorly treated for doing so, coming out can be beneficial for the mental health of the individual, because they feel able to be themselves in a fully integrated way without having to hide anything about themselves.

As everyone has to learn at some point, you can\u2019t unsay something that has been said, and once that thing is said you have no control in who else will come to know that information. This is both a positive and a negative. You want people to share information about mental health to raise awareness.

You can\u2019t do that if others aren\u2019t being honest with you about what your symptoms are. Also, it\u2019s rare to find a medication on the first try. The side effects can be many and varied, and some of them are really subtle. Only he will be able to provide feedback on what the medications are doing to him. I saw above that the therapist is afraid that telling him will worsen his symptoms. This can happen. It\u2019s usually a temporary thing brought on by the stress of diagnosis. There\u2019s never a good time to tell someone that they have schizophrenia, and it will only get harder to tell him the more everyone lies and tries to cover it up. He\u2019s going to need to be told sometime in order to better take care of himself and advocate for himself when seeking medical treatment. And what will happen as he figures out all of you are hiding something from him.

You don't need to give reasons if you don't want to, but doing so might give her further insight into her actions (probably not, from what you've said, but it could happen). Friendships, all relationships, are about consent, and you are removing your consent from this relationship. This sounds more like an abusive relationship than an actual friendship, since she's telling you that she doesn't even like you and is so quick to break off your friendship over nothing. So it does sound like it'll be much healthier for you to part ways.I will say that much of what you're describing sounds more like problems with her personality rather than a mood disorder. Problems like these can be changed, but it usually takes a ton of work and serious therapy. If she's not willing to put in that time and effort don't believe anything she says later about having learned her lesson. That will give you maybe 2-3 months of improved behavior before she reverts to the way she is now, and you're stuck in this same position.

They won\u2019t trust you if they have to learn what the serious side effects are on their own. And if they can\u2019t live with a side effect they\u2019ll discontinue the medication one way or the other; preferably, though, with your knowledge and assistance.Similarly, if a patient is unconvinced by their diagnosis, or thinks another one fits, talk to them further and considerately about why they think this. It\u2019s up to you to diagnose a patient, but there\u2019s also the chance that they\u2019ve omitted information that would make your diagnosis as accurate as possible. Encourage your patients who read up on their own diagnoses and medications. It\u2019s better if they feel they can be open about the information they\u2019ve come across and ask you questions about it. And reading into their diagnosis means they\u2019re investing their time and energy into their treatment. This includes being willing to try medications if they\u2019re in the same classes of medications the patient is taking. Be willing to look into current research. Your hours may be long and exhausting, and you won\u2019t always be able to do this. But if a patient comes to you with an article to read, or questions about new medications or procedures, put a bit of time looking into them. When you get patient referrals don\u2019t be too quick to change the diagnosis or medications if the patient seem content with them.

Treatments are not ethically undertaken except once it has been determined that the treatment does more good than the continued illness. This is one of those situations in which the converse is true: since the responsibility is to the health of the individual, and the treatment of the illness does more good than the continuation of the illness, it is unethical to withhold care in the situation where the doctor only has reason to believe the patient is correctly diagnosed based on the evidence they are able to collect.", "link_id": "t3_d5tyga", "time": 1568830039}}

Maybe the truth will come to light at a later date, or maybe not. But it doesn't make sense to expect the doctor to make a decision against treatment rather than for treatment if they must make a decision and they lack full knowledge of the situation due to this deliberate misguidance since it is explicitly unethical for them to withhold a necessary treatment.  Some medications are known to cause cognitive problems. So it makes sense in the situation of a patient already being treated to take their claim of cognitive side effects seriously enough to examine the possibility of their veracity and to consider altering treatment, in the same way it makes sense to treat symptoms as they are presented by the patient. Maybe the doctor is suspicious, sure. But it is still their responsibility to treat the symptoms and side effects the patient presents with to the best of their ability.

(Note: I have in the past believed I was in control of psychotic symptoms, that is until I tried to stop experiencing them. So, there\u2019s a difference between believing you\u2019re in control and actually being so)The thing is, hallucinations is just one symptom of schizophrenia.  And a diagnosis requires the presence of more than one symptom. If all three of your mental health providers say that you have schizophrenia then they are seeing symptoms and patterns that you can\u2019t see from your perspective. And, moreover, they\u2019ve been observing these symptoms for an extended period of time. As you probably know, considering your question, anosognosia is extremely common with schizophrenia. Somewhere between 50-80% of people with schizophrenia experience some degree of anosognosia (source: Surviving Schizophrenia). Speaking from experience, intelligence is extremely useful for covering up symptoms. It is entirely possible for the people you see daily, even people you live with, to not realize you have a schizophrenia spectrum disorder if you aren\u2019t presenting your symptoms in a manner that people usually associate with psychosis (this can sometimes work against you. When you need help it can make it much harder for people to take you seriously when you try to tell them that you\u2019re psychotic). This lack of recognition can go on for years. While you may not be able to tell that you have schizophrenia, your healthcare providers\u2019 diagnoses and the fact that there\u2019s a consensus bears consideration. If you\u2019re unsure, though, it certainly makes sense to ask them what symptoms they\u2019ve noticed to make them think you have schizophrenia.

The distinctions I think you're really asking about are three things :1) mood disorder with psychotic features2) schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, and3) comorbid schizophrenia and depressionThe difference between schizoaffective disorder and a mood disorder with psychotic features is that with the latter the psychotic features are only present during mood episodes and typically aren't as severe. With schizoaffective disorder the psychotic symptoms are present for a sufficient amount of time outside of a mood episode and can be quite severe. With schizoaffective disorder depressive type, while the psychotic symptoms do occur without the presence of a prominent mood episode, the mood disorder is either as or more prominent than the mood episode-free psychotic episodes, and typically the psychotic episodes occur around mood episodes. If instead the psychotic episodes without a mood episode last for a larger percentage of the time than the combined mood and psychotic episodes, then instead the diagnosis is comorbid schizophrenia and MDD. From what I understand, typically if you have bipolar disorder and show the symptoms of schizophrenia the diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder, rather than a comorbid diagnosis (but I could be wrong about this)While schizoaffective disorder(SZA) is the combination between schizophrenia and a mood disorder, typically patients with SZA look a lot more like patients with schizophrenia than patients with mood disorders. Our outcomes are similar, the severity of our psychotic episodes is the same, the manner in which our condition tends to deteriorate over time is the same, and we can experience any of the symptoms of schizophrenia, such as negative symptoms.

If you\u2019re in the US I would recommend talking to your PCP and ask them who they would send a family member to if that family member needed psychiatric help. If you have a doctor who has been practicing in your area for a while they should have some people to recommend. Also, ask friends and family if you feel able to. I found my psychiatrist through a friend, and then their recommendation was seconded by an second, un associated friend. Once you have some names you call around. If those names came from your doctor they may be able to reach out to the psychiatrist to ask whether they are taking new patients and if they might be able to see you earlier. You might end up on a waitlist. Access to good mental healthcare is really difficult in this country. Also many psychiatrists don\u2019t take insurance, so you\u2019ll need to check whether they\u2019re in network, unless your plan covers out of network care (which will still be more expensive than in network)I wish you luck in this.

There are two books that are autobiographical narratives by people with schizophrenia that I can think of and recommend off the top of my head. One, and my favorite between the two, is The Center Cannot Hold by Elyn Saks. The other is The Collected Schizophrenias by Esme Weijun Wang. The Center Cannot Hold has a narrative and narrator that I identify with more personally.

{"ezlazz0": {"text": "The specifics of hallucinations and delusions are extremely individualized in the way they take shape. Some people hear voices that just sound like their name being called from another room, or someone saying \u201chi.\u201d Others hear voices that tell them extremely negative things, like \u201cyou\u2019re ugly,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re stupid,\u201d \u201ckill yourself.\u201d Still others will hear calming things from voices that sound like family members, friends, or famous people. I get auditory hallucinations but I rarely hear voices. Usually I hear things like music, crashing noises, or laughter. Most of my hallucinations, though, are visual hallucinations. I see things like insects and shadow people on a daily basis, even though I\u2019m on medication. A delusion is a strongly held belief that isn\u2019t true. Some of them can be pretty mundane, and some of them can be truly bizarre. A lot of that depends on how long lived the delusion is and how severe it is. For instance, a delusion I had for a while was that my coworker was out to get me, was plotting against me, and was spying on me. This coworker legitimately didn\u2019t like me, and he did try to get me in trouble with management multiple times, but there was no organization or structure to his intentions against me. He wasn\u2019t specifically out to get me fired. This was a fairly mundane delusion. A more bizarre one that I had was that robots had invaded my body and were trying to insert filaments into my brain to take over my mind. Common delusions are things like \u201cpeople/the neighbors are spying on me,\u201d or \u201ccameras have been placed throughout my house,\u201d or \u201cother people can read my mind.\u201d I should point out that delusions don\u2019t mean that the person experiencing them is less intelligent or less rational. It\u2019s that some basic idea or understanding of how the world works has gone a bit askew in their mind, and all of the reasonable conclusions a person would make are then altered to match or fit this change. For this reason it\u2019s impossible to rationally convince someone with a delusion that the delusion is false. They are being as rational as you are, it\u2019s just that their basic understanding of the world is different from the one you\u2019re working with. This is why the best you can hope to get out of arguing with someone\u2019s delusion is for them to understand that the two of you don\u2019t agree. In answer to your question about what he experiences, it\u2019s impossible for another person to say what hallucinations or delusions are common for your partner. It\u2019s good that he\u2019s being treated, and is taking care of himself responsibly. They\u2019ll be entirely unique to him. As your relationship progresses and trust is built between the two of you it\u2019s reasonable for the two of you to speak further about this. It\u2019s reasonable for you to ask about what he experiences, and about what you can do to help. Right now you\u2019re doing a good thing, trying to gather information and better understand what all of this means. Sharing this diagnosis with someone we care about is a big thing, and a terrifying thing. Often people respond by rejecting us without any true understanding of what schizophrenia entails or the fact that these days a person with schizophrenia can in fact live a happy and normal life. So he\u2019s probably going to be nervous for a while about how you\u2019ll feel about this and him.

I have a background in philosophy and logic, and this might help a little. If he truly does like logic then the best way to explain what's going on with a delusion is to say that they are a fundamental shift in the first premises through which you interact with the world. So all of your actions while delusional are coherent, well reasoned, if you can identify which premise(s) have changed and don't fit the way most people see reality. Most bizarre delusions start with just a small real life incident. One of my more recent ones started with a kidney stone that I passed early one morning. The majority of people who have them respond to a kidney stone with the understanding that something was stuck in their kidney and then it passed out of their system. I understood this of course but the pain of it had felt like something was drilling into my back. While at first I knew the most likely situation was that it was a kidney stone. But the thought that something had drilled into my back sat in my head for a couple of days and over that time I came to the conclusion that something must really have been drilling into my back. It had felt hard, like metal, so that's probably what it was made of. It made sense then, that if they were made of metal, and they had drills, then they were likely robots of some type and I became certain that robots had infiltrated my body. I'll stop there in telling this, since it follows that if one has been infiltrated by something the only thing to do is to remove that thing. The point is that there was a shift in the way my mind accepted empirical knowledge and drew conclusions from this. Every step of the way was perfectly reasonable once those premises had changed. And no conversation with another person could persuade me that something was wrong because there was a fundamental gap our abilities to experience the world in the same way.With hallucinations, I point to neuroscience. It's been shown that auditory hallucinations activate the part of the brain that perceives auditory input. You really are hearing things. So, too, with visual hallucinations, you really are seeing things. It doesn't matter that other people can't interact with these things too, because your brain is literally telling you that you are hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, tasting these things. You might be able to acknowledge that others aren't experiencing the same things, but your mind is going to respond to these things like they're there because it really does think that they're there.", "link_id": "t3_cyi75t", "time": 1567388884}}

{"eyrbha5": {"text": "There are two symptoms of schizophrenia that you're kind of asking about or that are relevant to your question. One is thought disorder, which is more of a group of symptoms. Often with thought disorder you will see a breakdown in logic and reason, and associations are made that are either loose or nonsensical. That's where you see word salad, clang associations, tangential thinking, etc. In the case of delusions, though, mild to moderately severe delusions are often logical but they have unsound premises (severe ones are often accompanied by thought disorder). This is part of what makes delusions so difficult to treat. Because they will start with something small, maybe accidentally meeting eyes with a person on the subway, as an example. Instead of assuming that this was an accident and that the other person didn't mean to be looking their way instead the premises those thoughts are based on shift and they believe this person on the subway was watching them. Well, it follows that if they were being watched, who else is watching them? Are they just being watched by people, or are their monitoring devices around recording them? Why are they being watched? Is this an organized group that is monitoring them? And this one shifted premise behind the cause of two people meeting eyes can develop into a full blown delusion that a government organization is monitoring them, for a specific reason (that I'm not coming up with off the top of my head). But what makes this a delusion is the sincere belief of the verity of these things. The answers to all of these questions are taken as true, and all evidence that points against them are believed to be inconclusive. A fiction writer, though, may develop these questions and answers to them but throughout the process they know that this isn't real, it's only fiction. The scientist will go into their experiment with a clear outline of what types of results will verify a hypothesis, which ones will disprove it, and they will hopefully not have a personal bias that would cause them to falsify or falsely invalidate the results of their study.

{"ex73khq": {"text": "There are a lot of threads on this sub about what schizophrenia is and is like that you might want to take a look at, too. Each person\u2019s experience of it is entirely different, but there are a number of potential symptoms. For a very broad overview of symptoms and schizophrenia take a look at this crash course video that was shared today on the sub https://youtu.be/uxktavpRdzU To be diagnosed with schizophrenia you have to experience at least two psychotic symptoms, and  at least one of these must be a positive psychotic symptom, hallucinations or delusions. There are also negative, and disorganized symptoms that you should look into if you want to depict schizophrenia accurately. There are a number of other criteria as well, including duration of and recurrence of psychotic symptoms. For an overview of symptom types and diagnosis take a look at https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Schizophrenia But in terms of what it\u2019s like to live with, it\u2019s a detachment from reality. Sometimes and some people can tell when this is happening, but most people suffer a degree of anosognosia. For me this means that when my symptoms are more mild or just starting I know something is wrong but I can\u2019t identify what that is, and I rely on others I\u2019m close to (family and close friends) to help me figure it out. When my symptoms become more severe I can\u2019t tell that something is wrong, and I don\u2019t understand why others are upset, or trying to get me to take medications. Often at that point I think my medications are harmful, and am highly suspicious of other people. But in my experience psychosis, even more pleasant expressions of it (for instance, not all hallucinations are bad or scary; some are wonderful) are traumatic. It\u2019s difficult to maintain your hold on your personal narrative when you have episodes that yank you out of being connected to reality and who you want to be as a person. And it\u2019s difficult to trust your mind, to trust yourself when there\u2019s always a chance that what you\u2019re perceiving isn\u2019t real. From what you said about the characters, if the brother with schizophrenia is reliant on the older brother then it\u2019s possible that he additionally relies on him for verifying what is real around him. If he takes medications he may even need the older brother to remind him to take them, or to tell him when he needs to take additional doses because his symptoms are becoming severe. But this reliance can also be a point of conflict between the two, assuming the younger brother has any desire to be independent. He has to implicitly trust the older brother to depend on him this way (this would include trusting that the older brother never lies to him) but just because he enjoys that trust it doesn\u2019t mean that he wants to be dependent.

I felt that I couldn't trust her after she explicitly lied like that. I ended up finding a therapist after that who both had a better poker face and had more experience treating psychotic disorders. So far working with her has been wonderful and I'm really glad that I made the switch. Regarding your situation, I would ask her to clarify what she means when she says she \"needs to see if she can handle what comes up.\" I would ask her what information she is looking for, and try to communicate that you're asking so that you can make sure the situations that concern her are addressed rather than avoided in session. What may be the important thing to her ( I can't say since I don't know her at all) is that you communicate your feelings and thoughts with words, and try to explore and come to better terms with it in session.It comes to this, though: if she can't come to terms with people being angry in therapy then she shouldn't be a therapist. Anger is a normal emotion, and therapy is a good place to learn how to process anger in a healthy manner. It's normal to be angry. It's normal, even, to be angry at your therapist sometimes.

{"evyp5t4": {"text": "It\u2019s not unheard of for someone with bipolar disorder to never experience periods of remission. This is in fact more common with bipolar 2, although it does occur with bipolar 1. One of the more common distinctions between bipolar 1 and 2 is that bipolar 2 tends to be more depression dominant, while bipolar 1 tends to be more mania dominant (although this is not always the case). Anhedonia is a common symptom of depression, which makes it alone difficult to distinguish as either a mood or psychotic/negative symptom. And if you never experience periods of remission from your mood episodes then it would be impossible to diagnose you with schizoaffective disorder, since one of the key criteria is the presence of positive psychotic symptoms outside of a mood episode. Have you spoken with your doctor about your delusion? Doctors are usually pretty hesitant about giving schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses when there is another plausible option. Also, the psychiatric treatment of bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder is the same, so changing the diagnosis to the latter is of limited usefulness (it can be useful for some things). But it is important for your doctor to have a complete understanding of your psychiatric history and experiences. Would you prefer to have a diagnosis of SZA? There\u2019s nothing wrong with that if you do and it seems like the most sensible diagnosis to you. Having a diagnosis that better fits our understanding of our experiences can sometimes be comforting.

It sounds like he's dealing with some problems with damaged trust, at least in part due to his depression related problems with self confidence. The lack of intimacy between the two of you probably unintentionally reinforced his negative self perceptions. There are things that can be done about this. The first thing is to do what you just did. Keep the communication lines between the two of you open. Relationships thrive on communication. This is especially true when both of you struggle with mental illness (both my spouse and I do and this is how our relationship has managed to stay going). It's easy for this part to fall by the wayside, but communicating makes everything a shared experience, which should itself make things easier and build trust.  If he's alright with physical intimacy at this point then I recommend intentionally increasing the amount of it between the two of you. That doesn't necessarily mean sex. Kissing would be good, if you're ok with that. Touch is important. You can touch anywhere, stroking his face, back, stomach, paying attention to parts of him that he isn't confident about and make it clear that you like and accept them. Also, make time to just spend together and increase the romantic content of your relationship if you haven't been doing that. This is harder when you have a kid, but it sounds like your child is old enough that this can be doable. Go out on dates regularly. If you can, buy or make small gifts. Write letters (this is something I really recommend, they're more intimate than other forms of contact, and allow the other person to have a physical item to look over after the fact. I'm saying this as someone who definitely grew up after this was really a thing.) Take up a hobby together. Read books or articles together and discuss them, or go to events that you both like (a concert, wrestling match, a gaming event, opera, whatever you like). It also might make sense for the two of you to try a few sessions of couples therapy.

Write out an outline of your medical and psych history going back as far as you remember, noting important events that clarify why you've had the diagnos(is/es) you've had. These notes can include a list of symptoms and when they've started, notable episodes, duration of episodes, triggers you've been able to notice/track, and anything else you think is relevant. Try to organize it enough that you can provide a narrative. It doesn't need to be perfect, just a framework. Explicitly state what has brought you to them. It's been a couple of years since you sought treatment, so why now? What are your goals? Are you looking for long term treatment, or do you anticipate this only being for a shorter period of time? What does successful therapy look like/feel like to you?Write out questions you might have for them. I like to ask about their therapy technique/how the conversation will flow; what their response is to confessing thoughts of self harm/how trigger happy they are to hospitalize someone; discuss with them that I think treatment is a partnership and get their thoughts on what that looks like from their viewpoint; find out how easy they will be to access after hours in case there's an emergency. If they're a psychiatrist I ask about the medications they prefer to prescribe and why; see whether they have an understanding of both older and newer medications; discuss their approach to dosing and how heavy handed they are with meds (I prefer light handed with flexibility); what their thoughts are about PRN medications and dose changes; what their thoughts are on polypharmacy for difficult cases, etc.", "link_id": "t3_caoalw", "time": 1562622808}}

Trans people are still very much on the fringe of the LGBT community in terms of acceptance. That's getting better in much of the community, but it's caused a nigh-violent schism for that acceptance to occur. And in the context of society overall, we are often met with disgust, derision, and sometimes violence. Similarly SZ and SZA are very much on the fringe of the mental health movement. Lip service is made to us being included and important to the conversation, but when it comes to movement promotion, and policies being written often those with psychotic disorders are conveniently forgotten.

You can either say that or say that the dopamine hypothesis has been disproven for at least two decades. The original dopamine hypothesis is entirely debunked, but dopamine is still shown to play a major role in schizophrenia. Rather, later research has shown that dopamine is far from the sole neurotransmitter that is related to schizophrenia, and others including glutamate, GABA, and serotonin play major roles in the expression of both positive and negative symptoms. This is why many of the newer antipsychotics have shown themselves to be better at treating positive symptoms and have been able to decrease negative symptoms for many people for those who respond well to them; the neuropharmacology is catching up. They\u2019re far from having a full understanding of any forms of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, but there\u2019s a lot more nuance to the current models, and these are nuances that are being backed by neuroimaging.So I guess what I\u2019m saying is that antipsychotics as a class aren\u2019t going anywhere in the near future, since a lot of current research is going into the related genetic factors; but rather the drugs getting better at what they do.

Responses to antipsychotics are entirely idiosyncratic and it can take some time to find the right antipsychotic for you, so if Invega doesn\u2019t work for you don\u2019t worry too much. It took me 12 tries to get to a medication combo that I like, and that\u2019s not the most I\u2019ve heard of from others. Happily, if you\u2019re taking it to treat psychotic symptoms it might affect them pretty quickly, after a couple of days. It could take up to two weeks, and/or fiddling with the dose a bit to get to the right place, though. Antipsychotics can have a wide range of side effects. Most of them share the same potential side effects but have different likelihoods for each one. I tend to get really bad and weird side effects from meds which is part of why I\u2019ve tried so many. This is the first one I\u2019ve responded to at all well. Typical side effects you\u2019ll hear of for atypical antipsychotics include weight gain, dry mouth, sedation, tremors, akathesia,  heat sensitivity, etc.For me, Invega causes slight tremors that affect my fine motor skills, minor vision problems, dizziness, serious dry mouth, elevated prolactin levels, and occasional akathesia. For the first few months you take it your doctor should be running frequent blood tests to make sure it doesn\u2019t cause your white blood cell count to drop, which is a very serious counter indication for taking it. I also get my glucose and a1c levels checked because, as with most atypical antipsychotics, there is a chance of it causing metabolic syndrome and potentially diabetes. Ah. One last note about side effects, specifically dry mouth: antipsychotics will cause dry mouth for most people, even if it\u2019s minor enough that they don\u2019t notice. Dry mouth can cause rather rapid deterioration of your teeth so you need to make sure to take good care of them daily. There are mouth washes (like biotene), chewing gums, and candies with xylitol that can be used to activate your salivary glands and fight tooth decay. I find so far that it\u2019s worth investing in them. I don\u2019t specifically know why you\u2019ve been prescribed an antipsychotic, but if it\u2019s for a specific disorder there\u2019s likely a subreddit for it. I\u2019ve found the specific disorder subs that I subscribe to to be really helpful and informative communities.

{"emqnu8u": {"text": "I don't find what you've written to be offensive. You've clearly suffered and struggled with your mother's illness. I can't speak specifically about what's going on with your mom. I can just make a couple of guesses based on what you've said.The thing with psychosis in schizoaffective disorder is that the majority of the psychosis occurs during and for a certain duration around mood episodes. This is what distinguishes it from having separate diagnoses of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, where the psychosis of any severity would occur at any time and for any duration, particularly longer durations, regardless of whether the person was experiencing a mood episode. It sounds likely that the more severe psychotic episodes your mother is experiencing are during manic episodes, which would especially contribute to the feeling of them being 'fun' or 'exciting.' And when you're manic, especially when you're psychotic, it is very difficult to say that you are in control of your own behaviors because decisions are made too quickly to have been made with any degree of good sense and they're not based on reality. But deciding to not treat her own illness when she knows about it \\*is\\* something within her control and something she can be held accountable for.I've done terrible things while psychotic, and experienced terrifying hallucinations, including trying to kill my spouse. These are things that I deeply regret , and I hope, while euthymic, to never live through them again. But I still do crave the rush that comes with mania, and therefore these psychotic episodes. I both hope simultaneously to never live through these psychotic episodes again, and to experience the causes of them. I sometimes refer to this as being addicted to my own brain chemistry. But I take my meds and carefully track my psychotic symptoms, which never fully go away, and my moods to be careful to not become manic. This is because I personally prioritize the fear of what I would experience and do to myself, my family, and my friends, while psychotic over the promises of mania. But this monitoring is a decision I have to make every day, and some days it's easier than others. And at some times I have lapsed in this because mania is very seductive  (when I have stopped taking my meds it's usually because I've already started to become manic).Sort of contrary to what I said before, it may be that your mother isn't able to make this decision to take care of her illness. This could be due to a lack of insight about her psychosis, which means she doesn't entirely register when she's psychotic. It could also be due to anosognosia, a lack of realizing or believing that she's actually ill, which is common in both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Or, and this is just as likely, she might have some comorbid mental illnesses that are contributing to her behavior. Disorders like BD and SA often occur accompanied by other mental illnesses.Regardless, none of this is your fault. You're not a bad child or person for needing to take care of yourself. It's important to prioritize your own wellbeing, especially if the part of the support system you should be provided by you parents isn't there, either due to their own illness, or trying to take care of their spouse who is ill. Self care is especially important if you want to continue trying to support your mother. You can't take care of someone else if you tap out all of your reserves, and you also have a mood disorder that requires attention and caretldr; It's difficult to say exactly what is your mother's responsibility for a number of reasons. Mania is very seductive.

I take 2 APs: one an old typical AP, Haldol, and the other a newer atypical AP, Rexulti. I have mixed experiences with both. The Haldol helps me a lot with mania and psychotic symptoms, but in larger quantities I find it causes me to have serious cognitive side effects (as well as some extrapyramidal side effects like tremors, dry eye, not sweating, etc). The Rexulti is great for addressing my depression and mood crashes. It helps me focus better, overcoming a lot of my distractibility, however it makes my hallucinations slightly worse and when I take it daily causes me to become manic, so I take it every 2-3 days. These responses, though, are different from what some other people experience on these medications. For some people Rexulti helps a lot with mania, but causes akathisia. Geodon has worked wonders for many people, and helped them to lose weight with little to no side effects, but for me it causes tachycardia.

It's why psychotic features is an additional modifier of the diagnosis.I think it's important to note, too, that a lot of the internal fear surrounding psychosis involves societal stigma of mental illness. That isn't to say psychosis isn't itself scary or potentially dangerous when it's severe. But I've found it important in my own struggles with psychosis to examine how much of my difficulty accepting it as a part of my life has to do with the real problems involved with it (that's certainly there) and how much is related to societal norms and fears of being perceived as  \"crazy\"", "link_id": "t3_bg1y71", "time": 1555949258}}

These are going to be broad because I don't want to put in information that can be too easily recognized by anyone who knows me. I know these aren't examples but I hope it's still helpfulDelusions are, personally, one of my least favorite symptom of psychosis (right after disorganized thoughts). They're really sneaky and can be difficult to detect, they entirely shake your grounding in reality, and the longer they're there the worse they get. I've spent years with some less noticeable delusions before noticing that they're there and how bad they've gotten. Usually I don't register that they're there until after they've gone or started to get better (usually after medical intervention), no matter how absurd they are, whereas I sometimes have insight and recognize hallucinations for likely untruths even as I can't help but believe they're still true. In terms of getting stuck in one reality or another, that really depends on how bad the psychotic episode is, and for me whether it's accompanied by hallucinations that validate them. Sometimes I experience the delusions getting worse and then less overwhelming, but I don't stop believing them even when my behavior gets less noticeably extreme. However major they are, though, I don't ever feel disconnected from them. They become something I believe fundamentally, as a premise of reality; something not to be questioned. When I'm delusional in a lot of ways I'm not in control of acting and speaking as though these things are true, because to me they are true in a deeply fundamental way.I usually remember my delusions afterward. After, I sometimes feel disconnected from them because it's like I think and function entirely differently.

It took me several years to try to see a therapist after that but I'm glad I did. I did try some therapists who were misses at first but my last two therapists have been wonderful. The first session is always 1-2 hours of intake questions, so you don't really get to know the therapist yet. They shouldn't judge you at all. Their job is to get a feel for what's been troubling you and help you work through those things, to build the skills be most yourself in all the ways you want to be. It took me a long time to get over my own feelings of shame and internal judgement to talk about a lot of things but once I did the process became very rewarding. I can't say that it'll be easy at first, or that you'll find the right therapist on the first go. Your therapist should be both supportive and willing to challenge you.

As someone who gets a lot of weird and sometimes dangerous side effects to medications I do recommend going to a psychiatrist over an NP since this is their specialty. A good psychiatrist should have a comprehensive knowledge of both newer and older medications. They should be responsive and creative when it comes to recommending and prescribing medications. This is the sort of thing that comes with a thorough knowledge, background, and hopefully experience in their field, as well as a pursuit of newer and up to date information.   If you have the option to, it's best to do a phone interview of a potential psychiatrist to get an idea of their treatment methods and their familiarity with medications, as well as feel out any concerns you have with seeing them. When you go in to see them it's good to have a list of medications you've taken and how you've responded to each they should have an idea of what other classes and variations of medications to recommend as a next step. It does involve a lot of throwing darts at a board in the dark to start, but as you have more positive-ish responses to medications they should be able to knowledgeably recommend a next medication/step.

Hopefully you'll find this a bit helpful, at least.I'm diagnosed Bipolar I, in that grey space between strictly having an affective disorder and SA, so if you're cyclothymic and not sure if you've been manic in the past it'll be a bit different. I'm much more stable than I was before meds. I currently take Haldol for an AP and Lamictal as a mood stabilizer. A lot of this is more about what I'm like when I'm not on meds. Mood episodes, which have a different duration than mood swings, take a different shape for everyone. Part of the reason I'm considered between BD I and SA is because there are very few times when I'm not in some degree of a mood episode (and all mood episodes, even *very* minor ones, come with psychotic symptoms), and my mood episodes last anywhere from a few days/a week to several months (although I've had a depressive episode last a couple of years).  I tend to be more manic-dominant in my mood states, so I usually get manic before I get depressed, I tend generally toward manic and hypomanic states, and the severity of my manic episodes often dictate how severe my depressive episodes end up being. So what are my episodes like? That's complicated because each one is different, and because I frequently experience mixed episodes. They may or may not last long and when they switch they switch suddenly and often to the extreme end of the mood episode when they start. Depression can range anywhere between listless emptiness but general functionality, to an inability to move or peel myself off the floor (literally) because my body feels too heavy, to a vast void of agony and suicidal impulses. Hypomania is generally nice. I get more things done, I feel efficient, creative, witty and intelligent all at once. I might not even realize I'm starting to become manic, but over this time I stop sleeping more than 1-2 hours a night, and often stop eating. For me hypomania doesn't last very long, my mind starts racing faster than I can track then I often swing into a full manic or mixed manic state, which often involve catatonia, severe psychotic symptoms/full psychotic break, and (if I'm not catatonic) dangerous and ill advised activities. And, while my mood is in a specific episode I might switch back and forth between different aspects and degrees of depression, or alternate between hypomania, mania, and mixed mania.That's a summary, but I can go on a bit more if it'll help", "link_id": "t3_ahevxo", "time": 1547850195}}

She believes I\u2019m more BD1 and that I\u2019m always in some degree of a mood state that is causing psychotic symptoms of varying degrees. From our conversations she believes that even during my more stable points I experience pressure or \u201cbubbles\u201d from mania/depression/mixed moods and the psychosis is from this slight pressure. This means functionally I\u2019m not only always in a mood state, however minor, but I also am always experiencing psychotic symptoms (which are being effectively treated with APs).

{"ebh31en": {"text": "I was first diagnosed earlier this year, 32 M, BD1 with psychotic features, after having an observed manic episode initiated by an antidepressant. My onset with severe and lengthy episodes was sometime around the age of 12, but I had a terrible therapist at the time who wouldn't believe me when I told him I wasn't sleeping (I hadn't for months at that point), and that I was hallucinating. He diagnosed me with MDD at 16 when I was hospitalized for suicidal ideations. After I'd recovered from that episode this therapist was extremely aggressive and refused to listen to the severe problems and side effects I was having with the antidepressants I was on (like mania). My experiences with him were traumatic enough that once I started college I avoided all forms of mental care and continued to do so for over a decade. I've only been able to be honest about my experiences with mood episode over this past year, since I started receiving treatment, both out of necessity due to the crisis situation I was in, as well my fortune in having found a skilled pdoc.   I don't really have a good answer to how you recover from missing out on lost time. Sometimes I accept it calmly, because things are getting better. My medications (Lamictal and Haldol) are currently working, and while they do so I don't need to fear many of the worst symptoms (and their subsequent actions) I've had over my life. Often I'm filled with gratitude for the people who have stuck by me through all of this, and have made continuing on both possible and bearable.   Sometimes, though, I rage at how much time I've lost because I've had my life crumble around me so many times from a bad manic episode; how hard it's been continually starting over from square 1. I don't know if I'll ever stop experiencing that feeling. 20 years is a lot of time to lose, and no matter how well I've accepted the recent changes in my life the repercussions from those experiences are still very real and not going away anytime soon. But...I guess I've come to some peace with experiencing that anger. It's ok to be angry, and hurt by that loss. I just don't think it's not ok to let the anger steal any more time than I've already lost.  In terms of making friends, my best suggestion is to try to find something, a hobby, a craft, a course of study that you're interested in. Then find other people who are interested in that too. Look up clubs, reading groups, meetups, etc., and go to one. Be open in your interest, and unafraid to as questions, and someone will step up to answer you. Then you'll have made one friend. Then more friends at that meeting, or from that one friend. Well, at least, that's worked for me, and that's how I've made some of my best and most interesting friends. From these friends I've found that it also helps a lot if they also have personal experiences with mental illness. They tend to be solid friends for giving and receiving support, and the most patient and willing to forgive the inevitable problems that will pop up: a thoughtless comment or action made when manic, ditching plans when depressed, etc. It can be difficult, and feel painfully slow to find these relationships, but once they're there you'll be surprised and how quickly it'll feel like they formed.", "link_id": "t3_a4nrg2", "time": 1544411669}}
