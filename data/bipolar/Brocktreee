You need to get a lawyer as soon as possible and you need to get away from this man. Whoever he was, he no longer is.   As to his rules: 1. Manic people often don't know when they're hurting someone or when they're not. Manic people therefore *must* trust all complaints that they are hurting someone, and *must* stop the hurtful action, or if they aren't able to stop, must agree to a solution that prevents further hurt.2. No one can judge for themselves whether they are manic or not; that judgment is up to everyone else.First. It can be true that people that are manic may not know they are hurting someone. **It does not follow, therefore, that all complaints are valid.** Treating all complaints as valid opens you up to manipulation and robs you of your power to determine for yourself what is going on.  Second. **\"Everyone else\" is not trained in psychiatry well enough to recognize mania.** To trust \"everyone else\" is to leave yourself open to, again, all sorts of manipulation and gaslighting, being told you're manic when you're not, therefore you must change X Y Z behavior etc. Lack of insight into one's own state of mind ([anosognosia](https://www.nami.org/learn-more/mental-health-conditions/related-conditions/anosognosia)) is a symptom of bipolar, but it can be overcome and self awareness cultivated. You need to work with your psychiatrist to build this, read about bipolar, journal, etc. It can be done.

The reason you're not feeling, well, manic right now I would attribute to two things: One, you're still taking your lamictal, so that's contributing to your stable mood state.

You still have a therapeutic dose of lithium floating around--but that amount will decrease **every single day** you miss a dose. It's a very common bipolar justification that \"oh, because I'm feeling better, I don't need my meds anymore\". I would attribute that to lack of insight, which is itself a symptom of M/mania.

I'm transitioning to Vraylar right now because I want something with a longer half life, but I'm keeping my risperdal on hand for emergencies.   As far as advice? Stick with it. Ask your doc about going an extra week on your current taper level before reducing again if you think that will help. Li is 95% excreted in your urine, and the remaining 5% actually builds and accumulates over time. So it's taking a while to come back out, and that's a period of marked flux, as you're going through now.  Hope this helps!", "link_id": "t3_aku8j7", "time": 1548890439}}

Not a pretty sight. I recovered, however, even without any proper psychiatric help, survived a move cross-country, and started college when I was sixteen years old.&amp;#x200B;Made it through five years of school, unmedicated, undiagnosed, untreated, left Mormonism (born into it), came out as gay, got into the BDSM community, went to several college conferences, met amazing people and I've been able to cultivate those relationships into some truly wonderful things. I met my boyfriend who I've been with for three years now, and only last year did I seek or get any help or diagnosis.&amp;#x200B;I graduated from college at 21, no treatment. I made it to 24, really starting to see the impacts of my untreated disorder, and almost a year later (holy fucking shit), I\"m on an effective medication regimen with therapy, and I have the tools I need to manage and prevent my mood swings as they come.&amp;#x200B;They still come. They still suck cactus balls. But they're not as bad as they were before, and they're much easier to handle. I can't stress what a difference proper treatment has made for me.&amp;#x200B;As I write this, I'm taking a small break from studying for my professional examinations, self-study that I have committed to, for the long-term goal of becoming an actuary. The exams require a massive amount of work to pass, and I've been able to focus and commit to the work required to make it happen. I have the stability I need thanks to the changes I've made (getting enough sleep, avoiding alcohol, not overdoing the caffeine, regular walks), and I'm able to hold down a full time job, have for the past four years.  I'm financially stable, I'm in a fair amount of debt but not unmanageable, I'm in a stable committed relationship, and I'm on the road to progressing to a career that can set me up for a lifetime.

I've had minor auditory hallucinations (repeating sounds coming from outside, hearing my boyfriend yell at me). In my psychotic manic episode things got much much worse. I was hallucinating being attacked by devils, angels were appearing before me, I was talking to God and he was angry that I was masturbating, and at the worst of it I suffered under the delusion that Satan could take over my body and make me kill my family. I isolated myself in my room for hours on end for multiple days to keep that from happening, studying the Bible and praying constantly. My hallucinations more recently have been more exciting. They're usually hypnagogic (occurring as I'm going to sleep). Recently I hallucinated a woman with red hair and purple vestments, face chalk white, that was trying to talk to me. I was very agitated and manic so I took my risperdal and waited for it to kick in. Before it did I just told myself she's not real, at which point she laughed, and another disembodied voice laughed, and they said \"We'll show him how real we are\". The woman's hands grew and she started to strangle me. My body seized as this was happening. It was such a visceral thing.  This escalated into a cacaphony of voices and thoughts and ideas and things just spilling over themselves again and again, a maelstrom of thought and experience that I couldn't possibly keep up with.Before that, I hallucinated three people that were commenting on me going to bed, saying I shouldn't, that I should go to the bathroom. I had extremely vivid images of what these people looked like, and it wasn't until a few days after that I realized HOLD ON, that was a proper hallucination.I always expected hallucinations to feature in my illness, because of my psychotic break as a kid.

If anything I hope to be able to pass my trust in some doctors, like you said, on. My hallucinations and paranoia are fucking terrifying and I want to stay as far away from them as possible. (One time, briefly, I felt that I was a white 26 year old woman named Jessica being held in stasis by aliens... The whole front half of my body felt fused with hers, I had a crystal clear vision of her in my head. I was able to remind myself where I was and who I actually am, but that was really disorienting.

Writing that sentence out hurt.I was obsessively devoted to Mormonism and driven by the goal of having perfect, unsinful thoughts, which formed a major part of what was an extended psychotic manic episode. I thought that Satan was making me gay and could take over my body and make me kill family members, I hallucinated devils attacking me, God abandoning me, conversations with God who was angry because I kept saying I would stop masturbating... I was fucking distraught over everything I was going through. Did I mention that Mormons believe sex, hetero and homo, outside of marriage is NEXT TO MURDER in terms of severity?I told my parents what was going on, and they told me to \"leave it at the hands of God\", \"just stop\",... somehow none of this ever made it back to my now-deceased psychiatrist. Funnily enough, my sister was diagnosed as bipolar.Fast forward ten years, last November, almost a year ago (FUCK!). My boyfriend got me thinking about my... inordinately happy periods followed by my \"low\" periods. I started thinking, hey, I have family history, I have all these symptoms, I probably have bipolar... So I made an appointment, a diagnostic dealio, and after telling the intake therapist about my family history (bp sister, Aspie/depressed father, half my sibs have ADHD), I was diagnosed BP2 with rapid cycling. That has shifted to BP-NOS, and I suspect I am in fact cyclothymic with psychotic features.The intake interview took two hours. It really wasn't bad, just a lot of questions and talking about my life and experiences. I went in expecting to be diagnosed bipolar, but when she said bipolar, it just... punched me in the gut. She recommended buying a few books on bipolar disorder to educate myself about the disorder, and holy fuck am I glad I did. [This book](https://www.amazon.com/Bipolar-Disorder-Survival-Guide-Second/dp/1606235427) was INVALUABLE in helping me adjust to the news, stabilize my emotions, start to process, accept...Reading that and tracking my moods in [eMoods](https://emoodtracker.com/) really helped set me on the right path post-diagnosis. It was another few months (!) until I was able to see a psychologist. I was started on lamotrigine 25mg, a bipolar mood stabilizer effective in bipolar depression, but that didn't start to affect anything till I hit 100mg. My rapid cycling hypomanias were totally unchecked, and happened three or four times a month, sometimes more, for a few days at a time. I was started on lithium after this, 150mg, and it wasn't until three weeks after starting 900mg lithium that I started to experience the effects.[And sweet baby Jesus.](https://gph.is/2EnWzQM) It just hit me as I was on my way to a BDSM party, that... hey, I'm good.

It had to be reduced to 600mg due to complications with my thyroid, as it pushed my TSH and TA4 levels way out of whack, and they've since come back into the high end of normal, but my manias returned. I was given 0.5mg of risperdal, as needed, to break my manias when they happened. And [holy fuck](https://gph.is/2kle6dI). Risperdal fucking works.Psychosis is a significant part of my hypomanic episodes and though it's not been extremely disruptive, it's... alarming. I hallucinated that I was a white 26 year old woman named Jessica, with red hair and light freckles, that was being held in stasis by aliens, held in a slime prison with black tentacles all around. The entire front of my body felt suffused with her,... and then my brain kicked in and reminded me of where I actually was, in my bed, going to sleep. Yay hypnagogic hallucinations. Another one that happened more recently was when I was going to bed, I could tell my entire mind was just SWIRLING and I was getting manic, so I took a risperdal before going to bed. I hallucinated so many voices just chattering and talking, as well as a woman in a purple robe, powder-white face and red hair who was talking to me. I just laid there reminding myself that they're not real, and she laughed. \"He thinks we're not real. Let's show him!\" With that, her hands grew in size and wrapped themselves around my neck, and my body tensed up as if she was actually choking me. Then the risperdal kicked in. And Everything. Shut. Down. Instantly quiet.Risperdal is a dopamine antagonist: It blocks how much dopamine my brain absorbs, similar to schizophrenia medications (e.g. haldol). These days I take 0.25mg morning and 0.5mg evening, with 150mg lamictal morning and evening, and 600mg lithium evening. Two mood stabilizers and an atypical antipsychotic. And so far? It's actually working pretty well. I'm back to rapid cycling, or \"bouncing\" as I've taken to calling it, when my mood goes up and comes back down to normal levels in the course of minutes or hours, but the risperdal keeps it in check and if it's severe, completely cuts through my mania and essentially ends it. I'm extremely grateful for that.  SO.... there's my autobiography, a bit more than you asked for I know, LOL.   **TL;DR:** Psychotically manic Mormon gay boy ten years ago. Diagnosed recently following conflicts with my boyfriend. Deeeeefinitely bipolar. Psychotic episodes, medication, relative stability. ", "link_id": "t3_984gal", "time": 1534561077}}

At 600mg it's not doing the same, though I believe it's still acting \"in the background\".

I'm really, really loving it so far. It's a dopamine antagonist, blocking my brain from picking up dopamine, essentially. It's been extremely stabilizing for me. I was taking it previously as needed to break manias, but taking it daily now will act as a prophylactic we're hoping. It's definitely made me calmer in the mornings, so good news on that front!I'm leery of depakote, but it's still on the table if our other approaches to stopping my mania don't work.

Can I ask what obstacles you've run into that have made it impossible to get to a psych up to this point?   Also, a word about mood stabilizers: They take a while to kick in. I'm on lamictal and lithium. My lamictal was bumped from 25mg to 50mg to 100mg, and that took a few months, to minimize the impact of SJS. I didn't start noticing any difference until 100mg.   Lithium REALLY  kicked my mania in the ass, and that kicked in 2 months and 2 weeks into starting it, being on 900mg (up from 300mg/day) for two weeks.   More immediate-acting medications they can give you are atypical anti-psychotics. I have Risperdal 0.5mg as needed. When I'm manic, HOLY FUCK does it zap it in the ass.

What don't they understand?Mental health is ignored by so many people, glossed over, excused, justified, and legitimate causes of friction and misery are simply chalked up to bad behavior, personal failure, or moral failing. With bipolar, people don't understand that mania is not all sunshine and roses. it can be extreme agitation, anxiety, paranoia, hallucination, psychosis, delusion, grandiosity.... It can be so much more destructive than anyone really realizes, but no one considers that.* Do you feel that society/social media affects your mental health (Facebook/Instagram etc)?Yes. I avoid  world news because it brings me down, though I don't restrict myself from all of it. Facebook is neutral, Reddit can be very depressing, but I can handle that  in the right headspace.* Are the situations/places/times of the year that have a greater impact on your mental health?Winter seems to be more depressing, and when I'm around family, I have a lot more stress than usual.* What are your hopes for the future?Continuing to study for my professional certification exams, move to a bigger city, possibly own a house... I have a lot of hope for my future.", "link_id": "t3_906o0m", "time": 1532045309}}

You feel amazing because of the oversurplus of serotonin which, as many others have commented, has massively contributed to their manias. But the converse of that is it will make your depression much, much worse, as well as anxiety by depleting your brain's CAPABILITY to create serotonin for a time. This is not exclusive to bipolar people. This is a common phenomenon with people that use and abuse MDMA.  Short answer? **Bad.

The thing is, any effect that lithium is having on you now, if you stop cold turkey you will quite literally shock your system and if you are bipolar, that could be enough to trigger a manic episode.**PLEASE** get a second opinion. I wouldn't return to this person, frankly. You don't just \"know by looking\" whether someone has been manic or not.

They say that nothing else cuts it, and I believe them. I rely on hydroxyzine pamoate myself to manage my anxiety, though it's only on an as needed basis.However, through my research I learned that the recommended window of use for benzos is several weeks to a few months, and they're not intended to be used for years on end. Prescriber...COMPETENCE aside, whether they know that or not, I think this is absolutely something that should be discussed with pts. I've been interested in drugs for years, and I research medication that I'm on or that I may be considering for my own bipolar treatment, or that my boyfriend uses for his diabetes, or just something that I find interesting, and honestly, benzos scare the fuck out of me.  I don't ever want to use them for myself. The worst thing, I think, is the neurological damage that can result for years after benzos are stopped. [This documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVoFlGR7Lhs) really filled me in on a lot of those, as the documentor himself suffers a lot of the consequences of benzo cessation, among many other things.

Unmedicated I can't focus, I have a million things going through my head, I can't maintain any concentration, or I'm so agitated that I can't possibly sit down and do this, I've got to get up, I've got to go, or I'm on the verge of a panic attack and I'm out for the count.Being able to focus, concentrate, develop my ideas, my technique, learn the music, learn the patterns, incorporate new fingering in my piano playing, make new connections in my research... These are all things I'm able to do because I have stability coming from my medications. The quality is higher, my enjoyment is greater, and my content is as original as ever as it was off meds. Put another way, it's working smarter, not harder. Your creativity doesn't come from your manic mood swings. Your creativity comes from you.Definitely check out Marbles by Ellen Forney. She's a cartoonist and dealt with medications and adjustments etc. for over ten years, which she really goes into in her book. It's a very intimate look and I think you would get a lot out of it.", "link_id": "t3_8icqqp", "time": 1525965707}}

Lithium transport into cells is a kind of a facilitated transport; however, lithium transport out of cells needs active transport involving the assistance of the Na+-potassium (K+) ATPase pump. The pathways for transporting lithium out of cells are more limited, resulting in intracellular lithium accumulation (5). All these mechanisms show that hyponatremia facilitates lithium intoxication. The long term use of lithium salts might have influenced the sodium levels of our patients, and the hyponatremic blood level may have caused lithium intoxication (6). ....... Chronic lithium intoxication is a life threatening, severe situation. Hyponatremia is a facilitating factor of lithium intoxication. Serum sodium levels should be regularly checked with serum lithium.\"I was at work earlier and wasn't able to provide my sources, but the above and other research that I've done have convinced me that this is a vital thing to pay attention to when you're on lithium.", "link_id": "t3_8g9gfx", "time": 1525227647}}

I'm not railing on BPD, its literally in the diagnosis.When I was first diagnosed, I actually really struggled with this quite badly. \"Am I making it up? Am I just imitating symptoms because I know what to look for? Is learning all I can about Bipolar disorder hurting me because I could be unconsciously faking symptoms because I'm trying to make myself fit in my diagnosis?\"It's significantly calmed down and, honestly, I don't struggle with this anymore. But it was a constant conflict, a constant \"what the hell is going on in my brain\" question.However, I think that in differentiating bpd and bp (speaking only as someone with BP), as far as symptom presentation, particularly in response to symptom appropriation, the difference lies in how symptoms are generated, I think.Bipolar symptoms are in the context of an episode. Sleep deprivation, stress, anxiety, any number of factors may destabilize a bipolar person and from there their moods and actions and beliefs will be heavily influenced by their current state.My guess is that a person with bpd would intentionally exhibit the outward signs of symptoms to, like you said, get attention and may even believe that they are in fact experiencing manic or depressive symptoms, fooling themselves in the process. But this would be an act, as opposed to behaviors, actions and beliefs precipitated by brain state. This would, obviously, greatly increase the time it takes to get correct treatment.

{"dxbj1yi": {"text": "Must not type massive response...must not type massive response...WILL type massive response after work. LOL I just started lithium so I have plenty of advice about my own experience. Welcome to the lithium generation!EDIT: Massive response incoming! Then bed...So: I started just recently at 150mg lithium, and I am currently on 300mg lithium twice daily. I expect to be bumped up come my next appointment in a few weeks here. I've definitely had to adjust quite a few things in my life, but nothing extreme, so there's that.The biggest thing I did not realize when I started lithium is the effect it would have on my electrolyte levels. **Lithium impedes your ability to reabsorb sodium.** This is extremely important. This can lead to [hyponatremia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyponatremia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373711) if you don't replenish your electrolytes regularly. Sports drinks, coconut water, etc. When I first started lithium, three days after being on just 150 mg/daily, I had massive brain fog, fatigue, muscle weakness/spasming, and this all turned around LITERALLY in seconds when I grabbed some Gatorade. Holy fucking shit, instant turn around. Lesson learned: **DRINK. YO. ELECTROLYTES.** (It's what plants crave, and guess what, you're a plant now. Maybe.)Managing lithium levels: Your doctor will track your lithium serum level via regular blood tests, yes. Couple of things to note: **Dehydration can abnormally increase your lithium blood concentration, and this can lead to severe side effects and possible lithium toxicity at higher doses. DRINK YO WATER.** Typical therapeutic range is 0.6 mmol/L - 1.2 mmol/L. Last time I was tested, at 150mg, I was at 0.1 mmol/L. Yay progress!This plays into the next topic, NSAIDs: Non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. Naproxen, ibuprofen, aspirin (yes, aspirin is an NSAID), all of these can ALSO elevate your body's lithium levels by affecting your body's ability to absorb the lithium in your blood. Non-pharmacist, non-pdoc, keyboard warrior Brocktreee's opinion is that at low level doses (like mine) it's not a HUGE deal taking small doses from time to time for incidental pain, but it's better to move to **acetaminophen/paracetamol** for pain relief. (Max dose 3000mg/daily, and don't take too much! It's rough on your liver.)Side effects I had when I started lithium included:* Metal mouth -- metallic taste. This went away in less than a week, and though I noticed it briefly when my dose was upped, it has not come back.* Brain fog -- Ugh. Oh fuck me. This sucked. Bad. This came from taking my medication in the MORNING, on an empty stomach. I moved my dose to nighttime, and this resolved itself, particularly as my body adjusted.* Diarrhea -- Le sigh. Yep. Five times in my first two hours of the day, once. **Taking lithium with food has completely removed this symptom and the accompanying nausea.*** Muscle twinges -- I've...always had these? So I don't really attribute it to lithium per se, but it's a possible side effect, so ehh.Here's the thing: Lithium side effects DO level out and go away. Mine were through in about a week. But those first few days were fucking terrible. Stick with it. It will get better. I'm currently on lithium and lamictal (200mg), and I do feel it's been helping, but I'm 100% sure I'm still at subtherapeutic lithium levels. So. No results really as of yet, though I have noticed a...calmer-ness? To my mood? Ish? Maybe it's just me? Dunno./wordvomit", "link_id": "t3_8c21o5", "time": 1523651787}}

The results, predictably, were disastrous.I had a psychotic episode when I hit puberty that lasted for a long time, started, fueled, and maintained by my Mormon beliefs. Everything from believing that I was seeing angels, to having conversations with a god angry that I was masturbating, to being attacked and \"being made gay\" by Satan... I was divorced from reality.Before I renounced my faith, when I was still a believer, I realized \"I cannot believe in the existence of Satan, for the sake of my mental health.\" Any further belief would have fueled my assumption that the psychotic symptoms I was experiencing were, in fact, real.Here I am now, six years down the road, having formally resigned from the Mormon church. I can honestly say losing my religion was one of the best things to ever happen to me. It was extremely rough, mind you... I had to throw out my basic assumptions about the universe and rebuild them. Carl Sagan and Thomas Paine were very influential in this process. But once I stopped attributing natural or happenstance occurrences to the will of some mercurial god that whimsically decides to help us find our car keys (or not), the more...**stable** everything became. Being able to base my assumptions and my actions off of what is actually happening, instead of seeking a supernatural cause, has been an enormous source of stability in my life, especially since I attributed nearly every psychic symptom I felt to God or Satan. Since, according to the founder Joseph Smith, Satan only has as much influence over us as we allow, if I'm having sex dreams involving other, older men and waking up with jizz in my pants, then I must be giving Satan control over me while I'm asleep.

I take the time I need to process it, but then I force myself to share it, to get it out in the open, to make sure my partner(s) are aware. Maybe this would help you.

{"dw1zrc6": {"text": "Here's my non-psychiatrist thoughts on that:Epilepsy as a disease is characterized by so-called \"neuron storms\", where the brain is affected by cascades of neurons firing far faster and much more than they should.Medications for this, including lamictal, mediate the neuron's ability to reuptake electrolytes that are necessary to communicate a signal, effectively slowing these storms down. In a way, bipolar disorder is a neuronal storm of emotion and action, centered in the frontal lobe, which affects behavior, learning, motor function, personality, all aspects that are magnified and warped by the disorder. Anti-epileptics slow down our own neuron storms, our hypomanias and subsequent depressions, by reducing the ability of our neurons to sustain these storms.This also backs up the theory of \"kindling\" mood episodes, where episodes require a certain buildup before cascading over into full blown manias or hypomanias. These can happen on their own, or due to external factors, but the buildup is almost always there before onset occurs.That's what I think, based off my research into the topic. Absolutely fascinating. (Again, not a doctor!)", "link_id": "t3_86018g", "time": 1521648784}}

{"dvxd8bd": {"text": "Let's break it down a little bit:Like Doggostrophic said, there are several distinct mood states: Euthymia (normal), then below and above: Dysthymia (the blues), depression, hypomania, and mania.Entering into or coming out of one of these mood states, however, includes what are called **prodromes:** an early symptom indicating the onset of a disease or illness. Prodromal signs may include things like unusual cheerfulness, aggressive driving, slight feelings of disinhibition around money, increased sociality, but as individual symptoms, and not observable throughout the day. During this time you may be **subsyndromal**: characterized by or exhibiting symptoms that are not severe enough for diagnosis as a clinically recognized syndrome. In contrast, syndromal behaviors constitute the mood states we covered earlier: Dysthymia, depression, hypomania, mania. These mood states build up and fall down over time, though some people (hiiiii) may experience mood shifts in the course of a single day. Medication is usually designed to extend your prodromal period (the buildup) and shorten the length of time you remain syndromal, where unmedicated it may be a faster buildup and you may stay manic, hypomanic or depressed for longer. It's definitely possible to be subsyndromal--feeling hypomanic but *not quite all the way,* feeling certain symptoms but not all of them, and if you're picking up on that **great!** That lets you address these things, nip them in the bud before they get out of hand.I strongly recommend reading The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide by Stephen Miklowitz.

I laid down a list of hypomanic behaviors I know I've exhibited in the past, and he told me to go see a doctor.My response, and I quote: &gt;Fuck. Fuckfuckfuck. Fuck! God fucking shit damn cunt fuck fuck fuck fuck! FUCK! :@ &gt;Why ? :( Fuck me :( Why did this happen? I need to remember that self diagnosis is dangerous, I'm not a medical professional, and I need their opinion.Two things happened there: One, I started to believe that I am actually bipolar. Two, I began absolutely dreading the prospect of visiting a mental health professional. I know that bipolar is a degenerative disease and I was scared to death of the things that I might do untreated, so I felt I really needed a diagnosis, but I had also been subject to throw-pills-against-the-wall psychiatry as a kid. I suspect that that may have contributed to my psychotic-manic episode I had, being on antidepressants and vyvanse (!) at the time. My sister is bipolar and I have depression and thyroid problems and alcoholism on both sides of the family (and my dad is autistic--winning!), so I'm a slam dunk genetically for bipolar. As it turns out my instincts were right--current diagnosis is BP-NOS with anxiety NOS. Funny thing is after my initial diagnosis, even though I went to them and said \"I think I have a mood disorder\", and hoping to actually be diagnosed bipolar because hell yeah validation, after my diagnosis my mood immediately shifted into wishing I was anything but bipolar. It took me a few weeks to adjust to the diagnosis, but I'm at peace with it and undergoing treatment for it.Here's the bottom line: We cannot diagnose you. The only way to resolve this absolutely legitimate worry you have about being undiagnosed is to make a visit with a medical professional and get a reference so you can be properly seen. Something that my big brother said really helped me when I was in the throes of accepting that this might be going on, and I think it may help you: \"It's neither a cross on my back nor a badge on my chest, it's just a filter, a frame of reference.\" A way to understand your own behavior better.

I usually have a massive buildup of anxiety OR I try to catch the wave of energy, and end up acting giddy and hyper and happy and impulsive and reckless and stupid.

This is my biggest frustration with my boyfriend too.... **I don't know what I can tell him to say or tell him to do that will get me to listen when I'm elevated.** I'm trying to internalize the message I heard from here and / that, ultimately, I'm responsible for my behavior and I can't excuse it on my elevated mood. I have to control myself. And that is such a JAGGED pill to swallow. &gt;But also doesn't want me to treat him differently because of the disease, and try to stop him from doing everything because of it. That is, unfortunately, not a possibility. You absolutely have to treat him differently when he is hypo/manic because he is, functionally, impaired. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmlIjzXSe1U) was very insightful to me, as far as how this woman deals with her bipolar spouse when he's manic. Maybe you can get something from this vid. She has some really good points. Most notably: She's picked up on the warning signs that point to her husband's mania. This not only clues her in, but it has the potential to clue her husband in.This is where things get worse: Bipolar disorder comes with [anosognosia](http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/key-issues/anosognosia): Lack of insight into one's own illness. PLEASE watch [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lstn6WNnCRc) for a professional and extremely insightful look into anosognosia. I think this is a very hard thing to accept, personally and as an SO, and this talk really helped me. It's in two parts.&gt;He said he's angry because he can't tell if what he's feeling is genuine or not, and the fact his good mood is actually a BAD thing is getting him down. Yeah. \"Where does my personality end and my disorder begin\" is such a hard fucking question. It's fucking depressing, too! You don't know what's \"safe\" to feel, what's \"safe\" to entertain, and you don't know if the smallest thing is leading to mania before you lose awareness of what's setting in.&gt;I think he's still accepting his diagnosis.It definitely sounds like it.

I felt euphoric, so happy about what I was doing and the response I anticipate, and I wanted to stay up and keep working keep working keep working. But I made myself go to bed, and after 8 hours of sleep, I'm feeling refreshed and happy, and not hypomanic anymore.Previously, before I started meds, I had a very clear and vivid hallucination/delusion as I was going to bed, that I was a 26 year old Caucasian woman named Jessica being held in stasis by aliens.

An anecdote from this weekend, actually, that just came to mind, when I was extremely anxious: The thing about my anxiety, when I get like that, I become much more prone to snap decisions and suggestions because my gut instinct is \"do whatever I can to resolve this anxious/awkward situation.\" So that's what we were talking about--more specifically, my tendency to make small decisions on his behalf, something that we're still talking about (ingrained behavior, I swear I'm working on it!). Anyway. I'm driving, trying to keep calm and keep my impulses under control while we were discussing my behavior, when in the course of the conversation and exasperated, he began to pantomime me with his voice raised. That's when I outright yelled and told him to stop what he was doing, that I am trying to control my anxiety and my tendency to micromanage small things. It just felt absolutely uncalled for, and it felt like he wasn't giving me credit for my efforts to keep myself under control. That's actually a complaint that's come up before that I've successfully addressed with him.I'm working on the micromanaging thing. Mostly it's small comments or things that I normally wouldn't think twice about, except that he's brought it up. (I'm trying to be helpful!) But his snide mockery (which is uncharacteristic of him) when I was trying to discuss my behavior calmly may have just been frustration, or a sign that he needs to maybe not take my anxious behaviors so personally?I don't know. I'm just trying to figure this out and it's hard trying to suss everything out without him actually present to discuss it. LOL I'm 100% certain there are details from this interaction that I'm not remembering. I swear I'm not trying to make him look bad...just point out that there is room for improvement on both sides.

I don't want a blood vessel to burst while 30 minutes away from any hospital, especially in my scrotum. &gt; I feel like you could negotiate your limits (as a sub) when you're lucid/not in a mood episode, and the dom would then have to adhere to them even if your demands got over the top while manic.Absolutely, 100%. This is what my Dom has said he's done previously, acting as \"a grounding influence\". I've known him for a few years, scened a lot with him, and he knows me, especially when I get manic mid-scene. He's kept me safe and I really trust him with my body and mind.&gt; I think in any responsible scene, there should be some kind of realistic expectation of what is safe, and it shouldn't come down to just the sub's judgement anyway... It's a collaboration, after all, and it's still the dom's job to be alert and keep you safe.You're right on the money. :D I've ended scenes before as the Dominant when my submissive wasn't able to gauge where they were headspace-wise, and seen to their aftercare, and I've had other scenes ended for me when my rage and energy came barreling out of nowhere. It's fucking terrifying sometimes. Once I started getting flogged, and shortly after we started I snapped. Started bellowing in animalistic rage, slapping the concrete wall as hard as I could, crying, shaking... I vented, my Dom ended the scene, and I was able to calm down, but there's no way in hell I was thinking clearly there.&gt; I think it would be flat out irresponsible for someone with bipolar disorder to be a dom.

He previously expressed interest in pain play for this reason, and ever since the question of how BDSM interfaces with the urge to self harm stuck in my craw. It's a phenomenally intriguing question.Let's be honest: Most kink scenes end up with an aspect of pain, and endorphin rushes (\"sub space\") are often the goal of scenes, though not always. But it's in a safe, controlled space (ideally), and though there are definitely aspects that could be considered self harm if done to oneself, if a Dominant is cognizant of the submissive's limits and is in tune to when they should push or hold back, the submissive might find the release they want.Enter the ethical considerations of aiding someone in pursuing physical pain to the same ends that self harm includes, and whether that's fundamentally different because it's in a controlled scene...

Bottom line: **Medication does not eliminate the mood swings, but it can soften the edges and make them easier to handle.**I can't speak to your friend's experience as I have no idea what he was using, what doses, etc. But to my own experience, I have noticed several major improvements already, even though I'm not at therapeutic levels yet according to my psych. The first night I took lamictal I actually became hypomanic! It's provided an undercurrent of energy to my evenings, and it's definitely helped me bounce back from a depression I was in, but even today I've noticed I'm still... Susceptible to mood swings.To the other drug I take, vistaril (hydroxyzine pamoate), it's helped calm me down and avoid a full blown panic attack at work once already. When my brain is way too fucking turned on and elevated, it very gently brought me down and helped me relax. The alternative to this would have been a panic attack. Right now, I'm very grateful for my medicine. I know I'm bipolar and I need medication, period.

That really resonates well with me.That said, I think of my brain as inherently Bipolar: There is a distinction between bipolar behaviors (hypo/manic behaviors or depressive behaviors) and EPISODES, by definition. I can, and do, exhibit bipolar behaviors every single day, but because I am able to rein them in (mostly) and change the trajectory of my behavior, they are kept from developing into EPISODES, which are protracted periods of time with the behaviors present.With that in mind, sometimes I'm the victim of biology. My ultra-rapid cycling brain IS GOING to be depressed and then super euphoric. But the cognitive aspect (ruminating, beating myself up, or conversely indulging in grandiose ideas and plans) can be suppressed and it's effect on my behavior minimized. This influences my emotions, inevitably. Like, earlier today I got it in my head that I should quit my job so I can go to pharmacy school in a city 4 hours away because I've always been interested in drugs and oh my God I'm high on lamictal. I was able to recognize and label that train of manic impulsivity as a big red flag and actively suppress it. It sucked, but it did help bring down my brewing mood. (Starve the beast.)In turn, because I didn't quit my job, the inevitable depressive crash has less ammunition to throw at me when it happens, because behaviors driven by manic impulses did not get a chance to happen.I'm blathering.

{"dsq56jo": {"text": "Welcome on board. It's serendipitous that almost 60 days ago I got my bipolar diagnosis and today is my first psychiatrist appointment since my diagnosis.It rocked my fucking world when I was diagnosed. I didn't know where I began and my disorder ended, if that makes sense. One big thing that really helped me is The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide by Stephen Miklowitz. You can get it cheap on Amazon. It gave me a big picture of bipolar, and the small picture: What depressive and manic symptoms can manifest as, the life cycle of an episode, the existence of ultradian cycling (which I suspect I am), an overview of medications, how to handle employer questions, family conflict,.... There's a fuckton of information. Make that your first buy.That said, I also suggest downloading eMoods. You can use it to start tracking your moods and taking timestamped notes of your moods and thoughts. I just printed out my last 60 days of notes and I've been going over them before my appointment. Here's the thing: you are bipolar, but this is not all of you. You are still you. You were bipolar before your diagnosis and you still are. the biggest thing that's changed is your awareness of what's going on, and the realization that you have a tendency towards behaviors that are, frankly, pathological. But things can get better, and your moods can be stabilized.It feels like the world is torn out from under your feet. You'll find it again.

You'll have to decide if that makes sense for you, but if they understand what's been going on, maybe they'd be willing to give you more time.One of the primary treatments for depression is referred to as \"behavioral activation.\" In essence: if you start taking showers, looking after your nutritional needs, getting exercise, cutting back on alcohol, these positive behaviors will have a positive overall effect on your health and mood and help to improve your depression and state of mind, WHILE at the same time decreasing the stress that comes from NOT doing these things in the first place. Mentally, depression is an ugly cycle that feeds off itself: You don't have the energy to do what needs to be done, which leads to things not being done, which leads to you feeling like shit for not getting things done, which decreases the energy you have to do things, which leads to things not being done....

Did you find comfort eventually find comfort? How? Where is the assurance other than a doctor who believes everything I say, or a website I can\u2019t question?In order; Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. See below. See below.I was only diagnosed this November. Since then I've been tearing myself apart (figuratively) via introspection, going over past behaviors, my childhood psychotic episode, obsessive thoughts I've struggled with, analyzing temperament and behavior, trying to see where I fit...I found my peace largely from two things. One: Mood is not A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. Mood is a descriptor of how you feel over an extended period of time. It's the background music to your daily life. It's there, you know it's there, but it's not necessarily something you're always consciously aware of. Learning this helped me relax about not always noticing when I'm hypo/manic or depressed: Sometimes, most of the time I'm just responding to what's going on in my head without realizing it.And two, time. Obsessing less about my condition, going about my day, but remaining vigilant about what I'm going through and watchful for any prodromal signs that an episode may be gearing up.Which leads me to my favorite new word: Anosognosia. You described it well:&gt; I\u2019m unconvinced I\u2019m ill and I\u2019m unconvinced if I want to not be ill at the same time.Lack of insight into your own condition is what anosognosia describes. It's a hallmark of bipolar, unfortunately. And the fact that we suffer slight amnesias especially as we transition through manic/depressive phases doesn't help matters. \"Of course I'm well, I haven't been depressed!\"&gt;I\u2019m telling literally anyone who will listen all about my personal life and my illness because... well I have no idea what I\u2019m expecting to hear from them. I want to gently suggest that you stop doing this, pick a few close friends, and discuss your condition and things that you learn about it and insights you've had about yourself with them. Or start a journal, so you have a constant outlet.You're much like me: You're churning through as much information as you can possibly process, analyzing your previous behaviors, trying to understand what the F is going on and you need a place to express and figure things out. I use eMoods, FacingUs.org/journal , a few close friends and this subreddit primarily, but there is so much stigma around bipolar that unfortunately it's a bit safer in the closet, right now at least, especially since you're in such a turbulent place trying to land and get some sense of \"OK, I've got this.\"Best of luck. &lt;3", "link_id": "t3_7p7lxk", "time": 1515516198}}

They can be positive or negative, and they are the first step our minds take to begin to process things. I have been raped twice in my life. And for a long time afterwards, I suppressed the memories. They came back in flashes, and until I was able to sit down and allow myself the time I needed to fully process the emotions that those incidents brought up, I wasn't able to move on. By allowing myself to experience what I was feeling, not trying to push them out, not trying to banish or exorcise them, I was able to finally leave them alone and move on.I practice mindfulness with every single intrusive and obsessive thought I get. I acknowledge it's there, ignore it and move on. It leaves of it's own accord. [Here's a website](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/) that talks more about mindfulness.

{"druk0pf": {"text": "Today's been very weird. I feel like I need to get it all down. I'll be adding this to my journal after I write it all out...How did I start today. Anxious. Lots of anxiety today. I've been trying to keep it in my head that the way I feel in the morning upon waking up IS NOT a predictor of the way I'll feel all day. I'm glad I held on to that.My boyfriend brought me breakfast in bed, totally unexpected but very good! Got my blood sugar up, which is crucial for me to function correctly in the morning.Work was super fucking busy because a coworker was out yesterday and we had some work carry over. All the same... I GOT ALL MY WORK DONE, and caught significantly caught up. I'm so happy about that.Ever since my diagnosis 45 days ago, I've been devouring everything I can find on bipolar disorder. I mean come on! My sister is bp2, has been for years, my dad has depression and Aspergers, I was diagnosed with adhd as a kid (I don't think this is accurate at all anymore???), and I know I had a psychotic break/manic episode as a kid. I was on antidepressants (lexapro, welbutrin) at the time, deeply religious, hitting puberty, and unable to reconcile my sexuality with a fundie religion that nearly drove me insane. (You know what I mean.)All that said...I don't really have major depressive episodes. Until my boyfriend reminded me of something that happened in the past year or so I thought that was the case. Then he reminded me that I had previously contracted gonorrhea, and when I found that out, I went into a depression that lasted a fucking MONTH. I felt guilty, I felt responsible for what happened, I felt fucked up, dirty, worthless, wrong, responsible for giving it to someone else, like I failed, I was fucking depressed! But when I got the all clear my mood lifted. Right? Didn't it? Major depressive episodes don't have to have triggers PER SE I'm realizing, but in writing this out I realize that bipolar episodes have definite triggers, so why wouldn't depressive episodes? I have no doubt I was depressed then...but I have no idea if it was tied to a specific hypomanic episode around or near that time.Anyway. That's really been bugging me. REALLY been bugging me. Not because I contracted gonorrhea at one point, but the fact that I could and did forget about this stint of time that I was so severely depressed. How could I have forgotten that? Of course, I was fairly oblivious to my own mental health and harboring a deep mistrust of mental health professionals, following my experience as a kid with \"throw pills at them and see what works\" psychiatry. That said...here we go into the big thing I noticed today.I was watching a bunch of documentaries on ERs at work (like you do with an office job), and wandered over to watch psychiatric ER documentaries, in no small part because the opportunity to see patients that have bipolar IN A CLINICAL SETTING may help me identify certain behaviors in myself that I've previously missed. Self-published youtube videos and [wacky videos meant to describe a patient interview with mania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrzvsRqlgdc) can only go so far. And that's not very far at all. LOLAnyway, I caught myself keeping track of, specifically, \"What symptoms I would need to present to a clinician to be treated for X Y and Z.\" At the same time, I noticed that I was drawing an affinity between myself and certain patients that showed up on the documentary, seeing what fit and what didn't, which is totally normal I think. But the fact that I was keeping track of what I would need to do or say and exhibit to make someone think something's wrong...seems fucking creepy to me. I also looked at a few local hospitals for what positions they had open, because watching all these documentaries makes me want to get into medicine, and I've been interested in medicine ever since I was a kid. I also started doubting whether I should really put so much stock in a diagnosis that was reached after a single two hour meeting with a therapist that I'll never speak to again, who I spoke to with the premise \"I think I have a mood disorder.\" It still seems sensible to me to question my diagnosis, because I know how our minds can sometimes fool ourselves--psychosomatic behaviors/thoughts/feelings. The rest of the day I've been \"on guard\" against my own mind, as it were, trying to watch my behavior very carefully. But I haven't been exhibiting any traits of my hypomania. And I'm seriously doubting whether it's actually, factually the case that I've had any symptoms of hypomania or depression, and how they could be connected.Which I guess is a good sign that I'm currently in remission? It's objectively true that I have my journal entries, now over a month's worth, written down. From the times that I thought and felt I'm hypomanic. And that's all I can really rely on right now, I think, that and the belief that my mind and my senses are what I use to divine truth about myself and my world and that that's all I have. I have to count on myself. I have to believe myself. Hell, I'm reviewing the symptoms of Munchausen syndrome right now, and the signs around it, but based off my reading and my personal history and family history I'm very confident that I'm not making my symptoms up for attention or emotional validation. It's just so fucking hard right now. And on top of this, a fellow redditor expressed serious suicidal ideation and intention ( [they had already cut themselves and posted about wanting to slice open an artery, after posting about being alone and depressed on Christmas and wanting to get out of town](/spoiler) ), and I haven't heard anything from them. I told them to call 911. No idea if they're even still alive right now. AND at my second job, [a professional servicing a particular area was murdered by her husband in the past month, so we took over her clients. I spent some time tonight going through the files that we just recently got. Tons of emails and letters from her are printed out and included in their files, and something as simple as \"Sent from my iPhone\" is just fucking HAUNTING. She's dead. She's gone. And now I'm going to be working with the people who she left behind, with files that she handled herself.](/spoiler)I'm writing this right now while my bf and roomie watch Miracle on 34th Street.
