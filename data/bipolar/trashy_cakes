That should help prevent/reduce feeling overwhelmed. I recommend sticking to your meds and staying in contact with your psychiatrist. Are you in therapy?

She's been abusive since I was a kid, as well as an alcoholic. I moved out at 18 and moved back home about 6 years later since she kept asking me for money and she needed someone around to \"help her\" (read: abuse). I didn't recognize the abuse when I was kid but after living with her as an adult, shit got pretty bad. She hit me, gaslighted me, invalidated my feelings (even when trying to relate to her), berated me, etc. The final straw was when I had my first manic episode and she treated me like shit during it, didn't try to help at all. My boyfriend saved me and helped me move out. I guess my advice is to love her from a distance, if you can even find it in your heart to do so. I'm so sorry you're going through this. I know how upsetting it can be. But if you feel like it's best to go no contact, especially if you can help your siblings that way, then so be it.

Luckily she's been my bff for almost 20 years so she knew what I meant and said she took no offense. This was a great reminder, OP.
