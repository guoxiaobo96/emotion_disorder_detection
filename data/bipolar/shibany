I always keep account of which sim has the most energy-repleting activities available/coming up so I can save them for the longest activity coming up.Same concept with earning duckies: if the next step requires me to earn so many duckies, I won't click Collect on a completed spa event until that step is current.Also use one cupcake (not more, they won't stack bonus) in every spa event for an extra 90 duckies! Another minor but helpful thing is keeping in mind which sims are better (faster) at their caree stories; i.e., if I need to complete a long event for llamazoom, I won't put my newbie level 5 lawyer on that task, I'll put my level 10 doctor on it.Hope that helps!

She felt more remorseful of her actions for poor Harriet and she wouldn't have cared so much if it had only been herself that was injured by this massive error. She really does have a good heart, and just like anybody, can truly intend to change her ways and fall back into a bad habit. The best first step is that she finally acknowledges it as such! It would be completely unrealistic (as in many stories) if she repented and never made the mistake again. People seem to think if they overcome an obstacle they'll never have to encounter it and fail again, but life is often fighting the same battle over and over. We're human. It's what we do.I'm liking Emma more with each chapter, so I find it humorous to come here and see y'all disliking her equally as much lol.Also I enjoyed Emma unintentionally (though consciously) contradicting her own opinion just to vex Mr. Knightley. I wouldn't see their impending romantic entanglement as clich\u00e9 per se, except in the sense that their personalities butt heads and that is certainly a favorite of romantic plots because, well, it's the most fun to read. That being said, I think Austen does a great job of not making it COMPLETELY obvious that they'll end up together; at this point we're still not sure and wondering!Anyway, their respective wits are certainly a match, but more than that, I can see the one tempering the other in their strong opinions (values of which they share, though both often hide it) and stubbornness by intellectually reasoning the other towards a middle ground, though of course neither would admit it to the other just yet. I'm a sucker for romance so perhaps I'm biased, but I think their familial sparring-type relationship will develop into sudden and true understanding of the other with overpowering affection and I can't wait 'til they realize it lol.", "link_id": "t3_f1f1kk", "time": 1581376949}}
