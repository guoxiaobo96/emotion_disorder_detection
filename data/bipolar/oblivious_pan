Like, couldn't hurt a fly. She wants to be friends with everything, and wants to be pet constantly. She likes to sit outside all day, ideally with another human. We used to go on hikes and we could let her off leash with no issues. She runs up ahead, then runs back to us, then repeats. She's super loyal, and always makes sure we're following her. She does the same thing if she goes dowm the stairs at the same time as a human! She goes down the first few steps, then looks back to make sure we're following her. She lets out a couple barks when someone comes to the door because she wants to be friends so badly! But it's only a couple barks, and she tries really hard to stay quiet because she's a good girl who wants to make us happy. We probably could've trained her not to do that when she was younger, but she's not so good at learning new tricks now. She LOVES new people, and doesn't need even a second to warm up to them. She'll be asking for pets as soon as they walk through the door. She's great with kids, too! They're often scared of her at first because she's pretty big, but every kid I know warms up to her within 5-10 minutes.She doesn't shed or slobber, but she gets water stuck in her fur every time she drinks. It's a mild annoyance. She loves water, though. We get scared she'll drown in the bath because she sticks her face in the water. She does the same with snow.She's a very good dog.

A tiny homework assignment doesn't need to be treated like a summative assignment; those little assignments should probably take 30 minutes at most. It's not healthy to work all the time.

Without the skill I've built over the years, I always felt even worse because I already had negative emotions AND I had a shitty looking drawing. Bummer!I'd recommend painting, though. You don't need any practice or anything to feel good about an abstract painting. Just put the paint where you feel it should go and mix it around, let it get on your fingers. Pick the colours that represent your emotions (like purple is happy for me because it's my favourite colour, deep blue is sad, crimson is anger). Maybe try to blend two colours together? Just let the paint flow on the page. Don't worry about making anything, just focus on how it feels to push the paint around on the canvas. I find just having that sensory connection (sight with the look of the colours and their placement, touch with the feeling of the paint if you get it on your fingers) can really calm me down when I'm feeling overwhelmed.You can get acrylic paint and canvases at dollar stores for very little money. Paint brushes from the dollar store can be frustrating because the hairs fall out into the paint a lot, so I'd get like one thicker and one thinner brush from an art supply store. Stick to a limited palette in the beginning if you want to avoid muddy brown colours. Maybe just a saturated colour like a royal blue, as well as black and white? At least, that may minimize frustration in the beginning until you're more comfortable with paints.

I've never had trouble starting a new antidepressant, and I've been on like four of them haha. Of course, that's just me. I have had a couple weird side effects, like a week or two of headaches or nausea in the beginning, but nothing lasting. If the side effects stick around, it's time for a trip to the psychiatrist.Missing a dose or two isn't really a huge deal. Meds stay in your system for a while. If you're going crazy after missing a single dose, something's probably wrong and the meds aren't really working. I've had periods where I didn't take my meds for weeks to months, and it wasn't great. Stopping meds without medical help can really suck. I felt really strange, like I was being electrocuted with no pain every time I moved my eyes almost. Of course, that was after an extended period of time when I stopped cold-turkey. Not a normal experience at all.My best advice is probably just trust your gut, though. If you're prescribed something that doesn't sit well with you, see your doctor. If you think something's wrong, trust yourself. There are a lot of antidepressants out there; keep trying until you find a treatment that works for you.I'm no expert, by the way. I've just been on a lot of meds and I know a lot of people who have been on a lot of meds.

I've had friends ask me for things when I was very clearly not doing well (they knew exactly what signs suggested that I wasn't doing well) and they'd still ask for favours. It wasn't even just that they were asking for favours, it was just that they weren't actually speaking to me unless they wanted something.I suppose I'm just realizing that nobody actually seeks out my friendship, or initiates conversations with me, unless they want something. A lot of the time it's much less obvious than the group of friends from above, but if I think about their actions and motivations it's clear. People text me when all of their other friends are busy but they're really bored. People talk to me when they really just want me to edit their essays. My therapist only listens to me because she gets paid to.It's a bummer, but I'm trying to just accept that that's how the world works. *also I just realized that this was a lot of words I'm very sorry*", "link_id": "t3_dtnsd2", "time": 1573396543}}

{"f4b0jq2": {"text": "In my local hospital in Canada, it's not so bad. Some units are more intensive than others though.I was allowed to shower in the shower room. There are two, and they're pretty big. No curtains or anything so you can't hang yourself, but the door does lock. The water is nice and warm, but it's an annoying little stream so you can't drown yourself. Still, probably one of the most relaxing places in the unit because you're actually alone.My experience in all units was that you could walk around and do pretty much anything on your own time. I spent a lot of time pacing around my room. We even had some exercise time, where we'd do laps around the unit or do a bunch of stretches, and once we went outside to the roof (completely enclosed in glass, no escaping) to play some sports. We had group therapy for a lot of the day, which was pretty generic, but nothing super invasive. You'll meet with a psychiatrist and a bunch of different mental health workers to talk more in depth about stuff, like why you're there and how you'll stay safe when you leave. Where I live, if you're an involuntary patient (formed, meaning legally you're not allowed to leave) you can't wear your own clothes. Once you're off the form, you can wear your own stuff. Our forms are 72 hours, but once I had a 2 week form. That probably won't happen, it was a chain of weird circumstances that caused that one. Honestly, it's just kind of boring in the hospital, but it's a good reset. Try to be open and honest, and you'll probably leave feeling better.Of course, any of this could change. My first stay was really scary, and I had no idea what to expect. I knew everywhere was different. Now, I know all of the workers in the hospital by name. I know which ones I like and which ones I try to avoid. I get the routine and know my way around.

They were told I'd be on the wait list for about 8 months. My parents never heard back, even after calling many times.After my second hospitalization about half a year ago, I started seeing a social worker and a mental health nurse at school weekly. The nurse tried to call the organization, and they said they had never heard of me. The nurse said it was probably because they were changing their management at the time.My third hospitalization was at the beginning of July. A social worker at the hospital wanted to try to fast-track the process for me because I had been waiting nearly 2 years. I'm still not receiving covered therapy right now; my parents need to pay out of pocket. I'm not really getting better.Over this whole process, I've been given some resources to use while I'm waiting. Tangerine is a free walk-in therapy centre, and it could be valuable for you if you need to talk right now.

Your doctor WILL know you self harm, and you may be pressured into certain treatments that you're not ready for.If you hide your injuries, you'll likely be far too warm all the time. People will wonder why you're wearing a cardigan when you're drenched in sweat.Situations where you can't self harm will be stressful. In a meeting and something bad happens? You don't have healthy coping skills to rely on to calm yourself, and you'll miss everything that's going on because all you can think about is self harming as soon as the meeting is over.You lose hours to self harm. You think you'll only be five minutes, and next thing you know it's midnight and you've been self harming since 5:00.There are so many reasons. I know this probably won't convince you, because you've experienced all of this before as a seasoned self harmer.

But, by changing the conversations in the ifunny chat to be respectful to him, it took away that space where he could use humour as a coping mechanism. It also would always feel like he was a burden, regardless of what you say, because depression warps thoughts. None of this is anyone's fault, because you didn't know, and chances are he didn't realize this was going on in his head either.I get your motivation for trying to help him, but you're not his therapist. I know it can feel like you have an obligation to help, but it can feel very stressful and isolating to have everyone analyzing you like that. He never asked to be psychoanalyzed by his friends, and was probably pretty rightfully pissed off for being grilled all the time.I'd say the emotional outbursts make him an asshole, but you know the situation better than I do and you say they don't.To me, it just sounds like a misinformed group of friends and a stressed friend being forced to recover when he's not ready. Nobody's an asshole, but everyone's quite rightfully upset.Moving forward, I'd suggest some professional help for your friend if he's not already getting that. Maybe you can help him get help by looking up how to access mental health support where you live and sending him your findings. But first, talk to your friend. Tell him you're sorry for putting him in that position, that you didn't mean to upset him. Tell him you would love to have him in the group chat if he's okay with that, but not if he's not ready or doesn't want to. That was kind of long winded, but this is a bit close to home for me.

Kid missed out on a year of important social development, rest needed to grow strong and healthy, and physical activity that could've boosted his mood. And his parents encouraged it!

I'm not sure if you're talking mood disorders, learning disabilities, or what, but the parents handled it really insensitively. When a kid has trouble meeting expectations because of something beyond their control, you work with them and support them so they can develop life skills while still being happy.
