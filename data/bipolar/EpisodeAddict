I haven't had a period since 17th September but I was hoping someone medical would confirm it. After coming home from my appointment I bought two more tests and did them both last night and this morning they showed negative. I phoned the midwife and she requested I do another test next week if I like but to otherwise wait for my first appointment at the hospital in two weeks time. I do not feel pregnant and have had no symptoms - for some that is lucky but for me it is scary. I tried to book a private early scan but they won't see me without a positive test which I don't have. So what would you lady's do in this situation?  By the way I'm in the uk. Yes I could wait but I'm so worried.
