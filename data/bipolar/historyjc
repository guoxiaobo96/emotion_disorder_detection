Stay on top of your homework, you dont have to complete your work ahead of time but turn it in!!Go to class! Even if you're not taking notes you are still receiving information. Establish relationships with professors!!! Email them talk to them!! When they see students willing to put in an effort they will put in an effort to help you the best they can. I used to get Ds and Cs but now I am a A and B student and its because I put in the effort and established relationships with my professors.

Talk to the people you sit next to you never know who you make friends with in college!!Make use of recources for example your school gym, counseling, tutoring and anything else of the like.
