My thinking is that a lot of the previous behaviors from being unstable are programmed into my head. My guess is that I have to force myself while being stable to reprogram those unhealthy behaviors and replace them with better ones. Another thought is that the medications treat specific symptoms and won't be able to readjust behaviors set in stone over decades of instability. Which makes me think that we always have some symptoms left, no matter the medications we take.

It will most likely also cut down on your food waste. A plus here is that you will save time to spend on more fun stuff if you plan well. I think the most valuble thing in my life is time, time well spent.If you can't afford to have a car, it helps the enviroment even further. Busses and trains are viable in most areas if you get used to the timings that fit your work hours and free time activites. Even better, i guess, is using a bike or something similar, that also benefits your health.Most of the things i own are second hand, like my clothes, furniture, and stuff.

I mean no disrespect, and I totally see your point, and I do agree with you overall, and please take what I am about to say in a none negative and constructive way. Let us try and put ourselves in their seat, just so we can try and understand their actions. If we understand them, there might be a good chance that we can keep our cool and appreciate what they did as well, even though it might be frustrating.First of all. You have family and relatives that care about you, this is the only possible reason they are even asking you this. Yes, they have no idea what they are talking about, but can you blame them? Bipolar disorder is an extremely complex illness, and I bet it has taken you a lot of work to understand it, even you, one of the people who are supposed to understand your illness the best, might think it's a mystery at times. We all know that even doctors with decades of studies and work behind their understanding, won't come close to someone who actually suffers from the disease. So how can we blame others like family and friends for not understanding? I try not to, I instead try to educate my family members the best I can, the better understanding they have, the better support I am able to receive from them.Again, I understand your frustrations, and please don't take this in a negative way, but in a constructive one. I mean, who wants to get frustrated with other people in the first place? I think *understanding* and *accepting* are two key-stones in my life, and the only way to achieve them is to practise, and what a perfect example when to.I wish you the very best, and I hope you are able to twist people's concerns into love, no matter how stupid and ignorant they might be :)Also, happy turkey day!", "link_id": "t3_e31uj8", "time": 1575027746}}

You add the sound of an old LP to give the track some extra soul and esthetics.Tech freaks also love the sound of different types of machines, some of the old analogue machines has their own distinct personalities, some of them give the track a dirty esthetic simply because of how they where put together, parts that you simply cannot get your hands on any longer.Creating music purely digital on a computer does not really have the same \"feel\", so creating your own lo-fi sound where necessary if that was the goal.I think lo-fi refers to chill-hop, a type of hip-hop with its roots in Japan, which has huge traction in the last couple of years, and the grandfather of the genre is called nujabees, rest his soul.Perhaps lo-fi is the westernized version of chill-hop. More of n expression rather then a genre. Digital music has \"high fidelity\", analogue music has low, there is something soothing about old analogue music for the young adults around the globe, it reminds us of our childhood. Which in turn adds to the chill factor of, chill-hop.I am no expert though, so take what I say with a grain of salt.", "link_id": "t3_d5zfj1", "time": 1568895450}}

Also common with psychedelics in general. It's called *trip* hop for a reason, at least in my experience :)I'd say many could be \"labled\" modern hippies or something close to it, since many of my friends listening to it where or are in the underground rave scene. At least the majority.Drugs are bad btw, kids, trust me. At least be very, very, careful please. All of them are *heavily* into music, all kinds of music.Many of them grew up spending time around the music scene, or, working within the music scene. I've spent time on countless events during my teens and early adulthood, all types of music. Forest raves(psy-trance), hip-hop jams, fooling around in studios creating minimal techno, you name it, I've been there and explored as much as I could. One time I ended up in an anarchist house/club out in the middle of nowere where they had punk bands play in the basement in front of I think max 30 people during the weekends, I don't think more people could fit. Some gave me a weird eye being the only kid there in hip-hop clothing. I also cry when I go to the royal concert hall to listen to classical music.Even though most of them are mostly into electronic music in general, a few are total metal heads, that's probably because it's very popular around here.One friend works as a studio musician creating video game sound effects now. Others play in Rock bands or work as DJs. Dj work was and is very common.What I'm trying to say is, everyone I ever met who are into downtempo loves good music.Everyone is totally chill and incredibly lovely people, peace and love all the way through.So, I guess you could lable us as music loving chill out let's go fishing and smoke a spliff group of people?I dunno, I don't like labels either.", "link_id": "t3_d5zfj1", "time": 1568836340}}

I hope the numbers of miss diagnosis has gone down and keep that course in the future as we learn more. Imagine being able to tell from a blood sample for example. If you have any at all thoughts that you might suffer from bipolar disorder, find a doctor able to actually diagnose. Sooner rather then later.

Accepting that is key for you to be able and forgive yourself, and start letting go of the regret.Sorry if i\u00b4m preachy and if i sound like i\u00b4m telling you what to do, i\u00b4m no professional, but if no one has told you that i would be honored to be the first. It\u00b4s just that i\u00b4m so well versed with the regret thing, it comes with the bipolar disorder, i have done so much stupid shit outside of my control, and i still fight with regret myself. That and shame comes hand in hand.I have basically never felt attractive my whole life, except two periods of my life, and of course those where during hypomanic episodes when i had lost most of my extra weight. Gaining and loosing a lot of weight need to be present for a diagnosis. It says so in the DSM book(The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders sets out a list of codes which identify each individual diagnosis used by psychiatrists).I learned something from those 2 periods though, it was not about the weight really. It was all in my head. The amount of self esteem during hypomania is insane, girls can feel it. Pheromones are flying all over the place due to increased sex drive and that self esteem. We all possess that power if we can learn to tap into it, even those with disabilities of any kind. Because it\u00b4s all projected from our brain in the first place, or within ourselves if you rather think of it that way, it\u00b4s not about the physical being. That change comes from inside. People try and get to it changing their physical self, or the physical world around them in their life, by going to the gym or buy a nicer car for example. it\u00b4s actually the other way around. If you learn to tap into that \"power\", the physical world around you will change.People are not really attractive to the physicality, most people dont realize that. It\u00b4s just a small barrier, either way. Why would you want to date someone so shallow anyways?I dont know, i\u00b4m so much talk and low action sometimes. But what i said is what i actually believe. If you manage to get strong enough to *feel* attractive again even with the changes to your body, that would make you even *more* attractive then before the accident in my eyes.

When the genre became more mainstream for a while.I for example. I grew up with it being played on mtv, radio, in movies etc, for a while. But i never knew really, i was to young being born in 1986. I have listened to \"weird\" music all my life, at least compared to everyone else around me. As a child i recorded Amiga game music through the speakers on to tape, thunderdome and all kinds of crazy shit. I was always a bit bullied in school, later on when i was around 10 i remember that i got called fatboy slim for example, lol. When i got to the age of 13 i got into hiphop more and more. First mostly gangsta main stream stuff. But soon after underground Swedish hiphop, where i am from. All my friends and some family members like my cousin where deep in the scene. We would go to hiphop jams on the weekend. Produce music, do graffiti, and everything in between. My cousin actually went to the \"rap gymnasium program\" we had, at a special school. And his music has been played on the radio. And many of the beats we produced where used by known rappers at the time.Later on i parted ways more and more with that group of people. And in my later teens(16-18) i got into the underground rave scene. Same thing there, i was pretty deep in the scene. My friends where DJ\u00b4s, producers, i helped arrange the forest raves around Stockholm and so on. My close friends at the time was the ones who really introduced me to stuff like Portishead, Air, Zero 7 and a lot of stuff either being triphop or closely related, when we where not dancing to minimal techno, psytrance and the like on the weekends. We would get high and hang out in nature, pick mushrooms and listen to downtempo. And with my background in hiphop, trip-hop was the natural next step really. My taste in music will probably always bounce around, but downtempo and triphop is at it\u00b4s very core now. So you can see how the journey towards it was quite acquired.These recent few of years i have been listening to a lot of psych rock/jazz and, honestly, all kinds of stuff. But i can still tell that trip-hop is at its core.I am curating my own playlist as well. Where i try and gather the music i love dating back to those days when i started listening to trip-hop. The goal is to create my own ultimate playlist that i can listen to until i die, songs that i can listen to 100 times and never get bored of. It\u00b4s not your typical trip-hop list though, quite a bit of jazz, funk and soul which i also always loved. I add music to it as i go on, quite a bit of it.I bet i can find some new music on your list from the looks of it!

A general definition of when people starting to cross bread *inside* and increase the THC amount of the plant itself. You could partly blame this on \"the war on drugs\", when making a substance illegal, a common occurrence when a substance is made illegal. When this is done the natural balance between THC and CDBa, the cannabinoid in its raw form. And CDB, which is what you consume if you heat up weed by smoking for example.

Without very carefully thinking about it, over a long period of time.I chose to be single and live in celibacy 7 or 8 years ago, i think. And that\u00b4s how its been ever since. It was around when i got diagnosed. I moved into a 100 year old house by myself out in the bush to work on myself during the decision, which is worth mentioning. No distractions was allowed.Initial reasoning was that, relationships have brought more pain then joy. Romance, falling in love, unhappy love, and everything about romantic relationships is a HUGE trigger for me. So it is something i have chosen to not include in my life for my own health.I don\u00b4t have the stomach to put a partner into a potential bad situation because of me. Like you said. It\u00b4s also, ok, this is very shame loaded for me, But what the heck. I developed a sex addiction, which is also partly why i made the decision. I think this is more common then it seems with people who has bipolar disorder. It makes sense to me at least, over sexuality combined with tendency for addiction. I am still working on my addiction problems, not only sex, but cannabis to. Been sober for over a year now, so it\u00b4s going forward, same goes for the sex addiction :)I also decided to not have children, i suppose finding a partner gets a bit tricky because of that as well. But that\u00b4s a problem for the future. I made this decision when i saw the percentage chance of my children to evolve BD, i would not wish it on my worst enemy, so the potential risk is to scary.I have pushed away the few women that has showed interest and initiated a romantic relationship. I make very clear that i have decided to stay single. It\u00b4s part logic, and partly i am afraid.There is good and bad in everything in life. I am still unsure about this decision ever since. But have also made the decision that i am willing to date again when i am *ready*, and as long as i keep working and get closer to that date i\u00b4m perfectly fine.Again, i can\u00b4t stress this enough, this is *not* something i would recommend anyone else doing, it\u00b4s a huge sacrifice.But what i can recommend is that, taking some time being single and work on yourself is healthy for anyone.

{"ekohocs": {"text": "It is very common with cognitive issues if you suffer from our disorder. First of all, when you have a hypomanic or manic episode the brain activity gets so high that it basically \"burns out\" your brain. This also happens during depressive episodes, not just mania.When i say cognitive side effects i do not talk about intelligence, cognitive functions like your ability to concentrate and your memory can take a tole. This is more often shown in people who has had the disorder for a longer time due to the amount of episodes that has a cured, it is also shown more often in older folks in general.These might be permanent, but most often these issues gets better over time after an epsiode. A lot of comments talk about medication side effects, this is also true in some cases. It can be hard to pinpoint what is and what is not.I want to give you an example from my own experience. I had a several month long, almost a year long hypomanic episode with a couple of weeks of full blown mania at the end about a year ago. After coming down with help of medications i had a severe depression of course, if it goes up it has to go down, and vice versa, the brain tried to balance it out, and i had a long ripple effect after(fast and severe cycles and mixed states.During this period of time i experienced some insane side effects to my cognitive functions. You know that feeling when your brain lags(mostly memory) during a de ja vu?(sorry if i miss spell this) I had that feeling constantly for weeks after. Not knowing if i had experienced what was going on before or not.I have had a really hard time finding words afterwards, it\\`s been getting a bit better. But even now a year later i have a hard time.For you who read this who might be afraid of diagnosis and start of treatment, please take t he step to try and prevent more episodes. I have been sick for 17 years now, since i was 16. And the bran damage is really starting to show. I had a huge wake up call, and i am willing to endure most medication side effects if it helps prevent new episodes.I wish you all the best and i hope we all do our best to prevent more episodes and protect the most important organ we have, the one thing that evolution have given us to survive the world.

On the other hand, people say i look good and i might see myself way uglier then i am. Sometimes pretty girls say i look good, i dunno. When that happens is almost always during my longer hypo states i have had, where i lost a ton of weight. To sum it up, i know i can look good if i spend time on trying to look good. Loose weight, shave, nice haircut etc, which i spend time on during the hypomania/mania.Funny thing is, when i realized that anyone can be pretty if they want to, i care even less about superficial things. I have always hated how superficial the world is, dude, i live in Stockholm, Sweden. Everyone is super healthy and goes to gym more then their job. It\\`s a good thing i dont feel like competing like some damn bird flexing its wings. it just takes way much time i want to spend on my hobbies instead.People say that if you grow up being pretty you do not have to spend the same amount of time to work on your personality to be attractive to the opposite sex. This is no rule or anything but i agree to a point, especially since i have been very overweight and thin. I am not telling you you have a bad personality! :D Just some food for thought i guess.Have you seen  ? go check it out, i am subbed. I dream about another tiny house at some point, but then again, its super hard to find an apartment so i want to keep this one.When i say trauma, well. First of all, the biggest trigger i have is definitely love, romantic relationships in general. Even loving relationships with friends and family. Also, almost every single girlfriend i have had i met was during one of those extended hypomanic periods, we are talking 6 months or so. I assume you understand Bipolar disorder and know why this is.Love is simply(lul, simple) a huge trigger and i can describe any kind of episode or bipolar state being traumatic for me, especially in my teens when i barely understood what depression and anxiety was, which i figured out using the internet to get help.Keep in mind that i have been sick since i was 16, i am 33 now. Basically every romantic relationship i have had have been quite directed by my mental state. I have met girls and gotten into relationships a couple of time where i just end it when depression hits after the mania. There is one relationship that stands out, you know, the one, the one that got away. Many men have one of thosei think, the one that they lost.

{"eiv8n7q": {"text": "Short answer to your question is that, yes, these are all symptoms of a depression. I have experienced everything you just said ever since i got sick during my lows. You are not alone in feeling like this.Sometimes its somewhat based on reality for me. It is a fact that many, many friends have left me due to my behavior during episodes, both up and down, and i *totally* understand that, and accept their decision. This came along with me understanding more and more about the illness and how it affects me. Thing is, when you have a depressive episode you make these things bigger then they have to be, you poor extra into the mug even though much of it has evaporated years ago. Something you have to be careful about is that if you give in to these feelings they might become your reality over time due to how it long term affect your standpoint when it comes to relationships, especially romantic ones.It might seem that i know about this, and have it under control, i do *not.* i am *extremely* afraid of relationships now. I have been single for 7 years now to protect myself, love is a huge trigger one way or the other especially. This is based on both logic and reason, but also an unhealthy fear that i am trying to work on.If these feelings are something new to you i recommend you to address these problems as early as possible before it becomes part of how you feel about relationships in general, not even during an episode.Remember that this will tone down and it will be over sooner or later, one day at a time my friend, one day at a time. Every other depression you have been through have an end right? this one to i assure you. Do not be afraid to accept help, i bet you accepting your family and friends help will help maintaining the relationship rather then you isolating yourself.Me myself have had a *very* hard time asking for help since people tend to leave me, its quite extreme and hard for people to grasp and understand. I am about to ask to see a therapist again so that i can vent there instead and not unload on my friend more then i need to. One year ago i actually asked for help for the first time, for real this time. My self hatred have kept me from doing this probably ever since i got sick when i was 16, now 33.There is so much to learn, the best way i would say is to read more about our disorder, watch documentary etc. The more you figure out the easier it is to separate  symptoms from reality.I hope my words help in some way, try and stay strong and ask for help, i hope your episode will be over soon.best wishes", "link_id": "t3_b2uexp", "time": 1552990861}}

I am 33 soon and got diagnosed at the age of i think 25, and i have been sick since i was 16. I have only been taking lamictal/lamitrogin and tried a couple of other meds up to this point. 1.5 years ago i had a 6 months long hypomanic episode, followed by full mania for probably a week or so before i managed to get help, it was easy to seek help during the mania, it was intense. And as many of you probably recognize, its hard to seek help during a pleasant hypo state. Thing is mine are half a year long sometimes.  I have had these lengthy hypo periods before, sure, i had depressions after them, sure. But nothing like this, i was not prepared for what kind of bi effects from the hypo+mania i was about to experience.&amp;#x200B;First of all, it was a 10/10 depression, probably my worst one ever. But my brain was also completely fucking fried in other ways this time. The worst symptoms was that i was in constant *D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu* for at least 1 month(*D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu* is most strongly associated with [temporal lobe epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe_epilepsy). This experience  is a neurological  anomaly related to epileptic electrical discharge in the brain,  creating a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being  experienced has already been experienced in the past). I had no clue if i had experienced what was going on before or not, like, the exact same thing, just as the feeling when your memory gives you during a de ja vu. I had to ask my family and friends if we have had the same discussion before or not, just to make sure. &amp;#x200B;What i learned from all this is, i should have been more serious with medicating myself earlier. The brain damage is not worth it. If i could i would go back 7 years and tell myself that i should not be afraid of the medications or big pharma more then the illness itself. &amp;#x200B;Now, about 1 year after the episode, my memory is still damaged. And i get a knot in my stomach thinking about if the damage done never gets to heal. &amp;#x200B;After this whole experience i have completely stopped smoking cannabis, i have tried many different types of meds and found a combination of doses that have a good effect without to many side effects. I try and eat better and exercise. And i do memory/brain exercise as much i can. I only hope my brain will recover over time, at least some.&amp;#x200B;We don\\`t have to touch the bottom before we decide to swim back to the surface. I should have listened to my elders, and my doctors, before it was to late.

{"e1q6nh6": {"text": "I get why you are ranting, but it has nothing to do with this sub and what it does. I think the root of it is how hard it is to diagnose. Depression is quite common, and anxiety is to. They almost always come hand in hand. And the hypomania can easily be interpreted as just, good mood. That is where it differs. You need to have a few manic or hypomanic episodes. And us who have it, we do not even know we have them before we learn what symptoms there are, and then be able to read ourselves well enough to indicate we are having an episode.Moreover, everyone's brain is the same, basically. It is a system of the brain that is not functioning correctly in a person who has the disorder, at least not the same as 98% or so of the other people on this planet. The systems are still there, in all people though. That is why it is so hard to diagnose. About the cheating, i would have to just give you my own view on the matter. We are all different people, with different values. I personally have no problem with overspending which is extremely common. I think this is why i am very environmentally aware. I do not take part in over consumption of the natural resources of the planet. I already acted and had a plan about how i spend my money. If i really want something for a month, then i will consider buying it if it leaves a low imprint.Here are my 2 cents on cheating and why it is common. A symptom of bipolar disorder as many of you know is heightened libido, since hypo and mania is very much central stimulating just as cocaine for example. that combined with higher self self-esteem and increased physical activity, which brings weight loss. Which is what is a standard in modern, western society as attractive(where not so long ago fat where an indication of wealth and attractive back then /round person). It adds up to a higher chance of flirting and success in the dating area. But here values come into the picture again. I never had a problem with cheating, i would never do it, it is part of my values as a person. I do flirt more, its as if i cannot help it. Which also had brought some instability in my previous romantic relationships. But i would never cheat, just based on my values.What i mean is, we are all different people, with the same systems within our brains. We live the extremes of human emotional experience, that is about it. What you do with it is up to you in many cases.We all suffer the same symptoms, and we all have different problems because of those symptoms.          ", "link_id": "t3_8vrfgg", "time": 1530637002}}

The str character can carry more. I used it to carry one barrel of poision since you can combine it with weapons for a hefty DMG buff :) I think he also had barter for gold gain. Steal everything, give it to your barter before selling with that character. In general you want to go for o e type of magic or skill first. Then add something later.

I think the spell books you find tells you what they scale with.It's okey to restart the game after a few hours when you know more of what's going on.1 point into pet pal f\u00f6r more great content.The crafting in general is so helpful. A quick guide should help. It's not that hard to craft your own spells. Save nails and combine with yAll your boots! You won't have to worry about slipping on ice, especially important if you plan to use this against your enemy with water cold combos.If you just got a sword. Find the little crafting area in I thin Northwest of cyesel, the first town. There you can sharpen your blades.I'd say you want one character that put points into crafting asap since it's so useful. But that means looking at a quick guide(I recommend).More soon :)Edit2: link to my post.https://www.reddit.com/ reminded me. Have one get leadership, it is incredibly strong, first problem is hit chance, this helps a ton. And save all skill gear you find. For example.

This is where it gets weird, should you do things in a different way since you are a man? feminism is not about the battle between sexes, its about equality between ALL people, all of mankind.

They do not understand that it is about not being anti against anything.

And even more so when i read more.I was terrified at first. So much of my past was defined by it But at the same time it was a relief like you said, Its okay to blame it sometimes i`d say. Even those around us would rather think not. But that relief came after the actual diagnoses since that meant help. I had very little trust in the pharmaceutical companies, but i also did not want to support them in any way. So it took a long while before i gave up and sought out main stream treatment. Not that the work i did not gave anything, i actually think it was a good way of doing the part you need to do yourself, the things meds do not help you with, since you get the full onset of symptoms. The only drawback would be that the illness gets worse with every episode, in a way that it gives some brain damage. And i have to pay for it today, if i could go back in time i would go for the pharma meds right away.

In a sense that, perhaps its so little actual work into it, basically a effect straight out of a module, which makes the song feel soulless. There is also one other thing to take into mind. And that is that many of the radio songs use the same chords to make the song happy and familiar. Sometimes it feels less like art then other things.What i am saying is that there is a line somewhere. But yes, its all about taste.

{"dy3egph": {"text": "This is grey area since its on its way to the market. And there is very little real science for our psychiatrists to recommend it. That being said i have quite a bit of experience with it.For starters, i am in no way a professional, i will just talk about my personal experiences, and the people i have met. Take that as you will.Medical cannabis is real, that is for sure. But like with all meds they work for some, other not as much. Weed is crazy \"strong\" these days. When you breed a \"price winning\" strain it has very high thc in it, which brings down the cbd in it naturally. Medical cannabis should have very low thc. thc is what you get high from basically, and is what brings the side effects i am not interested in, and what makes a stoners like difficult sometimes. CDB(heated) and CDBa(raw from the plant) are the molecules that has the properties that has very promising attributes for our condition. Cannabis has many cannabinoids in it. a bit over 100 molecules. We are talking turpentines, omega-6 and omega-3 oils etc as well. All which are good for anybody. I believe that all the natural molecules needs to be there in balance. The CDB oils i get have 0-0.02 % THC which is making them legal. I am also not surprised you got way to high of that weed, which is not very pleasant if you are not someone who smokes all the time. Hell i know people who smoke every day and do not like to get to high, it all started when we started cross breeding plants to make them higher in THC, which is stupid if you ask me. Enough about the science, i ask of you to read up on it. There are many resources for doing that. Always learn before trying out any medication or doing anything in life really, a motto of mine. I could talk about the science for days, it is actually something me and my doctor talk about a lot since we both want to work in the field. I have another friend that is a chemist that thought me other things, etc.Here is my personal experience from using cannabis as a mood stabilizer, and as a drug for anxiety, with what i told you earlier in mind. I love my oils, i can have a active life style, i do not put things aside. There are side effect most people do not know about Cannabis, primarily the THC cannabinoid molecule. You do not enter REM sleep and get to have dreams that helps you process life, people get stuck in time. I do not get cravings(the munchies) and gain weight. Something some of our other meds also have as a side effect. First time i tried it i was honestly amazed. I waited for a while to let others try, let my friends tell me about what they experienced. My anxiety was completely GONE, i have not felt that way in a loooong time, only time is when i used cannabis, while being high. I got it while not getting high, at all. I am 100% sure about this one, like my doctor friend who works at the center for addiction. We talk about using these oils for people who wants to stop smoking for a while for the anxiety issues.I am not so sure about the mood stabilizing, but it has worked for me with traditional weed for my whole life. It is important that with any med we use, we cannot stop taking them, this will bring on a episode. Only times in my life when i get very long hypomanic episodes with depressions afterwards if when i stopped smoking, as if i would stop taking any other mood stabilizer. I do not want to stress enough that i have yet to tried them long enough to be sure. But so far, personally, it looks very promising. I would like to tell you a story about my neighbor. He suffers from a very though illness that breaks down his bone structure. His muscles are constantly contracting and it brings a ton of pain. I am no expert but i am reading up on it for him. All he gets are opiates to handle the pain, as a muscle relaxer. He hates them, and brings many awful side effects. And also making you very addicted, so much that it dangerous coming down on them.  He has been smoking cannabis on the side. The way he is consuming it is like the worst way. Not just that it is not effective, breathing in oils from plant matter is not a good idea. Yesterday we had his first trail with these oils. It was those videos on you tube with people with Parkinson. It was a magical day for him, and me. Just 15 mins later he could relax and not twitch, the pain was sooooo much better. He said that the opiates put him at 75% pain. And this got him to 25% at least. He face, omg, it was like he met god. Not just in happiness. His face was not pale anymore. His blood veins started to grow, he got color on his arms, and in his face. He sat back and could relax. His muscles where working much better. He did all the tests he had learned and was amazed. He got home work to read, and we are going to set a dose and work it up to the right one. I know where to get fully ecological super high quality oils and helped him with that to. I am excited to follow him on this journey. The guy have had his life destroyed, This might give him such better life quality. But his illness in particular is one of those that people study, since cannabis seems to be able to help grow back the bone structure even. There are bad oils out there with synthetic CDB. Please be careful and find the right company to buy them from. High quality, fully ecological made the right way in a serious lab environment by the right people.As you see i can talk about these things for years. And i am probably going to work in this field. But have been doing it underground since it has so much potential and i can help others like him.Remember, i cannot stress this enough, we do not how well the medications we take combo with CBD, or CBDa. And science needs to be done. But i have done this for 17 years, in some way or another. And these oils are amazing to me. And every story has been amazing that i have heard. Some doctors like it, some do not. At some point i had to make up my own mind for my own health and happiness.               ", "link_id": "t3_8fg8k7", "time": 1524879604}}

I noticed later that many of my close friends i grew up with also have bipolar disorder, we tend to attract each other since we are very much the same in so many ways. Even though we are very different and have different backgrounds.  My best tip is learning as much as you can about the disorder to make sense of it all, and learn how to identify the symptoms so you can act against them or take certain actions to help you cope. But also make sense of your life up until this point, it helped me let go of certain things i had done and had a ton of shame over.I started using an app called optimism to chart my mood depending on what i physically do, eat, how me sleep was etc. Not only for myself, but i was able to take these charts to my healthcare as well.They where baffled at the type of self care i did in that sense. They asked me about the app etc. This thing was pretty new back then i suppose. I thought them how to use it and so on. Later my psychologist said 80% of his patients are using it, and are happy with that app. I felt like a super hero that day :)Do not be afraid to come here for anything, anything at all.

I do all those things now, i have the space. and i stopped eating cannabis oils to try the meds again for real. I have not felt this bad in a long time honestly. Work is one of the best ways for me to handle all this since it helps me keep to a schedule, and it keeps my mind off of things during the day. I miss working in that sense, but getting treated the way i have, basically getting bullied made it much, much worse.Basically, he makes it sound this is a easy thing, i try and tell him that it is not that easy. That the parts of my brain that usually gets better doing this things is broken. He wont fucking listen to me, at all. He has hurt my feelings a lot by trying to help me. All i ask of him is that he listens. And now he wont even see me so i get to say all the things i want to say to his face. It has gotten so far now that i have made the decision to cut him from my life. But i can`t stop thinking about him and stuff i want to tell him. Everyone around me say i do the right thing honestly, but this means i cut ties to the only friend that has stuck by me during all the years. fuck...   sorry for a long rant, thanks for reading if you got this far.", "link_id": "t3_878z2u", "time": 1522153361}}

With a touch of Nordic EU which i am from. I also get influenced by the games i play, so some video game soundtracks are on there as well.  The list might surprise you.I love sharing music but i have never done it on the web before up until recently. And i plan on keep adding music as i go. Both new and old, where up and coming bands and producers is something that i crave.My hopes is that some of you get introduced to new kinds of music. There are few things i get as much satisfaction from as when i see a friends face light up as i play a song.if you decide to follow, remember that you can turn the list upside down to easily listen to the newly added songs.I wish you many chill times, with this very chill list.", "link_id": "t3_7ue44d", "time": 1517439644}}

I have tried a few of their drugs and went back to what have worked for 15 years+. The healthcare has only told me that i am an drug addict, it even says so in my medical journals since i am open about using it as medicine. I have tried living my life without using it many times. every time i go into hypomania, and i cant seem to stabilize, even with the drugs that we tried with. But i do not recommend this for anyone else, period. edit: cannabis works like their meds do as well. low doses, and build it up, very low. then i find my dose. I want to keep it as low as possible.

{"dpd05h7": {"text": "I would like to add something, for any of those who thinks its not possible to get past tilt, i`m a living proof it`s is possible. I have gone through all that mental training, at first to handle my bipolar disorder and crushing anxiety. Later i realized my training helped with tilt, and started using it for that as well, since i had a problem with it. Now am basically untiltable. I cant possibly give a write up on how to do it in a reddit comment. But i will give a few tips. Most my techniques is about changing how you relate to things. 1. This will be hard work, you will have to tell your brain its wrong about certain things over and over until it agrees with you. If you are not willing to put in the hard and long work, and just go half way. It wont really help i dont think.2. Mistakes. One of the best ways to train is learn how to handle mistakes. Often times people resort to anger when mistakes are made. I see them as opportunity to learn, its the only time i am able to fix my own game play.3. RNG. Now this is a life lesson, and its not easy to obtain. I use this in all of life. You need to realize what is in your control and what is not. I use the nature of RNG, the reason why it is frustrating to my advantage.3. losing, same as tip one. Being competitive in nature often makes us a \"sorry looser\". You can learn how to use this energy and use it to get better at the game, instead of creating an anger obstacle. Now you are actually able to analyze the game and find the weakness in your play, its something positive if you have a healthy goal, which is to get better at the game, not gain ranks.which brings us to my last tip for the comment, how to handle ladder anxiety, because if it builds up it will add to that tilt.You need to stop focusing on ranks, you need to make this about yourself and self improvement. Its not about anyone else, you are alone at the ladder. If the true goal is to get better at the game, remember, the loses is something positive.I hope you get rid of some of your mental blockades guys, its worth the time put in. And it will help you in your personal life as well, not just in gaming. ", "link_id": "t3_7abkn2", "time": 1509847484}}

If the reflect dmg is based on the dmg your character takes after armor reduction, It gets even worse.The protection for stun on your warrior you can get from the avatar of storms skill that my Jahan uses also. If i need or decide to use battering ram on my warrior for cc, if my turn order is incorrect (want warrior late, to be able to buff before battering ram) The air resistance is useful. One of the bigger problems for my build is stunning my own warrior through blood usually. From either chain lightning, lightning blitz bolt, or the air elemental that i use. So as long as i get that shield up i can see the air resistance being less useful to.I can see fire being the one most useful. I dont feel that poison dmg is that strong mid game, but i can see it being very good in the early lvl`s. Not obly because they use a lot of poison dmg, but this is when you are at your weakest point.My warrior can usually manage the poison, either from the 2 regeneration spells i have on both my casters. or his own heal. and ofc a pot if necessary. But yeah the treat poison is useful early game for sure, but because of the range i almost never use it on my warrior, only on my 3 ranged characters. And after i am able to use 2 summons to tank even further, while using cc on those pesky archers, and casters. my 3 ranged characters are safe in most situations. There has been a few encounters so far where i had a bit of trouble of having them out of danger, the skeleton king and his wife in particular. I do have the taunt for my warrior for that reason. And after i crafted the second summon skeleton spell i have another taunt and tank. But until then. The cc debuffs can lack in the early game.Yep, unbreakable is useless. Especially since i have Jahan at 5 blacksmithing (and crafting) asap. But whenever i see a huge armor upgrade i tend to equip it, if its green or above, in general. Good to know about the armor or dmg penalty! But in general if it is an upgrade is it is an upgrade, even though it has unbreakable, still very useful to know, thanks.When it comes to hp. I do not only see it as serviceability in the sense that you can take less dmg. same goes with resistances. If you are able to take a minimal amount of dmg. That means that my 2 casters are able to other things then heal. either do dmg or apply cc, buffs or debuffs etc. Which further increases the surviveablity, and you are able to spend those precious AP on something more worth while :)Thanks for the info and feedback   ", "link_id": "t3_6hxf1b", "time": 1498135510}}

{"dhho12f": {"text": "One thing that you did not bring up is Spirit Echo. It should always be included in a pure jade list in my opinion. It just packs an insane amount of value.And i can see it working in a Jade Elemental list as well, depending on what it has in it. But it might be hard to fit and to cut anything for it.I personally use Stonehill Defenders in my Elemental jade list instead of Tar Creepers(to highroll al`akir, thing from below, white eyes and earth elementals), but its an experiment so far. I can see the Tar Creepers being better, since there is usually more aggro on ladder then value matchups, where Stonehill Defenders are better. But with spirit echo in mind, Stonehills also is more viable.I play a lot of shaman, but just recently started playing it since un`goro and are experimenting a lot these past few days.
