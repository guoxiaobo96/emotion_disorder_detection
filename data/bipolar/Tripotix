{"f6k6y9a": {"text": "Thanks! I remember a little too much.. And unfortunately posted allot of it on facebook too haha! It is a looong story so i am only going to highlight certain parts. Firstly I believed I was the second coming and had to save humanity form the apocalypse (Weather warnings online must have had an effect on this, I believed the great rain was coming.) I therefore cycled my bike to the nearby mountains and climbed to the top to see if I could survive without materialism so i could build an ark in the coming days.. Parents called for a police search party but i ended up coming home covered in mud later that day after doing a load of random stuff and building a den to live in under trees on the mountain.. Next day I had a meeting with my psychiatrist about 40 miles from home. When I got there, still believing I was the second coming, things took an odd turn. I was seated with several psychiatrists and an emergence team around me asking me all kinds of questions.. This seemed awfully similar to that scene in the matrix where neo is being questioned by the agents. And there it was, I now believed I was surrounded by agents and had been living in the matrix, I denied medication and told them they could not keep me there as I was not violent or dangerous, I stood up and walked out. They told me they would call the police if I left the building and I said \"Fine\" and left. It was poring with rain. I got to the main road and started running the same way we came. I then thought every driver passing by was signalling the agents to come get me by mobile phone. I got to a part of the road with trees on either side and climbed down and through them into a field on the other side. From here I kept pushing forward trying to escape society by getting to the mountains that were in the distance. (the ones we passed over on our way here.) I ended up removing all of my clothing in case of trackers. Completely naked and about 40 miles from home I pushed onward. I had to climb over about 40 barbed fences throughout the day and god knows how many awful bramble patches. I could not move in a straight line either, I had to avoid houses, cars and all of society. Somehow, I was immune to pain. The mania was like rocket fuelled adrenaline and the psychosis turned my reality into a fantasy.. My imagination swapped places with my reality. by the time i got to those mountains, roughly 20 miles away taking me just over 10 hours, it was getting too dark to carry on. And so damn cold.. What the hell could I do though? Knock at someones door in the dark completely naked covered in scratches like I had been through war?!? I was coming back to reality at this point too and realised the dangers of hypothermia were getting real. I finally realized it was death or find a house to call my parents. I left the field i was in and followed the road until I finally saw a light in the distance. I followed the road to the light ahead. The small stones on the road were like little bits of lego piercing my feet with every step. I got to the house and stood by the gate planning on what to say when I knocked on the door. I stayed there for about 5 minutes until I gave in to the though of comfort. They were super nice, thank god. They called the police who had me taken to a hospital. It was there i finished this drawing!  There is so much more to the story, the mania lasted a month. This was the most intense part though. Damn.. writing about it bought me back there on a visual journey through my memory! madness xD", "link_id": "t3_drguys", "time": 1572906337}}

I was looking for some LSD on the deepweb, and came across a \"Limited edition\" 250ug tab that caught my attention and had great reviews. I decided to buy 2 of them. When it arrived, I wanted to take it right away. So I pulled out one of the tabs and ate it. It was a big tab! Within just 5 minutes of consuming this tasteless tab, I knew something was very wrong.. I never felt LSD hit me so fast before. Within 15 minutes I was really freaking out as I knew the tab had been heavily overdosed by this point. It was hitting so hard I phoned the ambulance immediately. The body load was beyond intense and my mind felt as though it was going to explode! When they finally arrived, they checked my heart rate and some other small things and said i was okay and that i should just try to relax. They left soon after. Everything is a blur beyond this point, I just felt like I was actually going to die because it was just so intense. And I had done over 100 trips at this point and never felt as though i was going to completely lose my mind before.. 250ug was a fairly mild trip usually. Intense of course.. Just not this. Long story short, I phoned the ambulance a total of 4 times that day, and by night, i was screaming for it to end. I took an anti psychotic to try to calm it down and went to bed still peaking at this point which was 10 hours later. As I lay there restless and confused I felt as though my entire life memories were being squeezed through my brain at light speed and could hear this heavy buzzing sound as though i could almost hear the intensity of the trip passing through me.. I am not sure if i slept or not, but it was suddenly light and I was still tripping, although it was somewhat manageable now. It stayed like this for another day or two before I felt at baseline again. I gave my other tab to my step-dad who said he would put it in the fire.  He took 1 5th of the full tab though,  and found it more intense than anything he had experienced in the past.. He still felt a bit off 30 hours later after just 1/5th..After this experience I went back on the deepweb to check the vendor's reviews. Most were great. However, there was 3 comments from people who had the same experience as me. Another guy got some 100ug LSD from the vendor in a bottle and took 2 drops. He woke up in a hospital. The vendor must have been diluting the lsd from pure crystal and messed up or decided to give a few \"Lucky\" people a trip they would never forget.

The most problematic symptom is being in the head space of a trip. Body load and brain fog really mess me up, but I guess you just get by when you have it.. What else can you do really!

I was taking 2 grams of speed (not meth) to myself daily for a few years and did over 150 psychedelic trips in the space of 3 years.. I got so caught up in the manic euphoria of stimulants that I felt indestructible.. Until of of course reality crept up and I stopped getting high from the drugs.. Instead they took me deeper and deeper into a depression I felt I could never escape from.. I thought I destroyed myself so saw no reason to stop using. Well, I eventually had to stop because I started getting completely psychotic every time I used and would chew my tongue to a bloody mess and just lose my mind completely. I finally quit. I did not go to a drug councillor or anything.. I wanted to stop. Had to stop. Long story short, I am 11 months and 8 days sober now and feel like I actually have a future again.. Make no mistake, I am hallucinating all the time now from all the lsd I took, but am hopefully going on medication again soon to stabilise my psychology further and stop the hallucinations. What matters is that I am healing and I feel 1000 times better than I did 11 months back.. Now I will fight to see how much better I can make myself feel in the next 11 months!
