{"fsx5xvp": {"text": "I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. I dated someone my senior year of high school who was significantly older than I was and it started out great, my parents liked him, and then the red flags started popping up. I didn\u2019t have a car at the time and he had promised me he would pick me up from school when my parents worked late, and at first he kept his word and then less than a month later I\u2019d be sitting in the school car loop until dark waiting for him and he would never show. Then he started getting verbally abusive, screaming at me over little things, calling me names, making me cry, bragging about how all the girls he screwed in college were so much hotter than me and how I was just a sad little virgin with a \u201cfake\u201d eating disorder (it was not fake, it got to the point where I started losing my hair because of how malnourished I was). Then he started getting physical. It was really rare that he would put his hands on me, but he did. He shoved me a few times and one time I tried to retaliate by slapping him in the face and he grabbed my arm and tried to twist it into a painful position. Then he would start taking me to party with his friends, most of which were in their late 20s-early 30s. He would pressure me into drinking and would convince me to keep drinking until I wandered off and blacked out somewhere. There were a lot of times where he took advantage of me while I was drunk and if I questioned it he would deny it because he would insist that I must\u2019ve been dreaming or imagining things. I never snooped through his phone because I didn\u2019t think of that at the time, but I\u2019d bet he had a lot he was hiding from me. He also had ridiculous rules for me, like I wasn\u2019t allowed to have any friends, I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk about him or what we did when we were together to anyone, even family, if he caught me hanging out with another guy or even talking to a male coworker that he wasn\u2019t friends or family with I would never hear the end of it and he would threaten to leave me or cheat on me. I fully 100% believe he cheated on me more than once because no normal person is that paranoid about their partner being unfaithful unless they themselves are also being unfaithful. I got away from him a few weeks before my 20th birthday, after calling the police and explaining I was breaking up with an abusive boyfriend, that I didn\u2019t want to press any charges, I just wanted out and I wanted them to protect me in case he showed up at my house. They stayed with me until I felt safe, and after telling him I was done and to never contact me again, I made sure to let him know that if he tried anything at all with me ever again there would be serious consequences for him. I\u2019m now in therapy, I don\u2019t plan on getting in any more relationships (I had one after him that ended three months ago that didn\u2019t work out) because I don\u2019t feel like I have anything to offer anyone after what I\u2019ve been through, and I\u2019m okay all alone. If you haven\u2019t done so already, I\u2019d definitely recommend therapy. It\u2019s helped me work through my issues with him as well as my issues with being molested as a child and if it wasn\u2019t for my therapist I probably wouldn\u2019t be here right now. Also just a side note, (and not to be rude at all, I just want to make sure you\u2019re safe and healthy after everything you\u2019ve been through), if you haven\u2019t been tested for STDs since this incident, you probably should get tested. Even if you used protection, and even if you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t have an STD, anything can happen, and it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. I wish you the best of luck in life and I wish you well on your journey of self discovery and healing. Remember you\u2019re not alone. \u2764\ufe0f", "link_id": "t3_gwikm6", "time": 1591317069}}

I got up to go rinse my hand and put a bandaid on it and as I was walking to the kitchen I started feeling really dizzy and faint so I sat down and put my head between my knees until it stopped. Got up again and immediately dropped to the ground. The last thing I heard before I fainted was a dull crack as my head hit the kitchen tile. Not sure when exactly I came to, but when I did my head was throbbing horribly, my vision was blurry as shit, and I was so dizzy that I didn\u2019t know which way was up and which way was down. My parents were out of town when this happened and I was incapable of calling 911 myself because of how dizzy I was so I just laid there on the kitchen floor for hours until the dizziness and blurry vision stopped. When my parents got home I had them check me for head injuries because my head had not stopped hurting the entire day and then take me to the ER if they thought it was serious, and sure enough, I hit my head hard enough when I fainted to give myself a concussion. 0/10 never want to relive that experience again.", "link_id": "t3_gub59b", "time": 1591020227}}

{"fqq59al": {"text": "I used to have super long stiletto nails. I only had them for about 3 months before I got so fed up with them breaking while at the barn and causing nail infections every single time they broke, getting dirt, horsehair, and horse shit underneath them as well as food, makeup, and other fun stuff stuck under the nail bed that I had to literally scrape out with a toothpick daily, and not to mention they got in the way of literally everything; texting, typing, saddling horses, drawing/painting, picking things up off the floor, doing my hair, etc. I don\u2019t mind the look of long nails if you\u2019re the kind of person that isn\u2019t very outdoorsy and you keep your nails well maintained. I, on the other hand, am very outdoorsy and spend most of my time with horses and other large livestock type animals as well as doing things like kayaking and cycling so having well maintained nails (at any length really, but especially at that length) isn\u2019t much of an option for me. Sure I get manicures once a month but outside of slapping some nexgen on my nails, they\u2019re subjected to very little pampering and direct contact with dirt and other fun stuff. Why did I have long stiletto nails if I ride horses and spend a lot of time outside, you ask? Well, I see these \u201cequestrian girls\u201d all over social media (and no, not the horse girls that are like weirdly obsessed with horses to the point where they want to be a horse, the ones who have rich daddies and imported horses from Europe) who go to the barn with their hair straightened or curled to perfection, full glam makeup on, and pristine looking riding clothes from brands like Cavallo and Equine Couture, and of course, super long well manicured looking nails. Sooooo I did a little experiment and got my nails done at a longer length and more delicate style than what I normally get to see how these girls can ride and care for horses with nails like that. The results were: they have grooms and exercise riders and stable hands that daddy pays to do everything for them and they just go to the barn to take some cute pictures with \u201ctheir\u201d horse that they see maybe twice a week tops for the sake of flexing on Instagram that they have an expensive European bred horse, and I am just an idiot.", "link_id": "t3_gk598o", "time": 1589559623}}

{"fqm4uai": {"text": " I\u2019m an equestrian. Part of my participation in horse sports is knowing how to handle dangerous situations. This may not be entirely useful to normal people but if you are a rider or if you enjoy group trail rides while on a vacation, this is useful info for you. I always teach any beginner rider this one rule when they\u2019re on the horse: if they\u2019re on the horse and the horse rears up on its hind legs, DO NOT pull back on the reins for any reason. Pulling back on the reins while the horse is balancing on its back feet can cause the horse to flip over backwards on top of you, crushing you with their body weight and possibly killing you, as well as risking injuring the horse. DO, lean forward and press your chest and stomach against the horse\u2019s withers and neck, if you need to hang on to something, wrap your arms around the horse\u2019s neck and lock your fingers together. Wait until all four feet are back on the ground before regaining control over the horse. If you think you can\u2019t stay on, or if you feel like the horse is losing its balance while rearing, kick both feet out of the stirrups, bail off the side, and duck and roll, keeping your head and neck protected as you do so. Do NOT stay on a horse who is about to fall over while rearing, doing this could very easily crush you and seriously injure or kill you. If a horse is bucking while you\u2019re on it, take one rein and pull them in a tight circle. If they\u2019re going in a circle they can\u2019t maintain forward motion because they can\u2019t balance while going in circles. If you feel like you can\u2019t sit through the bucks, let yourself fall and make sure you keep your head and neck protected from the impact. If a horse spooks and runs off with you, you can either stop them with one rein by pulling them into a circle, or if you feel too afraid to let go of whatever is keeping you balanced (the saddle, the mane, the neck, etc.) and there\u2019s no dangers like traffic or rough terrain around, just let them run. They will stop eventually. If you\u2019re a beginner rider and your horse bolts and your balance isn\u2019t good enough to regain control of the horse, let them run and just try to stay on. They\u2019ll eventually get tired of running and slow down enough for you to regain your balance and control. NEVER EVER trail ride alone. Even if you are an experienced rider, it\u2019s always important to bring someone with you in case you get badly hurt and are unable to call 911/whatever emergency line your country has. If you\u2019re trail riding, always bring a phone with location services enabled, water, food, a knife or something sharp in case your horse gets tangled in something and care items for your horse like a hoof pick, wound salve,  etc. as well as first aid for yourself such as antiseptic/wound wash, gauze, bandaids, etc. If you fall off and break an arm or a leg while trail riding, you can make a splint out of tree branches and clothing or your horse\u2019s polo wraps if he\u2019s wearing any. If you think you might have a head injury, even if it\u2019s just a concussion, and you are wearing a helmet, DO NOT remove it. Wait until you are being checked over by paramedics and have them take it off for you. The same rule applies to any kind of jumping, whether you are jumping a cross country course or an arena course. Always have a trainer or a friend supervising your jumping practice because you and your horse could very easily fall and get seriously injured and if no one is around to get help, you\u2019re SOL. If you see someone else fall off a horse and they don\u2019t get up on their own, DO NOT under any circumstances move them and DO NOT remove their helmet if they\u2019re wearing one. They could be seriously injured and moving them or taking off their helmet could only put them in even more danger. Leave them where they fell, dial your emergency line immediately, and wait for paramedics to see to them.", "link_id": "t3_gjgn93", "time": 1589471528}}

{"fp2iff5": {"text": "I got him when I was 8 years old as an untrained 4 year old slaughter rescue. He was very very green (and I was very green at 8 as well), and with the help of family and friends we trained him to compete. He made it as far as regionals in the more intermediate level show circuits before he started to just fall apart on show days and I could really tell his heart just wasn\u2019t in it. Once my cousin turned 2 or 3 we decided she should meet our horses since she was always talking about them (as best as a toddler can) and from the second Kenny (my horse) laid eyes on her I knew that his place in the world was teaching children and beginner riders about horses the way I learned about horses through him when I was a beginner. We kept him for about a year after he and my cousin met, although I made the decision to quit competition for his sake, and we would lend him to a local therapy organization that did riding lessons for children and teens with disabilities such as autism and cerebral palsy and he absolutely loved it and all of the kids loved him. It was almost a competition on who got to ride Kenny on the weekends. Eventually I came to the realization that I had far advanced past Kenny and was looking into competing in the higher levels at the time, but couldn\u2019t do that on Kenny since he just wasn\u2019t at that skill level and didn\u2019t enjoy being in the show ring at such a high level, and while he was great in beginner tiers and children\u2019s gymkhanas, he\u2019d just fall apart in the more challenging levels. Not only that, but he didn\u2019t have the right conformation or drive to learn the disciplines I wanted to get into (dressage and jumping). I decided after a lot of thought that while I loved him a lot, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to keep him in a place where he couldn\u2019t be at his happiest, nor would it be fair to keep him as a companion horse that was never ridden since he enjoyed doing lessons and gymkhanas. I told my parents I wanted to see about swapping Kenny for a horse with a more advanced skill set and tried to convince them that this wasn\u2019t because I hated him or didn\u2019t want him anymore, it was, in fact, because I loved him and hated the fact that I could no longer be what he needed, and that he would be better off with a beginner rider that matched his skill set. Of course, they took it entirely the wrong way, sold him, and told me I would never ride again because I \u201chated Kenny.\u201d Didn\u2019t stop me though. We were close friends with the people my parents sold him to and me and their neighbor would go visit Kenny and would ride together every day after school. They had a show jumper there that I rode and took lessons on in exchange for doing chores around the barn, which made my parents even more pissed. They tried everything to keep me away from the horses but eventually the friends stepped in and told them I was welcome there whenever I wanted to come and if they had to pick me up and drop me off just so I could go ride, they would (I didn\u2019t have a car at the time so I would either walk or hitch a ride from the other kids that rode there). Eventually the wife got really sick and in order to pay for her treatments and medical bills, she and the husband decided it would be best to sell all their horses and move to the suburbs so they could be closer to family. They sold Kenny to a friend of theirs who had a lesson barn and he now teaches little kids to ride and compete in the beginner levels. I miss him and I\u2019m sad that the new owner never talks to me or my friends so we can go see him but in the few times I was able to get in touch with her to visit, he seemed healthy and happy, so as long as he\u2019s okay I\u2019m not too worried. I recently signed up for lessons myself, since I\u2019ve been out of the saddle due to a combination of lack of free time and injuries, and of course my parents don\u2019t like it one bit, especially the fact that I plan on competing in eventing in the next year or so lol.", "link_id": "t3_gau0go", "time": 1588262297}}

The barn he\u2019s at now seemed immaculate and clean and all the horses looked very well taken care of, plus he has a new child to love on, so that\u2019s a bonus. I\u2019m sad knowing that\u2019s likely the last time I\u2019ll ever see him but I wish him and his current owners the best of luck and wonderful memories together, and I hope he can live out the remainder of his days on their property (he\u2019s 16, almost 17 now).", "link_id": "t3_fyqbjd", "time": 1586573732}}
{"fn1u6hr": {"text": "You can, if you get them from rescues or livestock auctions rather than from breeders or people high up in the show industry. When I was a kid we had about six horses that we either got from rescues or rescued ourselves due to owner surrenders or auctions, one of which (a Shetland pony) that we were just given for free because the owner didn\u2019t want him (claimed he was dangerous, which he wasn\u2019t wrong, that pony was an absolute fiend but it wasn\u2019t anything that some training and ground manners couldn\u2019t fix). My first horse, which we were originally just fostering for a local horse rescue, cost us $600.

{"fn1tfvw": {"text": "Awwww. Your story reminds me of the horse I had when I was a little girl. He was a skin and bones, untrained 4 year old Appaloosa from Ohio that was about to be sold to some kill buyers when a rescue organization from where I live managed to outbid him. They brought him down here and when we went to go adopt his stallmate at the rescue, we agreed to foster him for a time, too. They had named him Lazy K.C. Sparrow (really fitting because he was the laziest horse I\u2019ve ever seen, but we just called him Kenny). In the end things didn\u2019t work out with his stallmate and we had to return her because she was pregnant and we didn\u2019t have the resources and experience for a foal, but we had all fallen in love with Kenny and he became our foster fail.At first he was just my trail horse and when I was too inexperienced to show I just rode him bareback around the neighborhood, but when I got older we decided to see if he had any potential to be a show horse. We first tried him in barrel racing and time and game, but obviously it didn\u2019t work out because he\u2019s too laid back of a dude. We took a year of from showing him to retrain him and I for western pleasure, halter, trail class, and hunter under saddle and when we finally reentered the show ring, he excelled at it. I showed him for about 3 years in western pleasure, halter, trail class, and under saddle before I stepped back to focus on academics and won championship trophies with him in all our classes at the organizations I was showing for. I still have those trophies and all the ribbons we won together, as well as his custom halter with his show name that we won in a jackpot class. We later retrained him to be a therapy horse for disabled children and he was wonderful. He was a fan favorite at the riding center we lended him to and he brought joy to every child who was near him. When I was 16 I realized that he and I were no longer on the same experience level and I needed a horse that was able to compete at much higher levels and in more disciplines (I really wanted to get into eventing at the time), and upon bringing this up to my parents they got angry and accused me of thinking Kenny wasn\u2019t enough for me (mind you, this was my first ever horse and I loved him more than anything). I felt so guilty that I sold him to a friend and for a long time I refused to see him because it made me too sad. They continued to do therapy for disabled children with him and eventually, our friend\u2019s neighbor and my fellow classmate at school fell in love with Kenny and convinced me to start seeing him again. I always let her ride him and opted to ride one of the other horses they had because I could tell that the bond she had with him was really special, and it made me happy to know that he now had a rider that was on the same skill level as him. Unfortunately the friend I sold Kenny to fell really ill 2 years ago and in order to afford treatment she had to sell Kenny and all of her other horses and move to the city. Kenny now lives with a friend of my friend and has a little girl that loves on him every day. He no longer does therapy for disabled children, but last I heard the new owners do some light showing in western pleasure with him. I haven\u2019t seen him in two years because the owner for whatever reason doesn\u2019t let me or the girl who was riding him after me come visit and that makes me sad, but I\u2019ll always cherish the time I had with him and all of the lessons he taught me about having faith in myself and the ones I love, hard work, and determination. He was the best horse in the world and I hope his new little girl sees that, too.", "link_id": "t3_fyqbjd", "time": 1586569695}}

It took me several years to stumble upon the therapist I\u2019m seeing now and let me tell you, without her I would be dead. I would have killed myself.

And I know it\u2019s really cliche and I\u2019m not trying to be one of those people telling you that working out will cure you, but exercise really does help. At first, I only went out on my bike when I felt empty or suicidal. Then I realized I actually liked it and I started going out twice a week. Now I take my bike out every single day I have off from work, sometimes even after work if I get off during the day. I started setting goals for biking too. At first I could only do 5 miles. Then I started doing 10. Now I can do 15. I\u2019m hoping to be able to go 20 miles a day by summer. I actually checked my fitness app and I\u2019ve biked 115 miles since March. It really does help clear my head more than self harm, drinking, or popping pills ever did, and I feel better about my physical appearance too, for the first time in years. The funny part is I really hate exercise and never had the motivation for it until I found physical activities that I liked. I also have a kayak and once the state parks open back up, I\u2019m going to get back into rowing as well, and go back to the barn I ride at and spend as much time around the horses as I can (which, by the way, horses are great therapists). I\u2019m also going to try and get into martial arts once the quarantine is lifted. Even if it\u2019s not exercise that uplifts you, find a healthy outlet that does and stick with it.

I\u2019ve now been on Quetiapine for five years and none of the dosages I\u2019ve taken recently have truly been fully effective. I still have many of these symptoms as an adult, I never \u201cgrew out of it.\u201d It got tons worse in high school and it got to a point where I couldn\u2019t function at all and nearly failed a grade. I never got diagnosed with any personality disorder or mood disorder which I\u2019m now thinking I should because I\u2019m starting to feel like I show signs of either Bipolar Disorder or BPD or maybe even something else. Parents, please don\u2019t ignore your kids. Don\u2019t insist that their diagnosis (if they have one) is their diagnosis if they start showing signs of something else as they get older. If they feel like they need to get screened for something else, whether it be Bipolar Disorder, Anorexia, BPD, DID, anything they think or you think they might be struggling with, please get them screened. I attempted suicide 3 times by the time I was 16 and nearly died after overdosing on Tylenol because no one listened to me. Please please listen to your kids. And if you are an adult who is struggling, please don\u2019t hesitate to get a proper diagnosis and get help. It\u2019s not a bad thing. My therapist is like my best friend and she has helped me immensely and I\u2019m hoping to bring up the idea to get screened for either Bipolar or BPD soon.", "link_id": "t3_fsv36d", "time": 1585837772}}

{"flgeei5": {"text": "When getting a pet you should always accept that bonding with them takes time. I got my kitty last year as a scared little 2 week old kitten. For the first few months she would hide a lot, attack our other animals (the dogs and our chickens), had a massive fear of being outdoors, and hiss whenever someone she wasn\u2019t familiar with came into the room. Eventually through patience and hard work I managed to coax her out of those behaviors. My mom\u2019s dog is now her best friend. They sleep together, play together, and are frequently seen together. She\u2019s not as fond of our other dog but that\u2019s mainly because my other dog has made it clear that she\u2019s too old and tired to roughhouse, but I have caught them sharing food and sleeping together. She no longer hisses at the neighbors or other houseguests and we eventually managed to train her out of being violent towards the chickens. I started harness training her (she\u2019s not fully leash trained but she wears a harness and leash without a problem, and I even trained her to take rides in her stroller) and as soon as she was comfortable in a harness inside, I started taking her outside. First I let her sit on my lap outside and then once she got confident, I let her explore small areas while in her harness. Eventually, she wanted to go out by herself, so now we just open the door and she runs out to play. This wasn\u2019t an overnight process either, all of the work and training and bonding I\u2019ve done with my cat took me about 6-7 months. There were times where I was frustrated and overwhelmed because I wasn\u2019t seeing the results I wanted but I never once gave up on her. She is still not a very social cat and can be extremely territorial but I\u2019ve just accepted that this is her personality. She wants to be alone and hiding most of the time and I respect her boundaries. If she wants attention, I know she\u2019ll come find me. Please don\u2019t give up on your cat just because it isn\u2019t working out for you right this instant. A good bond with any animal takes a lot of work, time, and patience. Cats are not as social and loving as dogs the majority of the time, and when you get a cat this is something you have to just accept and respect. Give your cat her time and space to figure out her new home rather than smothering her with attention. I know this isn\u2019t what you want right now, and you want to play with her and cuddle her, but right now she\u2019s frightened by her new territory and leaving her alone to figure out her situation is the best and kindest thing you can do for her in this moment.

{"fl8whtu": {"text": "The hallucinations weren\u2019t necessarily frightening, just very debilitating because I couldn\u2019t tell what was real and what wasn\u2019t. I remember having one last summer while sitting on the couch home alone that my brother had come home even though he was at a friend\u2019s. I don\u2019t know how long I talked to the air in front of me before something in my brain just clicked and I realized it wasn\u2019t real because he wasn\u2019t home, and that I had never heard him come in. Another time, I had one while sitting at a red light and hallucinated that there had been a collision in the intersection right in front of me. Nearly had a heart attack right then and there. I had to pull over and just curl up in a ball in the driver\u2019s seat trying to convince myself that it wasn\u2019t real, it couldn\u2019t possibly be real, no one was hurt there was no wreck in the intersection. Most of the time they were auditory though and usually still are when I have them. A lot of the time it would sound more like a voice in my head or speaking directly in my ear, usually commanding me to do things like jumping off a bridge or running a red light into oncoming traffic. Thankfully, whenever these happen I\u2019m usually frozen in place and cannot act on what the voices tell me to do. Most of the time they don\u2019t sound like human voices. They\u2019re kind of detached, neither male or female, a little robotic actually. Kind of like a text to speech generator. It\u2019s not a normal phenomenon for these auditory hallucinations to happen. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m schizophrenic or schizoaffective. It really only happens if I\u2019m in some kind of extreme, prolonged psychological distress, and even then it\u2019s quite rare.

I stopped eating. I stopped drinking.

The second was my first boyfriend, who I trusted to take care of me because he knew how hurt and afraid my experience with my cousin had made me even though I did not understand what sexual assault was at the time. I was a very sheltered and innocent person well into my preteen years and was not taught about consent or sexuality or anything else involving sex. All I knew was that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with any of the abusive situations I was put through and they have traumatized me greatly, especially now that I know what they are and what they mean. Still, because I was so young and naive, I did not press charges or confront either of them for their actions. I was so afraid. I told no one. I made the mistake of remaining silent in my struggles and it has cost me so greatly. I fell into substance abuse and relapsed into self harm and a very serious eating disorder as a result of carrying my burden so quietly for so long. I began to fear relationships and I have trouble trusting people with being intimate. My trauma has cost me good relationships and years of my life that I could\u2019ve lived healthily that I will never get back. The two men who abused me stole my innocence and what remained of my childhood and while I am learning to let go of the horrible acts they committed against me, I will never forget them and they have affected my life greatly. I finally broke my silence in November of 2019, after six long years of quietly carrying that weight. I told my mom. It broke her heart to know that I had been too afraid to come to her in my time of desperate need. I am now about to start therapy this coming week so that I can finally be free of this burden. I no longer want to be weighed down by a pain and fear I did not ask for. I will no longer let these horrible people, and the memory of what they did to me, continue to affect my life. I am so proud of you for not being silent. I know your pain, and you are never alone. I hope you continue to grow and flourish in your journey in life, and I want you to know that you are an inspiration to many. Thank you for speaking up. Your bravery and strength has given me, and I\u2019m sure many others, the strength to speak up, and to speak out, against the horrible things that have been done to us.

Why are they stocking all the cute stuff in only XS and S and all the uglie attractive stuff in M, L, and XL? I went in there before Valentine\u2019s Day to see if I could find anything cute to impress my boyfriend with and I found a pair of panties okay, but I searched for a cute bra in my size that would match for HOURS before finally giving up and taking my money elsewhere.

Keep her off your bed and clothes to reduce the things you touch most often at home coming in contact with cat hair. Regularly grooming your kitty and teaching her not to lounge about on your bed or clothes as well as taking allergy medication should help your allergies.Edit: someone else mentioned cleaning your home, and I\u2019d add that too.

When I went for my birth control they did a breast and pelvic exam as well as blood pressure and asking me the whole nine yards (do you drink, do you vape/smoke, are you taking anything besides what your doctor prescribed, what prescribed medications are you currently taking, are you currently sexually active/have you been sexually active in the months leading up to your appointment, any family history of stroke, blood clots, or heart attacks, etc etc etc.) and STD tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV.

The only thing I had to pay for was bloodwork and that\u2019s only because the deductible on the insurance hadn\u2019t been paid yet. If you\u2019re sexually active you should not deny the STD testing. It\u2019s good to get tested just be absolutely sure you\u2019re negative for everything, especially if you\u2019re not sure if your partner(s) have been tested. Where I live in the US cultures for chlamydia and gonorrhea are mandatory if you want birth control. It\u2019s also a good idea to get bloodwork done if you\u2019re not sure if you have a family history of stroke or heart problems because some forms of birth control like the pill put you at a risk for blood clots, which is why they want you to get tested and advise you not to smoke with birth control in the first place. Whether or not your birth control and appointments are covered and what kind of coverage you have depends on the insurance. With united healthcare wellness exams, the IUD, the implant, and the pill are covered by your insurance.

I was in North Carolina visiting my grandparents and my aunt and other extended family at the time. My aunt encouraged me to hang out with him because he was a loner and didn\u2019t have any friends at all. The entire time we hung out he made several unwanted advances towards me and when I resisted he would whine that no girls liked him and tried to give me \u201cproof\u201d that it was okay to do these things because my aunt was not his mom and because I was adopted and not related by blood to anyone in my family anyway. He eventually took me to a deserted park and put me in a headlock and molested me even though I told him repeatedly to stop because I was uncomfortable and didn\u2019t see him as anything more than extended family. After it was over he made me feel guilty for saying no and since I was young and grew up in a sheltered Christian household that didn\u2019t really reach me about sex or consent I thought that it was my fault. The whole ordeal was so traumatic for me that I fell into a dangerous cycle of drugs and alcohol less than a few weeks later and continued that cycle up until I attempted suicide via overdosing when I was 16. I also avoided my aunt like the plague for a long time because I felt so guilty and dirty and because I never wanted to see him again, which made her feel like she did something wrong (which wasn\u2019t the case). I also refused to go back to my grandparent\u2019s summer home in North Carolina, which has cost me years of time I could\u2019ve spent with my grandparents that I will never get back because of him. It also set me up for two other sexually abusive relationships. My first long term boyfriend (who I dated from the age of 14-15) sexually abused and coerced me for almost two years. The second abusive relationship occurred just after I turned 20. I had just broken up with someone I had been with for 3 years and this guy I worked with at the time tried to coerce me into dating him even though I said I wanted some time to recalibrate. I ended up dating him because he kept making me feel guilty and he used my agreeing to date him to rape me.

{"fdqs3ej": {"text": "There\u2019s a deli worker I have to be around who I swear to god might be a demon, that\u2019s how nasty and horrible she is to me (for context I work next door in the bakery but I have to put up with this lady whenever I bring them sub rolls or am taking out the trash at the same time as deli). The first time she got nasty with me, I had come to put some cardboard in the baler. She was there, throwing mounds of cardboard into the already overflowing baler so I asked if she would mind me smushing some stuff down for her so she could have some more room. Ya know, just trying to make her job a little easier for her. She said no (just no, nothing else) and I thought that meant no she didn\u2019t mind, not no she did mind, so I moved to shut the gate on the baler and she quite literally shoved me as hard as she could against a trash can and screamed at the top of her lungs \u201cNO I DO MIND, YOU STUPID GIRL!\u201d Embarrassed I kind of just mumbled \u201csorry\u201d and waited for her to finish. She made my ENTIRE night hell after that. The manager that I didn\u2019t get along with was closing that night (and it\u2019s pretty common knowledge to anyone who has seen me and this manager interact that I don\u2019t get along well with her) and every time the deli demon thought I wasn\u2019t working hard enough (it was really really slow that night so I finished things pretty quickly and didn\u2019t have many people to help), she would leave the deli to hunt down the closing manager and then sit back and watch with a smile on her face as this manager interrogated and yelled at me even though I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. The second time I interacted with her, I was bringing sub rolls over to the deli and she put her hand on my shoulder and looked at me with a look of the utmost revulsion and just said \u201cyour hair is such an ugly red. So unnatural. How do you even get away with dyeing your hair that color? And your piercings/earrings are so unprofessional. Why do your managers allow you to even work here? I bet your hygiene is horrible. You\u2019re a freak.\u201d(Some context here: my hair is pretty red, almost a dark red wine color. I\u2019ve dyed my hair this color several times as well as quite a few other unnatural colors like black, platinum blonde, etc. throughout the years I\u2019ve been with the company and none of my higher ups have ever had an issue with it so long as I don\u2019t dye my hair like day-glo yellow or something. I also have my earlobes stretched a bit, which is allowed by company policy so long as they\u2019re smaller than a quarter, as well as a cartilage piercing on my ear, a very very tiny and relatively invisible stud in my nostril which you can\u2019t tell I have unless you look closely, and a septum piercing which I keep hidden during work hours. All of my managers know I have these piercings/body mods and quite frankly they don\u2019t really care so long as I don\u2019t show up to work wearing large tacky/unprofessional jewelry. Not a soul has ever said anything to me about it and for the record, yes I do know the rules about piercings. That being said, let\u2019s continue)Anyway, I was already having a pretty terrible day because I hadn\u2019t slept the night before, me and my s/o had been arguing for the last day or so, and I was already pretty run down from work because I\u2019m pretty much the only closing bakery clerk because the other night clerk only closes once a week. So I was not in the mood to deal with the deli demon that day. I kind of just swallowed back my hurt feelings and embarrassment and told DD to mind her own business and focus on doing HER job. Before she could say anything else to me I walked away. Not even five seconds later she was screaming at one of the younger guys in the deli because he accidentally bumped into her slicer. And I mean screaming. She sounded like a banshee. Red faced, she stormed off to look for a manager to complain to and I kind of stopped caring right about there. I don\u2019t get why deli associates are so horrible to everyone else, especially the older deli workers. Deli Demon is terrible to me, my coworkers, her coworkers, the associates in other departments, the managers, and even the customers. But I seem to be her favorite victim for some reason. I\u2019m surprised no one has given her any kind of disciplinary action for the way she acts because with the way she talks to customers I\u2019d be surprised if someone hasn\u2019t complained to a manager about her.

{"fdlsu0d": {"text": "When I was in middle school, my best friend cut herself. I was also depressed and a self harmer but I stuck to methods such as bruising, burning (usually with heat instruments for hair such as flatirons and curling wands and hair dryers), and biting myself really hard. Out of curiosity and searching for a new way to find the endorphin high, I stole her pocket knife one day and cut myself with it. It took me forever to stop cutting regularly. I think I stopped doing it regularly at the end of my senior year of high school after many failed attempts to get clean, and many interventions from family. I still do it in situations where I am under extreme emotional duress such as panic attacks or manic episodes because I don\u2019t know any other way to cope with the screaming in my head during these situations. Even when I don\u2019t feel the urge to cut, I still compulsively collect sharp objects like razors from box cutters and portable pencil sharpeners and broken glass shards, even if I rarely ever use them. Please don\u2019t give in to the urges. If you need to talk to someone, please do not hesitate to get help. Cutting absolutely is an addiction and once you go down that rabbit hole it\u2019s so, so hard to climb back out. I don\u2019t SH regularly anymore but I still find myself checking for scars, checking other people for SH scars, wishing I could give in to the urges, and searching grocery store and craft store aisles for suitable utensils to cut with, even if I don\u2019t plan to use them. Anxiety is a perfectly valid reason to cut, just like depression, sadness, feeling unloved, unwanted, or like you don\u2019t get enough attention are valid reasons to cut. No one has it worse than someone else, everyone just has a different life story. Pain is a universal language and everyone feels it at some point or another. You can have everything you could ever possibly dream of and still be depressed, anxious, lonely, or sad. When I decided to confide in the classmates I trusted and considered friends about my self harm, I felt like I was doing it for attention. Now when I cut, I either do it where no one can see it or I make it look like a cat scratch or brush it off as an abrasion from work because I don\u2019t want to be told that I am hurting myself for attention. I tell no one, not even those closest to me. When I cut I am the only one who can hear me scream and it is the loneliest fucking thing in the world. My experiment in middle school became a lifelong coping method that no amount of therapy has been able to eradicate. Please don\u2019t give into the urge, the curiosity, no matter how soothing it is and no matter how good it makes you feel. It\u2019s not worth the lying, the secrecy, the withdrawal from friends and family, or the constant and crippling state of shame and paranoia. If you feel like you need to talk to someone, or if you slip up and cut yourself again, please please seek therapy. Confide in someone who has the resources to help you. It\u2019s not a bad thing to ask for help. It doesn\u2019t make you weak. It takes a lot of guts to admit that you have a problem.

You should only clean your piercing with saline. Make sure to clean your piercing EVERY DAY until it is healed. I cannot stress this enough.

{"f7vgi27": {"text": "Oh boy. I have 44 horses so here goes. Sunstone (Jorvik Starter): Sunstone has been by my side through all the soul rider quests so far and more. He was the first horse I ever had on SSO and I remember when he looked like a frog on steroids but I love him anyway. Darkstar (Black Morgan): Darkie was my second horse and I rode him EVERYWHERE. I was SUUUPER into goth at the time so I had an outfit that went with Darkie and we looked totally goth together (sometimes we still do). Nightstar (Black Thoroughbred): Nighty was my third horse and he was the first horse I won a high score race on. I stayed on the leaderboard at No.1 for like a week and I was so proud of it, and because of that he became my champ horse even though we never won a single champ. Stardust (Black/white old friesian sport): Stardust was one of my favorites back in like 2016. I trained her in less than a week because she was the only horse I ever rode then (I kind of abandoned my starter and the other two horses I had at the time) and I have lots of questing memories with her in Silverglade and GHV. Stargazer (Old black Appaloosa Jorvik pony): my very first pony! I did every pony champ on her even though I later got the new ponies and kind of forgot about her, but I have lots of memories of failing the pony champ with her. Those were the good times. Ravenfeather (new frezzy model): Raven was my most expensive horse (and still is to this day) and I used to call him my grim reaper during the Halloween events (he does kind of remind me of a horse a ghost or monster would ride).Darkhollow (old North Swedish): Darkhollow literally helped me breeze through Dino and was my first cold resistant horse. Without him I would\u2019ve never made it through Dino alive lol. Darkheart (Shire): Darkheart is a nod to a shire I had on my old account before it was banned and he also looked like a shire I rode in real life who passed away from cancer last year. Rockstar (black icey): Rockstar was the first icey I bought when I unlocked Epona and he was named after my ex boyfriend\u2019s ambition to be a famous rockstar. I rode Rockstar EVERYWHERE and my old laptop was filled with pictures of him. Skywalker (gray icey): I named him after Luke Skywalker and went around telling everyone his name was Luke lol. He\u2019s secretly my favorite icey but don\u2019t tell Rockstar that. Starfire (paint icey): Star is no.3 in my icey collection and I don\u2019t ride her much but I love her coat color.Supernova (cow icey): I got her mostly because I love the fact that she looks just like a cow! Crownroyal (white friesian sport): my favorite thing about her is that her name is a nod to the alcoholic beverage Crown Royal. She\u2019s my favorite adult joke I\u2019ve ever made in SSO, mostly because all the other players are too young to get it. Sundancer (palomino north Swedish, new model): I saw Sundancer on the update video SSO posted and just knew I had to have him. Palominos are my favorite coat color. Greydale (dapple gray Lippizan): I don\u2019t ride him much but I remember wanting a Lippy for the longest time lol. I like that his bum wiggles when he runs. Moonbeam (fleabitten Connemara): Moony is secretly my favorite pony because I have soft spot for fleabitten grays. Stormheart (Bay Connemara): I haven\u2019t even trained him yet but I thought his face was just adorable so I had to buy him. Wildflower (new Chincoteague pony, the paint one in FP): I finally finished training her lol. My favorite thing about her is the little white spot on her eye. Also, Misty of Chincoteague was my favorite book as a kid. Sunflower (buckskin paint pony): he\u2019s just my chunky buddy, what else can I say?Spellcaster (Zony): I loved zebras growing up so when I saw Spell I had to get him. The noises he makes are too cute. Peppermint (chestnut pony): she reminds me of peppermints. I haven\u2019t trained her yet so I don\u2019t really know what her personality traits would be. Applepie (leopard Jorvik pony, new model): He\u2019s as sweet as apple pie and I loved the original model for the leopard pony so I couldn\u2019t resist buying him. Moonpie (Dapple gray pony): when I named him I couldn\u2019t help but think of the Moon Pie cookies. I think his name is my favorite thing. I haven\u2019t trained him either. Blueflame (Black/blue Jorvik Wild): I like that his mane looks like blue fire. Popstar (pink/white Jorvik wild): when I saw all the pink I couldn\u2019t help but think of JoJo Siwa and since I didn\u2019t want to name her BowBow, I named her Popstar. Starchaser (rainbow Jorvik wild): idk, she just looks like a horse you\u2019d find in space or something. Or like someone spilled rainbow paint on her. I really love her blaze. Haven\u2019t trained her yet. Ravenheart (black/red Jorvik wild): I got him because I just needed that touch of nostalgia from when I played SSO in middle and high school. Starlord (bay paint clydesdale): haven\u2019t trained him yet but he has such a sweet face Seabreeze (gray curly): she just looks so wind blown with her curly hair, like she\u2019s been standing by the ocean. Moonlight (dapple gray Akhal-Teke, new model): He just seems like a quiet and serious guy. Nightblood ( black/gray Pintabian): I used to work with Arabians so I really had a soft spot for Nightblood. Dawnstar (Haflinger): Named after the town in Skyrim! Dragonborn (black Hanoverian): named after the player in Skyrim! Superhero (champagne APH): my mom always has a soft spot for paint horses so I had to get Superhero. I have yet to train him though. Autumnflame (bay Lusitano): when I found out they could piaffe, I HAD to have one! I love dressage. Bays are also one of my favorites. Clouddancer (leopard mustang): she\u2019s my favorite western horse. Everwind (gray pinto mustang): I named her after the first club I made years and years ago, Everwind Mustangs. That\u2019s all I can think of right now, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing a few horses lol.", "link_id": "t3_dxq4i8", "time": 1574023494}}

{"f7orxds": {"text": "Definitely gonna echo what the other commenter said. Don\u2019t spend money on your own equipment right away. Wait until you\u2019ve gotten the chance to ride regularly before you spend your money on horse stuff. First, focus on finding a barn that is nice and well cared for and has positive reviews, and a good teacher. It\u2019s always good to take a tour of the barn to get a feel for how things run around there and how the horses are treated. Even better, see if you can sit in on a lesson or two and watch to see how the instructor interacts with their students. Unfortunately, my first riding instructor when I was a kid was extremely harsh and screamed at me every time I did something wrong. The lessons I took there were absolutely miserable, and I almost quit riding altogether because she was just so horrible and I didn\u2019t learn anything from being yelled at. The way she taught really destroyed my self esteem and confidence and I struggled with the fact that I thought I was a terrible rider, even years after I had stopped taking lessons there. You don\u2019t want that. Yelling at students is not productive in any way. Riding lessons should always be fun, but instructive, and an instructor who implements both enjoyment and learning into their lessons is has the mark of someone who knows how to get the best out of both horse and rider. Don\u2019t worry about what discipline you want to do or where you want to grow as a rider just yet. Right now, just focus on remastering the basics and whatever else you know about horses and riding before you worry about what can be or what will be. I\u2019ve been riding for 16 years and even I still practice the basics when I\u2019m riding. Even at intermediate and advanced levels of riding the fundamentals are still absolutely essential. Most importantly, just have fun. Nothing good ever comes from obsessing over your mistakes, or obsessing over ribbons or trophies or shows. Just enjoy yourself and enjoy the time spent with horses because they are absolutely wonderful.", "link_id": "t3_dxaszq", "time": 1573932872}}
{"f7oq956": {"text": "Yay great job! It\u2019s always great to work different horses. It teaches you to become a more versatile rider. Just like people, no two horses are exactly the same. It\u2019s always fun riding the horse you like the best, but sometimes it\u2019s good to get on a horse you\u2019re not very familiar with. It\u2019s one of the things I love about being an exercise rider. I get to work with different horses all the time. When I was younger I didn\u2019t often get the opportunity to work with different horses because I had my own horse and I always just rode him. Once I started working as an exercise rider during high school after we sold our horses I got to improve as a rider and a trainer, and even as a person because I got to work different horses at each barn I worked for, and each horse had his own quirks and challenges. Congrats to you for building your confidence by riding a horse who gave you a difficult time once, and congrats to Dotty for her improvements. It sounds like you had a blast and got the opportunity to learn something new, and those are the best kinds of rides you could ask for!", "link_id": "t3_dx6zby", "time": 1573931876}}

{"f6ua44j": {"text": "Do not let anyone tell you that old horses are supposed to be skinny. If you notice that your horse starts to lose a significant amount of weight, or you notice her going off her feed, please get it checked out to make sure she\u2019s still in good health. When I was a kid I adopted an 18 year old standardbred and he stayed at my barn until he was well into his 20s. He lived to be about 34. He was never ever skinny, or anywhere near skinny for that matter. Even once he was well into his 20s I still rode him daily, and he worked as a lesson horse at a friend\u2019s barn until he was about 31 or 32. I also want to echo everyone saying keep them moving. Light workouts are good, she shouldn\u2019t need a vigorous workout. Maybe take her on the trails or if you feel like doing arena work, you could do flat work or even some little jumps just to keep her from getting bored. I\u2019d also recommend letting children and inexperienced riders ride her for you if you don\u2019t have the time. An inexperienced rider is always best with a senior horse, and there are lots of people who are willing to either pay for riding lessons or help out around the barn in exchange for a bit of riding. If she does get to a point where it\u2019s just not ideal to ride her anymore, don\u2019t lock her in the stall. Turn her out as much as you can, and if you\u2019d like to spend some quality time with her, you could take her for walks and jogs on a lead rope around the yard or through some short trails just to keep her fit.

{"f6u5bau": {"text": "It was my friend\u2019s bridle. She prefers mechanical/leverage hackamores whereas I personally like a good side-pull.  My own bridle that I have leftover from the old barn I was working at is English with a side pull noseband made from braided para-cord but she insisted I use his bridle since she wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d behave without the mechanical hackamore (he hasn\u2019t been ridden in anything else since she bought him). Maybe next time I\u2019ll ask if I can use my hackamore, although I personally care much either way, I can use both types of hackamores in the way they\u2019re meant to be used, I\u2019ve been riding bitless pretty much since I started riding. The saddle is mine. She mostly rides Trouble western, and the majority of the people she gives lessons to and the boy who leases Trouble all ride him western, but she saw no issue with me riding him English and he actually took quite nicely to it, so much so that she encouraged me to keep riding him English. Either way, it\u2019s not my horse and I don\u2019t call the shots. Whatever she says, goes. Our riding styles might differ very greatly; she rides like a barrel racer (for lack of a better word) whereas most of my riding lessons in the past 10+ years have been mostly English pleasure/hunter under saddle, so my riding style is much quieter and more passive than hers is (light hands, deep seat, I ride mostly with leg cues to guide the horse rather than using the reins, etc.); but in the several years I\u2019ve known her, I\u2019ve never once seen her be deliberately cruel to any of her horses, so I can\u2019t automatically assume that because she rides her horses with a mechanical hackamore, she\u2019s a terrible abusive rider.", "link_id": "t3_dt2qku", "time": 1573158299}}

{"f5l3eg9": {"text": "At my worst phase of anorexia my weight dropped from 135 to 99. I was so cold constantly, even while taking a boiling hot shower. I wore a jacket, jeans, and fur boots in the dead heat of Florida because I was just so cold. I wore two blankets and three jackets whenever I was home because sixty degrees felt like -10 degrees. My nail beds and lips were always a ghostly shade of blue and my skin was always white as a sheet. Every time I brushed my hair it would fall out. Thankfully I have very thick hair so I never had to shave my head because of the shocking amount of hair loss, but I did cut it off at chin length to hide how much hair I was losing. I fainted. A lot. I would faint almost every morning after getting out of bed, I\u2019d faint on the bus to school, I\u2019d faint in class, I\u2019d faint at lunch. I also fell asleep a lot. I\u2019d fall asleep in class, at lunch, while doing homework, I even fell asleep during my exams a few times. I\u2019m still not sure how I maintained all A\u2019s and a 4.2 GPA during my senior  year of high school because I fell asleep or fainted at school a lot. But that\u2019s just what happened to me physically. I\u2019d weigh myself whenever my parents weren\u2019t around and cry and sob and scream because I wasn\u2019t at my goal (my goal then was 80lbs). I would eat everything in the house and then throw a massive fit because I had let food enter my body. I\u2019d have panic attacks about family dinners, and when I was forced to eat at a restaurant I\u2019d eat only from the kids menu and wouldn\u2019t even finish my plate. Instead of eating meals I would spend my time counting how many bones I could see or reading books that had anorexic main characters, or I\u2019d browse the tumblr and instagram thinspo tags for motivation. It wasn\u2019t until my doctors realized how low my weight had gotten that they gave me an ultimatum: either you go to outpatient or we lock you away until we decide you\u2019re better. Obviously I didn\u2019t want to go to an ED clinic so I got in touch with a friend who did experiential therapy with horses and I started riding at her barn seven days a week. My parents monitored everything I ate until the day I dropped out of college. I\u2019d like to say I made a full recovery but I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m technically medically overweight now but the voice of \u201cAna\u201d is still there. I\u2019m still starving and restricting and exercising more than I should. It\u2019s not that the therapy didn\u2019t help, it\u2019s just that once that barn closed down I sunk deep into my disorders once again and I\u2019m still stuck. I don\u2019t want this for myself but at the same time I\u2019ve fallen in love with my illness and I can\u2019t bear to let Ana go because I don\u2019t know who I am without her.", "link_id": "t3_dljd4g", "time": 1572273515}}

IF YOU HAVE HORSES:Before the storm:Buy halters that you can have engraved with your phone number, name, and horse\u2019s name, OR, write in paint or sharpie on your halter with your personal info so people can contact you if your horses get loose during a bad storm.  If for any reason you cannot do this, write your name and phone number on your horse in something that won\u2019t wash off in the rain. During the storm: If you keep your horses in your backyard, TURN THEM OUT. Put your horses in the pasture/in the yard. Chances are your barn or shelter is not a safe place for them to be in storm force winds. It is safer for them to be completely outdoors where they are not at risk for having the roof and walls collapse on them. After the storm: If you\u2019ve experienced bad flooding, be sure to move your horses to the driest ground you can find. If you cannot do this, we would dig trenches in the pasture and behind the stalls whenever the barn flooded to irrigate the floodwater. We actually did this during storm Isaac when all of Loxhatchee was flooded. Check your horse\u2019s hooves for thrush if they\u2019ve been living in standing water. While wet and dirty environments are not the only cause of thrush, living in wet and dirty conditions can definitely cause thrush. Also be sure to check your horses for signs of rain rot/rain scald. It is important to keep your horse\u2019s coat and hooves as dry as you possibly can. Prolonged wetness can cause a lot of problems. Remember, do not panic about your horses being turned out. They are more likely to be safe outdoors than they are locked inside a wooden barn. I\u2019d much rather my horses get loose during a hurricane than die because I locked them in an unsafe area.

I\u2019ve been stretching for about 4-5 years now and I\u2019ve been getting body piercings for the last 2. I got my nostril pierced when I was 18. I considered it my first legitimate piercing because it was the first one that was entirely my decision (had my lobes done as a baby). It was a bit of an impulsive decision, I\u2019d wanted one for a while but wasn\u2019t serious about actually getting it done until maybe the day before I got it pierced. My piercer was fantastic, APP certified of course, really great dude. Anyway, he pierced me, gave me my aftercare brochure and some saline and sent me on my way. Me being the absolute immature brat I was at 18, I didn\u2019t follow my aftercare properly and my cute nose piercing almost immediately turned into a nightmare a week after getting it pierced. I was also not careful with it at all as it was healing, which only made matters worse. I constantly fiddled with the jewelry, which led to constant pain and irritation, and bacteria on my nose at all times. The icing on the cake was when my dad forgot I had my nose pierced (I have a small brown stud in to hide it at work), was messing around with me and pinched my nose, and nearly ripped out my stud. Blood. Everywhere. I was mortified. Cleaned it up, cried for a while like a little baby, and went to sleep. When I woke up the next morning, it was swollen, red, oozing, and had a nice big irritation bump on it. I literally tried everything to get that damn bump to go away. Tea tree oil, sea salt soaks, hot water, saline, Tylenol paste, literally nothing worked. It stayed on my nose for a good three months before I finally gave up and left it alone, and THEN it disappeared. Thankfully, other than some acne around the piercing and the occasional buildup of gunk, the rest of my healing process went fine. Definitely learned my lesson after that and I\u2019m doing a fine job taking care of my new tragus piercing if I do say so myself.

{"eethjnm": {"text": "So many things wrong with this situation. For one, your piercer should always tell you the kind of metal in the jewelry. The fact that you don\u2019t know/piercer didn\u2019t tell you is a huge no-no.  My piercer walked me through the different types of jewelry and what would work best with my skin and allergies before he even sat me down in the piercing chair when I got my nose pierced. Certain metals can cause certain skin reactions that can be severe if overlooked. Jewelry metal should always be the hypoallergenic kind to avoid triggering any allergies you might have. Whoever told you you could change your jewelry after 6-8 weeks doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. You should never change it by yourself until at least six months to a year, especially if you aren\u2019t sure how to remove/put in your jewelry. If you absolutely need to change it before then, consult with your piercer and he/she can do it for you. L-shape jewelry should not be used in a fresh/healing piercing. It\u2019s generally too loose and prone to moving around and causing irritation. I would recommend trying threadless jewelry and see if that works a bit better for you. As for the pustule, I had something similar around the eight month mark of having my nose pierced because my dad forgot I had my nose pierced (it\u2019s hard to tell since I only wear a skin colored stud) and playfully squeezed my nose, catching on the stud and pulling it. It bled and oozed pus for a while. I just soaked it in warm salt water for 5-10 minutes three times a day and after a week or so, it eventually went away. However, I only did this because my piercer lives in another state and I couldn\u2019t go in to have it looked at because the closest piercer in my town is an hour and a half away from me. I would definitely have a piercer who knows what they\u2019re doing look at it before you do anything. Don\u2019t poke it with a needle or put tea tree oil or aspirin on it. If you must, clean it with saline. Again, let your piercer know. ", "link_id": "t3_aj41je", "time": 1548300955}}

{"ecsyipe": {"text": "I once rode a horse named Abby. The owner had been trying to sell her and she thought maybe if someone would get on her and work with her, people would warm up to her and see past her terrible habits of biting and kicking. I agreed. I bonded with Abby without even realizing I had bonded with her. We went from not cooperating to being teammates.... and best friends. She was there for me when my parents yelled at me and hurt my feelings. She was there to comfort me whenever I ran away from home. One day the abuse got so bad I almost killed myself. But as I was writing down my last words the world, I thought of Abby, and I stopped. I couldn\u2019t bear to be in any world or dimension that didn\u2019t have her in it. It was then that I learned that Abby was also broken. She had been passed on from owner to owner over maybe 20 years and didn\u2019t know who to trust. I wanted her to trust me. I decided that I wouldn\u2019t let anyone take her from me. The owner had given up trying to sell her because she had seen how Abby had changed me as a person. I would come to the barn a sobbing mess on some days and leave with a beaming smile. But what I didn\u2019t know was that Abby had gotten injured and her pain had caused her to lash out at people. She nearly kicked the owner\u2019s face in and attacked the dog, almost killing it. The owner couldn\u2019t bear to watch her be in so much pain that she attacked those around her, nor could she stable a horse that was dangerous, especially since kids and teenagers were her main riders, so she did what she thought was best and put Abby down. I got the call after a choir recital. It was the owner\u2019s husband, calling to inform us all that Abby died. And in that moment, time just kind of stopped. And my world shattered. I could hear it crashing down on my head. I think I screamed. I know I shouted at them not to hurt my Abby and that I didn\u2019t want her to die, but it was no use. My parents made me go to school despite the fact that I stayed up all night, locked in my room, bawling crying. I cried on the way to school. I put my head down and cried in class. I cried on the way home. I cried until I had no tears left to cry and then I collapsed and just laid on the floor and stared at the ceiling. I guess what I\u2019m getting at is, you\u2019re not alone. I know how hard it is to lose an animal companion that you\u2019ve bonded with, especially when that animal companion is your coping mechanism. Just know that your nparents haven\u2019t won, and this isn\u2019t your fault. Life really sucks. And this is one of those moments where it really sucks. But I promise you\u2019ll make it through. Loss is really hard. Whether it be human, horse, or cockatiel, loss is a painful experience. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on even my worst enemies. But if you feel alone, please do not hesitate to talk to someone. Remember, no matter how heavy your burden, it\u2019s always lighter when you carry it with someone. You\u2019re not alone, OP. I\u2019m really sorry for your loss. \u2764\ufe0f", "link_id": "t3_aae9r1", "time": 1546094670}}

One second he started walking a little too close and the next, I had rammed the fingernail of my index finger deep into his eye socket. The sound was sickening. The man screamed. I didn\u2019t stop there. I shoved the man to the ground and pinned him beneath me. I took out the bloody, mushy remains of the man\u2019s eyeball and force fed it to him. When he refused, I pried open his trembling jaws and shoved it in his mouth. I demanded that he swallow his eyeball or I would gouge out his remaining eye. He swallowed, and I laughed. I explained that it didn\u2019t matter if he ate his own eye, he wouldn\u2019t be leaving here with his sight. I used the same index finger to gouge out his other eye. He tried to scream but I shoved my knee in his mouth. He whimpered. Even pissed himself in fear. I laughed. He ate his remaining eyeball with no protest. He couldn\u2019t see me smiling down at him with pride. When the ordeal was over, I kissed him gently on the cheek and bid him goodnight. I don\u2019t feel bad. I don\u2019t even feel sorry for him. He made advances towards me multiple times that night and every time I rejected him he would put his hands on me.

Of course I didn\u2019t know what to do when he started touching me in places I had never even touched myself. I just kind of froze. I couldn\u2019t even say no. It was a horrifying experience. Eventually I came to my senses I told him I didn\u2019t think we should be doing this, take me back to my aunts house, etc etc. and he did, after several minutes of me crying and begging. I told him never to speak to me again, and proceeded to block him on facebook and delete his number. I never told my aunt and uncle, or even my parents or grandparents. The only people who know are my brother, my ex and my current boyfriend (though I didn\u2019t tell him until many years after this incident). I dealt with my trauma almost entirely alone. It\u2019s sickening to me that anyone could gain any kind of pleasure from sexually assaulting someone, much less someone who wasn\u2019t even an adult. What\u2019s worse is that my cousin wasn\u2019t the only man to sexually assault me. My first boyfriend, who I had gotten into a relationship with only months after I had been molested, didn\u2019t hesitate to overpower me and convince me to perform acts on him that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with at all. And he got away with it every time because he was almost six feet tall and easily weighed 250 pounds, while I was barely 5\u20191\u201d and about ten pounds wet.  And to make things more disgusting, he knew I had been molested and still proceeded to abuse me like this anyway. Rape isn\u2019t funny and it happens more than you think.

I opened the shed to investigate and as soon as I did, my horses spooked and bolted out of their stalls and into the pasture. I did some investigating to see if it was a raccoon or the neighbors dog, and get this: there were no animal tracks in the dirt, no sign that anything with a physical form had ever been there at all, and moments before this happened it was completely silent. There\u2019s a whole lot of other weird stuff that went on for a while too now that I think about it. When my mom got new chicks about a month or two ago, she got about 20 of them and maybe 10 of them mysteriously were found dead in their pen despite having adequate amounts of food and water and plenty of room in the pen to avoid the chicks stepping on each other and crushing each other. My mom chalked it up to an animal, but I inspected the dead chicks thoroughly and found no bite marks, scratch marks, or any other signs of trauma related death. They just.... died. And none of them were sick, they were all perfectly healthy. My mom thinks it\u2019s a raccoon but looking back on it I\u2019m not sure.

I\u2019m not going to be giving out Old Man\u2019s real name, his current owner\u2019s name, or his previous owner\u2019s name because I don\u2019t want anyone tracking them down and attacking them or saying that the current owner is abusing Old Man in any way. He gets lots of love from her and has several other people caring for him as best as they can with the time they have. Old Man\u2019s current owner owned Old Man back in 1990 and sold him to a woman who breeds Arabians. This lady, who I\u2019m going to call previous owner, made a million dollars off of breeding Old Man. I never met previous owner, but judging by the state of Old Man, he was eventually no longer needed as he aged, because not too long before current owner got Old Man, he was locked in a dark stall with a blanket thrown haphazardly on his back only to be seen at feeding time. Now fast forward to about February 2018, current owner found Old Man and began working to get her horse back. Well she did, and she didn\u2019t get what she saw in the picture. What came to her was a horse covered in sores, matted hair, dirt, filth, manure, his hooves riddled with abscesses and overgrown. Fast forward months of having issues cleaning him up and putting weight on him to me coming along, and we have Old Man now. Please keep in mind that where he is now, he is well loved, well fed, and being taken care of by me, my friends, current owner, and family and friends of current owner. We are doing all we can for Old Man to make him comfortable and happy until he inevitably is either put down or passes away on his own. You don\u2019t have to believe me, you can call me a liar or tell me I\u2019m a terrible horse person for posting pictures of a skinny, broken horse in the process of being rehabilitated, but please know that I haven\u2019t done anything to hurt this horse and neither has current owner. We are doing what we can for him with all of the free time we have. I don\u2019t know what the end result will be yet. But hopefully Old Man is feeling the love he deserves to have.

I have everything against drugging horses to mask the pain of injuries so they can run, also risking catastrophic breakdowns.And not only that, the racehorses that don\u2019t end up with physical problems that could either kill them or cripple them for life ultimately end up in slaughterhouses. How do I know this? Well, not only is that a fact, I also owned a rescued Standardbred former racehorse growing up that was supposed to be sent to slaughter because he was \u201ctoo slow\u201d and couldn\u2019t win. Not all racehorses are as lucky to find good homes instead of going to slaughter and ending up on someone\u2019s plate in Canada or Mexico. I\u2019m not saying that everyone in the racing industry is bad. Unfortunately, however, so much of the racing industry is truly cruel and disgusting and for that reason, I will never support horse racing. In my eyes, racing is right up there with abusing Tennessee walking horses. You can tell me I\u2019m biased, downvote me, do and say whatever you want, but as someone who grew up with a former racehorse and dealt with the psychological issues he had, my opinion on horse racing still firmly stands.

I\u2019ve already had my heart broken many times when it comes to horses. I grew up with horses that I retrained and rehomed, and it was sad to see them go, even if they were going to a place with a loving family to take care of them, and they\u2019d have it better than they would with my family. I was sad when I had to give my horse up to the people who are now selling him and the horse I ride because I no longer had the time to work with horses 24/7, and after a freak accident with my horse, I had decided that it was no longer safe to keep a horse in my side of the neighborhood, and that he needed to go somewhere where he would be ridden and worked with regularly. I have seen this before. This is not new. Like I mentioned, I retrained and rehomed horses for the majority of my life. I was attached to many of the horses I worked with, and it saddened me to see them go to a new family. I understand that where the horses go is not my decision, even though one of those horses belonged to me for ten years. It was not my decision when they put the horse that saved my life down. It was not my decision when they put two other horses down. I understand that I have no say. The owner is sick, and while me and my friend help out as much as we can, she\u2019s sad because she can no longer ride or care for her horses, and relies on her husband and us to care for them. I totally understand what it\u2019s like to have horses that you can no longer adequately care for because you don\u2019t have the time/money/or if you\u2019re hurt or ill. I have rescued several horses growing up who were caught in this situation. Getting attached to an animal that isn\u2019t yours is in no way a bad thing. The last horse I rode was my superhero. I loved her very dearly. I was devastated when she died, to the point of depression. But in the end I understood that it was for the best. The horse had a lot of issues. There were moments where she could be extremely dangerous, and if me or my friend got in the horse\u2019s way on a bad day and were injured or killed, the owners would have to live with the fact that their horse had lashed out and things did not end well. And no one wanted to take her because she attacked people for no apparent reason. Not only was she dangerous, she also had arthritis and was in pain. She could only work for so long before moving started to hurt her. Her death was for the best, although to this day I miss her very much. She was a one of a kind. And if they sell the horses, I understand that it is entirely their decision, sad for all of us though it may be. However, my friend and I are going to make a plan to find a way to either help pay for feed/vet bills/farrier bills/etc. or find a way to help pay for the owner\u2019s treatment so she can recover and ride her horses again. My mom is going to reach out to the local church for help. The owner is very active there, and she uses her horses for the special needs ministry in therapy riding lessons. I am sure that the church will do anything in their power to help her keep her horses and help her recover, as well as shower her and her family with love, kindness, and support. These horses mean a lot to everyone who has had the opportunity to love on, care for, and ride them. Many of my days off are spent with these horses. They are very dear to us and we will be very sad if in the end, they do have to leave. I have decided, that if worst comes to worst, I am selling my tack when the horses go, and I am ending my days as an equestrian. Maybe I\u2019ll focus on studying abroad, and find a new hobby, like art, or photography. If the horses move on, so will I. I\u2019ve already asked my friend to please refrain from inviting me if she starts riding elsewhere. And that is my final decision. ", "link_id": "t3_9131r2", "time": 1532358319}}

{"dykmust": {"text": "Hey guys. Girlfriend here. Yeah, I have Reddit, too. I don\u2019t want to sound defensive or bring any hate to myself, and I\u2019m sorry if you see it that way. I\u2019d like to explain myself a little. Like my boyfriend said, I lost a bunch of friends. One got tired of dealing with me through a tough time in life and refuses to speak to me, one moved to Indiana, and one doesn\u2019t really care all that much about me and only wants to hang out if horses are involved. So of course, when someone reached out to be my friend, I gladly accepted the offer because I didn\u2019t want to be alone, especially now when my life is going in all different directions. I do understand where my boyfriend is coming from and it was wrong of me to not truly take his feelings to heart. I was afraid to lose another friend and I focused on that instead. I\u2019ve been cheated on in two relationships and I know how painful it is. I\u2019d like to point out that I deleted those contacts a year ago. We were at the stage in the relationship where I still had trust issues and did not completely trust him due to reasons I\u2019d like to keep between me and OP. It was immature of me to do so at the time, but I did believe that I had my reasons. I\u2019d like to get this straight: I don\u2019t mind him talking to girls as long as it\u2019s not ex girlfriends or any girls he has had any kind of intimate relationship with in the past. My exes are off my friends list on social media and out of my contacts, and I expect the same from him. If there\u2019s a girl that he wants to go to for relationship or life advice, that\u2019s okay. But I will tolerate cheating just about as much as he does: which is, I won\u2019t tolerate it at all. But I trust him not to cheat on me, and I hope to god that he trusts me as well. I\u2019m also okay with him hanging out with another girl as long as I\u2019m with him. We had a conversation today with my friend over the phone. I wasn\u2019t comfortable bringing up personal conversations that I\u2019ve had over messenger and the pressure I was being put under was giving me an anxiety attack, so I figured it would be easier to call and clear things up. It was made perfectly clear to all of us that my friend and I have a platonic relationship. We are just friends, and neither of us ever see each other ever being anything more than that. I\u2019d also like to point another thing out. I grew up with guys. I have a younger brother, and I grew up in a neighborhood of only boys. I was the only girl around growing up. If I wanted to hang out with someone, I had to wrestle or play kickball with the boys. I didn\u2019t have any girlfriends to play dolls with. So I ended up growing up a tomboy. I can\u2019t relate to wearing makeup or pretty designer dresses, or gossiping about who knows what, like girls always do for some reason. I grew up riding horses, wrestling, hunting, fishing, playing sports with boys, and preferring dump trucks over Barbie dolls. Hanging out with and talking to guys has been so normal to me that I\u2019ve just become one of the guys, I guess, and that\u2019s how most guys who know me see me, if that makes sense. So I didn\u2019t think anything of it when I started talking to my friend. I was just one of the guys again, and he admitted that that\u2019s how he sees me since I like guns and knives and most of the stuff guys are into. And like I said, I grew up having a lot of guy friends, so I just figured that this was normal. I\u2019ve also never been in a relationship where talking to a guy was such a big deal, but I guess I never had that issue because the other guys I was good friends with were good friends with my exes, even if they only knew them through me. Bottom line, having guy friends has always been the norm for me, whether I\u2019m in a relationship or not, and I just didn\u2019t know any different. I hope that clears stuff up a bit. I\u2019d like to say that after talking this over, OP and I are doing fine. This relationship will not be ending anytime soon. ", "link_id": "t3_8heb4c", "time": 1525671038}}

And that's how life is. I know that statement probably sounds pointless to you because if you want to kill yourself, then you already know what I'm trying to say. I'm probably preaching to the choir here. This probably isn't going to matter to you much, but I just want to tell you that if you kill yourself now, you'll miss out on so many wonderful things in life. There are so many great opportunities, so many options, and so many doors for you to open in life. Some will be bad, some will be good, and some decisions you make will be the best decisions of your life. I hope choosing to live instead of killing yourself will be one of those great decisions for you one day. Please remember that there are always people who care about you and will stand by your side in the dark while you try and find your way. They may be friends, family, or even total strangers.

I remember taking all those pills, I remember everything from before I blacked out. I remember my brother looking concerned because I was acting differently than I normally did. I remember texting my friend and telling her not to miss me. She remembers it, too. There are stories of people dying and coming back to life. It's happened before, and no it's not some Bible stuff. Just last night I was talking with someone whose heart stopped while he was blackout drunk. After an hour of searching for him, his friend found him slumped against a tree with no pulse. His friend had to literally punch him in the chest to get his heart pumping again. This stuff has happened. I could very well have had a similar experience. I don't know what you define as stupid shit, but I'm no longer suicidal at least. I had a lot of reasons to want to kill myself. I was being abused, spending a lot of time running away, in a toxic relationship, and struggling with school. School was not my only issue. Sure, a lot of people have it worse than I did.

The manga is pretty well written and definitely has some sad/emotional/deep moments, but it's got a bit of comedy to it. The anime adaption was a little bit overdone and ventured a bit far from the story. It got a little too \"comedic\" in some places, but some of the deep and emotional moments that were in the manga are still there. Fullmetal Alchemist is another good one. I haven't read the manga in a while, but it definitely got deep in some places. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was pretty good, but I didn't finish the whole thing. The episodes I did see though had some emotional moments, too. If you haven't already, go check them out. Surprisingly, a lot of people I talk to have never even heard of Black Cat, so if you haven't heard of it, you definitely need to check it out.

{"dssa8dp": {"text": "I think I can understand where the both of you are coming from. It's scary to witness an anxiety attack because people who don't know about it don't understand. It's also in most cases unexpected. I do think the guy was an asshole for dealing with it the way he did, though. That wasn't fair to you at all. Mental disorders have a negative stigma, and that makes it hard to bring it up sometimes. It's a touchy subject and one that needs to be talked about with care. When you're ready to date again, give it a few dates before you break it to them. Then, handle it sensitively once you're ready to talk about it. If they truly care about you, they'll be with you to walk you through it when it gets bad. As for the anxiety attacks themselves, have you tried the 5-4-3-2-1 technique before? It goes a little something like this. I'll use a restaurant for this example. 5. Five things you can see. For example, tables, silverware, menus, booths, or chairs. 4. Four things you can touch. For example, your silverware, your plate/bowl/tray, your menu, or your drink. 3. Three things you can hear. For example, the people around you, waiters/waitresses opening/closing the kitchen door, or your stomach rumbling cause your hungry. They have to be external sounds, though, you can't use your thoughts. 2. Two things you can smell. For example, the smell of food from the kitchen, or the meal in front of you. 1. One thing you can taste. Maybe your meal or the drink you ordered. This coping mechanism helps you distract you from the thoughts that are causing your anxiety by making you focus on the things around you. If you feel an anxiety attack coming on, try using this to focus on something else. ", "link_id": "t3_7qs7kh", "time": 1516140024}}

{"dsj8x71": {"text": "I had to write this about a million times so I could get my thoughts in order. This is coming from someone who has been haunted by dreams about their ex (as well as someone who has tried crawling back to them before). I've also helped my best friend get through something similar. Alright, let's start from the beginning. I'll skip the first few sentences because that's irrelevant to what I'm going to tell you. You said your ex was not the kind of person you should be in love with. Sure, she might've been gorgeous, but a pretty face doesn't mean a pretty personality. You said the main thing you didn't enjoy about your ex was that she needed constant attention and that made her untrustworthy. You also said you couldn't change that fact about her. There you go, that's why you guys broke up. She wasn't trustworthy and demanded too much of your attention. So you believe she has some sort of strange \"love\" for you when she DOESN'T have a boyfriend. First of all, if it's \"love\" then it isn't love, especially if she only \"loves\" you when she's single. Sorry, but that's not love. That's called a rebound. I'm assuming that she comes around once she gets dumped, has sex with you, and then disappears. She's using you, and because you're letting her use you, she's taking advantage of you. \"She was the girl who took my virginity.\" Okay, you need to let that one go. That may make a significant other special DURING the relationship, but if that relationship ends, what does losing your virginity to them even mean anymore? It doesn't matter if you lost your virginity to them, if they were toxic to you then, they're toxic to you now. \"If I do happen to meet her, we usually get physical, making out or sometimes even having sex.\" I feel like that may be one reason you're having a hard time letting go. That area is one I don't have any experience with because I'm still with the person I lost my virginity to, but I assume that's one reason you keep coming back to her, regardless of who initiates it. \"But days, maybe even weeks later, she disappears.\" There you go, that's the biggest sign she's just using you. If she just keeps disappearing and finding someone else, and then running back when she's single, she's using you. Alright, this cycle has been going on for ten years and you're dreaming about her. That often happens when you're having a hard time letting someone go. It's happened to me before. I had a really hard time letting my first boyfriend go, and I felt really bad because it was me that ended it, and I kept having dreams about him. However, once I learned that he cheated on me multiple times, it was time for it to stop. He was also demanding when it came to doing sexual stuff. He didn't want to respect my boundaries. In order to accept it and move on, I had to cut off all contact with him because that was the step in the right direction. After he could no longer contact me, I needed to take some time away from being in relationships to accept the fact that it was over and to move on. That ended the dreams, the guilt, and the urge to crawl back to him just because I felt bad. And that's what I think you need to do. You need to move on. She is keeping you from meeting someone who is going to be good for you and treat you right. She's preventing you from having the possibility to be in a healthy relationship. The first step to stop having these dreams is to cut her out of your life. Delete and block her number, unfriend/unfollow her, block her, and don't talk to her ever again. Then, you need to accept the fact that she's only holding you back. Take some time away from relationships to let that sink in, and for the dreams to go away. She's taking advantage of you and in turn, you're torturing yourself by letting her run your life like this.", "link_id": "t3_7pp6ho", "time": 1515699628}}
