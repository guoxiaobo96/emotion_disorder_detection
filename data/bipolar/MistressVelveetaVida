{"ft9r6ki": {"text": "This is one subject I do not talk to others about because it is one of my deepest shames, however I really really need you to hear this. I have been bulimic off and on for over 26 years. I'm just going to lay out all the long term effects it has had on me. My teeth have been eroded to the point where some have had to be removed while having thousands of dollars of dental work done. My hair is falling out. I now cannot eat without discomfort and pain. My body is so damaged that I have had to have my gallbladder removed. I have to take stomach medications daily just to not have the absolutely crippling pain I have in my stomach, I have been informed by multiple Drs that this is permanent all I can do is try to manage the pain. My throat is litterally eroding. I hate myself and how I look and the longer I let the bulimia go on the worse it got. It is pure hell and I don't want that for you. I. Do. Not. Want this for you. I understand the urges to purge, it's like a release letting all the \"bad stuff\" out and you feel better for a while but slowly that high you get after will fade away and all you are left with is the seemingly uncontrollable compulsion to purge and that's what it is, a compulsion. I would advocate telling someone you trust first. Therapy is also something that can really help but it is not a cure all. I truly wish someone had sat me down and layed all this out to me years ago but I have never had the courage to tell anyone the reason all these problems exist. YOU DID! Even if it is just strangers on the internet you were able to take that plunge and I admire the hell out of you for it. Please don't lose hope because you are much stonger than you realize.

I'm not going to lie though, it was very uncomfortable and a sometimes just horrible but as my dosage decreased it was like I could feel again. It felt like I had come out of a 3 year fog that I don't remember a whole lot of. The real shit of this is that that was the dosage they had prescribed and let go on that long, I had to go to a different Dr and they were shocked to say the least. They couldn't believe I was coherent. If this is something you want to do, like really ready the difference will change your life.

I was very surprised with the results, my doc ended up changing a few doses of my meds, stopping some and trying ones from the list of most likely to help.
