{"fssqa8w": {"text": "I am extremely upset that a man and his family took advantage of me. I was 15 and he was nearing 20. I didn\u2019t know his age when we started dating. It was the beginning of the school year. I was a sophomore and he was a senior, so I thought he was 17 at the oldest, so while not ideal, nothing predatory, or so I thought. Now, I had just left a mentally abusive relationship with someone else which had almost lead me to suicide. Every night that ex would talk to me about how he was going to harm himself or kill himself, especially if I left, so it took more than one time to break up with him, and I thought that if he killed himself for real that time, that I would have to do the same. So after that experience, my whole understanding of how relationships were supposed to work was completely shaken up, especially since I was at an age where everyone is learning that stuff. So, when the older boy came along, I was so broken in that area that I clung to the affection I didn\u2019t receive in my last try at a relationship.I didn\u2019t know his age until after our first kiss. I spent a lot of time at his place, and he, his friends, and all of his family led me to think that our ages were perfectly acceptable, normal even, and that I shouldn\u2019t be worried in the least.I lost my virginity to him, and we had intercourse many times. I thought it was okay because everyone acted like it was, and everyone always told me how great he was, what I nice guy he was, how he was just the McFucking best, so I went along with it, despite my apprehension.What it was was statutory rape. I started to get more and more uncomfortable when it came to physical intimacy. I started feeling wrong and gross and my eyes were finally opened to how no, it was not fucking okay what he did to me. An adult man had his hands all fucking over me and everyone encouraged it! He was so fucking loved by everyone that I could never say anything bad about him, let alone that he was a rapist, without getting verbally attacked myself.So of course, I repressed that shit. I shoved it down deep inside of me, because I didn\u2019t get any sympathy. I got no pity, kind words, or any closure at all. It took my two years to say anything about it to anyone. I didn\u2019t process the situation fully until I moved to college. We went through several rounds of consent training, and each one was brutal to me. I didn\u2019t give, COULDN\u2019T give consent. Every time we had a training, the wound reopened. The first person I told was in college, because they didn\u2019t know him. What did I get in return? \u201cTake some responsibility, you were at fault too. It\u2019s unfair to call him a pedophile\u201d. Yeah. That felt fucking fantastic.I\u2019m turning 19 next Monday, and I swear, every day I get closer to his age, I get sickened more and more about how someone could ever think it was okay. It hurts quite a bit.I\u2019m working on relationships with my therapist, now. I have a great understanding now about my boundaries, which is good, but I keep psyching myself out of possible romantic encounters, because the two experiences I had were far from healthy, and I have difficulty understanding now what is and isn\u2019t healthy.

People can feel on top of the world and like everything is incredible, or it could be accompanied by extreme irritability as well. Usually there are risky behaviors present during these episodes, risky sex, drug use, or irresponsible use of money. My risky behavior is money related, I once spent $1000 dollars of teenage summer job money on witchcraft supplies over the two months I was receiving that money. People can also have delusions of grandeur, psychosis, the lack the need for sleep or as much sleep, usually intense goal oriented activity, or hyper sexuality. Mania usually prevents typical functioning and often leads in hospitalization, while hypomania doesn\u2019t usually require hospitalization and, while still being intense, is usually slightly less extreme.

{"fs9252q": {"text": "So starting in about the 6th grade, I began having 2-4 month depressive episodes once a year that tended to fall right in the middle of the school year every time. I was treated for depression, but it never really helped at all, my grades would drop, I would sleep too much, all that jazz. Last year was my senior year of highschool, and I was hit incredibly hard. The summer before the school year started, I had my first large hypomanic episode, got really into witchcraft, spent at or over $1000 online, and was irritable as all hell 24/7. Once the school year started, my mood just went haywire. I\u2019m an incredibly good student, and am known for being upbeat and energetic, and people around me just saw how sick I was. I was in a play at that time, but I had lost interest in wanting to be there, despite being in theater since the beginning of middle school. I also have ADHD, anxiety, and I am currently being considered for a diagnosis of autism(ASD), and my intense moods definitely triggered those issues, I was so sensory sensitive I couldn\u2019t handle most touch and I had to wear earplugs most of the time. These issues were disrupting my abilities in class and in the show. Two weeks before our play went on, I had to step down from my role. I was taken to the crisis center, because I had intrusive thoughts about self harm. At this time, my medications were all mixed up because depression medications tend to do the opposite for bipolar disorder, so I was most likely having some sort of mixed episode. I wasn\u2019t placed in residential inpatient care, but I was put into a partial hospitalization program. At this point, the episode wasn\u2019t mixed, it was just one of my 4 month long depressive episodes. Treatment was amazing for me, but of course I was still depressed, that\u2019s just how the disorder works. I seriously wish even mentally healthy people learned what I learned in the program. After some time, the meds started working, and I was able to start picking myself back up. Because of the program, I missed at least 5 weeks of one of my classes. At the end of the year, I managed to get qualifying scores on my AP tests despite me having missed so much time. Flash forward to now, just finished my first year as a music education student at college. When I meet back up with friends from highschool, they tell me how healthy I look now. I haven\u2019t had an episode since hospitalization, and I ended this semester with a 4.0. I will tell you, you have to put in a lot of work to heal. I have to exercise often, eat well, sleep well, and be strict with my medication, but it\u2019s worth it. I probably answered literally none of your questions, but that has been what it\u2019s like for me so far. My biggest piece of advice is to dedicate yourself to take care of your body and mind. It\u2019s hard, but not impossible! Right now, even with quarentine, I\u2019m not doing too awful as long as I stay up to date on my exercise :)", "link_id": "t3_gt2w2v", "time": 1590793287}}

What is usually recommended is to calculate your TDEE, which is your Total Daily Energy Expenditure. The TDEE is basically how many calories you burn in a day. Then, you subtract 500 from it, and eat that amount in a day. That way, you eat less than you burn. One way to still eat a lot while eating less calories is to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. Make sure you are not going hungry! There are plenty of lower calorie recipes all over the internet!

Just to be clear, I\u2019m not undermining anyone\u2019s hard work or dedication just because God sent them. Personally, I think God sent them because they were able to be so strong and brave to accomplish what they did, more like teamwork, if that makes sense. I personally have been through terrible situations and traumas, and I believe that God was with me during them, even if it was me doing all of the hard work to heal and better myself. Like he guided me where to go, and once I was there I worked my ass off and got where I needed to be. I think we have a lot of the same ideals. I 100% believe in people bettering themselves and being the owners of their own successes and hard work. With that, I believe that God helps guide them to where and how to do what they need to do in their lives. One small example in my life was when I moved to college this past year, there really wasn\u2019t a church around my campus that was a good fit for me. I felt a bit lonely and lost, and didn\u2019t really know where or how to practice my faith. By what I believe was God, and you may believe is chance, I ended up walking outside the dining commons at the right time where a girl I met who was about to leave invited me to a prayer group. They were about to leave, and I had almost missed them. I was nervous and unsure at first, and I almost missed it if I hadn\u2019t looked at the clock when I did. I ended up making it to the group, and I met a group of people who prayed for me and cared for me when I was going through a very difficult family emergency. They invited me with open arms and I found a family in them.I think that shows a bit what I mean by God\u2019s presence. I would share an experience where I really had to work hard for myself, but they are quite personal, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s something I would be comfortable sharing on  of all places, but I could always share in private if need be. I don\u2019t want you to think I believe that people don\u2019t deserve credit for what they do, that\u2019s not it at all. I just think God points us in the right direction and guides us to where we need to be, if that makes sense?

For meals like lunch and dinner, half of your plate should be veggies(typically non-starchy) and/or fruits(try more veggies than fruits if you can) a quarter plate lean protein, and a quarter plate grains and stuff like pasta, rice, or starchy vegetables like potatoes and corn. For snacks, try to have a fruit or vegetable and a protein, like having an apple and a cheesestick, or some berries and healthier nuts like almonds or cashews. Breakfast is up to how you feel, try to keep it lower in fat, but see if you personally feel better if you have a more carb focused breakfast like having berries, multigrain toast, or a healthy cereal full of fiber, or if you want a more protein based breakfast, like greek yogurt or eggs. Keep breakfast light but filling. My favorite combos for breakfast are a single scrambled egg on top of whole grain toast and berries on the side, or Greek yogurt with a bit of granola and some nuts on the side. Those may be too light for you, idk your measurements, but those might be a good start. When doing this method, you have to be very mindful of your body\u2019s cues. Remember, eat until satisfied, not stuffed. If you eat until you\u2019re stuffed, you will most likely feel gross and sluggish, and working on your diet isn\u2019t just about gaining or losing weight, but nourishing your body and keeping yourself feeling good! :)Wow, sorry for big text box!", "link_id": "t3_goka33", "time": 1590172040}}

You can do this with negative emotion, but also positive and neutral emotions! Sometimes I just say whatever is on my mind at the time, and this can help process or just getting stuff out of your head and into the open.3) Challenge negative thoughts/ cognitive distortions- It can be hard sometimes to fight back against negative thoughts on your own, so working through them with a therapist can be very useful, as they see your thoughts from the point of view of someone outside your brain, and can pick up on things that aren\u2019t true or aren\u2019t helpful/constructive4) Work on coping skills for your mental toolbox!- Your therapist can help you to find ways to deal with mental/physical issues when you are alone and have to work on it by yourself. They can teach grounding, how to deal with anxiety/depression, and just get yourself to a better state of mind on your own.There are probably many more, but my ADHD meds just wore off, so my thoughts are a bit scattered.One smart thing to do would be to make notes of things during the week, leading up to your appointment.

To claim that you are being oppressed by a doctor letting you know that you have a health problem actually boggles my mind. Admit that you have a goddamned problem, and make healthy steps to improve your life.", "link_id": "t3_geabh1", "time": 1588733681}}

Eating 1,200 calories is actually really easy when you bulk up every meal with fruits and vegetables. There are tons of really low calorie veggies and fruits, so you will be eating more for less calories. Work with a nutritionist if you have to. I\u2019ve been working with a nutritionist through my school, and I\u2019m actually finally feeling full from my meals at less calories than I used to eat.My favorite filling foods are these:-Vanilla Greek yogurt with berries, granola, or both-Chia seed pudding(my favorite recipe right now is 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk, 3 tablespoons of chia seeds, one tablespoon of maple syrup as a sweetener, half cup of strawberries, and a tablespoon or two of French vanilla coffeemate. I personally like to blend mine, and let it sit overnight and have it for breakfast. This one makes two servings)-Frosted mini wheats(usually at lunch for me)-scrambled egg on toast (depending on the size of the bread, one or two eggs scrambled in 1/4 or 1/2 tablespoon of light I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s not butter, cover the toast with the scrambled egg)-Strawberry peanut butter banana smoothie(1 cup frozen strawberries, 1/2 a banana, 1 cup of almond milk, pinch of stevia, and depending on how many calories you are looking for, either 2 tablespoons of PB2 or 2 tablespoons of normal peanut butter. If you\u2019re looking for more protein, you can add plain or vanilla Greek yogurt, I usually do 1/4 or 1/2 a cup)-peanut butter banana sandwich(whole grain bread, and depending on the size of the bread you could use 2 slices or cut one big slice in half, slice up a banana and I like chunky peanut butter on it)-scrambled eggs scrambled with frozen peppers and onions and sliced up Canadian bacon-low calorie protein shake paired with a fruit(I usually have a vanilla Atkins protein powder shake and a banana)Snacks:-Air popped popcorn with a bit of grated Parmesan, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder(you need to drizzle a bit of oil or light I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s not butter for the seasoning to stick)-apple(or any fruit) and a cheesestick-grapes and light cheddar cheese-Celery or carrots and hummusIdk, these recipes have been great for me lately!

That is literally exactly what it is, so of course people think that pedophiles rape children. That\u2019s literally what their entire attraction is about, do you see where your logic is flawed there? Bisexuality:literally nothing to do with children because age is not and never has been a factor. Pedophelia:literally completely having to do with nonconsensual urges aimed at minors who will never be able to consent.", "link_id": "t3_g1uv49", "time": 1587008026}}

Make no mistake, I\u2019m an excellent student and even a pretty mature person, but this situation has presented me with a lot of challenges.There were a few weeks when I really just didn\u2019t want to deal with one of my friends. It was tiring just to think about texting her, and I just didn\u2019t have the self control at the time to have a more mature conversation with her. Luckily, now I am feeling a lot better about that, and can communicate with her a lot better. Sometimes I really just need a break. Even the people who seem to tackle the symptoms the best will have plenty of times where they struggle super hard with it, and I think right now with the mass change in schedules is taking a lot out of everyone, let alone people with ADHD.Of course, I can\u2019t speak for your partner, but it may be best to try to have a conversation about it, and give space if needed. Even though I felt disinterested in my friend for a bit, I still cared about her quite a bit, I just needed some time where I socialized less to give my brain a break.Edit: Ooh, and about the internet things, oftentimes I will say goodnight to friends a bit early, because I need time to wind down, without socializing with anyone.

I\u2019m only really talking about 1% of the community, but people who think like this also tend to label other members of their community by their sexuality/gender only as well.I really don\u2019t want to only be defined as my sexuality.

Not everyone with an opinion on the internet is some high class researcher and it is silly to believe that is true. I\u2019m speaking from experience. The trans friends I know have had huge jumps up in quality of life through their transitions when they have supporting family and peers, and when they havent, unfortunately I have seen them go through terrible mental health issues. I have a trans friend who has a wonderfully supporting mother, and he is doing amazing. The trans friend I know without a supportive family and friends had to go into a partial hospitalization program because she felt so alone and cast out by her own family. When distanced from her family and she found supportive friends, she became so much happier and regained the life she wished to have.

What I found really worked for me in this case was I practiced the skill(singing for me) a lot, and gained confidence about the skill first, at least only for myself. Then, I actually got the most experiences possible. The first time I sang in front of my peers was TERRIFYING! I was shaking, forgot some of the good techniques I had learned, and my face got all red. But! I made it through the scary moment! Then, I performed WHENEVER POSSIBLE! I took all the opportunities I had even though I was scared shitless. Eventually, it became routine, and I started thinking less and less of my anxiety each time, and focused more on the skill each time. I started getting used to it! Now, I can use enjoy what I do, maybe self criticize my performance a little, but that\u2019s something all singers do, lol. So really, it took a while, but my biggest advice is to get the most exposure to whatever situation you\u2019re anxious about as possible! It\u2019s really scary at first, but I have to say it honestly works! I\u2019m pretty sure it is actually one of the more common treatment procedures done by therapists and professionals as well. Even if it takes you a while, don\u2019t give up! Sure I still get anxious about performance and plenty of other situations, but I think by doing this you learn to process it a little better!

I\u2019m pretty sure I began having depressive episodes(not as bad as they got when I was older before diagnoses and medication) in 6th grade. When my episodes first came up, I would nap a lot more than usual, and my homework took a huge hit. Since the sixth grade I have had a depressive episode every year usually getting it\u2019s worse mid to late winter, and went from being about a month when I was younger up  to my longest episode last year at about four months, far more symptoms and intensity as it fully presented itself. Everyone just wrote off me not doing my homework as me trying to be a bad student, and my therapist was so biased against bipolar disorder that she never saw any of the signs and didn\u2019t let me get a diagnosis until I had to go to the crisis center because of it, leading me to work with other professionals who gave me a diagnosis and medication. Luckily, now after taking medication for a full year(the medications can take months to fully take effect) my grades are the best they have ever been, I got onto the Deans List of my college in my first semester with my lowest grade in 7 classes being an A-, and even though it is the dead of winter I have absolutely no signs of another depressive episode at the moment! What upsets me is that if people took my mental health seriously and looked beyond just middle school emotions, I could have gotten a diagnosis years before, but instead I (and my grades) had to suffer for years until it landed me in the crisis center, for Gods sake. It is really important to listen and really look into mental health when things look off. We need to take care of our children, especially at that age. Luckily I ended up okay, but if my medication provider hadn\u2019t had just a sliver of curiosity, I could have been gone by now, and that makes me kind of sad to think of.

I mean this in absolutely no offensive way, to get to your weight you have most likely been eating more than that, so this will drop you to a normal range, which probably would even result in fat loss, without pulling your body into shock, and then you can reduce from there. A lot of it is going to be getting your body back to eating normal amounts, and your hunger will suck at first, but the longer you eat one way, the more your body gets used to it. I would go to your doctor or get a recommendation for a dietitian/nutritionist for more guidelines. It\u2019s gonna be really hard, but I believe in you!!!!! Good luck!!!!!!", "link_id": "t3_ekn5ie", "time": 1578280838}}
