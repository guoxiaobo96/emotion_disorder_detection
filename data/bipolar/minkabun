It\u2019s a chronic brain disorder, the chemistry in a bp brain needs assistance to function and there is no shame in that.

I am satisfied with my life on a fairly consistent basis and yet, I still receive a completely unwarranted amount of intrusive and wholly inaccurate input: \u201cyour life isn\u2019t complete without children,\u201d \u201cyeah but you\u2019ll love then when they\u2019re yours,\u201d \u201coh, you\u2019ll change your mind one day,\u201d \u2026 All the typical bingos you would expect and then some.I apologize for rambling and essentially giving you a memoir of my life story thus far but, try to keep your head up because in the end whether they admit it or not most of the breeders are at least partially dissatisfied with their lives. (i\u2019m super lucky in that my own parents support this 100% and have actually  admitted to both my sister and I that though they love and have provided well for us, children ruin lives)Sending good vibes &amp; encouragement to ignore the haters (breeders \ud83d\ude12) because life sans wombrats can be and IS wonderfully satisfying. ain\u2019t nothing wrong with a little \u2018selfish\u2019 with living YOUR fckn life :) &lt;3 xx", "link_id": "t3_f8qcem", "time": 1582561055}}

{"dhg7rk8": {"text": "I'm really late to this thread but I wanted to mention that a trainer that I've worked with for one of my leash reactive clients (dog walker here) told me that you should start by releasing your dogs leash as soon as they are being approached by one that isn't secured. Sometimes, aggression can occur because one dog is restrained and has no means of escape/self defense. Obviously you don't want the dog to have to defend themselves at all because preventing a fight is the ideal outcome but an off-leash dog meeting one that's on-leash almost always ends poorly. The best advice in this thread is to get behind the aggressor and pull them backwards by their hindquarters. ", "link_id": "t3_6al6jj", "time": 1494556194}}

I always point out the leash laws and the amount of people that seem to give no fucks astounds me (won't lie, I can be pretty snide about it!). I'm also a dog walker and even though I have insurance, I don't do greetings simply because of the liability. Even though most of my dogs are longstanding clients, you truly never know how an animal may react in a situation especially if their owner isn't present. Having unleashed dogs approach one of my clients' dogs can be the most unnerving thing! I had a woman shout \"mine is friendly\" and I chose to say \"mine is unreliable.\" If a random dog in a neighborhood (specifically ones we haven't seen/passed before) is running at my client's dog, trying to quickly explain that I'm just the dog walker isn't always practical or time effective to prevent a possible negative outcome. I gave no indication that the dog was 100% always aggressive, simply a short warning to hopefully light a fire under the owner's ass (unfortunately in this specific instance, it didn't. The woman continue to saunter over lackadaisically and I swear I could've punched her). I also told my client later so they would be aware should they see that dog owner again and so they could clarify anything if that owner approached them about having an \"aggressive dog.\"This wall of text wasn't really relevant to anything, lol, just felt like sharing :)", "link_id": "t3_6al6jj", "time": 1494555969}}

{"dh5oq5y": {"text": "Of course I don't mind you asking! Helping/inspiring other people makes me so happy\u2014a lot of my friends have kicked into gear after observing my progress and being able to \"guide\" them is awesome!First, just like everyone always says, diet is a very large part of my progress. \"You can't outrun your fork.\" I use myfitnesspal for logging. When I first started I was eating at a more aggressive deficit (about -650 daily, ~1300 cal a day) mainly because prior to paying attention, I was eating close to 2500 a day \ud83d\ude31 Now that I'm essentially at maintenance, I go for 1450, a little more on gym days. The absolute game changer is sticking to a deficit. I use a heart rate monitor at the gym (I always log it at 80% of what the HRM calculates as I'd rather under estimate than over). Then I use my Fitbit to keep track of my daily TDEE because you can program a goal to maintain your deficit; MFP logs exercise but then gives you all the calories back for your total which cancels out any deficit you may have. I really don't eat anything super crazy person healthy. I don't forgo carbs, I don't avoid sugar, I even have 2\u20134 beers from time to time and \"cheat days\" once a week if I'm out socially or just craving pizza (damn you, pizza. Can't quit you!). I hate cooking and don't typically have time for it anyway. ALSO! This is huge! Getting a food scale changed my life!I eat the same breakfast every day and a lot of times the same lunch, too. I'm lucky, I'm not the kind of person that gets bored. I just like things to be completely mindless because I like food but I also like eating as soon as I'm hungry and not having to think about what I'm going to make. I try to get in about 15\u201320 grams of protein and some fiber in the morning so I stay full for a few hours. Plus LOTS of water, I probably drink close to 120 ounces a day. My lunch is usually just a collection of small snacks that are portable and easy to eat in the car. I'm a dog walker part time and don't really have the ability to sit down and eat so snacks that I can sneak while driving are key (turkey jerky, almonds, carrots, hard boiled eggs, string cheese... etc). Surprisingly, even though my gym routine is consistent, I don't spend all my time there\u2014I only go 3 days a week for 1 to 1.5 hours (occasionally 4 days if my schedule allows but since I have to do the whole \"adult\" thing, my availability doesn't work that way too often). I absolutely detest cardio so I do a relatively intense weight training regimen and go running with my dog if the stars align (which is only about 2\u20133 times a month lol). I do not stop moving for long stretches when I work out. I keep my heart rate up in between sets by continuing to move. I do what's called \"cardio acceleration\" (you can learn more about it through a simple google search or on bodybuilding.com via Jim Stoppani); things like mountain climbers, bench step ups, and jump squats. My weight training routines are pretty typical and I aim to lift heavy. I just recently changed to slightly less weight and more reps/sets at the advice of a friend that's a trainer\u2014my body was getting too accustomed to the old plan and I hit a mini plateau so I needed to mix it up.

They approach slowly, allow him to sniff them first, and do not pet him until he has expressed that he is okay with the situation. I am fortunate to have a dog that loves children but I cannot explain how frustrating it is to have a kid run up to my dog screeching and immediately getting into his face without a proper introduction.

I will thank you for wanting to be strong for her and not giving up. BPD is a disease. We didn't choose it but we can learn to live with it given the proper help. A supportive SO can help tremendously.I hope you don't mind but as someone with BPD I have some unsolicited advice.Help your SO maintain a consistent sleep/wake cycle. I cannot stress this enough. It is so important to regulate the body's circadian rhythm when dealing with BP to help prevent mania (assuming she is BP I-- BP II is a little different as mania does not fully present itself. That said, maintaining a natural rhythm still has many benefits when dealing with mental health disorders).Do NOT let her convince herself that she is okay and can stop taking meds. BP is not the same as many types of depression that can sometimes overcome the need for a prescription with adequate talk therapy. If she is ultimately diagnosed with BPD, she will need to be on medication for the rest of her life (assuming they don't develop any other solutions before then--I'm still holding out hope for that!). Going off meds when you have BP is a recipe for relapse which often sets you back farther than any other episode possibly could.See a therapist to help you recognize warning signs of mania and how to cope with them. My last BF didn't know what to do when I became violent during a manic episode and ended up putting me in a chokehold until I passed out--when I came to, I was even more angry. (fwiw, we're no longer together).You will never fully be able to understand what she is going through but you can educate yourself as much as possible and practice empathy (sounds like you've already got that part down). Try reading *An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness* by Kay Redfield. I think you can gain a better understanding of what your SO is going through by reading things *by* people with BP as opposed to reading medical stuff *about* people with BP.Your SO is not her illness. Things will happen that she can't explain and you can't spend your time trying to find meaning in them. Instead, spend your time trying to help her face them and learning to identify any triggers that may have led up to them.I send you and her my absolute best. Managing and living with BP is more than possible and having a strong partner is an awesome bonus.Be well xx", "link_id": "t3_58wwiq", "time": 1477245996}}

{"d5gq2qe": {"text": "u/StateOChaos has some really wonderful advice I just wanted to add a few things that worked for me when I brought Busta home. The command \"eyes\" worked wonders for me as a foundation for everything else (you can use any word you prefer). It taught him to focus on me from day one and to understand that he gets rewarded for paying attention to me and what I'm asking him to do. It's best to do 5\u201310 minutes sessions. Start by rewarding every time your pup holds eye contact while you hold a treat between your eyes. Gradually move to not treating every time. Try to get at least 5 solid seconds of eye contact at this point. Then, wear clothes with several different pockets and keep a couple treats in each one. Point to your eyes without a treat and then each time pick a reward from a different pocket (that helps reinforce the command to look because they don't know where the treat will come from but they start to understand they receive the treat if they look at you). Eventually, just verbal praise was enough incentive for him to focus on me. Also, when dogs come to a new environment, it takes them awhile to figure out how to signal to you that they need to go outside (be patient, even if the rescue has told you he is housebroken, accidents will probably happen). I used a bell on the door. Every time we went to the door to go outside, I said \"go potty?\" and rang the bell.  Busta learned that by sitting at the door, I would take him out. It's important to reward outside potties (that wording sounds ridiculous when I read it back \ud83d\ude0b). Do not scold your pup for accidents unless you catch him in the act! If you catch him, stop him and immediately take him outside. Lastly, I used a specific treat (whimzees toothbrushes are my choice because they take a few minutes to consume) when teaching Busta to be comfortable in his crate. Soon he associated being in his crate with a tasty treat so now all I have to say is \"go brush your teeth,\" and he runs to it and lays down without hesitation.

Working with a trainer hands-on helped a ton because, as u/lechat89 said, I needed to build my own confidence in addition to training Busta. I am much more secure now because I know I am doing the correct things and I have stop expecting him to change overnight. The important thing is to remain consistent, be authoritative, and not give up on yourself (or your pup). I use the command \"eyes\" to get Busta to focus on me instead of other dogs and he's getting better at it everyday. I do it at home with no distractions and on walks where there aren't other dogs present to reinforce the command (it sounds like you've starting doing something similar and that's great!)If you want to try the eyes command specifically, it's best to do 5\u201310 minutes sessions. Start by rewarding every time your pup holds eye contact while you hold a treat between your eyes. Gradually move to not treating every time. Try to get at least 5 solid seconds of eye contact at this point. Then, wear clothes with several different pockets and keep a couple treats in each one. Point to your eyes without a treat and then each time pick a reward from a different pocket (that helps reinforce the command to look because they don't know where the treat will come from but they start to understand they receive the treat if they look at you).Ultimately, you should be able to move on to not even pointing to your eyes every time. It really wasn't a tough command to teach and it honestly helps with every other command I do\u2014I start almost every mini session with eyes to get Busta's attention right off the bat.You're not failing your dog, you'd be failing him if you didn't care enough to try to correct the behavior.

Using smell for direction is a great idea but not critical to helping her get around (I do really like the idea though, we never did it but it certainly makes sense and could end up being very helpful).

I would suggest putting bumpers temporarily on sharp corners when she moves in\u2014she WILL bump into things early on but once she knows her surroundings she'll be just fine. I second the advice regarding dog-to-dog interaction. Your new pup will not be able to read body language and so introductions must be in a very controlled environment.I also agree with the advice regarding verbal commands. My dog knew \"step\" and \"curb\" to go up and down. You can also work on \"this way\" and \"easy\" to help lead her or slow her down. I'm always so happy to hear of people adopting special needs pets. Many don't make it out of the shelter as people see it as too much hassle.. Our dog went blind at three and we actually had people ask if we were going to put him down! Absolutely ridiculous!

In the unfortunate event that something were to happen, the other owner will always be to blame, assuming your area has leash laws.If you have a way to socialize your boy in a controlled environment, perhaps you could mediate the problem.

Try to get at least 5 solid seconds of eye contact at this point. Then, wear clothes with several different pockets and keep a couple treats in each one.

This is definitely a case that needs professional handling, not that of a casual dog owner.I am sure that you are a decent human being and probably a good dog owner as well but for a puppy this young to be displaying such behavior, I do not think it would be wise for you to continue moving forward on your own. As someone mentioned above, there are WAY to many pits/pit mixes that unfortunately exhibit these behaviors (mostly because of a terrible upbringing) and adding another to the mix is just a recipe for disaster; for you and other pit owners who already deal with the stigma.I am not at all saying that you are not a capable person, I just think that if you want to prevent euthanasia, you should really look into finding an environment for him where he can be assessed and dealt with on a professional level.I'm sorry for your loss and I hope you come through this situation with new knowledge about finding the right dog for your family.", "link_id": "t3_3vqsbx", "time": 1449501698}}
