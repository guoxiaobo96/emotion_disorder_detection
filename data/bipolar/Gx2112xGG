Ever since i was 16(21now), i\u2019ve had multiple girls/women come onto me due to what i can only assume is my depressed and reserved demeanor. I usually push them away because i know that i\u2019m not mentally \u201cgood\u201d enough for a relationship, but some are very persistent and just keep asking me over and over what i mean. Then when i begin to feel comfortable and secure around them, it then becomes harder for me to hide my emotions. Why bother using all that energy to put up a fake smile if she loves me right? Nope, it gets flipped back on me and i\u2019m told that she needs a man and \u201cdidn\u2019t sign up for this.\u201d Idk why i get so much unwanted attention but it\u2019s definitely kept me inside a lot more over the years and has developed into anxiety. I told you i had issues, i tried to ignore you, i told you i\u2019m not who you think i am right here right now. I guess you thought you could just walk in and \u201cfix me\u201d but you only made things worse. Anytime a relationship fails due to these reasons it only proves the lies in my head right and makes it that much harder to deal with.", "link_id": "t3_gttjis", "time": 1590959474}}
{"frxs5k6": {"text": "   Shit\u2019s rough, but life ain\u2019t over for you. I was in a somewhat similar predicament when i was your age. I\u2019m now a grown man at 21 and still suffer from a lot of my childhood experiences. However, it all comes down to your individual perception. Of course right now in your position you are feeling no sense of hope and a lost cause, but if you can, try to think about your future and bettering yourself. Remember that you are \u201cyou\u201d regardless of how you\u2019re perceived or taken as. Are you happy and content with who you are? Do you think of yourself as a bad person? Do you have a moral code you would like to live by or something of that nature? Sure, you smoked some weed, oh well. Not that big of a deal. My mother\u2019s the same way to this day about me smoking. I\u2019m an adult and she thinks it\u2019s borderline crack. When i was a kid i got it 10x\u2019s worse, that was to prevent me from doing it. My own mother\u2019s called the cops on me numerous amounts of times for typical teenage stuff and i still have the memories to this day.    They\u2019re not good, but i know when i was and wasn\u2019t in the wrong. Law isn\u2019t a basis for morality. The holocaust was legal, people who hid jews were criminalized. In life you have to know when you\u2019re right and when you\u2019re not and always remain true to yourself. You say you had bad grades? I dropped out at 16, not saying it was the greatest idea nor am i advocating it, but i know i made the right decision for myself. In the end, that\u2019s all that matters. When i was struggling mentally and getting bullied and jumped in school and in my neighborhood. I would tell my mom to no avail. I was just being \u201clazy\u201d and \u201crefused\u201d to go to school. They didn\u2019t understand that we lived in section 8 government housing which was predominantly \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cwhites\u201d weren\u2019t liked too much. At the bus stop i was stabbed, beaten and called names on different occasions.    My mom would ask how i got a cut on my face. Since she didn\u2019t listen prior or never seemed to care before i never told her. I made shit up, \u201coh i fell and hit it on the curb.\u201d I too felt extremely depressed and suicidal. To the point i was actually going to follow through with it back in May of 2015. I was 16 and had just dropped out of highschool and was getting shit at home that i felt was unbearable. I wrote a note i still have today, got my gun and loaded it the night before and proceeded to sleep with full intent to \u201coff\u201d myself while my brother was at school and my mother worked the next morning. I never followed through with it obviously and i\u2019m still not sure why. I\u2019m not going to lie to you and say everything is all peaches and cream now and that i\u2019m sooo glad i didn\u2019t do it, but life is very strange.    I still get my moods where i want it all to end, but not to the extent it was in my teenage years. When you\u2019re a teenager you have no voice in the world, it is always a war between you and the \u201cadults\u201d a war that \u201cyou\u201d as a teenager will never win. And that is ok, because believe me it is going to fly by and you\u2019ll be on your own making your own decisions and trying to figure out life for yourself. As you get older you will in turn realize that adults are just kids trying to be adults and that ignorance is very prevalent in fully grown people. As a teenager it seems like a \u201cstatus\u201d adults have, a power over you in a sense and that will be washed away as you get older. I still feel the same level of maturity i did when i was 16, sure, i\u2019m now 21, but since 16 i\u2019ve been honest with myself and everything i\u2019ve done has been for me. I still feel like that reckless ignorant teenager inside, but now i have a voice.    When i say something i am heard, when i do something it is noticed. So when you say your life is over or at least it feels that way, ask yourself what you want from your future. And don\u2019t tell anybody, your ideas or dreams will be ripped apart by those around you. But find something you\u2019ve always liked or enjoyed and try to imagine a place ahead of time you\u2019d like to be and start towards it as soon as you can. If you went out now, you\u2019ll upset people and people that never had hopes for you will never be disproven. If you continue through life and succeed, there is nothing anybody can do or say that will affect you.    When you come from the gutter you can only go up. You\u2019ve lived less than half of your lifespan and you feel like cutting it? For what? You know who you are right? You know you\u2019re not dumb or a loser or a whore right? It\u2019s just what\u2019s been spewed out of other\u2019s mouths and projected onto you. And the way i see it is it only shows their ignorance. The goal here is to better yourself and lead a life YOU wish to lead while proving those with doubts wrong, but it all starts with persevering through the hard times to reap the rewards of the good times. Stay strong and keep that head up! One day you\u2019ll figure it all out and it\u2019ll make more sense.", "link_id": "t3_gr7vyb", "time": 1590546260}}

Don\u2019t get mad at the woman/man for rejecting you. Everybody\u2019s got their own preferences. What i like to do is walk up to the girl i\u2019m eyeing and start a little small talk. Not too long though. Maybe like 3 mins max, then i ask if she\u2019s single. Usually they say no, so i\u2019ll be like \u201cis it jake from statefarm?\u201d Usually it gets a laugh regardless.

It gives her leeway too, she doesn\u2019t feel like she has an obligation to call or text you because you don\u2019t even know her number.

{"fka3scz": {"text": "   Listen here dude, i\u2019m 21, but it feels like i was 13 just yesterday. I was the same way back in high school and i hated it, i had already been in and out of mental hospitals and such and hormones were kicking in like crazy. The girls around school started becoming more attractive, it\u2019s when they usually start adding makeup to their daily routine. Guys don\u2019t get that luxury lol, we gotta wait till our facial hair comes in and fully, can\u2019t be patchy.   I\u2019ll tell you right now that your friends and others are going to bullshit you on how many times they\u2019ve had sex and this and that and depending on how you take it, it\u2019ll affect you differently. I\u2019m pretty sure most are in your same boat and there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of there. As for actually getting a girlfriend, it\u2019s not as hard as you\u2019d think. Main things to focus on are yourself first. You gotta look in that mirror when you get up and know you\u2019re \u201cthe shit\u201d and own it. Now i ain\u2019t saying you gotta be an all around stud cuz i was anything other than that trust me and i had a few boo thangs that was into me.   Confidence is key and it helps to be easy to talk to. You never want to be too blunt or or so nonchalant that \u201cshe\u201d never notices you. Rejection is a part of life and it happens to all of us so if some chick doesn\u2019t like you and instantly shuts you down. Don\u2019t look at it like it\u2019s \u201cyour fault.\u201d That\u2019s her loss, why? Cuz you the shit homie! If you don\u2019t like yourself, nobody will. You gotta get ahold of yourself and step outside your comfort zone or you\u2019ll never get anywhere even in adult life. High school is the best place to learn how women work. First is always appearance on both sides, male and female. Get groomed up, if you got messy hair get it cut, or if the messy hair looks good on you and you genuinely like it, keep it! You gotta be fully comfortable in you and your ability to do and say stuff.    Women smell fear and insecurity a mile away and they\u2019ll put you down for it lol. I\u2019ll tell you that if you\u2019re worried about getting embarrassed in front of school by getting rejected, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure. Once high school is over with, nobody cares! Nobody will remember that dumb thing you said or how so and so said you\u2019re this. Everybody in that school once they turn 18 are gonna be forced into adulthood regardless of their preparation. Everybody\u2019s gonna be focused on other things and tied up in life. Even best friends will unfortunately become strangers. So what have you got to lose asking the girl you\u2019ve got an eye on out? Nothing my man. So go get her bro! You\u2019ll be far ahead of your peers in dating when you\u2019re older because you broke the ice in high school. Hell, you may even be so damn comfortable with it at that time that girls won\u2019t leave you alone!    And if it takes you a little longer, don\u2019t beat yourself up, as long as you\u2019re trying you\u2019re doing better than most grown ass men i know. You don\u2019t wanna be in your 20\u2019s having never at least kissed a girl you thought was cute right? The sooner you start, the less stress it\u2019ll be in the future. And guys look better with age, so the older you get, the better you will look. Girls get the shit end of the stick and they got peak appearance around 18-25. After that, they start declining. So us guys got one thing going for us in the long run! Simple things like \u201cspeaking up,\u201d walking more straight and just being comfortable in YOU gets the women going. It sounds crazy to us guys, because we could give a fuck as long as she got dat ass huh? I know! And the reason girls are so appealing to us is because they know they look good and they flaunt it. So get yourself a \u201clook,\u201d clothes, confidence, and own that entire thing. Girls will be eating you up in no time.    Stay away from the stuck up broads though, they aren\u2019t worth the time and will only give you a headache.  Let them fuck up in life without you and move on. You wanna look out for a girl you think your mom would like, someone who isn\u2019t gonna be rude and is well mannered, but cute enough to be your lil thang when you guys are alone if you catch my drift. Not saying your mom absolutely has to like her. After all it is your life and you are your own man. You\u2019ll know what i mean when you get there though.    I didn\u2019t mean to write a damn novel, but i never had a father and it messed me up as a kid, my mother tried her best, but in the end, i needed my father to help especially when it came to women. What i\u2019ve described here is all through life experience and losing your father at a young age will inevitably cause you to grow up much sooner. You gotta take care of your mom now, help her around the house. And even when she\u2019s wrong, give her respect. You don\u2019t have to kiss ass, but a man never disrespects the women in his life, EVER. Treat her as though you\u2019d treat your future wife. Help her with the dishes from time to time. Maybe vacuum the floor when she\u2019s out. And do all that without ever bringing it up. Trust me, she\u2019ll notice and will feel appreciated and it\u2019s the best way to brighten her day. Always do what you say you\u2019re gonna do or don\u2019t say you\u2019re gonna do it. Always be reliable, but never a slave. And get you a code and live by it. Never do anything that feels off to you, and at the end of the day, be your own man.", "link_id": "t3_fh4d5e", "time": 1583991487}}

Right up there with Dragon Quest in my opinion.3. Mark of Kri, this game i feel paved the way for God of War type games. The fighting was ahead of it\u2019s time and very fun, the gore was there. And another good story.Those right now are all that come to mind, but i would really like to see each and every one get a remaster sometime soon for each console.

I was finally introduced to the two counselors when i was in 4th grade. I can\u2019t remember their names, but i got along with them. It would always seem like they listened and cared. However one day i was in school in 4th grade mind you. A cop comes into the classroom and asks for me out of no where, i follow him and he leads me to a room with my grandmother and my counselors. It was kept a secret for awhile that they were planning this so i wouldn\u2019t \u201crun away.\u201d   I got in there and the first things that were said were something along the lines of \u201cdon\u2019t worry Gabe you\u2019re gonna be fine. We\u2019re not going home tonight, you\u2019re gonna ride with them tonight.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to think so i was kinda happy because i thought i was staying the night with the counselors or something. Well i saw my clothes packed up in the car and didn\u2019t understand fully until i started heading to Little Rock AR i knew that place because i had been there multiple times, but only for mental institutes. At that point i knew what it was. That was the first time i went in long term. Pinnacle Pointe hospital. I felt betrayed by everyone especially my counselors. I was doing fairly well around this time and that only added to the confusion.   For 4 months and 28 days i was sitting at that window just staring out at society and little kids holding hands with their parents going to stores and enjoying life on the outside. It was painful because i was told i wasn\u2019t in there because i was \u201cbad.\u201d But anytime i talked to my grandmother i had to be \u201cgood\u201d to leave. The whole reason i feel i went there is because the counselors wanted me in and my grandmother was naive enough to fall for it. I\u2019m not so sure if that\u2019s how it happened, but ever since then i haven\u2019t cared for a therapist. I\u2019ve been myself, by myself.
