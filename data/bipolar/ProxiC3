Then suddenly things were getting bad, and my husband said that he would leave me if I didn't immediately go to my general physician and get a referral to a psychiatrist.  They referred me, and first I spoke to a mental health nurse.  I spoke to her three times while waiting for me appointment with the psychiatrist.  She stated she thought I had bipolar, and would be mentioning that to the psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist interviewed me and agreed that I had a mood disorder and it appeared to be bipolar.  I went on meds, but then got pregnant, went off all meds and did great.  **Second Time:**  I was off my meds for my pregnancy and postpartum period, and things were great.  Unfortunately, I could feel issues with anxiety and depression coming back, about 16-18 months after my child's birth.  I didn't want meds, or a diagnosis, so I went to see a therapist.  I straight up told them of my past diagnoses, but said I did not want to be labelled or diagnosed or anything.  I worked with them for awhile, but things were getting rough, and they said I should see a psychiatrist for ADHD and Bipolar.  They strongly felt I had both of those conditions.     **Third Time:**  My GP referred me to a psychiatrist that specialized in diagnosing comorbid psychiatric issues.  That psychiatrist (after filling out a bunch of forms and have two interviews with different people) diagnosed me with Bipolar 1 and ADHD.  Referred me out to a different psychiatrist for treatment.  **Fourth Time:**  Ended up in the hospital due to mental health issues.  In walks the specialist psychiatrist - but it had been 3-4 years since I had last seen him for that two-hour diagnostic appointment, so I didn't say anything.  He read over the circumstances of my involuntary admission, asked me a bunch of questions, and said it looked like I had Bipolar 1 and ADHD.  At least he was consistent haha!

{"fqy7w0q": {"text": "There are quite a few differences, more than there are similarities.  Bipolar is a mood ( general emotional state or mood is distorted or inconsistent with your circumstances and interferes with your ability to function) disorder, and borderline personality disorder is a personality disorder ( personality disorder is a way of thinking, feeling and behaving that deviates from the expectations of the culture, causes distress or problems functioning, and lasts over time ).  Some major differences between the two are:* Bipolar disorder generally has longer mood shifts than borderline personality disorder.  The minimum length of time of a Bipolar mood shift is four days (hypomania), but can last for months.  Borderline personality disorder often has mood shifts throughout the day.* Borderline personality disorder often has a shift due to triggers, especially those involved in interpersonal struggles.  So a fight with a friend, or a disagreement with a coworker might \"trigger\" the mood change.  Bipolar disorder doesn't have triggers, or when they do, they are generally physiological, like sleep deprivation or differences in light exposure.  * Both can have interpersonal or relationship issues, but they are caused by different things.  In Bipolar, relationship problems are the result of behavior during depressive or manic states.  In Borderline Personality Disorder, the issues are due to perceived problems.  The person with BPD will often think something is going poorly or that there is a problem whereas the person without BPD will not agree.  * Bipolar disorder often has periods of euthymia or stability.  Borderline personality disorder often has these issues constantly - there is no break for them.* Bipolar disorder, in spite of the varying differences in mood, rarely loses a sense of \"self\".  People with BPD often don't have that sense of who they are, or it seems to change a lot.   &amp;#x200B;The good news for borderline personality disorder is that with the right treatment, they can basically go into remission.  I mean, they may still have a tendency to towards those difficulties, but with dialectical behavioural therapy + time, many people don't meet the critera of BPD.  It also doesn't require medication for life... some people may require medication temporarily to help with frequent mood shifts, depression and anxiety, but it isn't necessarily permanent.", "link_id": "t3_gllg40", "time": 1589744106}}

I have a mental illness that unfortunately requires medication (and I am pretty anti-meds) and I was very swayed by friends and family who said I didn't need the medication.  Almost died.  Not a great situation.  On the other hand, having the support of and connection with friends and family when you struggle with mental health issues, is essential.  And if they are encouraging you to make healthy changes to your life that can also incidentally help your mental health, this is not a bad thing.  Having people in your life that you can vent to when you have had a bad day/week/month is awesome!    So I think your psychiatrist is giving you good advice, but don't take it to an extreme.

I had a joyful childhood, a good family, etc.  I think undiagnosed ADHD, plus hitting puberty, plus being a bit of an oddball all contributed to it, but there was no trauma or anything.2.  What prevented me from seeking help before?  A really bad therapy experience.  Also a fear of being perceived as attention seeking.3.  I don't have any difficulties practicing my coping skills when stable.  When depressed, I feel too tired to do them, and it feels hopeless.  When hypomanic or manic, I just don't want to.  I get in a very \"I don't give a shit\"mood. 4.  I would say 95% of the time I can identify my mood.  I can always identify my activities.  I work full time and I have a child (and pets) so I am very busy most of the time. 5.  Pleasurable activities (I am going with activities outside of pandemic time): coffee with friends, courses, hiking, playdates, walking dogs, long drives, reading.6.  Last time I was in the hospital, it was pretty sudden.  Work was busy, but not impossible.  Home was good.  I had been doing great for months.  Then there was a couple of mornings where I had substantial trouble waking up.  I kept thinking, \"I would rather die than wake up and get started with my day\".  But, at the last minute, I would get my shit together and get going.  By the weekend though, I was really suicidal and depressed.  It was so fast that I called my therapist and got an appt for Wednesday, his soonest opening.  He was worried, but I just had months if solid stability, so not overly concerned.  By Monday, I wasn't depressed or manic.  I was just blank.  Clear.  And very confident I needed to die.  There were moments where I was like, \"Wait, I don't want to die!  What the hell!?!?\" But 95% of the time, I was calmly, confidently prepared to die, either that Friday or Saturday  ... Just was waiting for a couple of work and family obligations to pass.  I didn't want to inconvenience anyone.  When I tried to cancel my psychologist appt, he got concerned.  We argued a bit... Well he calmly kept pointing out why it would be good to give in, and I was all pissy like he was trying to mess with my plans that he wasn't even aware of.  So I kept the appt.  But in the appt, which I perceived as an interrogation even though it was probably normal haha, it came out that I had been engaged in rather dangerous self harm that they considered a suicide attempt.  Police were called, Hospital was the destination.  It was a major mood shift from normal to depressed to mixed, and there was no trigger.  It was crazy.So that is my story.  I would ask yourself the following...1.  What specifically doesn't work in your life?  What is stopping you from being the person and living the life you want to live?2.  What do you ruminate about before bed, in the shower, while driving?3.  Why do you think you have these issues and the \"typical\" person doesn't?

I saw a mental health nurse first who said bipolar, and then was passed to a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist also said bipolar.  I didn't really think too much either way about the diagnosis, just hoped the pills would work.  Then I got pregnant a couple of years after.  Went off my meds and actually did great the whole pregnancy and most of the postpartum period.  Looking back, I was in a long spell of hypomania that probably didn't turn into mania only because everyone around me was super strict about me getting at least five hours of sleep.This is when I started to doubt my diagnosis.  I stayed off meds, didn't return to that psychiatrist, and lived life.  But then things started to get a little rough again, so I decided to re-try therapy.  I specifically told the psychologist that I did NOT want a diagnosis.  I just wanted skills to keep me stable.  I didn't buy into labels anymore.  It started out great, but eventually he  did notice enough behaviors that he said I seemed to have ADHD and mild bipolar.  After some more time went by, he pushed me to go and see a psychiatrist again because he felt my bipolar was severe enough that lifestyle modifications were not enough.  I eventually went to a new psychiatrist that my GP referred me to who was a specialist in diagnostics.  He said BP1 and ADHD.  I went to a different psychiatrist for treatment.I have since struggled with the diagnosis pretty much daily.  When I am doing well, I think it is impossible that I could have something as severe as BP1.  When I am doing poorly, I think it is impossible for it to be BP1 because I have had a couple doctors suggest other things, so how can I trust MY doctors?  They must be just trying to drug me.I guess during my last hospital stay, I asked my psychiatrist if he REALLY thought I had bipolar one, not once, not twice, but over ten times.
