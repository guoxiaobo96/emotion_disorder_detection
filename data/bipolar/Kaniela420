Secondly, pictures, music, and video, are a fraction of the size of downloaded applications. To put it into perspective, roughly 1,000 pictures only takes up about 2GB of memory.

That being said, there are a few measures you can take to give your phone a \"tune up\", and quickly free up a couple GB at least. Start by going into your settings, under the device maintenance section, and tap on storage. Your device will calculate how much cached data you have, and give you the opportunity to \"free up space\". Clearing your cached data will not cause you to lose any personal content, it's essentially like cleaning off the corrosion built up over time from a car battery. Do the same thing under the \"memory\" section. Now go back to your settings launch screen and select \"apps\". One by one, tap each app in the alphabetized list, then tap storage, then clear cache.

{"fsm28u8": {"text": "Some TI's take the Praying Mantis as a bad omen, or an attempt at going down the religious rabbit hole, but when I began discovering them in my home and began to research their symbolism, THIS is the lesson I chose to take from the experience; \"If you know anything about the praying mantis, it will come as no shock that this insect is the paramount\u00a0spiritual symboll\u00a0of stillness and patience. The praying mantis takes its time in all that it does. It takes care to pay diligent attention to its surroundings, and moving through life at its own pace. It demonstrates the ultimate power of stillness. It serves as a reminder for humans to\u00a0slow down in our chaotic, fast-paced lives.The praying mantis animal totem also teaches us\u00a0how to still our bodies\u00a0and go within our own mind. By doing this, we can connect with ourselves, drawing up greater physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual power. This stillness and concentration is a\u00a0form of meditation, a practice that the mantis places much importance in.The praying mantis always comes to us when we are internally craving peace, quiet, and calm in our lives.The praying mantis has a variety of traits: temperance, quietness, awareness, calmness, clairvoyance, patience,\u00a0mindfulness\u00a0and innovation. These insects are well known for their pre-strike pose, which is a popular symbol of balance and patience in and of itself. In fact, the Chinese honor the praying mantis for its elegant, mindful, and contemplative movements. By reminding ourselves to have patience with ourselves in our own movement, we, like the mantis, can grow in our wisdom. They remind us to have patience in acquiring the things we want and to remain balanced throughout the duration of the wait.If a praying mantis strikes too soon, its prey gets away. Because of this, it has evolved to be patient: so patient, in fact, that it will not budge unless it is\u00a0100% positive\u00a0that it is the correct thing to do. This acts as a direct message to us, reminding us to contemplate our movements just as carefully and precisely.When our timing is off, we may generate an unnecessary (and unpleasant) struggle or blow an opportunity entirely. Through stillness, awareness, and balance, we can hear and recognize the perfect moment. We must listen to the voice that speaks to us with openness, not fear. If we\u00a0have patience\u00a0and wait before striking, the right moment will come, and we will succeed.The praying mantis will become your animal totem once you have learned to take your time and live your life at a silent and reflective pace. You should make all choices with a sincere commitment to careful thought and contemplation.By \u00a0being mindful of this, you will enable yourself to know exactly where you are going and when you will get there. Calmness and serenity are crucial to living like the praying mantis.But you should also be capable of being decisive and ready to take action when opportunities present themselves. For example, healers often cite the mantis as their inspiration when channeling their\u00a0healing power.\u00a0All of the instincts and gut feelings you have been experiencing lately are attempting to tell you something about the situation you are currently in. Do not allow your judgement to be clouded, your concentration to be broken, or yourself to be distracted from the end goal.\"https://www.sunsigns.org/praying-mantis-animal-totem-symbolism-meanings/", "link_id": "t3_gujyrl", "time": 1591081621}}

Can't even say the same for my own mother at this point and THAT is a real mind fuck. Never thought I wouldn't be able to trust my mom. We were always very close. Couple of my friends that live a couple thousand miles away, aaannd that's about it. I've gotten to the point though I'm so isolated hell I'll even confide in the honeypots I meet on here, even though I know what they are from the beginning usually, at least it's someone to PRETEND to be interested in what you have to say, isn't infidelity dismissive and judgemental, (even though they're acting.) I'm a very social person, or should I say I WAS a very social person. All this outcasting has really taken a toll on me. I'd say the loneliness factor hurts more/has affected me more than all the rest of it, even moreso than the freakshow they put on outside at night and the distance skeletoning they scared the shit out of me with inside my house. Crazy as that all might sound.I'm not really afraid of them anymore, they're moreso like that annoying swarm of gnats that you find yourself caught in walking along a greenbelt on a warm summer evening, that you just can't get the fuck out of, no matter how much you try to bat them the fuck out of your face. I am quickly learning HOW they accomplish that optical illusions, and how they use is against each other, to create their \"legend has it\"-esque folklore, so I'm not afraid of them being around anymore, except when it comes to them kidnapping my kid. Or losing my livelihood, or my home. But it seems inevitable, no matter how much I try to fight. I could even live with losing my house and my job I guess, much as that would break my heart, as I love my job. But my kid? There'd be no point in going on if they succeed there. So I guess they sure do know how to hit where it hurts. And that's the only credit I'll ever give them. Oftentimes it feels like my son and I are like the little boy from the sixth sense. Desensitized to the macabre and unnerving weird bullshit, but just makes us look weirder. I get so down, forlorn, want to go lay down and sleep for 4 days straight, (which, if they want me to, I will, since Im powerless to stop it); but that sadness turns to a seething hatred so strong that I can literally feel the blood turn red hot in my veins. Most of my tears aren't from sadness, I want to make sure they know that. They're from anger, and from offense, at the -audacity- of these abominations. There's a distinction there and I want them to know it. How DARE THEY try to clip my wings and put me in a cage? I worked long and hard, a lot of years to come out of my shell and recover from the lowest self image I'd imagine one could have, and the merciless taunting and bullying I was subjected to throughout my school years? How DARE THEY terrorize an innocent little boy and steal his childhood away from him, setting him up to endure everything I had to live through growing up and then some? What could that 3 year old little boy have POSSIBLY done to them to cause then their poor little narcissistic injury pity party? So I'll continue to confide in others, cautiously not thanks to them, but I still will do this because God damnit if we don't work together we're outnumbered any way you slice it.

That's exactly how human traffickers \"groom\" their victims.

It has housing for these missionaries for while they're not on assignment. There's also of course their much larger entity, MAF -INTERNATIONAL-.

{"frte9gu": {"text": "The parts that I found most interesting were under the \"appeal and disillusionment\" category under their description on Wikipedia;\"Experts have classified the appeal of QAnon as similar to that of religious cults. According to expert in online conspiracy Renee DiResta, the QAnon pattern is similar to enticement into cults in the pre-Internet era, where as the targeted person was led deeper and deeper into the group's secrets, they become more and more isolated from friends and family outside of the cult.[64] In the Internet age, QAnon virtual communities have little \"real world\" connection with each other, but online, they can number in the tens of thousands.[64] Rachel Bernstein, an expert on cults who specializes in recovery therapy, says that \"What a movement such as QAnon has going for it, and why it will catch on like wildfire, is that it makes people feel connected to something important that other people don't yet know about. ... All cults will provide this feeling of being special.\" There is no self-correction process within the group, since the self-reinforcing true believers are immune to correction, fact-checking, or counter-speech, which is drowned out in the groupthink of the cult.[64] The cultish quality of QAnon has led some to characterize it as a possible emerging religious movement.[17][18][19]QAnon is an example of what historian Richard Hofstadter called in 1954 \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\", in which history and political trends are seen in apocalyptic terms:The paranoid spokesman ... traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds, whole political orders, whole systems of human values. He is always manning the barricades of civilization. He constantly lives at a turning point. Like religious millennialists he expresses the anxiety of those who are living through the last days and he is sometimes disposed to set a date for the apocalypse... Since what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil, what is necessary is not compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Since the enemy is thought of as being totally evil and totally unappeasable, he must be totally eliminated \u2013 if not from the world, at least from the theatre of operations to which the paranoid directs his attention.[16]Travis View, a researcher who studies QAnon, says of it that it is as addictive as a video game, and offers the \"player\" the appealing possibility of being involved in something of world-historical importance. According to View, \"You can sit at your computer and search for information and then post about what you find, and Q basically promises that through this process, you are going to radically change the country, institute this incredible, almost bloodless revolution, and then be part of this historical movement that will be written about for generations.\" View compares this to mundane political involvement in which one's efforts might help to get a state legislator elected. QAnon, says View, competes not in the marketplace of ideas, but in the marketplace of realities.[65]Nonetheless, some QAnon believers have eventually started to realize that they have been isolated from family and loved ones, and suffer loneliness because of it. For some, this is a pathway to slowly beginning the process of divesting themselves of their cultish beliefs, while for others, the isolation reinforces the benefits they get from belonging to the cult. View says that,People in the QAnon community often talk about alienation from family and friends. ... Though they typically talk about how Q frayed their relationships on private Facebook groups. But they think these issues are temporary and primarily the fault of others. They often comfort themselves by imagining that there will be a moment of vindication sometime in the near future which will prove their beliefs right. They imagine that after this happens, not only will their relationships be restored, but people will turn to them as leaders who understand what's going on better than the rest of us.[66]Some Q followers break away when they recognize the content of the theories is not self-consistent, or they see that some of the content is directly aimed at getting donations from a specific audience, such as evangelical or conservative Christians. This then \"breaks the spell\" the conspiracies had over them. Others start watching Q-debunking videos; one former believer says that the videos \"saved\" her.[66]Disillusionment can also come from the failure of the theories' predictions. Q had predicted Republican success in the 2018 US midterm elections, and claimed that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was involved in secret work for Trump, with apparent tensions between them a cover. When Democrats made significant gains and Trump fired Sessions, there was disillusionment among many in the Q community.[67][68] Further disillusionment came when the predicted December 5 mass arrest and imprisonment in Guantanamo Bay detention camp of enemies of Donald Trump did not occur, nor did the dismissal of charges against Trump's former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn. For some these failures began the process of separation from the QAnon cult, while others urged direct action in the form of an insurrection against the government. Such a response to a failed prophecy is not unusual: apocalyptic cults such as Heaven's Gate, the People's Temple, the Manson Family, and Aum Shinrikyo resorted to mass suicide or mass murder when their expectations for revelations or the fulfillment of their prophecies did not come about. Psychologist Robert Lifton calls it \"forcing the end\". This phenomenon is being seen among some QAnon believers.[66] Travis View echoes the concern that disillusioned QAnon believers might take matters into their own hands,[27] as Pizzagate believer Edgar Maddison Welch did in 2016, Matthew Phillip Wright did at Hoover Dam in 2018, and Anthony Comello did in 2019 when he murdered Mafia boss Frank Cali, believing himself to be under the protection of President Trump.Prominent QAnon follower Liz Crokin, who in 2018 asserted that John F. Kennedy Jr. faked his death and is now Q,[69] stated in February 2019 that she was losing patience in Trump to arrest the supposed members of the child sex ring, suggesting that the time was approaching for \"vigilante justice.\"[70] Other QAnon followers have adopted the Kennedy theory, asserting that a Pittsburgh man named Vincent Fusca is Kennedy in disguise and would be Trump's 2020 running mate. Some attended 2019 Independence Day celebrations in Washington expecting Kennedy to appear.[71][72]QAnon theorists have touted drinking bleach (known as MMS, or Miracle Mineral Solution) as a \"miracle cure\".[73][74][75][76]\"So, isolation, disconnect from family and friends, feeling as though they're a part of something important that the world doesn't know about yet. Resorting to vigilante justice, sitting at a computer fact checking and self-reinforcing.... Doesn't a lot of this sound like what our gang stalkers force us into?", "link_id": "t3_gq5wg6", "time": 1590448539}}

I was reminded of this Riddle while thinking about the methodology necessary to take the advantage when dealing with our stalkers. It's not always about WHAT you say necessarily so much as it is HOW you say it. I'll give you an example; I've had a couple trail cams sitting in my purse for a few weeks that my stalkers were unaware that I had purchased. They sat in my purse for so long because I had been struggling, trying to figure out how I was going to install them without my stalkers knowing where I had installed them. I knew no matter what I tried, SOMEONE would be watching me. Then it came to me; the lie and the truth. Disinformation. Just like they do to us all the time. Stop worrying about them knowing that you're installing the cameras, because they will know, no matter what. Instead, make them wonder WHICH CAMERAS are real, and which ones aren't. I made a big show of purchasing this large flower pot, dirt, a stand, flowers to put in the put, and made sure and set it outside during daylight hours so they all could see. I put a trail camera with no batteries in it. I \"installed\" several other dummy cameras around my property, peppered here and there with actual cameras. Let me tell you, it's pretty god damn funny watching them out there at night trying to inspect that dummy camera. Lol.Before you speak, think. Is it true, is it kind, is it necessary? If so, DON'T. Stop and reassess what you're trying to accomplish, and methodically consider HOW you're going to spread disinformation to accomplish your goal without your stalkers knowing the lie from the truth.", "link_id": "t3_gq6em6", "time": 1590391575}}

Blue and green when coming from a drone, purple when coming from someone on land. I actually have a photograph somewhere I'd have to dig up, of one of them holding up this large space age looking ray gun, over a fence pointing towards my house at night. I always assumed the lasers were strictly for the purposes of scrambling the focus on my camera, but I could see the possibilities of them being able to execute what johnsoncounty is purporting. Pertaining to the health issues that so many of us are experiencing, we have to remember too, that our food and water sources could be tampered with, and that being slowly poisoned could create many of the symptoms that we are all describing. I, myself, have begun to notice ridges and white lines all along my fingernails. Last week, I experienced a sudden onset of SEVERE pain in my lower left abdomen, that lasted upwards of 2 hours. The pain was so severe I thought I was going to have to drive myself to the E.R. My appetite has been reduced to nothingness, my hair is falling out, I have noticed in the last couple weeks that I am experiencing numbness in my hands and my feet, and EXTREME lethargy. These are all symptoms of Arsenic Poisoning. I've come to believe that the drilling sounds I heard for so many months outside my house, in my back yard, were my stalkers tapping into my water supply, for the purposes of depositing high concentrations of arsenic. I also notice a VERY wide gap on my front door between the door and the frame. There's even a dent where it looks like someone had mounted a vice grip.

Every night! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02And to your point about assholes turning against you after you've had their back and stand up for them and try to be a true friend to them? Honestly? I think they were probably already playing for Team Gang Focker long before we tried to be decent human beings to them. I'll give you an example. This gal on my team, we'll call her \"Cindy\", anywhats I was on a team w her for a long time but she never really talked and we didn't sit near each other. Always had her head down and looked so sad and never made eye contact w anyone. Then I found out why when she left on maternity leave. Apparently her oldest daughter had accused her husband of molesting her, and instead of making her husband leave, (because I guess her daughter was a trouble maker and had accused Cindy's father of this as well in the past) she stuck by her husband and didn't believe her daughter and therefore lost custody of her children for a time. SO, my heart really went out to her, you could tell she really loved all of her kids and she seemed like a very loving, caring, nurturing mother. What an impossible situation to be in, my heart really hurt for her. So I reached out to her on messenger, told her I didn't know her whole story but I knew enough, that I could tell she really loved her kids and if she ever needed a non judgemental ear I was there to listen, my cousins did foster care for many years so I've seen all sides of it and I know for a fact those teenagers can be little SHIT BAGS to try to get what they want. SO, she did and seemed very appreciative for the things I had said. When she told me she had gotten her own apartment and was going to be able to get her kids back I was so excited and couldn't have been happier for her. In fact the night she moved in she contacted me as I had told her previously if she needed help moving to give me a call as she had no one, no family, nothing who could help. It was 1:00 in the morning and I drug my ass across town to help her unpack because I knew CPS would be looking around her digs when they dropped the kids off. She had a fussy newborn and I could tell she was overwhelmed so I just took charge and unpacked her whole damn apartment for her. Fast fwd 6 months, she's transferred to another state because as she told me \"once your case closes with CPS you grab your babies and you RUN. Everyone knows that.\" Well, when I was thrown into the fucking PSYCH WARD on an involuntary mental hold for the first time in my life, even though I did not meet the state's requirements for an officer to make that assessment, my son was placed in state's custody. I later after actually reading the law discovered that they violated my civil rights on multiple counts and did not give me the right to due process as they did not give me the opportunity to contest them taking my son. They kept me in that hospital for -6- -fucking- -days-, and I am now confident that it was to make sure I COULDN'T fight back. So, Cindy had texted me out of the blue and I had told her about some of the weird shit regarding my case, like the fact that I could not verify any of the \"social workers\" on the state's employee database, didn't think anything of telling her as she has been thru hell with them as well, well, my mother (who is my son's \"foster parent\", thank God, calls me the next day just absolutely FRANTIC, saying the social workers called her because someone had called us in for \"breaking the rules\"!!! And wanted to have a meeting with her and see my son the next morning!I was absolutely floored. I racked my brain forever thinking who could do such a thing!? She was the only person I could come up with. So I googled her name to see what I could find. One of the first results that came up was an acknowledgement for her contributions from the author for this book available on Google. A book about CORRECTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY! This book right here in fact, I think you'll find some of the subject matter absolutely RIVETING; https://books.google.com/books?id=sPWODwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22&amp;lpg=PT22&amp;dq=mindy+huskey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b-EXW3KLQu&amp;sig=ACfU3U1ryJDFbJcguVSq4-yD8GRyAvzj_Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjn--HfxcrpAhXoFjQIHUplDGIQ6AEwEXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mindy%20huskey&amp;f=falseI remembered her telling me she was a C.O. at a prison for a few years, and telling me some wild stories. So basically, I was led to believe after reading this book description, that perhaps she was just a \"researcher\", \"testing\" people's reaction to her situation to see if they were \"good people\" who would be repulsed by her choice to stay with her husband in her situation and ostracize her from society, or a \"potentially future bad person\" who deserved to be punished for showing her any compassion or kindness. I know for certain that my being a guinea pig is not the driving force behind my stalking, but like, WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK!? You're gonna treat me like Public Enemy #1 for showing KINDNESS to you!?

{"fqtufhx": {"text": "ClassificationThe hentai genre can be divided into numerous subgenres, the broadest of which encompasses heterosexual and homosexual acts. Hentai that features mainly heterosexual interactions occur in both male-targeted (ero\u00a0or\u00a0dansei-muke) and female-targeted (\"ladies' comics\") form. Those that feature mainly homosexual interactions are known as\u00a0yaoi\u00a0or\u00a0Boys' Love\u00a0(male\u2013male) and\u00a0yuri\u00a0(female\u2013female). Both\u00a0yaoi\u00a0and to a lesser extent,\u00a0yuri, are generally aimed at members of the opposite sex from the persons depicted. While\u00a0yaoi\u00a0and\u00a0yuri\u00a0are not always explicit, their pornographic history and association remain.[43]\u00a0Yaoi's\u00a0pornographic usage has remained strong in textual form through\u00a0fanfiction.[44]\u00a0The definition of\u00a0yuri\u00a0has begun to be replaced by the broader definitions of \"lesbian-themed animation or comics\".[45]Hentai is perceived as \"dwelling\" on\u00a0sexual fetishes.[46]\u00a0These include dozens of\u00a0fetish\u00a0and\u00a0paraphilia\u00a0related subgenres, which can be further classified with additional terms, such as heterosexual or homosexual types. Many works are focused on depicting the mundane and the impossible across every conceivable act and situation, no matter how fantastical. One subgenre of hentai is\u00a0futanari\u00a0(hermaphroditism), which most often features a female with a penis or penis-like appendage in place of, or in addition to, a\u00a0vulva.[47]\u00a0Futanari characters are primarily depicted as having sex with other women and will almost always be submissive with a male; exceptions include Yonekura Kengo's work, which features female  empowerment and domination over males.[47]HMMMMMMM any of that crazy shit sound familiar to anyone?

{"fqtu3uo": {"text": "Origin of erotic animeBecause there are fewer animation productions, most erotic works are retroactively tagged as\u00a0hentai\u00a0since the coining of the term in English.\u00a0Hentai\u00a0is typically defined as consisting of excessive nudity, and graphic sexual intercourse whether or not it is perverse. The term \"ecchi\" is typically related to\u00a0fanservice, with no sexual intercourse being depicted.Two early works escape being defined as hentai, but contain erotic themes. This is likely due to the obscurity and unfamiliarity of the works, arriving in the United States and fading from public focus a full 20 years before importation and surging interests coined the Americanized term\u00a0hentai. The first is the 1969 film\u00a0One Thousand and One Arabian Nights, which faithfully includes erotic elements of the original story.[24]:27\u00a0In 1970,\u00a0Cleopatra: Queen of Sex, was the first animated film to carry an\u00a0X rating, but it was mislabeled as erotica in the United States.[24]:104The\u00a0Lolita Anime\u00a0series is typically identified as the first erotic\u00a0anime\u00a0and\u00a0original video animation\u00a0(OVA); it was released in 1984 by Wonder Kids. Containing eight episodes, the series focused on underage sex and rape, and included one episode containing\u00a0BDSM\u00a0bondage.[24]:376\u00a0Several sub-series were released in response, including a second\u00a0Lolita Anime\u00a0series released by\u00a0Nikkatsu.[24]:376\u00a0It has not been officially licensed or distributed outside of its original release.The\u00a0Cream Lemon\u00a0franchise of works ran from 1984 to 2005, with a number of them entering the American market in various forms.[25]\u00a0The Brothers Grime\u00a0series released by Excalibur Films contained\u00a0Cream Lemon\u00a0works as early as 1986.[26]\u00a0However, they were not billed as anime and were introduced during the same time that the first underground distribution of erotic works began.[23]The American release of licensed erotic anime was first attempted in 1991 by\u00a0Central Park Media, with\u00a0I Give My All, but it never occurred.[23]\u00a0In December 1992,\u00a0Devil Hunter Yohko\u00a0was the first risque (ecchi) title that was released by\u00a0A.D. Vision.[23]\u00a0While it contains no sexual intercourse, it pushes the limits of the ecchi category with sexual dialogue, nudity and one scene in which the heroine is about to be raped.It was Central Park Media's 1993 release of\u00a0Urotsukidoji\u00a0which brought the first hentai film to American viewers.[23]\u00a0Often cited for creating the hentai and\u00a0tentacle rape\u00a0genres, it contains extreme depictions of violence and monster sex.[27]\u00a0As such, it is acknowledged for being the first to depict\u00a0tentacle sex\u00a0on screen.[12]\u00a0When the film premiered in the United States, it was described as being \"drenched in graphic scenes of perverse sex and ultra-violence\".[28]Following this release, a wealth of pornographic content began to arrive in the United States, with companies such as\u00a0A.D. Vision,\u00a0Central Park Media\u00a0and\u00a0Media Blasters\u00a0releasing licensed titles under various labels.[26]\u00a0A.D. Vision's label SoftCel Pictures released 19 titles in 1995 alone.[ alone.[26]\u00a0Another label,\u00a0Critical Mass, was created in 1996 to release an unedited edition of\u00a0Violence Jack.[26]\u00a0When A.D. Vision's hentai label SoftCel Pictures shut down in 2005, most of its titles were acquired by Critical Mass. Following the bankruptcy of\u00a0Central Park Media\u00a0in 2009, the licenses for all Anime 18\u2013related products and movies were transferred to Critical Mass.[29]Origin of erotic gamesThe term\u00a0eroge\u00a0(erotic game) literally defines any erotic game, but has become synonymous with video games depicting the artistic styles of anime and manga. The origins of\u00a0eroge\u00a0began in the early 1980s, while the computer industry in Japan was struggling to define a computer standard with makers like\u00a0NEC,\u00a0Sharp, and\u00a0Fujitsu\u00a0competing against one another.[30]\u00a0The\u00a0PC98\u00a0series, despite lacking in processing power,\u00a0CD drives\u00a0and limited graphics, came to dominate the market, with the popularity of\u00a0eroge\u00a0games contributing to their success.[30][31]Due to the vague definitions of any erotic game, depending on its classification, citing the first erotic game is a subjective one. If the definition applies to adult themes, the first game was\u00a0Softporn Adventure. Released in America in 1981 Apple\u00a0II, this was a text-based comedic game from\u00a0On-Line Systems. If\u00a0eroge\u00a0is defined as the first graphical depictions or Japanese adult themes, it would be\u00a0Koei's 1982 release of\u00a0Night Life.[31][32]\u00a0Sexual intercourse is depicted through simple graphic outlines. Notably,\u00a0Night Life\u00a0was not intended to be erotic so much as an instructional guide \"to support married life\". A series of \"undressing\" games appeared as early as 1983, such as \"Strip Mahjong\". The first\u00a0anime-styled erotic game was\u00a0Tenshitachi no Gogo, released in 1985 by\u00a0JAST. In 1988,\u00a0ASCII\u00a0released the first erotic\u00a0role-playing game,\u00a0Chaos Angel.[30]\u00a0In 1989,\u00a0AliceSoft\u00a0released the turn-based\u00a0role-playing game\u00a0Rance\u00a0and\u00a0ELF\u00a0released\u00a0Dragon Knight.[30]In the late 1980s,\u00a0eroge\u00a0began to stagnate under high prices and the majority of games containing uninteresting plots and mindless sex.[30]\u00a0ELF's 1992 release of\u00a0Dokyusei\u00a0came as customer frustration with\u00a0eroge\u00a0was mounting and spawned a new genre of games called\u00a0dating sims.[30]\u00a0Dokyusei\u00a0was unique because it had no defined plot and required the player to build a relationship with different girls in order to advance the story.[30]\u00a0Each girl had her own story, but the prospect of consummating a relationship required the girl growing to love the player; there was no easy sex.[30]The term \"visual novel\" is vague, with Japanese and English definitions classifying the genre as a type of interactive fiction game driven by narration and limited player interaction. While the term is often retroactively applied to many games, it was\u00a0Leaf\u00a0that coined the term with their \"Leaf Visual Novel Series\" (LVNS) with the 1996 release of\u00a0Shizuku\u00a0and\u00a0Kizuato.[30]\u00a0The success of these two dark\u00a0eroge\u00a0games would be followed by the third and final installment of the LVNS, the 1997 romantic\u00a0eroge\u00a0To Heart.[30]\u00a0Eroge\u00a0visual novels took a new emotional turn with\u00a0Tactics' 1998 release\u00a0One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e.[30]\u00a0Key's 1999 release of\u00a0Kanon\u00a0proved to be a major success and would go on to have numerous console ports, two manga series and two anime series.Japanese laws have impacted depictions of works since the\u00a0Meiji Restoration, but these predate the common definition of hentai material. Since becoming law in 1907, Article 175 of the\u00a0Criminal Code of Japan\u00a0forbids the publication of obscene materials. Specifically, depictions of male\u2013female sexual intercourse and\u00a0pubic hair\u00a0are considered obscene, but bare genitalia is not. As censorship is required for published works, the most common representations are the blurring dots on pornographic videos and \"bars\" or \"lights\" on still images. In 1986,\u00a0Toshio Maeda\u00a0sought to get past censorship on depictions of sexual intercourse, by creating tentacle sex.[33]\u00a0This led to the large number of works containing sexual intercourse with monsters, demons, robots, and aliens, whose genitals look different from men's. While Western views attribute hentai to any explicit work, it was the products of this censorship which became not only the first titles legally imported to America and Europe, but the first successful ones. While uncut for American release, the United Kingdom's release of\u00a0Urotsukidoji\u00a0removed many scenes of the violence and tentacle rape scenes.[34]  It was also because of this law that the artists began to depict the characters with a minimum of anatomical details and without pubic hair, by law, prior to 1991. Part of the ban was lifted when\u00a0Nagisa Oshima\u00a0prevailed over the obscenity charges at his trial for his film\u00a0In the Realm of the Senses.[35]\u00a0Though not enforced, the lifting of this ban did not apply to anime and manga as they were not deemed artistic exceptions.[21]Alterations of material or censorship and banning of works are common. The US release of\u00a0La Blue Girl\u00a0altered the age of the heroine from 16 to 18, removed sex scenes with a dwarf ninja named Nin-nin, and removed the Japanese blurring dots.[24]\u00a0La Blue Girl\u00a0was outright rejected by UK censors who refused to classify it and prohibited its distribution.[24][36]\u00a0In 2011, the\u00a0Liberal Democratic Party of Japan\u00a0sought a ban on the subgenre\u00a0lolicon.[37][38]most prolific consumers of hentai are men.[39]\u00a0Eroge\u00a0games in particular combine three favored media\u2014cartoons, pornography and gaming\u2014into an experience. The hentai genre engages a wide audience that expands yearly, and desires better quality and storylines, or works which push the creative envelope.[40]\u00a0Nobuhiro Komiya, a manga censorship worker, states that the unusual and extreme depictions in hentai are not about perversion so much as they are an example of the profit-oriented industry.[41]\u00a0Anime depicting normal sexual situations enjoy less market success than those that break social norms, such as sex at schools or bondage.[41]According to clinical psychologist Megha Hazuria Gorem, \"Because toons are a kind of final fantasy, you can make the person look the way you want him or her to look. Every fetish can be fulfilled.\"[42]\u00a0Sexologist Narayan Reddy noted of\u00a0eroge\u00a0games, \"Animators make new games because there is a demand for them, and because they depict things that the gamers do not have the courage to do in real life, or that might just be illegal, these games are an outlet for suppressed desire.\"[42] can be further classified with additional terms, su", "link_id": "t3_gkhjpq", "time": 1589646140}}
{"fqtt5vh": {"text": "EtymologyThe history of the word\u00a0hentai\u00a0has its origins in science and psychology.[2]\u00a0By the middle of the\u00a0Meiji era, the term appeared in publications to describe unusual or abnormal traits, including paranormal abilities and psychological disorders.[2]\u00a0A translation of German sexologist\u00a0Richard von Krafft-Ebing's text\u00a0Psychopathia Sexualis\u00a0originated the concept of\u00a0hentai seiyoku, as a \"perverse or abnormal sexual desire\".[2]\u00a0Though it was popularized outside psychology, as in the case of\u00a0Mori \u014cgai's 1909 novel\u00a0Vita Sexualis.[2]\u00a0Continued interest in\u00a0hentai seiyoku\u00a0resulted in numerous journals and publications on sexual advice which circulated in the public, served to establish the sexual connotation of\u00a0hentai\u00a0as perverse.[2]\u00a0Any perverse or abnormal act could be hentai, such as committing\u00a0shinj\u016b\u00a0(love suicide).[2]\u00a0It was Nakamura Kokyo's journal\u00a0Abnormal Psychology\u00a0which started the popular\u00a0sexology\u00a0boom in Japan which would see the rise of other popular journals like\u00a0Sexuality and Human Nature,\u00a0Sex Research\u00a0and\u00a0Sex.[15]\u00a0Originally, Tanaka Kogai wrote articles for\u00a0Abnormal Psychology, but it would be Tanaka's own journal\u00a0Modern Sexuality\u00a0which would become one of the most popular sources of information about erotic and neurotic expression.[15]\u00a0Modern Sexuality\u00a0was created to promote\u00a0fetishism,\u00a0S&amp;M, and\u00a0necrophilia\u00a0as a facet of modern life.[15]\u00a0The\u00a0ero-guro\u00a0movement and depiction of perverse, abnormal and often erotic undertones were a response to interest in\u00a0hentai seiyoku.[2]Following\u00a0World War II, Japan took a new interest in sexualization and public sexuality.[2]\u00a0Mark McLelland puts forth the observation that the term\u00a0hentai\u00a0found itself shortened to \"H\" and that the English pronunciation was \"etchi\", referring to lewdness and which did not carry the stronger connotation of abnormality or perversion.[2]\u00a0By the 1950s, the \"hentai seiyoku\" publications became their own genre and included fetish and homosexual topics.[2]\u00a0By the 1960s, the homosexual content was dropped in favor of subjects like sadomasochism and stories of lesbianism targeted to male readers.[2]\u00a0The late 1960s brought a sexual revolution which expanded and solidified the normalizing the terms identity in Japan that continues to exist today through publications such as\u00a0Bessatsu Takarajima's\u00a0Hentai-san ga iku\u00a0series.[Depictions of sex and abnormal sex can be traced back through the ages, predating the term \"hentai\".\u00a0Shunga, a Japanese term for erotic art, is thought to have existed in some form since the\u00a0Heian period. From the 16th to the 19th centuries,\u00a0shunga\u00a0works were suppressed by\u00a0sh\u014dguns.[18]\u00a0A well-known example is\u00a0The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife, which depicts a woman being stimulated by 2 octopus. To define erotic\u00a0manga, a definition for manga is needed. While the\u00a0Hokusai Manga\u00a0uses the term \"manga\" in its title, it does not depict the story-telling aspect common to modern manga, as the images are unrelated. Due to the influence of pornographic photographs in the 19th and 20th centuries, the manga artwork was depicted by realistic characters.\u00a0Osamu Tezuka\u00a0helped define the modern look and form of manga, and was later proclaimed as the \"God of Manga\".[19][20]\u00a0His debut work\u00a0New Treasure Island\u00a0was released in 1947 as a comic book through Ikuei Publishing and sold over 400,000 copies,[19]\u00a0though it was the popularity of Tezuka's\u00a0Astro Boy,\u00a0Metropolis, and\u00a0Jungle Emporer manga that would come to define the media. This story-driven manga style is distinctly unique from comic strips like\u00a0Sazae-san, and story-driven works are now dominating\u00a0sh\u014djo\u00a0and\u00a0sh\u014dnen\u00a0magazines.[19]Adult themes in manga have existed since the 1940s, but some of these depictions were more realistic than the cartoon-cute characters popularized by Tezuka.[21]\u00a0Early well-known \"ero-gekiga\" releases were\u00a0Ero Mangatropa\u00a0(1973),\u00a0Erogenica\u00a0(1975), and\u00a0Alice\u00a0(1977).[22]:135\u00a0The distinct shift in the style of Japanese pornographic comics from realistic to cartoon-cute characters is accredited to\u00a0Hideo Azuma, \"The Father of\u00a0Lolicon\".[21]\u00a0In 1979, he penned\u00a0Cybele, which offered the first commentary on unrealistic depictions of sexual acts between Tezuka-style characters. This would start a pornographic manga movement.[21]\u00a0The lolicon boom of the 1980s saw the rise of magazines such as the anthologies\u00a0Lemon People\u00a0and\u00a0Petit Apple Pie.The publication of erotic materials in the United States can be traced back to at least 1990, when\u00a0IANVS Publications\u00a0printed its first\u00a0Anime Shower Special.[23]\u00a0In March 1994,\u00a0Antarctic Press\u00a0released\u00a0Bondage Fairies, an English translation of\u00a0Insect Hunter.[23]", "link_id": "t3_gkhjpq", "time": 1589645613}}

I think a lot of you will find at least a theme or two that has been run on you;Outside of\u00a0Japan,\u00a0hentai\u00a0(\u5909\u614b\u00a0or\u00a0\u3078\u3093\u305f\u3044;\u00a0\ufffclisten\u00a0(help\u00b7info)\u00a0English:\u00a0/\u02c8h\u025bnta\u026a/;\u00a0lit.\u00a0\"pervert\") is\u00a0anime\u00a0and\u00a0manga\u00a0pornography. The word is short for\u00a0hentai seiyoku\u00a0(\u5909\u614b\u6027\u6b32), a perverse\u00a0sexual desire. The original meaning of\u00a0hentai\u00a0in the Japanese language is a transformation or\u00a0metamorphosis. The implication of\u00a0perversion\u00a0or\u00a0paraphilia\u00a0was derived from there. Both meanings can be easily distinguished in context.TerminologyHentai\u00a0is a\u00a0kanji\u00a0compound of\u00a0\u5909\u00a0(hen; \"change\", \"weird\", or \"strange\") and\u00a0\u614b\u00a0(tai; \"appearance\" or \"condition\"). It also means \"perversion\" or \"abnormality\", especially when used as an adjective.[1]:99\u00a0It is the shortened form of the phrase\u00a0hentai seiyoku\u00a0(\u5909\u614b\u6027\u6b32)\u00a0which means \"sexual perversion\".[2]\u00a0The character\u00a0hen\u00a0is catch-all for queerness as a peculiarity\u2014it does not carry an explicit sexual reference. While the term has expanded in use to cover a range of publications including homosexual publications, \u00a0it remains primarily a heterosexual term, as terms indicating homosexuality entered Japan as\u00a0foreign words. Japanese pornographic works\u00a0areoften simply tagged as\u00a018-kin meaning \"prohibited to those not yet 18 years old\", and\u00a0seijin manga\u00a0(\u6210\u4eba\u6f2b\u753b, \"adult manga\"). \u00a0Less official terms also in use include\u00a0ero\u00a0anime\u00a0(\u30a8\u30ed\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1), ero manga\u00a0(\u30a8\u30ed\u6f2b\u753b), and the English initialism AV (for \"adult video\"). Usage of the term\u00a0hentai\u00a0does not define a genre in Japan.Hentai\u00a0is defined differently in English. The\u00a0Oxford Dictionary Online\u00a0defines it as \"a subgenre of the Japanese genres of manga and anime, characterized by overtly sexualized characters and sexually explicit images and plots.\"The origin of the word in English is unknown, but\u00a0AnimeNation's John Oppliger points to the early 1990s, when a\u00a0Dirty Pair\u00a0erotic\u00a0doujinshi\u00a0(self-published work) titled\u00a0H-Bomb\u00a0was released, and when many websites sold access to images culled from Japanese erotic\u00a0visual novels\u00a0and games. The earliest English use of the term traces back to the rec.arts.anime boards; with a 1990 post concerning\u00a0Happosai\u00a0of\u00a0Ranma \u00bd\u00a0and the first discussion of the meaning in 1991.  1995 glossary on the rec.arts.anime boards contained reference to the Japanese usage and the evolving definition of hentai as \"pervert\" or \"perverted sex\". The Anime Movie Guide, published in 1997, defines \"ecchi\"\u00a0(\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1,\u00a0etchi\u2009)\u00a0as the initial sound of hentai (i.e.,\u00a0the name of the letter\u00a0H, as pronounced in Japanese); it included that ecchi was \"milder than hentai\".\u00a0A year later it was defined as a genre in\u00a0Good Vibrations Guide to Sex.[9]\u00a0At the beginning of 2000, \"hentai\" was listed as the 41st most-popular search term of the internet, while \"anime\" ranked 99th. The attribution has been applied retroactively to works such as\u00a0Urotsukid\u014dji,\u00a0La Blue Girl, and\u00a0Cool Devices.\u00a0Urotsukid\u014dji\u00a0had previously been described with terms such as \"Japornimation\", and \"erotic grotesque\",prior to being identified as hentai.", "link_id": "t3_gkhjpq", "time": 1589645240}}

{"fqqvvl5": {"text": "Absolutely. And nearly all Android devices have the capability to allow you to customize certain exceptions such as sms notifications to be excluded from do not disturb. I would also caution everyone that RCS messaging is beginning to be deployed industry-wide, and RCS is INCREDIBLY vulnerable to security breaches. At least as vulnerable as the current SMS system, SS7, which has had a major design flaw since deployment, that flaw being that because it was set up as a way for Telecoms to communicate with each other, ie; T-Mobile asking Verizon to deliver an SMS text, it was designed to trust -ANY- request. For instance; carriers often \"ask\" one another for the whereabouts of a certain device so they can calculate the nearest cell tower to route a call. If a scammer poses as a telecom and asks that same location question, (OR sends a low level packet request for info such as YOUR DEVICE'S IMEI NUMBER!) he'll get the same answer a real carrier would, enabling illicit tracking. As inconvenient as it will be, we need to find different authentication methods.  I must say, even being a tech rep in the wireless industry, I never put much thought into how vulnerable we ALL make ourselves by relying so heavily on our devices before this all started happening to me. Now I'm realizing I left myself open to so many of these attacks in my proprietary data, I could just kick my own ass.

Last week one of them, or it could have been each of them individually, tried to dive bomb me TWICE in one shift. Dirty motherfuckers. I wasn't fond of them before and I'm certainly not any more in love with them now. Then, 2 years before my stalking began, I began to see these ENORMOUS birds, the first time, I was camping with one of my best friends, and we had each taken 3 tabs of LSD. (Not my first time or probably even my 10th or 12th lol) anyway, I remember laying on a blanket on my back on the ground, I look up and there's this perfect canopy of trees, and there is this huge fucking bird, at first I thought it was a peregrine falcon, but it was too big. It had to have been an Osprey.. and this thing, I shit you not, circled in this opening of this tree line, for what felt like over an hour... I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing, I thought to myself first and foremost, \"I gotta keep this acid guy's number! Holy shit!\" And then I thought \"no really, I must be hallucinating....\", which I've never seen things on LSD that weren't there, save the fractals and intricate lacey patterns on the walls. But my girlfriend confirmed that she too, saw the bird. It truly almost looked, the way it was flying and not leaving the sky directly above me, like it was being remote controlled....The next time, during a rather sad and serious moment when I had just found out my husband had cancer (spoiler alert, found out a year later he made it all up) but at the time very serious, we were standing outside my back porch and I live in a residential neighborhood, big tall street lamp in my driveway, when suddenly, a Great Horned Owl comes swooping in, and perches right on top of that street lamp. In the area I live in, that is NOT a common occurrence. And yet he stayed there, perched up in that streetlamp, looking down at us, for a good 15 minutes before he took off. The 3rd time, my husband and I were at an outdoor reggae concert at the botanical gardens, and I'll be damned if ANOTHER HUGE fucking Osprey doesn't show up and begin flying back and forth, intermittently perching on the tops of each one of these enormous stacked outdoor speakers on either side of the stage. I was more transfixed with the bird than the concert! Any time we would go to the river for walks or to go fishing that summer, I would always see Cranes and Heron. Another instance, an owl flew next to my driver's side window at night. In short, it was a weird fuckin summer. At the time, they almost brought me a sense of peace and calm, when my life felt like it was falling apart. (With the exception of the Owl, as I'd always understood them to be messengers of death.) Then that next spring, rolling into the summer before my stalking began, is when the praying mantis's started showing up in my house. Now looking back at it, I can't help but to think they were all just covert surveillance tactics. I have seen videos on YouTube of tiny drones fashioned to look like insects, mostly bees, so it would stand to reason that that is most likely the more probable answer. I'm actually somewhat petrified of large insects/large wings, and, birds. I admire them from a distance, as long as they stay the fuck away from me lol. My stalkers probably knew that, and knew I wouldn't touch them with a 10ft pole, so, free reign for them to snoop around undisturbed.", "link_id": "t3_gjd7z9", "time": 1589447798}}

We took my son to the Mission Aviation Fellowship that sits across the street from the main road by my house, a straight shot about a football field's length away, right next to the municipal airport. We took him there so he could play on the playground equipment that's set up outside the condos that house the missionaries when they're not on assignment. It was very eerie, there were 2 pieces of equipment there, 1 for older kids with taller slides and a tube, one for toddlers. The one for older kids had been SMOTHERED in bark, the tube was stuffed full, the slides had piles of bark stacked 4 ft tall at the foot of each of them. I thought \"how odd... Must be because of the coronavirus shit\" but then it occurred to me, wouldn't they have done the same to both pieces of equipment?

Like they were trying to hurry up and clean it up before I got there.... A little boy came out while we were there and dead ass stared at us very creepily, then put his hand out like he was going to salute, except instead of going to his forehead, he aimed at his throat, then dropped to his knees, but still \"at attention\". He stayed that way with his hand to his throat for 10 minutes.... A couple missionaries I assume came out with 2 other kids, and they were weird as fuck too. I asked what was with the bark, and the man just said \"oh you know kids will be kids\" .... Kids did not do that. And if they did, they were forced to.

{"fq7vuia": {"text": "I have worked in the call center industry for over 15 years. After you've been in that line of work long enough, you get very good at a few things... Starting with being able to read people within a matter of less than a minute, and being able to adapt yourself and your positioning to garner the response you want out of your customer. We'll call it \"gaining their agreement\". What goes hand in hand with that is being able to detect relatively quickly if the person you're speaking to on the other line is a fraud. That applies to other representatives as well, not just customers calling in. In example; transferring a call to technical support, or transferring your call to another department. You can hear it in their dialect, in the uncertainty of certain policies or procedures in their voices, and in the background noise you're able to pick up. A good call center representative is extremely attentive to every little aspect of the call they're on, and when they've been at one position long enough, they even know what the beeps should sound like when they dial out, what the automated phone system's voice should sound like, what kind of hold music they should hear. Since my GangStalking began, I have encountered a BARRAGE of \"phone actors\", starting with the 911 operator that hung up on me the very first night it all began, when there were people outside my house with bright lanterns and drones. I could hear it in the dispatcher's tone, and the lack of the typical murmur of a call center in the background. My call had been intercepted. After that I began receiving calls and texts from strange numbers, as well as my ex. I then found a homemade gps tracking device, complete with sim card slot (no sim card, unfortunately) laying on the side of the road next to my car. After doing some research, I learned that that's how your stalker pings your phone, and activates the gps. Digging further I came to understand that you don't even have to answer the call or respond to the text in some cases. I noticed that some of my exes calls in my call history didn't show as \"missed\" or \"received\" but rather a different code, \"unanswered\". Id never seen this before so I looked into it. Turns out that's how the log will look if the calling party is using a 2nd sim card in their phone. I've also been receiving phone calls from phony customers, as well as transfers from outsourced reps that didn't check out as far as being employed by my company. Even when placing outbound calls to other companies such as Apple co if needed to route my customer to, I can hear the difference in the IVR when I've dialed out and am not ACTUALLY getting Apple. There is absolutely such a thing as Smart Call Routing in a call center, and there are absolutely a MULTITUDE of ways that these \"phone actors\" can intercept our calls and route them to whereve they wish. In fact while investigating one of my suspected stalkers, I couldn't help but notice that one of his first friends on Facebook, (I have a phony account I use via web browser. I refuse to have Facebook or Facebook messenger installed on my phone these days), was a manager at a company called  \"Casting Calls America\".

Here I'll post up what I wrote;So I have been mulling over this idea for a while now, about how we can all best help each other, to get closer to accomplishing our shared goal, which is to expose our stalkers and end our nightmares individually, as well as regaining our credibility, and hopefully, protecting others from being enrolled unwittingly into \"the program\". So here's my thought process thus far. A regular GoFundMe will call too much attention to our friends and family members who already think we're nuts, as well as opening up the floodgates for stalkers to intercept and abuse. In addition to that, being a TI means we're already having our livelihoods fucked with, struggling to make ends meet, and as much as we would all love to be able to help each other catch up on bills and finances, that doesn't help us get any closer to raising awareness and collecting viable evidence, which is what it's going to take to gain any momentum in stopping these assholes. That being said, what I'm proposing is to create some sort of gift card/voucher program, with an allotted amount per recipient, that can be used at very specific merchants, specifically merchants who sell tactical surveillance gear. How many times have we had commentors telling us \"I don't see anything\" or \"it's too blurry to make anything out\" or \"it's too dark to see anything\" or \"you need to invest in a better camera\". Well, that would be just great, we'd all love to have better cameras, but we don't have the funds to make it happen. Instead of donators handing down cash, we have them use that cash to put into gift card pool. We have an application process for the TI to briefly explain their situation, and what sort of surveillance gear they feel might help them best, even if it's just a couple cameras to help them feel a little safer. We then make a determination of how much we can allocate towards their request, (up to a certain pre-specified maximum allotment), and then distribute the gift card electronically to the recipient.Imagine how much faster we would be able to get real, viable evidence. How many more opportunities there would be, if more of us had access to these sort of invaluable tools that we so desperately need. And this way, there wouldn't be any concern of abuse or embezzlement. My company runs this rewards program for sales incentives, in which you accumulate points for sales and then can take those points and go to the rewards points \"store\" to shop for a variety of items within their points allotment.

Limitless access to funds might make for a more challenging obstacle, but it doesn't make it an impossible obstacle. Not by a long shot.I didn't take any college accredited classes or have well off family to pay my way through a fancy school to get where I'm at in the industry I work in. I'm not saying -I have arrived- by any means, but for a girl who didn't even get her high school equivalency until 11 years after her senior year, I've managed to work and supervise at some very well known major US companies without having any product knowledge or experience in the Telecom and technical industries, and have climbed up the ranks and  excelled in those fields, half of which I got hired on without even having a high school diploma at the time. I'm good at bullshitting my way through just about anything I need to. \"Fake it til you make it\" kind of thing I suppose. You ever hear that old phrase \"it's not WHAT you say, it's how you say it?\" It's so very true. I have a knack for being able to read people and tailor my verbiage and the way I present myself depending on who I'm talking to to get the response I want. I guess you could call it a form of manipulation, but I never have used it with malicious intent. (Maybe once or twice in some past relationships lol). I've never prepared for a test or an interview in my entire life, and I've never failed a test or been turned down for a job. I guess my point to all of that was, you don't HAVE to have the keys to the private jet and the platinum expense card to get the advantage on these assholes. You just have to be clever, quick witted, charming, and know how to network. For every measure any person on this PLANET takes for cyber security there are 3 more being developed in it's place to circumvent their attempts. It's been that way since the beginning of good vs evil and it ain't goin anywhere any time soon. So what do we do? Roll over and die? Sit idly by while the demise of mankind as we know it unfolds before our very eyes?

Will we single handedly bring the entirety of gang stalking down as a whole with our efforts? Fuck no.

Think about how it felt, how ALL of us have felt, when we tried to reach out to SOMEONE, ANYONE, for help, and were met with criticism, changed perceptions of us from people we thought knew us better than anyone else on this Earth. Now take a moment to think about how much WORSE that experience will be for the next targets, when there's absolutely NO ONE even trying to keep these assholes preoccupied with even at least minute \"busywork\" on a day to day basis, breaking back down their \"back doors\" to our phones, to our cars, all things IoT...

In the wrong hands, the ramifications could be devastating. Our phones have the ability to send and receive \"low level\" sms messages, without the end user even being aware. A low level sms can be sent to the phone requesting certain information, such as your devices IMEI #, and the phone can send a response with that information, without the end user seeing anything show up in their conversation box. With the IMEI# of the device, hackers/scammers can wreak absolute havock. With the sim card #, now we're talking sim heisting. If a scammer is able to get your sim and mobile#, they're able to Port your number to whatever provider they need, and from there they can use the \"forgot password\" method and use it to receive the password reset pin from Google to gain entry into your Google account. From there as I'm sure you can imagine, it's game over.

And perhaps my son can get better footage than I can as well. Thank you for the suggestion!  What I mean when I say a \"ghost line\" is that the line shows as active in certain areas of my online account, and shows that it has data and 1 other feature, but it won't allow me to check usage, and it almost appears as though the line is a placeholder to link an equipment installment plan to (24 month financing on phones). Except it doesnt have any IMEI number except the LG Rebel 4 attached to it, which is a non T-Mobile phone. T-Mobile offers a complimentary service called Digits, in which you can have multiple phone numbers attached to 1 of your lines (this has existed since before dual/embedded Sims). So it's almost as though this line is being used as a digits line, to be able to mirror my phone.I have had that thought as well, that he's somehow being manipulated to do and say a lot of this stuff. When I ask him \"how do you know about this?\" Or \"where did you hea this?\" He gets his flashlight and shines it in my face (highlight of my evening, let me tell you), and he says \"just close your eyes. Close your eyes, and shut your mouth.\" Then when I comply, he'll mumble and tell me he heard his dad and suchandsuch talking about it. What's weird is he'll give me timeframes as well. For example, after he told me a very disturbing story about some events that happened to him, I said \"when, baby? When could anything like that have ever happened to you? You're always with me or your grandma.\" (I work 3 12 hr days a week and have 4 days off in a row every week) and then he said; \"think. Think mama. Member when I lost Thomas?\" And indeed, last fall, we took him to the library and he forgot his Thomas the train. Nobody in this county could ever forget. It was the most catastrophic event of the season. My son is OBSESSED with Thomas the train. We didn't hear the end of it for 2 days, when I was finally able to get back to the library to get the beloved dye cast g@# d@*$# Thomas on my way home from work. Id gotten off early that day. He told me \"that's when.\" My husband was watching him that day. His somewhat estranged brother was also visiting from out of town that day. I remember when I got home, my son was in his room and looked like he'd been crying. My husband came in from outside and told me he was in trouble for getting into the dirt in one of our house plants. And I remember for the rest of that evening, my son seemed very sad, distant, afraid of his dad. He acted like he was having a very hard time chewing and/or swallowing. At the time I thought he must have some new teeth coming through, but now after what my son told me, I'm not so sure. Then my son said \"you saved me! You saved me mama!\" As if I somehow had come home early unexpectedly and stopped something worse from happening? I don't know....I know you can't read too much into things a 3 year old says, and they have very wild little imaginations, but, it's the way my son tells me these things. I don't know what other way to describe it but to say that it's different. He's very cautious and tries to cover his mouth, or mix in what he's saying with random babble or use his toys to \"act things out.\" Like I said, it's all very, very strange, and leaves more questions than answers.", "link_id": "t3_fuvjr3", "time": 1586412450}}

You can barely see that he's breathing... Its terrifying. The first couple times it happened I thought for certain they were killing him. Then the click again, the furnace cycle will lick on again, he'll take a deep breath and then his breathing will regulate again. And he feels sweaty, like his poor little body has been through a terrible strain. He tells me \"I got a booger. But I broke my booger.\" And always points to the same spot in his nose. The other night he told me \"you got a booger too.\" And he put his finger right inside the corner of my right nostril, where I noticed about a year ago I have this rough patch of skin/membrane I guess you could call it that constantly FEELS like I have a boog but I don't.

{"fm2rxwj": {"text": "\"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\" Matthew 10:16When this all started happening to me, that message kept coming to me, over and over. Months prior I kept finding praying mantis' in my home, and I couldn't figure out why or what it meant. One of my oldest friend's from high school has a father who is an apostolic preacher. They always treated me like a daughter when we were kids, and when I went through some other life altering trauma in the year prior to the beginning of my GS, twice, he had woken up in a cold sweat from a deep sleep, after having visions of something terrible happening to me, and felt compelled to reach out to me. Both times, he was spot on. I was very headstrong when this all began, and I kept telling him I was going to stop these monsters. He urged me, multiple times, to not take matters into my own hands, to give it to God. Pray to God first and that God would show me his plan for me, my place in all of this. So, I prayed that night. For the first time in a very, very long time. I read up on the symbolism of praying mantis, I found some very relatable explanations; \"The praying mantis takes its time in all that it does. It takes care to pay diligent attention to its surroundings, and moving through life at its own pace. It demonstrates the ultimate power of stillness. It serves as a reminder for humans to\u00a0slow downin our chaotic, fast-paced lives. Wisdom emerges when we are still and quiet, sensing and feeling rather than thinking critically. It comes with experience, age, and being, rather than traditional schooling. It cannot be obtained through arrogance. The praying mantis meaning has a variety of traits: temperance, quietness, awareness, calmness, clairvoyance, patience,\u00a0mindfulness, and innovation. These insects are well known for their pre-strike pose, which is a popular symbol of balance and patience in and of itself. In fact, the Chinese honor the praying mantis for its elegant, mindful, and contemplative movements. By reminding ourselves to have patience with ourselves in our own movement, we, like the mantis, can grow in our wisdom. They remind us to have patience in acquiring the things we want and to remain balanced throughout the duration of the wait. When our timing is off, we may generate an unnecessary (and unpleasant) struggle or blow an opportunity entirely. Through stillness, awareness, and balance, we can hear and recognize the perfect moment. We must listen to the voice that speaks to us with openness, not fear. If we\u00a0have patience\u00a0and wait before striking, the right moment will come, and we will succeed.\" After I read that, I walked out of my bedroom into the living room, and there, on the floor where my new dog had torn up my walls, 2 pieces of the interior of my door trim were laid out under a soft blanket of light casting from my lamp, perfectly shape positioned in the shape of a cross. \"Wise as a serpent, gentle as a dove.\" Just keep focus of your goals in your personal life fellow TI's. Collect what evidence you can when the opportunity presents itself, but be methodical. I've learned my lesson recently, and will keep what evidence I have to myself, and wait for the moment I can capture something that is beyond a shadow of a doubt, with no room for trolls or doubters to poke holes.

{"fkyxsiy": {"text": "You're absolutely right about that. I think \"community policing\" may very well be the cause behind ALL of my stalking. A week after the drugs were planted in my car, (I, by the way, have zero drug related charges on my record, nor do I have ANY charges on my record. Nothing that would have flagged me for them to want to search my vehicle) I took the back roads home from work. It was about 8pm, and for the 3rd time in the last 3 months, my cruise control engaged on its own. I was trying to be cautious, as, you know, I didn't want to DIE in a fiery crash, so I was driving slow. Hardly any other vehicles on the road that time of night, and none behind me. When I got home and parked my car in front of my house, I sat in my car for 3 or 4 minutes, gathering all of my things. When I started to open my car door, I noticed a big lifted up truck had parked behind me. Unmarked, no indication of it being a police vehicle... First thing he does is shine his maglite right in my rear view mirror, blinding me. He hops out of the truck and lo and behold who should it be but Officer Mcfuckface himself, from my first encounter. He told me someone had phoned in an \"anonymous tip\" that someone was driving too slow on the road on suspicion of drunk driving. He continued to shine his maglite right into my eyes, repeatedly, throughout the whole ordeal. Then he made me perform a field sobriety test, in my own front yard...I had just gotten off of work. There was no alcohol smell coming from the car and I was clearly coherent and explained myself reasonably. For that matter, he would have had to know where I lived, as my neighborhood takes 3 turns to get into, and he didn't pull up until several minutes after I had already arrived home. Then he played stupid, \"hey waaaaiit a minute, didn't I just pull you over last week over-\". Ok first of all my white Impala has a huge chunk missing from the back bumper that leaves a huge gaping black hole (from a previous run in with a stalker at the DMV) so my car stands out, and secondly, I have long flaming red hair, and our town isn't a major city, it's still relatively rural, so I'm certain he knew damn good and well who I was.He follows me into grocery store parking lots and will get behind my car and scope it out so I'll notice when I come out of the store, or he'll wait for me to exit my vehicle to go inside before he exits his. 4 encounters in 1 month.In addition to all of that, I recently installed a police scanner to try to circumvent some of this bullshit, and as I hear the dispatcher and an officer talking about a \"female subject\" and what cross streets she was on, I realized I \"fit the description\" of said \"female subject\". After about 5 minutes of listening in, officer asks dispatch a question and she's real tight lipped all of a sudden. He asks the question again and the dispatcher says \"female subject is still listening on an alternate line.\" I was like whaaaattt the fuuuccck?? My jaw about hit the floor. What I don't understand is why they've decided to target ME in all of this. I am the victim of domestic violence and went to them for HELP. My son had also been making inappropriate gestures and telling me things that indicated he may have been sexually abused. So, I go to the authorities to ask them for help and what happens?? I begin to get gang stalked. I'm terrified, wondering WHY this is all happening to me and who might want to harm me, they -I- get taken away in HANDCUFFS, in front of my 3 year old son nonetheless, for a \"72 hour mental health hold\" that turned into -6- -fucking- -days-. Mind you I have no history of mental illness or criminal record of any kind, and yet my son gets placed into State's custody, I go away in handcuffs, and the gang stalking continues. Riddle me that?The town not 10 minutes away from me has a \"fusion center\" I recently learned and I think that's their front shop for their little domestic terrorism/civil rights violating funhouse they've got going on.

Different.Hardly anybody would speak to me, I'd wait around outside for our post shift smoke and nobody would come out, but as soon as I'd start to leave, miraculously I'd see some of them come out the doors.

He knew I was getting off at the back door, but when it came time he acted like he didn't remember... So he slowed down briefly and I thought he was going to stop so I went to get off, and he slammed on the gas and accelerated. I went flying off the back of that golf cart and caught most of the impact of the pavement with the back of my skull. \"Conveniently\" the facilities manager that I never see happened to be standing RIGHT THERE when it happened, and they both feined sympathy for me, but it was pretty obvious it was fake.

I have the ability to learn and retain new information relatively quickly, (as long as it -INTERESTS- me), which I now know from my research is a common trait for those of us with bipolar. So I can speed read and filter through the relevant vs irrelevant information and base my findings off of the important highlights and save a TON of time. If there's a more efficient way to do things I will find it lol. But going back to the children seeing reading as a chore, I agree with you it is very unfortunate. I learned how to read when I was 3 years old. I was OBSESSED with learning to read and spell. I was reading The Call Of The Wild unabridged at 5. Joined the summer reading program at the library every year and absolutely LOVED it. It really seems society as a whole has just forgotten the importance of literacy/language arts. It can take you so much farther and be taken more seriously by your peers/coworkers. Society is getting progressively DUMBER. Mike Judd's Idiocracy is becoming more a reality and less a preminition. My son is 3, but has been able to say and identify every letter of the alphabet, upper AND lower case, as well as numbers 1-13 since his 2nd birthday. and I think that's largely in part because I DON'T let him play on my phone. AT ALL. He's a kid. He can go do kid shit. Eat dirt. Anything other than having his face in electronics. And also it's because he WANTS to learn to read, just like I did. His favorite show for over a year was Super Why on PBS. And he would legitimately get pissed if I tried to put on a different cartoon lol. And I also read to him every night. Usually 2 books. Parents I cannot stress ENOUGH to you the importance of reading to your kids every night is. They might not seem into it at first or seem like theyre not paying attention but they are. And in no time at all they will get VERY into it and it's so much fun. My son takes the books from me now and \"reads\" them to me in his own way , describing what's happening on each page, and sometimes he's pretty damn close to the actual plot!

If I felt on top of the world, I needed to drink to celebrate, and would proceed to make a whole ass of myself, put myself in dangerous situations, spend money I didn't have, and hell, when you're drunk everything seems like a great idea, so why not throw hard drugs into my daily cocktail? I lost my job that I'd held there for the first 2 years, and took a job in a dungeon of a kitchen at the bar I was at basically every night. It got to the point I would clock out, take the $100 I'd made that day, start drinking, spend the rest on drugs, be too fucked up to drive home (although drinking and driving was NOT beyond me) and end up being put to bed in one of the offices above the bar. I was basically living there it seemed at times! I remember one day I was sitting at the desk in the kitchen, getting ready to open, and I thought to myself \"how in the hell did I get here?? How have I made SUCH a complete shitshow of my life? I used to be responsible, I used to be creative, I used to love life and have supportive friends and family, I used to be NORMAL! Now I feel like I'm just an empty shell of the person I used to be, and I'll never be able to get back to ME. That girl is long gone. A distant faint memory.\" It truly made my heart hurt to consider that notion. That I would never be the person I used to be, feel happiness the way I used to feel.Fortunately for me my mother caught wind of my drug use, and bought me a ticket to my home state to get some dental work done. She lied to me and told me the ticket was round trip, but it was only one way, and she had NO intentions of changing that. Thank God she didn't. She probably saved my life. I was again diagnosed with bipolar,  tried going to therapy, hated it, still wasn't quite ready to admit that I had anything than your average run of the mill depression. After all, I was UP way, way more than I was down, so what did I have to complain about? I was able to secure a pretty decent job though, and I threw myself into my job. I also was back around my stable friends, so that helped me level out for a couple years, but I still was a basket case internally, still going out drinking by myself every night. Finally, when drinking just wasn't FUN anymore and the blackouts and fights became more frequent than the good times, I again went to my Dr, and this time accepted the diagnosis. I was taken off the Wellbutrin I had been prescribed immediately, as Wellbutrin can send someone with bipolar's anxiety through the fucking roof. She put me on Lamotragine, and I swear to God that medication has changed my life. Not even 2 weeks after I began taking it, I noticed the change within myself. Things didn't piss me off instantly anymore. I had more patience with everyone, most importantly my young son. I didn't feel so OVERWHELMED and flustered and frazzled all the time. My problems were still there of course, but I felt like I could handle them one at a time, more organized, less chaos. I started going to AA, which I only felt I needed for about 2 months. With me being on the right medication, I didn't feel the urge to drink any more. I didn't need to self medicate, because I finally found something that WORKED for me. I remember being in my bedroom, performing some mundane task like laundry, on a beautiful sunny day, right at the 2 week mark of being on the lamotragine, and suddenly I felt this big smile spread across my face, and I thought to myself \"well I'll be damned. There she is!\" I don't know what other way to put it than to say it felt like my soul had been floating around above me, and suddenly got knocked back in to my body. I FOUND the old me. Finally. After all those years of mourning her death. You will find the right meds that work for you, have faith. If -I- can get my shit together and rediscover the old me, you can too. Don't lose hope, every morning you wake up and your heart's still beating, that's called purpose. You're still here for a reason, and it's NEVER too late to start all over. I have had to hit the reset button on my life quite a few times in my 35 years on this Earth, and I'm sure I probably will a few more times because I am a dumbass and stubborn and have to learn the hard way a few times to be sure lol. Sorry for the long comment, I just know that if you were feeling anything like the lowest of the lows that I was feeling when I had that thought, you needed to hear a decent message of hope.God bless, and keep fighting", "link_id": "t3_fdv1dv", "time": 1583417415}}

B) their mission in destroying your credibility and making you appear insane was achieved, and they wouldn't have to worry about fucking with you anymore until you got out. And C) no electronics. Without a smartphone, you wouldn't be able to research anything that could get you closer to discovering the truth. And without electronics, they had no way to track your every step and pull their directed message bullshit.The reason the stalking slowed when you moved, was because you relocated to an area that they had yet to lay their framework for harassing you. It takes time to set up cameras, get neighbor's, purchase/rent the houses/apartments next to you, tell everyone in the area all the lies they tell to get those citizens to partake in this shit. That's why it took a while for it to crescendo. They needed time to set up shop at a new location. And let me tell all you assholes that keep telling us we need help and medication a little something. I -HAVE- bipolar mood disorder. I -TAKE- a mood stabilizer to treat my disorder. I -GO- to therapy every week. And guess fuckin what? I STILL say that the shit is real and that the things that have happened to me, HAVE HAPPENED.

For some reason when I private message people on here I never get a response. So, at the stake of my stalking flaring up and getting worse, I'll just throw myself on the coals and come out and say it here.Within our little group here, we have an individual with a degree in computer science, who can help us decipher the raw data on sites that we visit, the processes running in the background on our smartphones, and a plethora of other software codes that could be extremely valuable to helping us filter through what is actually happening on our devices and get some real hard evidence. We have a psychiatrist from Romania who is willing to draw up a statement with his accreditations explaining how he has come to know that gang stalking is a very real thing, and his medical expertise explaining the difference between the mind of a schizophrenic, and the mind of a true targeted individual. We have myself, who troubleshoots smartphones and all IoT's on a daily basis. I might not have a degree and I might not know -everything- about the inner workings of the software/hardware on electronics, but I know how a cell phone communicates with a cell tower. I know how to pinpoint what tower a cell phone is connected to. I know how to find out what band frequencies the towers around me are outputting. I know how to find on a map where every Bluetooth device in a 200ft radius is located. I know what system apps should and should not be on a device. I have also been able to discover some of the apps that gang stalkers are using to run their surveillance on us and communicate with each other. I know how stalkers hack our cars, and what all they can do with that control. I know how to use TAILS to become \"the ghost in the machine\" and be completely untraceable. I'm also probably not the worst looking TI. I say that not to be vain, but because when I have regained full custody of my son, I fully intend on creating a YouTube channel and sticking my neck out there to show real evidence and speak out against what has happened to me, as well as all of us TI's. I also have been able to convince a few of my friends and family that something sheisty IS in fact going on, and I have their support. It's very hard for gang stalkers to fulfill their agenda if we have even 2 people in our lives that won't turn their backs on us. I have an associate who is very familiar with how to use the darknet and has access to a market that I can peruse. We HAVE everything we need, right here within EACH OTHER. through talking to a few different people on this sub, I have been able to geomap a nice little group of people to make a strong case for the Northwest. Specifically Oregon, Idaho, and Colorado. If any of you have any other areas of expertise that could be beneficial, PLEASE make yourselves known. Even if you don't think it's valuable, let me be the judge of that. I am extremely resourceful and am pretty damn good at coming up with outside of the box solutions on the fly. It's part of what I do for a living. I have a few other ideas as well, but I don't want to share them out in public. I'm happy to share them privately with those of you who are interested. I am trying to get a private sub going, it's called TtOS, Targets for the Total Obliteration of Stalkers. I've started it but am still learning how to invite people, etc. If you want in, message me and let me know. Together we CAN fight this shit. We don't NEED expensive technology, we don't NEED cops on our side. We don't NEED expensive lawyers.

I was 25 and hadn't been officially diagnosed yet, and had just gone through a bad break up with my boyfriend of 5 years, and I spent the first month or 2 crying myself to sleep every night in an airstream trailer on my cousin's property. But after those couple months, I careened into an EXTREME manic episode that lasted nearly a full year.  Started going to the bar by myself to try to make new friends, put myself in some very dangerous situations and got mixed in with the wrong kinds of people, drinking every night, doing drugs, the whole self destructo shebang. So yeah, moves and breakups are 2 major triggers for bipolar. Definitely get in touch with your Dr, download a mood tracker and monitor your symptoms closely.

{"fizma0t": {"text": "I love what you've said here. I think a lot of times being bipolar, we tend to gravitate to people who are just not good for us. Partly because we are empaths and narcissists are very attracted like a moth to a flame to empaths, and partly because we WANT that \"bad boy\", someone to fuel our reckless, throw our cares to the wind, get into lots of trouble and have fun while doing it attitudes we have while manic. If you can find someone who is willing to accept you and love you for ALL that you are, put up with your quick temper and irritability and lashing out, without wanting to immediately jump into arguing and instead pauses and considers that this could be because of your mental illness and finds a way to bite their tongue, and still be there to clean the house and bring you your pills and some juice when you're laying in bed for a week straight while going through a depressive episode, hold tight to that person. Nobody is ever going to love you more than that. My husband and I have been together for 6 years, and although he definitely has his own demons as a recovering addict and we have been to hell and back, (twice) lol, he has adapted to my illness and values me to the ends of the Earth. He knows that I am so much more than my mentally illness, and that my bipolar is a part of what makes me who I am. We have a beautiful 3 year old son who is the smartest, sweetest, most respectful little boy, and that just goes to show you that you can have a well rounded/adjusted kid even if you have your own problems as an adult. My son is most of why I have stayed on my medication consistently, to be better for him and be the mother he deserves.

What they negate to factor into their equation, is that there are plenty of monumental scandals that are uncovered nearly every day. Nobody ever stops to consider, instead of all of the reasons why we could be wrong, what about the possibility of us being RIGHT? And if we ARE right, how easily could it happen to any one of them? Edward Snowden isn't hiding out because he told some \"tall tales.\" The shit is very real, and with the advancements in technology somehow making LIGHT YEARS of progress in such a short amount of time, in spite of how much it seems that society is getting progressively DUMBER, these \"instances\" are going to become more and more prevalent.

People don't understand that, WE, TOO, as targeted individuals are trying to rationalize what's happening to us. All day. All the time.

{"ffdnbms": {"text": "Alcohol ruled my life from the time I was 17 until 33, a little over 2 years ago. It was the direct or indirect cause of every truly awful thing that has ever happened to me in my life. Alcohol and I started off on a pretty damn good foot. I was very shy and socially awkward, in fact had been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, so when one of my girlfriends drug me along to this house party, I was very uncomfortable, worried about how I was coming off, and just wanted to melt into the wall. Until I discovered good ol' alcohol that night. I noticed suddenly I was actually starting to crack jokes, and people were noticing, and listening to me, and laughing at my anecdotes! And I had a - GREAT- - TIME-! And I liked the effects, and even the taste, a LOT! From there on out, if I was ever gonna go out, if I ever had to meet new people, if I was gonna get the courage to get on the dance floor and shake my ass, sing karaoke to Hotel California, tell someone how I REALLY felt, I needed to be drunk. Through my early 20's I did a lot of partying, which is of course to be expected. But as my friends kind of started to \"age out\" of it, I kept going. Due to a pretty devastating break up in my longest term relationship, (5 years), I moved to another state, made new friends, party girls. Got myself into a lot of trouble and became a reflection of the company I was keeping. I could find an excuse to drink every day. \"woo-hoo! It's my birthday month bitches! Let's celebrate!\" \"I'm having such a great time, let's keep drinking til we get so drunk we'll take shit back we ain't even stole yet!\" \"you know summers up here really only last a few months, we should really have as much fun as we can! Let's get drunk!\" Then of course I would have to hear from others about the absolute spectacle I'd made of myself after I blacked out. Or I'd put myself in these dangerous situations, going to a bar by myself without pre-planning how I would get home, going to strange dudes houses after the bar closed to continue partying, being so drunk everything sounded like a good idea, including taking hard drugs I'd never tried before, and drinking and driving. So then of course it would turn to shame, humiliation, spending all my money at the bar and being too broke to pay my bills as a result. Not remembering how I got home. Not coping with the loss of my relationship or my past traumas in the healthiest of ways in the least. So then it would turn into \"this day absolutely SUCKED. I just wanna get drunk and try to forget about it.\" \"I'm so depressed. I feel hopeless. I need a drink!\" \"everyone hates me, there's NO WAY my life could get any worse. I'm gonna go get a bottle, fuck it.\" like I said, an excuse for every day. I couldn't IMAGINE having a life, being myself, getting through shit, without alcohol in my life. The thought of the very question made me panicky. Made me need a drink. Now I don't mean I couldn't go a DAY without drinking. I could go a couple, sometimes a week or more, no problem. But if that opportunity presented itself, I would NEVER turn it down. My problem wasn't that I would get the shakes or any of that, it has always been that once I have that first drink, the rest go down so smooth, and I have no gauge. So I'll gogogogogo, and before you know it, I'm blacked out drunk getting in a friend of a friends face I've never met before, going \"mole-y mole-y mole-y mole-y mole-yyyyyy!\" (in my defense, she HAD a mole. And she was kind of a bitch. From what I remember.) I just did. Not. Know. When to quit. Fast forward to my 30th birthday. I had started dating this guy I met, (at a bar) that I was just absolutely head over heels for. We'd been together a couple months, He was a cab driver so he wasn't drinking, and just in general was not a big drinker. He WAS however a recovering heroin addict, AND he had cocaine in his car. I'd already been drinking, so sounded like a good time to me! Anyway on the night of my 30th birthday he had to work and couldn't come out with me. Last words to me were \"don't drink and drive!\" well. I did NOT take 30 well, and feeling sorry for myself, I went out drinking. Well. Guess what? Finally, after all those times of getting away with it, I got hit with a big fat DUI. Blew a. 21, so it was an EXCESSIVE DUI. Go big or go home, amiright? I didn't even feel that drunk! So, my boyfriend was surprisingly pretty understanding and helped me out a lot, even paid for half of the cost for me to get a decent lawyer. During my pretrial probation, I wasn't allowed to drink. I didn't know how I was gonna be able to do it. I was climbing the walls after a week! I believe the notion that I was not ALLOWED to drink made it that much more intolerable. I never tried to drink and cheat the system while I was on probation, my philosophy has always been, \"just take your lickins, put your head down, pay your debt to society and push through it and be over and done with it!\" so that's what I did. I found that  after about month 3, I didn't really miss alcohol. I'd lost weight, went camping and hiking all the time, my relationship with my boyfriend and I had deepened significantly, all of the lot. The day I was told my 2 years of probation would be UN-supervised? My boyfriend took us out to dinner to celebrate after court, it was around noon, and the first think I did was sit myself up at the bar and order a nice fat double crown and coke. I never should have done that. It just started the downward spiral all over again. My boyfriend and I become engaged, shortly thereafter I get pregnant. I never had a problem with not drinking while I was pregnant with my son, I was taking care of another little life, the thought never occurred to me. But as soon as I was done breastfeeding, I was ready for a drink. My now husband, who was never a drinker, began to drink. He and I started to enable each other, and we would go through over a 5th of whiskey a night. As time went on, we started not getting along so well when we drank together. Then things escalated. We would both get so drunk we'd black out, then we'd beat the hell out of each other. And wake up not even remembering why or how the fight started. It took us until our son's first birthday to realize this is not the life or the example we want to be setting for our son. I decided right then and there, that I am not the mother my son deserves when I am under the influence of alcohol. We went to AA for a few months, and both my husband and I were able to quit drinking. Colors began to seem brighter, more vibrant. Life began to feel much, well, richer. All of my relationships with friends, family, had so much more depth. I felt healthier, happier. Life is so much more fulfilling without beer goggles clouding everything up. I apologize for the long comment, but if I can ever save someone from going through what I went through by sharing my story, even just one person, I always try my hardest to tell it all. We are bipolar, we fall under the binge/social drinker category for the most part, but, there's a reason that 60 percent of us suffer from a commorbid substance abuse issue. We are just more prone to it, because we try to self medicate. Find the right meds that work for you and you wont even want to drink. Won't even miss it. I used to not be able to imagine my life without alcohol in it, now I can't imagine how I ever was able to DRINK LIKE THAT as often as I did.

Many of us have had a lot of success in reducing the frequency /intensity of our episodes. I'm no Dr of course and I don't play one on TV, but he may just need a med change. Not sure if this might be one he's taking but I was told by my primary care physician that Wellbutrin, while it can be extremely helpful, can be really awful for people who have bipolar, as it makes their anxiety go through the roof.

Twice in the last 2 years he has had dreams about me that have woken him from his sleep and has felt compelled to reach out to me, out of nowhere, at the most coincidental of times. When I explained to him what I had been dealing with, he told me to pray to God and ask for his wisdom before I took any action.I prayed for the first time in a very long time, and it was after that that I was led to these verses while doing my research. After I prayed I walked out to my living room, and there on the floor where my new dog had ripped pieces of my door frame off, they were lain on the floor in the shape of a cross. I told the preacher about my experience and he too said \"wise as a serpent, gentle as a dove.\" The letters to the 7 churches. God is trying to tell us something. That history is repeating itself. That we need to document EVERYTHING we are seeing and hearing, we need to compile enough evidence on these Satanist bastards and get word out to the right people so we finally have enough leverage to nail these depraved vile pedophiles. God's message to me has been clear. Be patient. Don't take action until the time is right. Document EVERYTHING that's been happening. Protect the children, they are the innocent victims who cannot speak up for themselves. Strike when the time is right and hit them with everything you've got.

I tried to report it to detectives working my case for a separate domestic violence case and in turn my son is in the custody of the state though they were so \"generous\" to allow him to stay with my mother until I stand before a judge to prove that I am fit to raise my son, and I was sent to a psychiatric hospital for 6 days, because I'm \"bipolar\" and am paranoid and hallucinating.

My son is highly advanced, he knows and can say and identify every letter of the alphabet upper and lower case, he can count to 12, he can identify those numbers, and has been able to since shortly after his 2nd birthday. He will only talk to me and show me these things when he seems certain no one is listening/spying. He has taken my phone, shown me how to turn off my mobile data, enable my airplane mode, change my sim card name, and even shown me how to play the \"no internet\" dinosaur game on Google chrome. I NEVER let my son play with my phone, I am strongly against allowing a device to raise and educate my child, and as a result he is obsessed with books and learning how to read. He has even used my swipe text and typed short words to me to try to help him explain. This is why the police think I'm delusional, because they don't believe a nearly 3 year old child is capable of doing this.

{"f8ekb4m": {"text": "Allow me to go into much further detail and explain the entire backstory of what is happening to me. I have been with the father of my 3 year old son for 6 years. Last year I attempted to kick him out of the home for domestic violence, as well as hiding a pretty severe drug addiction from me. The day after I kicked him out, our home was vandalized via a broken pipe under our kitchen sink that flooded our kitchen, as well as robbed, everything we had of value was taken. After I kicked him out, he came to me and told me he had stage 3 transitional cell carcinoma. As time went on his cancer progressed, and I allowed him to move back into the home as I wanted him to have as much time as he could with his son. He was accepted into a non profit cancer treatment center in Los Angeles, and traveled there from our home state for 6 weeks for treatment. During that time I wired him over $5k of my own money, as well as $1200 from a GoFundMe I started to help pay for his medications and living expenses while he underwent treatment. Long story short or as short as I can make it, the drugs and psychological abuse did not stop, and our bills continued to get further behind and I discovered him taking money from my debit card without my consent, and a pawn receipt for some of my items as well as my mother's laptop. The final straw was getting a certified letter from my mortgage company stating we were in .default of our loan and about to lose our home. That's when my mother mentioned she did not believe he ever had cancer, and that I should call the treatment center in California to see if he was ever a patient. That night I looked on our bathroom shelf and his prescription for oral chemo caught my eye. I used pill identifier to look up the pills and kept coming back with results for blood thinners. Then I looked up the  name of the chemo. It is an IV ONLY chemo mdication. I contacted the treatment center in California and was able to get 2 different medical records personnel to confirm, he was never a patient.", "link_id": "t3_e0f7hh", "time": 1574529334}}

{"f6z6bed": {"text": "I've never been officially diagnosed with 1 or 2, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar 3 times by different Dr's and therapists. I can tell you though that I most definitely am more inclined to believe I am bipolar 1, as I experience auditory hallucinations at times, and some pretty ghastly psychosis experiences. But, I've never been hospitalized for it, and apparently a lot of folks read that in a description and believe that to be a pre-requisite for a diagnosis of bipolar 1.I think I'm just better at suppressing my actual thoughts and feelings when I know I have an audience that has the authority to lock me up against my wishes. Probably my misspent youth doing illegal shit and evading cops.  My depressive phases, quite the contrary to what most people describe with 1 and 2, are actually relatively short. I'd say on average maybe 1 to 2 weeks, although I have had a depressive episode last upwards of a year once or twice. My Mania, on the other hand, is frequent and has a mighty large reserve tank when the gas runs low. My longest manic episode I would say lasted more than a year. As I don't have much of a frame of reference for the depressive side, (besides loss of interest in hobbies/things I've enjoyed, staying in bed and staying in my sweats and not bathing for a week at a time, isolating myself from everyone I know and becoming quiet and distant), I'll give you a rundown of what mania/hypomania looks like, for me.It starts out; everything is fucking AWESOME! I have so much energy and I feel so good, I really need to get this house clean! Oh wow I finished the house in no time! You know what, I should really clean out my closet and get rid of a bunch of shit I don't wear.... You know what? I'm having such a great day, and it's so beautiful out, I should have a Corona! Wow this beer tastes good, I think I'll have 1 or 2 more. Hmm.... I have a pretty nice buzz going, but I really feel like having a shot. I'm gonna go for a drive to the next town over that has the only liquor store in the valley open on Sundays and bump some gangsta rap. Man it sucks being in such a celebratory mood and not having anyone to hang out with, I'm gonna start blowing up Facebook with funny commentary and trying to hit up all my long lost friends on chat! Oh my God I have such a great idea on how to effectively make our partnership with our global convergys reps more cohesive! And while I'm at it, I'm going to put a training together on how to use our engineering coverage maps, I guess that means I'll have to learn how to ACTUALLY be what I always claim to be on my resumes, \"proficient\" in PowerPoint! Fuck it, I'll figure it out, I'll just wing it! Oh shit only 2 hours before my husband gets home and he doesn't like it when I drink, I wonder if I have time to pop in to the bar around the corner and have a couple crown and cokes and make it back here before he gets home... I just want to socialize a little bit! Next morning, after blacking out and getting maaaaybe 3 hours of sleep. \"Oh damn. I think I might still be a little drunk. How did I even make it to bed last night? Why is my husband sleeping on the couch? No time to deal with that dfamay, gotta get ready to go get dis bread!\" *Spends a COPIOUS amount of time fixing hair and makeup and getting those wings JUST RIGHT. Takes forever picking out a necklace and boots to accessorize perfectly* \"well shit. I'm 10 minutes late as usual. Where are my damn keys!?\" *Gets to work, spends entire morning meeting interrupting everyone and trying to make sure I command the most attention and have a funny comment or anecdote for every single topic that is mentioned.* *Starts on PowerPoint for that great idea I had last night. \"Oh you need me to help you work your follow-ups? Sure! Bring em on! Gosh our servicing partners have a lot of questions, but I absolutely can NOT leave any of them unanswered. But the more I answer them the more they private message me and only come to me with their questions... Oh well, this should help get me some recognition so I have some visibility for that promotion I always say I don't want...\" Before long I am over extended and HIGHLY annoyed and snappy and bitchy with ANYONE that tries to transfer me a call, as if it's their fault I'm busy...Aaaah home after a long day, time to pick a fight with my husband and be annoyed by my son's existence. I need some alone time. I'm gonna go see if there's any leftover fun drugs I can crush and snort. God my life is so MUNDANE and eventless. You know what would make me feel better? Some retail therapy. I'm gonna buy a bunch of clothes online and then because I can't wait I'm gonna go to a local store and buy a cute new outfit! None of my clothes fit me anymore because I've already dropped a fuckton of weight because I'm manic, plus I just cleaned out my closet today, I've earned it! This goes on, and on, and ON, for days or weeks, my fuse gets shorter and shorter and I fucking RAGE and go mad hoss at the slightest inconvenience. Then, thanks to good ol lack of sleep and photo editing projects, I start hearing shit. \"What is that sound? Why does it sound like 2 morning radio DJ's talking? I don't have the radio on... Why is it so muffled like I can't ever make out what they're actually saying??\" Then, the visual fuckery comes into play. -ESPECIALLY- if I am home alone, which I fucking HATE being home alone as I am convinced that the bad man has been laying in wait, waiting for the opportunity for me to be alone so he can rape/murder me. Throw that in with the eye fuckery and the muffled voices of 2 dudes in another room... We've got ourselves a party! I once carried a 9mm throughout the house all night and all morning long, convinced that there were people in the house that were going to get me. I saw someone's glasses reflecting in the moonlight watching me from the park across the street... I even called the cops and made them patrol my house. Twice. My house is fucking tiny. With paper thin walls. I can't believe they didn't haul my ass off. The best one was my most recent psychosis though, where I became convinced that my hairline was receding and that it was caused by scalp ringworm I must have gotten from my son or our dog. I walked around the house, spraying the walls with bleach water, I thought the cobwebs were mold or some sort of fungus that wanted to collect my hair. The spiders in the shower were watching me in eager wait to collect my hair, I saw them eating it, or making a web with it, I wasn't sure which. The flies were working with them, it was a covert op where they would dive bomb me, snatch my hair and give it to the spiders, who would then in turn give it to the mold monsters. I wore a beanie inside at all times, to try to protect my hair. It went on for several days, and didn't stop until my husband came and collected me out of the front yard, where I was sitting, picking ringworm pebbles out of a beanie I had just pulled out of the dryer, refusing to go inside because I didn't want to lose any more of my hair... He had to walk me around and make me point out the things I was seeing, so that he could explain them away for me. THAT. was a real muthafucka of a psychosis. Worst one yet, though thus far I've only had about 4 major events since I was diagnosed. As I get older, my symptoms get worse, even with medication. My rage gets more severe, my fuse shorter, the flight of rapid fire ideas, becoming early overwhelmed, crippling fear of calling places for bills, Dr's appts, basically any grown up obligation. And the presence of those auditory hallucinations definitely grows more prevalent. And so, yeah.... That about sums it up... Sound anything like your thing?

He said it all started when he noticed a blimp floating across the sky, right past a tower. He called his boss and said \"is your tower down?\" Sure as shit his boss said yes it was. He said \"watch it's about to clear up. Give it a few and it's gonna go out again.\" And it did. This gentleman was clever enough and perceptive enough, with no knowledge of RF Towers, to identify that his company was having issues with this specific tower, because of a blimp...He told me at his ten year high school reunion, he had the opportunity to talk to his high school counselor, who was appalled at how well he had done for himself. He told her \"well as it turns out I had some IQ testing done in the Navy, and I fall somewhere in the highly gifted area, I just never applied myself in school because it was boring to me.\" -At this point, I knew. I knew he HAD to be bipolar. I don't make it a habit of showing my cards to many people, but I knew I had to broach the subject with this customer. I said \"it's funny you mention that, because I've done a lot of research on the correlation of high childhood IQ's and bipolar-\"He stopped me there. He said \"let me just say, since you went there, that people that say we're bipolar and that there's something -wrong- with us are 2 dimensional thinkers.\" My jaw hit the floor! He KNEW! He KNEW that I was bipolar and he was WAITING for me to say something. He went on to say \"people that treat us like there's something \"wrong\" with us are only capable of thinking in 1 or 2 dimensions. We think in 3 and 4 dimensions. That's why we're able to pick up on things quicker, that's why we're so in tune with other's feelings and emotions, that's why we're so empathetic. We see things in a way that the 2 dimensional thinkers could never dream of.\" He was over the moon to have the opportunity to talk to me, he said it doesn't happen often, that we find each other and are able to freely have a conversation with someone who GETS IT, that we don't have to explain and break down everything for, but that it was always such a wonderful experience when it did happen and he wished we could all sit down in a room together for a while and talk.

In his mind, you should only get up, go to work, work all day, -maybe- stop at the grocery store or pick up Chinese on the way home, come home, watch TV, go to bed, go to work. Like come ON old fogies, don't you remember being young once? Why is it \"just plain stupid\" to spend $40 on a concert ticket? Or go camping? Good God. I know for a fact both my mother and his father had their own little gold tins of cocaine that they packed around religiously in their mid 30s. How quickly they forget. *Sigh* they're just concerned because they HAVE done it and don't want us to make the same mistakes blahblahblah it will NEVER. CHANGE. I just keep my distance now and if my mom sticks her nose where it doesn't belong I just walk away and don't talk to her, and still do the damn things I wanna do, I just don't tell her. As Coach Klein says, \"what mama don't know... Won't hoit her.\" Hey think of it this way, at least your mom doesn't live 3 houses up from you! Literally, 3 houses. I'm halfway there when I make it through my side yard. And she has binoculars. And uses them. Frequently. It's like everybody loves Raymond but most of the time... Ain't nobody laughin.

Also, is your software and carrier services up to date, and have you tried any other Bluetooth headset yet for making/receiving calls? have you checked under general settings/apps/app permissions, to make sure that there are no apps that have permissions to your microphone, phone, or contacts that shouldn't?

{"f5wejmg": {"text": "When I was your age, I went through a pretty messy break up (found out my boyfriend of 5 years had been cheating on me, multiple times, with multiple girls) and it nearly destroyed me. I knew that he would find a way to manipulate me and get me to come back to him if I stayed close, so, I moved 3000 miles away, back to my home state of Alaska. I spent an entire summer crying in my cousins airstream trailer alone, drinking a 6 pack of Budweiser every night, wondering what was so wrong with me, why wasn't I enough for him? Eventually I got lonely, needed some social interaction. Thanks to my already underlying problem with alcohol, I soon found myself going to bars by myself, to meet people, to have someone to talk to. This was the beginning framework to the most extreme manic episode I've ever had. It lasted over a year. I had decided that if all men wanted me for was to use me, that I was going to use them, and not let anyone get close to me. I used my looks to manipulate men into doing my bidding, be that buying me (and my friends) drinks, installing my car stereo for me, de-studding my snow tires, buying me things, giving me things, taking me places, helping me or my family move heavy furniture, you name it. I was never that kind of person. Before I left for Alaska, I was a Bob Marley t-shirt wearing, Birkenstock sporting, reggae and classic rock listening hippie. That all changed when there was no one around me who knew me, no one to call me on my bullshit and tell me I wasn't acting myself. It was a whole new me. I could come up with a good excuse to drink every day. \"Man I had a rough day. I need a drink.\" \"Yayy it's my birthday month! Let's celebrate! Everything is just so fun and AWESOME right now! Let's live in the moment!\" I went to clubs, lost a ton of weight, became obsessed with my appearance, got black out drunk every night, slept with strange men I'd met at the bar, started doing hard drugs, ran with a rough crowd, lost my job, lived in a duplex with no heat or power, stealing electricity from the vacant unit next door using an extension cord ... No, I was most definitely NOT myself. I was so ashamed of myself, I felt like an empty shell of the person I once was, and I longed so desperately to be that person again. I knew everyone in the lower 48 that had known me for 15+ years wouldn't even recognize the person I had become. But I felt that I was too far gone, and I would never be able to get back to that long lost, innocent soul. In some ways, I was right. I learned a lot about myself, I learned that I am a hell of a lot stronger than I ever gave myself credit for, I learned that I CAN meet people and make friends easily and not have to hide from the world. I learned that whenever I fall on my face and it seems there's no way out, I will ALWAYS make it through. I learned how to be independent again, and that I COULD be happy without a relationship, but that I DID have the capacity to love again. And, I also learned a lot of things that I DIDN'T/don't like about myself. I guess the point in my telling you all of this, those things that I did, those things that I learned that I don't like about myself? They might be a part of my story, but they're not WHO I am. My personality flaws and my mental illness are a part of my cocktail that MAKE ME who I am, but there's so much more to me than those things. And I took those lessons and I learned and grew from them. Just because you made a mistake doesn't mean you should have to be punished for it the rest of your life, especially when it's you who's doing the punishing. You have to wake up every day and spend every day with yourself, so you have to find a way to be ok with your flaws.

She found out I lost my virginity while I was working in Yellowstone at the age of 19, (almost 20) thanks to a blabbermouth friend of mine, and I can still remember exactly what she said to me when I called her. \"I can't believe you did that. I thought I taught you better than that. I am very disappointed in you.\" ...I was almost TWENTY! I thought I had done pretty damn good! But, because of the way she raised me I struggled with intimacy in my relationships and was even scared to LOOK at a guys youknowwhat for YEARS. To this day, (and I'm 35 now) it takes me a couple years of being in a relationship before I can finally open up and relax a bit about sex. You still have a lot of life experiences to get through, but I promise you, the older you get, the less worried you'll be about other's opinions. You've got this, and God's got your back.

Alcohol is the most evil drug on the planet. It turns people into evil, abusive, HORRIBLE people who say and do the most horrific things. All around even if you're not the one drinking, we with bipolar do NOT need to be around alcohol, in any capacity. And it's sad really, that alcohol is legal so people pass their judgement on drug addicts while they're sitting there drinking their liquor and beating their partners. I've met a lot of drug addicts that were the kindest people and would give you their last dollar that are a hell of a lot better people than an alcoholic.He sounds more like a narcissist to me. Check out this article when you have time, I think we could all say we've come across a few of these in our lifetimes. But I highlighted a few of the tactics I thought you might recognize;https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2016/06/20-diversion-tactics-highly-manipulative-narcissists-sociopaths-and-psychopaths-use-to-silence-you/2. Projection.\"One sure sign of toxicity is when a person is chronically unwilling to see his or her own shortcomings and uses everything in their power to avoid being held accountable for them. This is known as projection. Projection is a defense mechanism used to displace responsibility of one\u2019s negative behavior and traits by attributing them to someone else. It ultimately acts as a digression that avoids ownership and accountability.\"5. Nonsensical conversations from hell.  -\"If you think you\u2019re going to have a thoughtful discussion with someone who is toxic, be prepared for epic mindfuckery rather than conversational mindfulness.Malignant narcissists and sociopaths use word salad, circular conversations, ad hominem arguments, projection and gaslighting to disorient you and get you off track should you ever disagree with them or challenge them in any way. They do this in order to discredit, confuse and frustrate you, distract you from the main problem and make you feel guilty for being a human being with actual thoughts and feelings that might differ from their own. In their eyes, you are the problem if you happen to exist.\"6. Deliberately misrepresenting your thoughts and feelings to the point of absurdity.\"Narcissists weave tall tales to reframe what you\u2019re actually saying as a way to make your opinions look absurd or heinous. Let\u2019s say you bring up the fact that you\u2019re unhappy with the way a toxic friend is speaking to you. In response, he or she may put words in your mouth, saying, \u201cOh, so now you\u2019re perfect?\u201d or \u201cSo I am a bad person, huh?\u201d when you\u2019ve done nothing but express your feelings. This enables them to invalidate your right to have thoughts and emotions about their inappropriate behavior and instills in you a sense of guilt when you attempt to establish boundaries.7. Changing the subject to evade accountability.\"This type of tactic is what I like to call the \u201cWhat about me?\u201d syndrome. It is a literal digression from the actual topic that works to redirect attention to a different issue altogether. Narcissists don\u2019t want you to be on the topic of holding them accountable for anything, so they will reroute discussions to benefit them. Complaining about their neglectful parenting? They\u2019ll point out a mistake you committed seven years ago. This type of diversion has no limits in terms of time or subject content, and often begins with a sentence like \u201cWhat about the time when\u2026\u201dlong story short, you made a mistake. A mistake that could probably be attributed to your bipolar. But we've ALL done things that we are not proud of in our lives, and will probably carry guilt for forever, but that doesnt mean you should have to PAY for it for the rest of your life. There comes a point where enough punishment is enough. And your partner should be someone that makes you feel warm and safe and understood, not someone who's going to make your life HARDER. Your partner  should be a nice compliment to your life,  not an additional source of pain and stress. Just somethin' to think about. Best of luck to you my dear.", "link_id": "t3_djd8a4", "time": 1571356590}}

Right where I had been standing. And goes right thru a screen of an open window.... last thing that almost went thru my mind was the front of my skull. Myself and drunk dude 1 proceeded to tear this guy a new asshole, breaking the most important 3 rules about gun safety all in one shebang! Hell I think if anything we'd probably make BETTER soldiers.

{"f3pz3yt": {"text": "I guess, for me personally, having bipolar is just like having any other disability, be it losing a limb, paralysis, muscular dystrophy, chronic pain, what have you; You can spend your days thinking about how shitty and unfair it is that you have this disability, why it had to happen to YOU, complaining about how much pain you're in all the time, basically letting your illness define you and allowing it to become your identity, or, you can accept the fact that you and your affliction are going to be together for a long, long time, that it is a part of what makes you, YOU, but it's not ALL of what makes you, you, and you can learn some tricks to make your life more manageable. Would I give anything to not experience psychosises, like the one I had last week that scalp ringworm has overtaken my home, and that mold and black piedra were lurking everywhere, waiting for me to get near enough for them to take more of my hair? Seeing spider sacks and LIVING mold everywhere I looked in my home? Sure, absolutely, I'd wait in line to return that gift. Would it be great to not be broke as a fuckin joke, even though I have a good job, because I can't stop spending money irresponsibly like a jackass? Yeah, that'd be fantastic! Where do I sign? Would I KILL not to go into SCREAMING animalistic rages over stupid shit on the ones I love, so I could quit hurting them? Yeah, I'd give away my soul for that one, truly. Would I LOVE to have all of the embarrassment and shame from my past transgressions, drinking to the point of blacking out and putting myself in dangerous situations where I was taken advantage of and could have been killed? Well yeah, who wouldn't? But I don't have those options. I have a mental illness, and I've had to learn to forgive myself, and I've had to adapt and overcome. Which, everybody has to do, Bipolar or not, it's just a lot harder and a lot heavier for those of us with bipolar. So if I can find something positive about my illness that is a PART, (not all) of my identity, you bet your ass I will grab hold of that and find a way to feel the slightest bit better about who I am as a person, because self assessing and wanting to find ways to accept the things about yourself that you maybe don't like, and in accepting those things, understanding that there ARE things you can do to make these \"flaws\" less detrimental is imperative to your mental health and wellbeing. And I will ABSOLUTELY continue to try to spread a positive message to hopefully reach the eyes of readers who maybe need to read just exactly what I read to make myself feel better, and if I have the ability to help someone through some dark waters, I will always give everything I can, because I know how it feels to be drowning in despair, with no one who understands to reach out to.In closing I'd like to say, there's only one thing that truly bothers me about this sub; the comments where someone is trying to downplay/minimize someone else's \"level\" of bipolar. Just last week, I had someone flat out tell me; \"you're not bipolar! You're just irresponsible with money!\" I don't know if any of you have experienced that, in your personal lives or otherwise, but that shit is flat out abhorrent. As we all know from having a mental illness, being told you DON'T have a mental illness by someone passing judgement is a huge blow to the gut. You're already questioning your diagnosis yourself in your own mind, feeling guilty that maybe you SHOULDN'T have a members only jacket to this particular club, not being able to trust your own judgement... And you already have enough people judging you for being \"different\". You shouldn't have to be made to feel that way by the group of people who are like you as well. We're not Dr's, we haven't seen what everyone else has on their chart, let's not assume because one person's experience didn't go exactly like ours did that they must not be on the same \"level\" as us. \"Our prime purpose in this life is to help others.

{"f3gs91d": {"text": "Well get this, in the week or 2 leading up to this, I had been getting REALLY into studying up on my illness and was just TRANSFIXED in the commonalities so many of us share. Primarily, the vibrations that we feel that there is no medical explanation for, as well as the overabundance of Synchronicities that a lot of us experience. A lot of people say that when they feel these vibrations, they know they are about to go off the deep end on the mania spectrum, or go into a bad psychosis. I had never noticed any correlation, but I was determined to pay closer attention and learn all that I could. So, for about an entire week prior, I KEPT finding these praying mantis's in my house... 4 in total, I knew they were different ones by their size, and I knew they were really real because my husband and my son saw them too... We live in southern ID so it's somewhat considered high desert, so we DO HAVE praying mantis, but it's somewhat rare to see them, let alone in your house. The weird thing was, they only seemed to make their presence known when I was deep in thought about my life... Then, one of my cousins that I'm pretty close with that lives in Oregon out of nowhere posts on Facebook this picture of this praying mantis that visited her in her kitchen sink and scared the living fuck out of her... So anyways we get to chatting and come to find out she also experiences these vibrations and an exceedingly high amount of synchronicities. She's never been diagnosed but I've long suspected her of being bipolar too, as her mother definitely is, as most of the women on my mother's side of the family are but refuse to acknowledge it.THEN, her DAUGHTER who I am also very close with that lives in another town in Oregon, contacted me suddenly after a long stretch of us no really keeping in touch. So I go out to visit her, and I'll be damned if she doesn't tell me that SHE has been diagnosed with bipolar and has been prescribed her own fair share of mood stabilizers and anti psychotics, and that SHE, TOO, experiences these vibrations. Now mind you her mother and her did not discuss my prior conversation with my 1st cousin beforehand, and the way this conversation came to fruition was completely organic. Then she told me, \"you know Danielle, I can feel when you're hurting. Even when I don't know what's going on in your life, I can FEEL it.\" ...and I got to thinking about it, and she was absolutely right. Any time I've gone through some really heavy shit that I've never really let anyone in my life know about, she has ALWAYS reached out to me on a whim, because she wanted to visit or me to visit, or just see how I was doing. So I was feeling the vibrations right before and all during the mantis thing. So, I guess I can conclude that there may very well be a correlation between these vibrations and a pending manic episode.  Sorry, I know that was long, but some of this stuff is just MIND BLOWING. I think those of us that are truly afflicted with bipolar are all connected somehow... It's crazy, I know, but so is a lot of the shit I have seen and been through in my life! My life truly is stranger than fiction, you can't make this shit up! \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "link_id": "t3_dgihad", "time": 1570914653}}

I thought that the long legged spiders were in on it with the fungus and the flies. Like they were all working together. I saw black dots of mold, and longer dust bunny looking things that would scurry away when I sprayed them. Then I saw white cocoon looking spider sacks on the ceiling. I couldn't take it anymore, I had to get out! I pulled a beanie out of the dryer and saw it had the same little hairs on it that I began noticing at the start of my hair loss.

He walked me through the house and made me point out to him the things I was seeing. He explained away every last one of them. The bunnies I was seeing? Cobwebs. The spider sacks? Excess texture that had always been there on the ceiling. The black dots? Some of them (not all) were liquid eyeliner. The spide covert-op alliance?

Another facet that's asked about during diagnosis; \"-Has there ever been a period of time that you got much less sleep than usual and found that you didn't really miss it?\" So if you are feeling tired after missing out on the sleep, that would negate that particular section from qualifying. You mentioned the low end of the spectrum of self esteem, but what about periods of -inflated- ego? Dressing more provocatively, brighter colors, brighter makeup, basically you thought you were the Belle of the ball and men were falling at your feet. Or feelings of grandiosity, believing you held a position of much more importance than  what would be constituted in your line of business. During your episodes of rapid speech, do you find that you become quickly and easily frustrated at those around you, because they're not able to keep up with your flight of ideas? Being bipolar makes you feel like you're in the middle of a circle of darts, each dart holding an idea, and being thrown toward you in rapid fire motion. During these excessive energy episodes, do you find yourself being more social/outgoing, making TONS of commitments with others that is uncharacteristic of you? And then when you crash, not being able to fulfill a majority of these commitments? Do you find yourself fixating on a particular subject you're interested in, to the point where it takes up all of your time, and you tune other conversation or other tasks out because you're so hyper focused on said subject matter?Do you find yourself taking extreme risks that you normally wouldn't? Ie; going out to bar alone and getting hammered and waking up with no recollection as to what happened. Gambling, partaking in illicit drugs or excessive drinking. Spending money like you're Oprah and everyone in the audience is getting a new car, except they're not, and you don't have the means to substantiate such lavish spending.

But when I do get those depressive episodes... My poor house. My poor family. I let everything go to complete shit and I sleep for about 2 weeks straight, when I am normally an EXTREMELY anal retentive clean freak about the cleanliness of my house. But I'm sure others here can give you examples of the depressive episodes. Hopefully these can give you some benchmarks to go off of, and there are a TON of helpful resources on the internet as well, such as bphope.com, psychologytoday.com, verywellmind.com, anyway, just to name a few.

He thought he was going to die. He had accepted his fate and decided that he didn't want to spend his last days on this Earth with me and our 2 yr old son  feeling too sick  and weak to get out of bed from the chemo and halted all treatments. His aunt was somehow able to get him accepted into a non profit cancer treatment center in California. (We live in Idaho). He was gone 2 months. And the Drs down there told him he was NOT Stage 4, he was stage 3, and that they were pretty confident they could shrink and remove all 7 of his tumors. And they did. With robotic surgery they were able to remove ALL of his tumors.We are extremely grateful and he is extremely lucky. If he would have stayed here in Idaho he would have died in a few months. But, we still can't let go of the ANGER at these oncologists here in Idaho. For me it's as if my husband is back from the dead. It's such a mind fuck. I'm still just shell shocked. I think we both are. Still waiting for the other shoe to drop. In many ways I think we are both in a worse mental state NOW than when we were in the thick of it.

It was extremely beneficial for me, and I didn't have to physically go anywhere or meet anyone to participate. Just jumped on when it was convenient for me and poured out my soul.

{"f2dfat1": {"text": "My dear, it sounds awfully bipolar to me. When I was a teenager I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. When I turned 19 though, good Ol' alcohol brought me right out of my shell. I used to have very low self esteem, being a ginger with invisible eyebrows and swamp thing teeth didn't help my cause much. But when I turned 19, and the braces came off, and I learned how to draw my eyebrows on and discovered my amazing ability to shotgun a beer, things started to change. It was then that I had my first manic episode, (unbeknownst to me at the time of course). All of a sudden, I was getting attention. Lost a ton of weight, Guys were noticing me, everybody wanted to be around me, I was the life of the party! I didn't know how to handle that attention. It was Ugly Duckling Syndrome to the 9's! But it made me feel so good, I played the game. The flirting, the skimpy Jean skirts and low cut tank tops, bright colors to make me stand out in a crowd, spending wuh-HAY too much time straightening my hair,  doing my makeup, 10 lbs of mascara and 2 hours later... Let's hit the club! (I used to listen to classic rock and collect vinyl records  and wear Birkenstocks and Bob Marley t-shirts and jeans. Being a clubrat was quite out of character for me.) For the first time in my life, I WANTED to take selfies, I WANTED to be in pictures, I WANTED to go shake my ass on the dance floor. I WANTED the attention. It seems a major trigger to send me careening into full blown mania is a break up from a long term relationship. 3 separate times now, starting at 19, I've gone from being a responsible adult with good credit that pays her bills on time and holds a supervisory position, to being an irresponsible teenager that just wants to party all the time and look hot. I blow all my money pretending I'm young, dumb, and 21 again. I miss or am late for work because of my long nights partying, my performance suffers, my coworkers get annoyed with me. I put myself in risky and/or dangerous situations. I do hard drugs. I'm late on bills. My credit nose dives. And I always. Always. ALWAYS lose a shit ton of weight.Migraines are actually quite common for people with bipolar mood disorder;\"Most people with bipolar disorder will have to deal with comorbidities (or co-occurring illnesses).

It could be that these meds are exaserbating an underlying condition, (being bipolar) that you're not yet aware of. It could just be the meds... But your behavior sounds awfully close to mine, and I'm Bipolar 1.

{"f2chyts": {"text": "As cliche as this will sound, just know that you're not alone. There are a LOT of us that are right there with you. And, having a predisposition to substance abuse doesn't mean there's anything or another thing wrong with you, especially if you are recognizing it early and taking steps to prevent it from becoming a problem. It's all intertwined with the bipolar. Our low impulse control, our desire to fit in and feel \"normal\", our shifts in mood and wanting to control them, to numb the pain, to forget about our behaviors that were embarrassing, to slow our minds down, it's all connected.Just as it is being genetically predisposed to alcoholism is, (having an alcoholic parent makes you 50% more likely to struggle with alcohol dependency yourself) Its the same with bipolar. So when you look at it like, \"I have a 50/50 chance if I drink of developing an alcohol dependency because of my bipolar\", I think, especially when you're recognizing that you are beginning to crave it, it makes it a bit easier to make that choice to just NOT f#*k with it. Your mind is trying to trick your body into thinking it needs it, just don't let it win.My husband and I went to AA meetings every other day for 2 months straight. It was incredibly beneficial. I really got something out of it, as did my husband. I think initially I wanted to go so that I could minimize my own drinking problem, (\"well I've never done anything as bad as that guy did in his share so I can't be an alcoholic!\") But their stories really resonated with me, even the really extreme stories, I could see how easily that could be me. Their line of thinking and justification was just like my own. After those 2 months I really didn't experience the cravings or the compulsion/urge to drink anymore at all, my body, mind and spirit had already made that conscious decision to stop drinking, December 10th 2017, and because of that, it made it easier to maintain that self control. So maybe I WASN'T an alcoholic, maybe I WAS just a binge drinker, but I sure am glad I didn't test that theory any further. I now have deeper connections not just with my husband and son, but in ALL of my personal relationships. Colors seem brighter, my body is healthier, and boy it sure is nice to wake up and remember everything that happened the night before. My life is fuller and richer without alcohol in it. If you're not comfortable discussing this with a  therapist, or making yourself physically go in to a meeting, here's a suggestion;The next time you are having a craving for alcohol, open up YouTube and go to this link; https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuSJRom1_4kDULtA1J5V67-MwW_ofjKRkScott R.'s share \"we are not a glum lot\" and Jonathan S. Speaking of the term recovered vs recovering in AA held an especially exorbitant amount of significance for my husband and I. It's like going to a meeting, without having to be uncomfortable being a newcomer, and without having to leave your house, and without anyone else being aware of what you're doing. Listening to some of these speakers was probably THE most beneficial for my husband and I, really and truly. I hope they can help you too!", "link_id": "t3_dcmzwj", "time": 1570138409}}
{"f2bvdv8": {"text": "If those thoughts of drinking alcohol to feel better or calm your nerves are already beginning, my best advice to you is to STAY AWAY from alcohol while you still have some self control! There's a reason that -60%- of those afflicted with bipolar mood disorder also suffer from drug and/or alcohol dependency. I used to consider myself a binge drinker as well, but those benders became longer, and longer. Eventually, I looked for an excuse to drink every day. \"I'm sad/depressed/stressed, I just need a drink to calm my nerves...\" \"I'm so stoked, everything in life is just so AWESOME right now, we should really celebrate, it is my birthday MONTH after all!\" That's where the blackouts come into play. That's where I allow myself to get so obliterated that I get taken advantage of. Going home with strange men, getting into a vehicle with them and waking up not remembering what happened, who they were... I could have been killed. I certainly don't remember THEM, so how could I have consented? I say horrible things to people I know, talk mad shit and try to pick fights, and once I'm feeling pretty buzzed up, everything sounds like a great idea! \"Sure, I'll try some heroin!\" \"Meth? Well I've done coke before so if it's like that, sure! Why not?\" \"I'm not that drunk, I can drive home!\" From the Betty Ford Clinic;Stage 1: Pre-AlcoholicDo you drink to feel better about yourself? Do you drink to dull the pain? Do you drink to forget, stop worrying, or eliminate anxiety? If so, your drinking could escalate without help.Stage 2: Early AlcoholicBlacking out from drinking too much is a warning sign of this stage, along with lying about drinking, drinking excessively, and thinking obsessively about drinking.Stage 3: Middle AlcoholicAt this point, it's obvious to those close to you that you're struggling. You might miss work, forget to pick up the kids, become irritable, and notice physical signs of alcohol abuse (facial redness, weight gain or loss, sluggishness, stomach bloating). Support groups can be a highly effective form of help at this stage.I never have really craved sweets, but if I was on a particularly extreme bender, I would wake up in the morning and my hands would shake, and all I wanted was a Snickers. I didn't crave sweets because I was getting so much sugar intake from the alcohol, thus, when my body didn't have alcohol in the system, I needed that sugar. I had my first drink when I was 15 years old, and I always considered myself a social drinker, but in my mid 20's, right when I was diagnosed with bipolar, my alcoholism really ramped up. Alcohol took over my life, it was a part of my identity and the direct and indirect cause of every truly awful thing that has ever happened to me in my life. I rang in my 30th birthday with a nice fat excessive DUI. I blew a .21. I didn't even feel that drunk, and I still remember everything that happened that night. And yet even after all the consequences of that DUI, as soon as I was on unsupervised probation, I went straight back to alcohol. Addiction is a hell of a thing. It stopped being fun. Less jovial, happy, fun-loving drunks and more blackouts, physical fights, it started bleeding into my performance at work and into my personal relationships.It wasn't until after I had my son, and my husband and I began fighting horribly, that I had my \"moment of clarity\". My son didn't ask to be born to an alcoholic mother, and I am not the mother my son deserves when I am under the influence of alcohol or hung over. My husband and I have been sober from alcohol for just shy of 2 years. I used to not be able to imagine my life living a day without alcohol. Now I can't imagine how I ever lived my life drinking like that every day. Not to sound preachy or give you my life story, but if I can help save one person from having to go through what I did with alcoholism, I believe it's worth it to share my story. The statistics on bipolar and substance abuse/addiction commorbidity are staggering. If you're beginning to have those feelings of needing to self medicate, talk to your Dr and get your meds adjusted. Abstain from alcohol NOW before you don't have the self control/willpower to do so. Best of luck to you!", "link_id": "t3_dcmzwj", "time": 1570131267}}

Not only do you get PTO and full medical dental and vision, but 6 weeks paid -full wages- maternity leave, but you can take up to 3 months off, even new dad's, get 3 weeks paid paternity leave. TMobile will provide up to. $7,000 towards adoption, surragacy, IVF, and IUI, so if a husband and wife both worked there, TMobile would literally buy you a baby lol. And beyond that, TMobile puts forth a lot of effort into their employee's work/life balance. They have a support line you can call 24 hours a day, everyone that answers the phone is a licensed therapist. They'll provide you resources and help you find a local therapist or support group, direct you where to look locally for assistance when you're struggling, all kinds of different things. You get a free 30 minute consultation with an attorney when you need it, they'll help pay for your ticket or rental car if you have a family emergency and need to leave the state, they even have an employee relief fund, where, in very special circumstances when an employee is struggling financially due to things beyond their control (like me, my husband was out of work for 3 months undergoing cancer treatment, we didn't think he was going to make it but he beat it. But, we got very behind on bills with all of his medical bills/prescriptions/being out of work. I applied for the employee relief fund and TMobile gave me extra money, tax free, just to help get me back on my feet.) Overtime is never mandatory,but is usually always available if you'd like to work some. During iPhone launches, they give us-$50- an -HOUR- stipend on TOP of time and a half to work the launch, IF we want to. Not required. but who the hell wouldn't want to!?There's no such thing as \"attendance points\",they understand that life happens sometimes, so their attendance policy is based on behaviors. If you're showing a trend of missing days all the time, (barring pre-scheduled time off or FMLA) That's when they have a talk with you, not like other call centers and their strict attendance policies. It is definitely not an easy job, the cell phone industry is constantly changing and competitive offers on devices and plans seem like there's a new one every week, so there is a LOT to know and a lot to keep up with. I've done this work for years and years and it STILL took me almost a YEAR before I thought I had a firm grasp on it. But that's ok, because our bosses know this, and they want to see us succeed. They COACH us, not reprimand/action plan us. But, we work hard, we play hard. Last summer our site won a $40,000 party, rented out Big Al's (bowling alley/adult arcade, like Dave and Buster's kinda, but fancier) and every year they rent out Roaring Springs water park for TMobile employees only for our company picnic.

I have worked in the call center industry for 15 years, 4 years (2 years first time, 2 years 2nd time) DirecTV,  1 year Apple tech, 2 years Hewlett Packard executive escalations, just shy of 2 years Verizon tech as a supervisor, moved to AK for a few years, made a wreck of my life, got RE-hired at DirecTV, made it there another 2 years in retention...The job was EXTREMELY stressful and depressing as FUCK, (this was also during the time AT&amp;T was buying out DirecTV, so they were looking for any reason they could to get rid of those that were higher paid) I wanted to put a gun in my mouth before every shift and that ain't no lie, I lived in the community adjoining my office and I STILL barely clocked in on time. You know how when you're dreading something that strongly, your whole body just freezes and you just physically CAN'T make yourself stand up and walk out the door? as if you've turned to stone? Well, that happened one too many times, got fired (again) for being 2 hours short on paid time off for a day I took.... Got RE-hired at Verizon tech, I was sitting in the new hire training classroom when I got the call and was offered a position at Tmobile. I had been trying to get on there for over 10 years, they are ranked the #1 best place to work in Idaho. So, quit Verizon, (AGAIN. Notice a theme here?) And have now been at Tmobile for over 3 and 1/2 years. As you can see I had a habitual habit of making it 2 years somewhere and then either getting stressed/burned out, or impulsively quitting. And as you can also see, even though I either quit or got fired abruptly for my attendance, I was still such a high performer and well liked, that even years later I was offered to come back to not only 1, but TWO companies. In the call center world that's unheard of. I think the difference, for me, with TMobile, is that they TRULY care about their employees. They are genuinely concerned for our well-being and they treat us as EQUALS, not just a warm ass in a seat. And they have so many different schedule options. Mornings, nights, 4 10's, 3 12's which is what I'm on, so I can just rally thru 3 days and get 4 days off in a row, every week. They were the ones that recommended I try to get on an intermittent leave of absence, on days where I just couldn't make myself move. I get a day a week, just in case I need it. It has really saved my ass on more than one occasion. So, my point in all of this is, find a company that gives a shit about you, which it looks like you already may have, and find out what it would take to get an intermittent LOA. When you feel appreciated and you appreciate your boss, you're much less likely to be inclined to let him down, and having a backup plan like the intermittent LOA to cover your ass and keep your job safe, you CAN maintain a job long term.

After about a month, I noticed that I was more anxious than an Arabian horse at the races, waiting for the gate to open. Literally chomping at the bit. I requested an appointment to discuss how the Wellbutrin did nothing to help with my anxiety, and my regular Dr wasn't in the office.  The nurse practitioner who saw me instead, quickly determined that I was bipolar (I have been diagnosed 3 times in 10 years, but never accepted it until last year) and told me that Wellbutrin can actually be quite bad for people with bipolar, as it can cause their anxiety and paranoia to go through the roof and blast off to outer space. She told me to quit taking it IMMEDIATELY, and prescribed me with Lamotragine.I noticed a difference within a few days. Lamotragine really kind of gave me my life back. it worked well for about a year, until I stupidly took myself off of it because I didn't want to deal with scheduling an appointment and dealing with more Drs. I plan on getting back on it, I have an appointment next week to try to regain control of my life.  But yes Wellbutrin does absolutely nothing to help with your anxiety, but can certainly make it a hell of a lot worse. I was acting like a tweaker, constantly looking through my husband's phone, trying to track him with family control apps because I was CERTAIN he was cheating on me....

You said it yourself, you've taken leadership roles before no problem. And if you really think of those times that you took charge, it was because everyone else was sitting around with that stupid f@#&amp;*in look on their face with no sense of direction, and so you HAD TO stand up and take the reins and come up with something on the fly, because SOMEBODY had to, and nobody else was stepping up. Right? Do you know why? Because we're SMART, and we are -natural- -leaders-, and we can come up with some pretty incredible ideas off the cuff. I know it's not college, but I had a very similar situation happen to me in the 6th grade. None of my group wanted me to take charge because I ALWAYS took charge. We did 2 seperate scripts/videos. One with MY idea, and one with theirs. Of course they chose theirs to submit. And when the time came, when the video ended, I could see that our teacher was not impressed. He asked if we had any other ideas we could have submitted. I told him about my tape, (much to my groups chagrin), he played the tape, and said that was exactly what he was looking for. He said if we had submitted that tape it would have been an A. Guess who got an A, and guess who didn't?Approach your professor with YOUR ideas and be straight up with him. Then he will see that you weren't slacking and will understand that you really were and have been trying.

Wifi calling is a complimentary feature provided by TMobile and the devices that are made for TMobile have this capability built into them. However BYOD devices in many cases do not have the right carrier settings to allow this feature to work. Check your APN settings and see what it says for \"APN protocol\" it should only say iPv6, and the roaming protocol should only say iPv4. Additionally, there are 2 ports that need to be opened up on your router to allow wifi calling to work properly. I can't remember offhand what numbers they are, but some Google searching should give you the answer. Good luck getting a competent Cox tech rep on the line though, without paying for advanced support via their $13/mo protection plan. What your TMobile rep needs to do is to verify that you have the free WiFi calling SOC on your line, it's FREWIFICA. Then send OTA activation downloads to your device, followed by resync'ing your account provisioning, and then cancelling your location. While your rep cancels your location, reset your WiFi, mobile, and Bluetooth. Power your phone off completely for 2 minutes, then power back on.  If all of this has been done, and your device did not come from TMobile, that is as far as tmobiles responsibility lies, as out BYOD disclaimer clearly stipulates that not all features and functions are guaranteed to work on a BYOD device. If the phone DID come from T-Mobile, but you've rooted to international unlocked, this could also cause the wifi calling functionality to no longer work properly, as you are likely no longer continuing to receive carrier updates.

I also get to talk to a lot of really cool customers, and follow up with them to make sure their issue was resolved, and sometimes, they teach ME things I might not know about. Troubleshooting phone calls are different than regular customer service calls, because people are a lot nicer to you when they know hold the key to fixing their phones, and you're not talking about their bill/money. I get to work closely with our engineering department filing trouble tickets to identify network issues and resolve customer's pain points, as well as identifying areas of opportunity for tower enhancement.

The feeling is incredible, all of your aches and pains, even ones you didn't realize you had completely go away. Everything has a warm hue to it and music sounds better, you love everybody and everything is just AWESOME. lol but it also makes you grind your teeth a lot, and after it wears off you kinda feel antsy. Like your body is tired but your mind won't let you sleep. I thin taking a Xanax at the end of the fun part would be pretty beneficial. Never had one to spare though lol. But it's a hell of a \"hangover\" of sorts. I just can't set aside a whole weekend like that anymore. And last few times I've done it its made me puke. Not that that takes away from its efficacy or anything, just puking f@#\"#n sucks. LSD is probably my favorite though, just because no nausea like there is with mushrooms and the visuals are pretty out of this world. It feels \"cleaner\", somehow. I've never felt like I was gonna have a bad trip on acid, but I never push it more than 3 tabs. I think it's easier to have a bad trip on mushrooms. But same thing, after the effects wear off, you can't go the F to sleep. Not nearly as shitty feeling as with MDMA afterwards though.  Now mushrooms are.... Mushrooms are a class set alone from the rest. You'll feel like you need to puke, but you won't puke. you'll laugh so hard tears will roll down your face, but it also has a more emotional element I think than the others. It makes some people cry over absolutely nothing, but not in a bad trip kind of way, in a \"I needed that for my soul\" kind of way. Best way I've learned to take them is to grind them up into a fine powder and then make chocolates out of them by melting chocolate morsels down and then pouring into a candy mold.

A LOT, and I have always had such positive experiences from them. The afterglow lasts for nearly a week, and I'm more at peace with myself, more tolerant, I don't get impatient andbhave any rage snaps, I'm able to see things from others perspectives, I feel closer to my husband... I think you have to be in the right state of mind before you take them, but I think they're a powerful tool that are foolishly being dismissed from having any benefit. MDMA is actually used a lot in couple's counseling, and Ayahuasca has been proven to actually completely CURE addicts from their addictions. I think that whatever kind of person you are deep down, in your soul, that is going to be pontificated when you take psychedelics. If you have evil and hatred within you, that's going to come to the surface. If you have love and are generally an empath, that's going to come out and empower you to be a better person. Have you done any research on DMT? there's a documentary on Netflix called \"DMT, The Spirit Molecule\", and I found it very fascinating. Its always been one I've been too scared to try, because of my fear of relinquishing control. It only lasts for 15 minutes, although people who have tried it said it feels like hours, or years. But it has been life changing for many. DMT is found in every living being on this Earth, from people, right down to the blades of grass in your yard. It makes me wonder if we who have bipolar, might have a surplus of this within us, well beyond what those who don't have.", "link_id": "t3_d2srd1", "time": 1568233268}}

{"ezvm6j4": {"text": "...when my husband was told he was going to die from his cancer... I felt as though God was guiding me. I've never even attended church except maybe twice when I was invited when I was a kid. Was always very anti organized religion, and yet I was reconnected with an old friend from high school, who is Apostolic and deeply religious, her father is a preacher. We were very close, like sisters in high school, and her parents like 2nd parents, although I was a wild child and they wore their Jean skirts and hair in buns, they accepted me like family. I hadn't spoken to her in 15 years, severed off ties because I liked to party too much. Anyway, she had been a CNA since we were in high school, and when my stepfather was in his last stages of bone cancer (traveled up to his brain, it was horrible. All while my husband had to watch in horror at what we thought was to be his fate as well. It was horrific. Darkest times of my life.) My mother was trying to take care of him in home, and he became belligerent and disoriented and fell out of his bed and my mother couldn't get him back up. I had the thought, \"maybe I can contact Dorothy ?' but how? I looked in my contacts, and amazingly, I still had a number programmed for her. How it lasted that long in my contacts I will never know. But surely it couldn't still be her number? It was. She came over immediately (now a nurses aide) and helped my mother get her husband back in his bed, and gave her tips on how to make it easier for her to move him.I begged her to let me take her out to breakfast to repay her, and when we sat down it was like no time had passed between us. Her advice and unique perspective were a great source of comfort for me. Her father told her to contact me one night because he woke up out of a deep sleep in a cold sweat, telling him God had spoken to him and told him to pray for us, and that if they could be of any help to my family to please let them know.Strangely, her sister, who now lives across the country, had a similar dream, and called me at 3 in the morning to tell me, \"God told me to pray for you.\" I can't describe that overwhelming feeling. It was all too much to be coincidence. And though my whole world felt like it was falling apart, I felt that God was speaking through me, that the right words would always come to me when needed, to comfort others. My husband, his family, friends and family members not even related to the situation ... It still gives me chills to think about, almost a year later. My husband was able to get into a non profit treatment center in California and with chemo and robotic surgery, they were able to remove all 7 of his tumors. I can't help but to think God sent this family back into my life when he knew I needed them the most, and that their prayers may have saved his life.Lately I haven't been living my life the best way I could. I've made some dumb choices I feel pretty badly about, as all of the stress of the past year have thrown me into rapid cycling with some of the worst of the worst manic episodes. Praying Mantis's have been coming into my home... That rarely happens where I'm from. We have them, but they rarely come inside your home. In the last 2 weeks I've seen 4. I can tell they're different ones because of their differences in sizes. I have also proven this not to be a hallucination because my husband and my son have both seen them. They only make their presence known when I'm deep in thought about my life and the choices I must make. While I was in the midst of explaining some of this to my long lost friend Dorothy, out of a dead silence, one began to chirp right outside my window... From what I've found online, there's a mixed bag of symbolisms, but the major one is, \"when you see Praying Mantis, it's time for you to pray.\" All this research I've done on how our illness brings us these delusions and grandiosity, and then all of these things happen and I just don't know what to believe! I try to reaffirm that that's all that it is, my mind reading too much into it, trying to convince myself that it's nothing... But is it? I'm so sorry for the long winded tapestry.

I'm beginning to lose touch with what's real and true, what might be coincidence, if I'm being gaslighted, if I'm reading too much into someone's attitude towards me... The few times I have gone into a psychosis have been in regards to concern for my son. The first time, last year, he bonked his head on the tub basin, and I was convinced that he had a concussion, that he was stumbling and not acting himself. Nobody could convince me otherwise. I became so frightened and concerned, that I ran up to my mother's house with him and made her drive us to the emergency room. As she was driving I saw blood running down one of his ears. I SAW IT, it was real, it was there... It wasn't there. The Dr's there looked at me like I was from another planet. I was pacing back and forth. I could see the concern in my mother's eyes, not for my son, but for me. I'm lucky they didn't commit ME that night. Since that night, if anything ever happens to my son and I feel he's not acting himself, I record a short video of him to send to my husband, to prove that it's not just a figment of my imagination, and to validate myself I suppose. A few days ago he got ahold of a bottle of hydrogen peroxide my husband left out that I was unaware of and ingested some. He seemed very disoriented afterward and his belly was distended.

All the structure and performance metrics can be overwhelmingly stressful, and even though I tell myself I don't care and I'm not going to break my back to rank highly, I always do. I check my month to date stats first thing every morning. I'm in the top 2% in the Nation for 2019, because as much as I don't want to be, I'm an over achiever. My boss tells me \"don't chase the numbers chase the behaviors, let me worry about the #s\". But I can't help it, I can't relinquish any control. I am very lucky to work for such an amazing company now though. As opposed to other centers I've worked at that make you feel like you're in jeopardy of losing your job every day, my company actually gives a shit about their employees. My bosses were the ones that pushed me into trying to get on FMLA, to keep my job secure and alleviate some of the stresses in my life. I work 11 hour days, which seems like a lot, but I only have to work 3 days a week, and I get 4 days off every week, with a shift differential to offset the missing 7 hours. If it weren't for them treating me so well and me having the flexible schedule options, I don't think I'd be able to work 5 days a week. I wish more companies operated this way. A lot more of us with bipolar would be able to stay in the workforce I think.", "link_id": "t3_d14myr", "time": 1567960751}}

Ha! Jokes on her, I isolated/excluded my OWN self! Lol JkjkBut yes you're absolutely right I've always been a leader, very bossy as a child lol and always stood up and took charge. I used to have to tell my teachers the spelling books were too easy and to give me the next grade level up, (which was still too easy), always the one to get called on for oral reading when the teacher wanted to hurry up and get through it. Always had to be the narrator in plays and the class representative for spelling bees, (begrudgingly!) Skipped school all the time in high school all. The. TIME! I'd come in on a test day and Ace the test, used to piss my teachers off so bad \ud83d\ude02Dropped out because I wasn't being mentally stimulated and people suck, took years to go get my GED but in that time I held high positions in the telecommunications industry, constantly getting promoted everywhere I worked, because of my charm/sense of humor and my ability to process new information quickly. Promoted to supervisor for a 3rd party vendor for Verizon in their tech site, isolating/identifying new issues and fixes for \"smartphones\" (Blackberries and Palm Pilots! Shows my age ! \ud83d\ude02) Accomplished all of that with no background/college education or even at the time a high school diploma... So yes, those articles absolutely ring true for me as well. As I've gotten older I feel that my symptoms have progressed, if that's possible? and it's not quite as easy as it used to be, takes a little longer and some days I'm so scatterbrained I can't even remember the soft reset process when troubleshooting an iPhone, and some days I'm just frozen to my bed. Can't leave my house. Just yesterday I took the day off because I just couldn't mentally handle it. And I LOVE my job, but I am very fortunate to have FMLA and my company is very compassionate and understanding and genuinely cares about their employees. If more companies operated their business this way, I think more of us with bipolar would be able to hold down full time jobs and be successful.

How incentivizing do you think it would be for someone who already has a predisposed inclination of perceiving people with bipolar as nutjobs, for them to see all of the anguish and macabre at it's worst levels? I'm sure that'll really  reel 'em in to volunteer at the telethon, ya think? They'll be lining up single file!Yes, I have an explosive temper. Yes, I feel guilt and shame and remorse for my actions and for my decisions. Yes, I have put myself in dangerous situations and made horribly poor choices and have suffered the consequences. Yes, I am \"too much\" even in my most joyous level of mania. Yes I have lost jobs, friendships, relationships because of my bipolar. Yes, I have lived on the fringes of society, in 20 below weather, with no power, stealing electricity via electrical cord run through the vacant side of a duplex, drinking copiously, spending $100 a day on heroin and close to that on meth. I've done all of those things, but all of those things are not who -I- am. I'm also a good person with a big heart, who will always reach out to the underdog when I see they're struggling. A person who will go out of their way to help a friend, acquaintance, or complete stranger in any way that I possibly can. I'm a good listener (when my thoughts aren't racing) and a shoulder to cry on. I give too much of myself and rarely get a fraction of that in return. I'm a loving mother who worries about her son and the impacts her illness may have on him, I try my hardest to make up for it by taking him to as many places I think he would enjoy as much as I can, as often as I can. I give great advice, even when my own life is unraveling. I'm able to do so because of my own personal life experiences. I've lived through a lot of shit. And even having this mental illness, I was able to be the support net for my husband while he was battling cancer when we thought he had 6 months to live. I carried our family through it, financially and emotionally. I singlehandedly found ways to fund it all. It's incredible what you can do when life is thrust upon you and you have no choice but to be strong and keep moving, even when you want to lay down and die.So yes, I'm delusional. Because I'd much rather find SOMETHING. ANYTHING positive to grasp on to about my mental illness because this is my body, and this is my brain, and we are going to be together for a very long time, and I don't want to live every day of my life in constant self loathing.

{"ezb9wlg": {"text": "I can appreciate where you're coming from, but doesn't the general public ALREADY have a skewed perception of bipolar disorder? Would you prefer to be alienated yourself when you tell someone that you're bipolar? Let me give you an example. As you can see from my name title, I'm a technical support representative. The way it works with TMobile is that each region of the US is assigned their own team of experts. My team and I take calls specifically from the San Diego market, so there are 10 customer care reps, and 2 tech reps. We're pretty slow as tech reps, as San Diego is our fastest LTE hub. We have a lot of time to sit around and shoot the shit. We had been on a team together for about 7 or 8 months, when he mentioned that he thought his ex girlfriend was bipolar. I looked him dead in the eye and said \"well, you really can't always tell when someone might be bipolar. -I'M- bipolar, and for the most part I'm pretty chill or \"normal\" so you'd never really know unless I told you.\" To me I thought nothing of it, he and I were buddies, but after the words \"-I'M- bipolar\" crossed my lips, I could see the look in his eyes even as I was still trying to blurt out the rest of my sentence. It's the look you get when you know someone's opinion of you has changed, with the snap of a finger. Wide eyed, bewildered, and a little afraid. Since that day the dynamic between us hasn't been the same. So if someone's inclined to have a pre-notion about the personality traits of someone who is bipolar, which would you rather it be? That we're all raging psychopaths that have no regard for another human being and might cut little slices out of your face with an ice pik, or that we're all novelists and we paint happy little trees on landscapes in an oil based medium? Being ostracized doesn't help bipolar depression, does it? Don't we already get enough of that? Why not help create a clearer understanding of our illness, get people fascinated, to the point that they actually do their own research on the matter? Wouldn't that make society as a whole more tolerant and empathetic to our plight?In addition to that, I feel that bipolar is just the same as any other chronic illness, be it cancer, chronic pain, what have you; while there may only be 2 \"types\" of bipolar in medical literature, no two people with bipolar mood disorder are the same. We all might fall under the same umbrella as far as impulsivity, risky behavior, irritability like a m#*+@#er, but we all exhibit our behaviors differently and to different extremes. Some are manic for a couple weeks, some have gone manic for months or years. Some are addicts and some are not. Some are violent, and some are not. Some are depressed more and manic less, some are manic more and rarely depressed (I fall under the latter category, but when I DO get depressed, I'm down for 1-3 weeks usually). My point being, our diagnosis doesn't put us as individuals in this neat and tidy little box labeled 1 and 2. There is SO MUCH MORE to a human being, to a person's SOUL, than their diagnosis. We can't let it consume our lives, and we can't use it as a get out of jail free card to be a shitty human being. So what's wrong with trying to boost ourselves up and have a better quality of life by choosing to take a moment to accent the positive in every day?", "link_id": "t3_d0m534", "time": 1567816365}}

Sometimes we have to meet people where they are, and sometimes you have to leave them there too.In the end it's probably better they don't communicate with you now, because if they say they've forgiven you and they haven't, the whole dynamic of your relationship is tarnished forever.

All the while raising our 2 year old son, holding down a full time job to pay the bills, and not really having my own opportunity to fall apart. God it was awful. I wanted to shut myself off from everyone and everything. Doing the laundry felt too overwhelming. My son kept me getting up every day, as what can one do when they have no choice? If anything were to happen to my husband, I'm all he has. My mother and my friends wouldn't let me isolate myself. If they hadn't heard from me all day, they were texting, calling, showing up. They brought me meals, did my laundry, watched my son so I could take a drive with friends and just do something for -myself-, something that -I- enjoyed doing. Even going for a drive with a girlfriend, I can't begin to tell you how cathartic that was. You get so wrapped up in your significant other's illness, you tend to lose your sense of self, and you start not taking care of yourself and your own needs. Absolutely join an online support group, I did and it helped me tremendously to have that sounding board and know that I wasn't alone, and to be able to just type and not have to obligate myself to attending a group in person was extremely beneficial for me.As someone with bipolar, I can tell you, we doubt and question ourselves and our choices daily. After all, look at the messes we create for ourselves because of our impulsive decisions. Our significant others are one of those choices.

Then it started losing its efficacy, I went up to 200mg, it kept me even-keeled, but before long I could feel that impatience and irritability building back up in me, then it almost seemed to make my rage WORSE. it gave me dizzy spells here and there too, like I was on an elevator stopping at the next floor. Stopped taking it too. Wish to God it had worked out for me because those months it worked I felt like a much better person.", "link_id": "t3_cvtia9", "time": 1566866563}}
{"ey6g3ov": {"text": "I'll tell you what man, if you can find a way to swing it, get. A. Lawyer. I paid $3,500 for my attorney but he let me make payments thank God. My fines were going to be to the tune of $2500 but my attorney got them to $1500. They wanted me to do 1 year supervised/1 year unsupervised, my attorney got me 2 years unsupervised. Pretrial probation is worse than after sentencing! Every other day I was getting called down to piss in front of someone at $13 a pop. Told one of the nurses when she made me drop trou and spin \"I feel like you're the one that should be payin' me here!\" My license was revoked for 2 years, I had to do -72 hours- of community service, which my attorney also negotiated or else it would have been SILD, and fuuuu@$#-k that noise. 72 hours doesn't SEEM like a lot but when you have to do it and by a certain time AND work full time and you damn sure don't want to do it on your days off, it is -cumbersome-. Be sure and try to get them to let you do it at the Goodwill though, they are wonderful, kind, non judgemental people, and it really could have been way worse manual labor. By far.In the end with the cost of the UA's, my attorney, (who had a heart attack and died right after I paid him off... Not to be a dick but uuh. Damn. Shoulda waited a while on that last payment) court fines and classes (6 days, can't remember how many hours but they felt long. And did nothing but PROMOTE recreational drugs and alcohol weirdly) license reinstatement fee after 2 years not being able to have one $500 for reinstatement, about $200 more for the license, registration, etc. , I had to carry an SR-22 for 3 years which is NOT cheap, cost me $230/-MONTH- I'd say it all ended up costing me just shy of $10,000.00Most expensive mistake of my life. And the sad thing was I had already pretty much learned my lesson and quit drinking and driving a couple years prior, but, when that little wild devil woman comes and sits on my shoulder, I just can't seem to stop myself. I was, however, fortunate that I had never been in trouble with the law before for anything somehow in my whole life (don't ask me how, cuz I sure as shit should have been! On MANY occasions). So, I was able to use my Withheld Judgement. Wrote a letter to the judge when my debt to society was paid and he wrote it off. Can't find it on the court repository, it's as if it never happened. (Unless I do it again. Then it's a felony and probably some serious jail time).Looking back on all of it, at the time I didn't think that I was ever going to get through it, but I towed the line and kept my head down and pushed forward and jumped through all their hoops, I faced my consequences and atoned for my transgressions, I knew I would be stuck in this court system loop so much longer if I f$$@ed up. I did a LOT of LSD and mushrooms that summer, it helped my body, mind, and soul tremendously. I never thought I  could live without drinking alcohol every day.

I have a few pair of decent headphones, I tried on oneplus 7 pro (one with original type c converter) as well as a good type c headset. Guess what? It's bad. Electrical signal hiss\u2026 slightly distorted treble and clarity, and bass lack of punch. I know I being a picky person here but we cannot deny that oneplus din focus on type c audio routing properly, u can even see their release NOTES for last update haha.Even when I connected my type c headset to LG (if u can recall, hifi do not support type c audio routing api) the sounds also marginally better, and it's incomparable for hifi DAC on the 3.5mm jack output...But I dun care anymore. Latest LG flagship do not bring me the stuff I've wanted except the good old Sabre DAC. That's why I changed to oneplus. I'll still use my LG v30 as mp3 player when I need something sounds good, else, I'll stick to oneplus with all the Bluetooth headset I have. At least, the Bluetooth on this phone having better signal than LG v30~\"So can I ask you guys, do you listen to the Bluetooth on anything besides headphones? Ie; in your car, home stereo system, Bluetooth speaker? I I will say that while the Bluetooth sound quality is -better- it's still bar none to the good ol headphone jack. However when I use my UE Megaboom, the difference is -undeniable-. I don't get it, same Bluetooth speaker, same downloaded songs off of Spotify, and YouTube even, 2 completely different sounds. Also, and mind you I've been at this for a while now, few months I'd say, I DID notice a SUBSTANTIAL difference when I went into the developer options and changed the Bluetooth audio codec selection from system selected to QualComm aptx HD Audio, only problem is, as soon as my screen times out, the selection reverts back to system selected. I try to enable the optional codec's, same thing, reverts back to system if the screen times out or is minimized. My assumption is that those options would only stay selected if the connecting device supported it, but then why would it be capable of sounding that good for as long as the screen was unlocked!?

So you could potentially have a phone that works perfectly fine, then a few months later, boom! Won't work anymore. And with no access to the previous owners account, you'll have no way to unlock it. So, buyer beware is my best advisement", "link_id": "t3_cd5ol4", "time": 1563135236}}

Sometimes you have to completely reset your APN's to default, and manually input those APN's again. For whatever reason, these BYOD's can periodically lose their grip on some of these settings.

Here is the support document with S7 APN's;https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-30273Now, for APN type, Samsung phones can say Internet+MMS, or default,supl,mms (this one is usually the one that works) and I have seen some people report success by changing the Bearer to LTE instead of Unspecified, but usually Unspecified works. If you are to the point of manually inputting APNs as a part of your troubleshooting, I would advise calling your team of experts tech (call TMobile press 1 to interrupt greeting and say technical support. You'll get right through) and having them do a Cancel Location to re-register your phone to the tower that you are closest to. After doing this, turn your phone completely off, not just power off and restart, completely off, leave it off for 2 minutes, and turn it back on. These troubleshooting steps nearly always resolve BYOD connectivity issues. Hope this helps!", "link_id": "t3_ccg6vw", "time": 1563053621}}

The entire process we state takes 24-48 hours, but it's typically much faster than that. There may be a short freaky Friday situation where you're still getting service on both devices, but this is very rare. Now, as a technical support representative, in have access to a more in depth coverage map than what's provided to account reps or our website. I would advise you that Montana, as it currently stands, is a low dominance area for us and you will not get great coverage in Montana. I'll actually from Alaska, (born and raised in Eagle River) and I can tell you that whole TMobile does not have an entity in Alaska, GCI and AT&amp;T do allow our customers to roam on their networks. NOW, that being said, -data roaming- is a different story. We used to have a decent partnership with these providers, until we purchased all of that low band... Now these providers see us as competition, and therefore they are paying closer attention to our customers using their towers. You can talk and text as much as you want, but you will be subject to Domestic Data Roaming rules. Meaning after 200mb, if they notice you, you'll get booted. You'll still be able to use data, but it will be like AOL dial up days. Signal quality wise you'll get coverage though, so if you don't permanently reside in Alaska, you could get away with using WiFi to download your maps and music playlists to be utilized while offline, and using your data sparingly as you are traveling. I don't currently have access to my maps (day off) so I can't answer your question about coverage in Florida, but if you call 611 and press the 1 key to interrupt the automated greeter before it transfers you to your team of experts, and say 'technical support' and you will be routed to your team of experts tech rep right away.

This was done for a couple of reasons, to protect proprietary customer information, and for lack of better terminology, to get with the times. As our towers, etc advance in technology, our servers need to update as well. Consider this as well, it's a compatibility nightmare. Different Android devices that weren't built for TMobile specifically, may show that they have certain features/functionality, but they weren't specifically built to run tmobiles technology/services, hence why we have the bring your own device disclaimer. Additionally, as new phones and technology advance, older phones end up getting left behind, as in, app and software updates are no longer supported. The issue you are having with duplicate MWI indicators is a known issue, and our engineers are working to resolve this. There was also a data breach recently pertaining to YouMail, and we will no longer be supporting linking our voicemail servers with them, for our customers security and privacy. If your primary concern is that you want to be able to press the little tape recorder button on your dial pad to access your voicemail, I would advise adding the voicemail server number, 805-637-7243, to your speed dial. Then you can still access voicemails from your dial pad. TMobile phones already have this integrated by long press and holding the #1, or by dialing 123.

{"etnpj99": {"text": "Thank GOD someone else finally notices the audio issues! It has been the bane of my existence since I got this phone. Prior to the 7 pro I had an LG V30. Sound quality was great, I rarely even had to use the High Quad DAC because the default sounded great. Move to 7 Pro, bass is flat and compressed. Vocals are pulled too far to the forefront of the track. Now I will tell you, I am a technical support representative for Tmobile. I tried EVERYTHING. Numerous 3rd party bass boosters, they helped but still weren't cutting it. I noticed the built in EQ, I was not able to actually ENABLE the built in, until I plugged in an aux cable via the dongle. The EQ was then available, for Bluetooth and aux. No matter what, still sounded like shit. Software update pushes thru, sound gets a little better, but not by much. Reset my network settings, wiped the cache partition, all to no avail.  I was ready to root the phone, when I finally decided, even though the phone was so new, to factory reset it. Sound quality improved GREATLY. I have found the best setting is \"None\" for scenario based enhancement, \"None\" for the Intelligent Styles, high on the first dB notch, stagger til the middle notch and bring it DOWN, stagger the rest. (I can attach a picture thru imgur if you'd like). Unfortunately it's almost every single song that you have to tweak the EQ on to sound good. NOW. here's the real kicker. If you study hip hop recording (because this is how far I got into trying to fix this damn problem) you'll discover that artists such as, Dr. Dre, for example, will record the majority of their tracks in MONO, NOT stereo. The stereo is added in later, and the mono is still 3/4 of the track. SO, here's where it gets tricky (er). Certain artists will sound better in stereo on this phone, and some will sound better in mono. The mono audio settings are nowhere NEAR the sound settings (settings&lt;system&lt;accessibility) try both ways, toggle mono on and off. Depending on your connections device, Rittz, for example, will sound better in mono on my home stereo, and better in stereo in my car.. Same with Yelawolf. To further complicate things, when in stereo, it's almost as if you are hearing the vocals doubled up, like one set is a nano second faster than the other, and it's annoying as fuuuuck! From track to track you will still have to adjust the bass and treble settings on your connecting device. I swear to good I'm gonna get in a wreck from trying to make my music sound good! But, it can be done, just a LOT of damn work. I wish OnePlus would address this issue and resolve it. It's making my 2Pac sound like 1Pac! Or NonePac!

{"esh0sfi": {"text": "Also in answer to your question, if you do choose to go thru this process, while a Sim card CAN be activated anywhere, even where there is no service, you would want your T-Mobile SIM card to be able to connect to a T-Mobile tower to ensure it receives all of its carrier updates and OTA activation downloads prior to taking it somewhere without a T-Mobile entity. My best advice to you then would be to ensure that your device is paid off, your account is current, and that the device shows a minimum of -40 days- of on-network (T-Mobile network)  usage prior to requesting the device be unlocked. Once it's unlocked, you are free to pop in any carriers sim your heart desires and access that carriers network with full access. We oftentimes run into customers who believe they will be able to unlock their devices while in another country no problem... This is not always the case. With WiFi? Eehhh .. sometimes? It will work. Other times? That device wants to talk to a tmo tower prior to giving you authorization to unlocking your device and taking off with it. While sadly, yes, many people DO STILL believe us Alaskans mush polar bears to work driven by Sarah Palin and that we sleep in igloos, AK is still a part of the 50 original states y'all", "link_id": "t3_c7nlas", "time": 1561977237}}

In the past, T-Mobile had agreements with GCI and AT&amp;T to allow our customers a larger amount of Domestic Data Roaming while traveling in Alaska. Due to TMobile's recent acquisition of low band spectrum and of course our drive to deliver the best and fastest LTE network to our customer base, there is of course now, a, well, a pissing match between cellular service providers. While you are absolutely free to connect and borrow off of GCI and AT&amp;T towers while traveling in Alaska, you will be subject to Domestic Data Roaming Deprioritization. We're talkin... 200mb? Max? There is no way to purchase additional domestic Data Roaming passes, as they were/are extremely costly to our customers for not even an addnl 50mb. Once you are deprioritized, you will be connected to at&amp;t or GCI's 3g (or 2g) the \"more than 50% of usage in another location\" that a previous poster had mentioned is only subject when a customer spends more than 50% of their time and shows more than 50% of their usage in another country (Canada, Mexico, etc) this is due to the fact that paying for a United States service while residing in another country comes thru the paths of many legalities, primarily, TelCel, and Rogers, etc, don't want THEIR full price paying customers to be slowed down during congestion due to people eating up all the band frequency, when they are only supposed to be borrowing while travelling through. In short, you can talk and text over GCI and AT&amp;T all you want, but data is going to be a living nightmare and a miserable experience for you. If you are intending on just traveling through, I always strongly recommend to our customers to be sure and download the maps they will need and their sweet sweet tunes over WiFi, to ensure they have everything they need in times where they will not otherwise be able to receive a T-Mobile signal. As a T-Mobile representative, we HATE to see our customers have to leave us, but you have to do what's right and what makes sense to you. As an Alaskan grown girl, I can tell you right now that GCI and AT&amp;T will probably gouge you up there (p.s. last I checked, there is still NO unlimited home wifi service in Alaska. It's all capped and it's all RIDICULOUSLY expensive, but at least you will have reliable service, AND 4g speeds. Without trying to pry, are you moving there to be stationed on base in Anchorage? (Ft Rich or Elmendorf) suspending your line for military deployment is available for much longer than we give for a seasonal suspend, or possibly repurposing the line so that a friend or family member in the lower 48 can use it?

{"eru90oe": {"text": "Well, we can't always be certain, in troubleshooting the more questions we ask upfront can more quickly help us identify the root cause, but as a general rule of thumb more often than not when it happens it's either a storage or an app issue. In your case we know the issue isn't storage, as you have plenty of available space. Now what CAN happen, however, is a 3rd party app on your device could be causing issues as it isn't compatible with the OS version you are downloading. Quickest way to rule that out is by running the phone in safe mode for a while. If the issue does not persist, you have a rogue 3rd party app on your device that needs annihilated. If it does, you may be missing certain components of your OS packet. (Think of it like missing a driver for a CD Drive on a Desktop PC) While a power off/restart is great at resetting MOST things, the only way to 100% kill the juice from the battery running through the CPU is with a battery pull.

My best advisement for the media would be to transfer it to a PC, or use Google photos for pics at least. The point I suppose I'm skirting around is that you don't want to put your Google account back onto the phone right off, as you may be re-loading the problem from a backup all over again. Remove your Google account prior to factory resetting the device. Then, instead of performing the software install OTA, plug it in to a computer via USB and download the OS that way (if possible) then, set up the device as new. Give it time to see if the issue re-presents itself or if it's completely gone. Then add your Google account, but DO NOT re add the apps from back up. Slowly start to reinstall them from the play store one by one, to make sure you're not putting yourself thru techie hell again.

We have been telling our customers to download a 3rd party messaging app like Android Messages and this seems to be resolving the issue as a temporary workaround. And, if I can level with you man, the default messenger is total garbage. I personally use Mood messenger and it is so much more customizable and user friendly than messages. Try it out, you'll have a much better experience. In reference to the group chat, you can try to have the creator of the group chat remove and re-add you, and you delete the entire conversation thread off of your device, or have the originator just start a new group chat. If you have messages you want saved you can always either lock them or screenshot them. Cheers!", "link_id": "t3_brhef0", "time": 1560811283}}

Without being connected to WiFi or a cellular network? Where did the video source come from? I would first start with accessing your application manager and clearing cache, clearing data, and force stopping Google chrome. You want to be sure your browsing history is completely removed. Secondly, I would connect to WiFi and access the play store, uninstall and reinstall all apps that are misbehaving, start with Google. Not chrome, but Google. This should update all of your framework services. Do chrome as well however. If none of the above resolve, you may want you check your video player and clear it's cache, but don't clear data. From within the app manager, select the video player, hot the 3 dots, uninstall updates and then reinstall. It's possible, too, that you need to fully wipe your cache partition. (You won't lose any personal content) lastly, and I would hate to have to be the one to crush your world, but, eventually, when a phone had been out long enough (like the Note 3) device manufacturers are simply unable to continue to support these devices, as they have to make room for the old to support the new as far as software and apps go.
