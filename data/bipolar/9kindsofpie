However, managing the \"right\" amount of alcohol was a lot of mental energy, and I was never guaranteed to keep it to a reasonable amount (4-6 drinks, yikes). I'm also slower witted when I'm hungover and, as I age, my body isn't recovering like it used to. FWIW I have only ever vomited from drinking a handful of times in my life, despite heavy drinking for 10+ years cumulatively. I've heard that if you suffer less repercussions from drinking, you're more likely to develop a drinking problem.

I'm saving my calories for dessert later. I don't like to smell like alcohol around my kids. I've got too much to accomplish tonight. I don't want to get started too early. Maybe after a water, I feel dehydrated. One drink gives me a headache. I think I feel a cold coming on. No, thanks, I don't feel like drinking tonight.

However, I'm doing a ton of research and wondering if we both have Sensory Processing Disorder, possibly by itself or in combination with ADHD.
