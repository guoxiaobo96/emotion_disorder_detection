Also, I'm in a bit of a hopelessly depressed spot at the moment so my response may read a little dreary.Mine start out pleasant. First I have a little more energy, the world is brighter, I have a lot of ambitious but healthy ideas (e.g.: actually exercising and eating healthy). After a couple days I start feeling horny ALL THE TIME. It's insatiable and uncomfortable and really distracting when I'm trying to talk to people but can't stop imagining doing them. I get pressured speech and racing thoughts. There are so many thoughts that I can't focus on one or choose any one thing to do, which usually turns into me pacing around doing nothing. Even though it's uncomfortable by this point, I always want to go higher, to take meds or substances that I know will escalate my hypomania. It's a break from the depression and, though I know the subsequent depression will be worse the higher I go, I don't want to let go of the high yet. Then I get more outlandish ideas, like shaving my head or remodeling our house in ways that don't make sense. I can't sleep and want to lay in the middle of the road at 2AM. I get more paranoid that someone is following me, sometimes thinking I hear someone whisper my name. I get really agitated and irritable with people because they move too slowly or try to slow me down, including my husband.The real kicker is whenever my hypomania starts to subside, usually because I get my meds adjusted, I get a lot of mixed symptoms. My brain screams and I feel like there are two people in my head: a hypomanic one and a depressed one. I feel hopeless but energized. It's harder for me to keep myself safe because my depressed thoughts have a motivated body.

{"eik9tp0": {"text": "(Sorry for the many words...I didn't mean to make it so long)Yep! I've been a nurse for five years. I wasn't diagnosed until last year, but I've struggled with depression since early college. Not sure when the hypomania officially started (it's more obvious when it happens now), but it's been a couple years of not being able to find middle ground in terms of mood. Nursing school is hard, even without mental illness. Everyone that does it needs to learn effective coping skills or it's hard to last. I did 12-hour rotating shifts for about a year and a half (8 weeks days, 8 weeks nights, and so on) and was ready to quit when I got a full-time day shift position. The irregular sleep schedule was really hard on the body (anyone's body, really) and made the feelings of hopelessness and suicidal ideation worse. I cried. A LOT. Acute care is a lot to deal with. It's a lot of responsibility. You see people at their worst and they're not always nice. I've been threatened and screamed at and injured by a patient. I also deal with PTSD as a result. That said, I also meet some of the most amazing people and have become a much stronger person through being a nurse. I'm in the home stretch of getting my MSN in nursing education and am planning to move away from full-time patient care. That's the beauty of nursing. There are SO many things you can do with it. Bedside care and night shift and irregular schedules aren't your only options. A lot of people start there, but it's not absolutely necessary. Still, everyone is different in terms of what is best for them, bipolar or otherwise. Bipolar just adds some extra complications and people vary in terms of how disruptive those complications are. The only reason I'm making it through my Masters program is because finishing it means I get to quit my job and move somewhere I can work part time. My wonderful meds that are giving me my life back are also making me a bit slower in the cognition department, so I don't want to be so responsible for other people's health. But I also don't want to stop my meds.My recommendation? Find some nurses in your area and shadow them. Ask them what they did to get to where they are. Then talk about it with your health care team. If you want to do it, make a plan for how you're going to manage your BP during school (meds, therapy, self care, sleep schedule, etc). Set boundaries for what type of job and schedule you are safe to work. I don't think having BP means you can't achieve your dreams.

She then set me up with an appointment to see a psychiatrist (I first saw a psychologist) who asked similar questions but with more focus on my specific symptoms than on my feelings about my childhood, etc. He told me what he thought might be going on in terms of a diagnosis and asked me if I wanted to try medication. I said yes, but that they made me nervous and I am very sensitive to even small doses. He gave me a couple options and said I'd start on half the normal starting dose, I thought about it for a few days, and then started on one. There's been a lot of back and forth since then and clarification of my diagnoses (bipolar 2 and PTSD) but the initial evals were a lot less terrifying than I had built up in my head. Once I started being honest with them it actually felt really good. Keep in mind, if you try someone out and after a few sessions you still don't feel comfortable with them, you can always try someone else.

There are many arguments to be made for and against meds, but ultimately it's about what you and your health team decide is the safest decision for you and your little babe. Personally, I currently plan to stay on some meds while pregnant (should the stars align and that happens). My pdoc asked about baby plans when we first met and has taken it into consideration as we have made med choices. Thus, for the meds I'm on and plan to stay on (there's one I'll drop when the time comes), the benefits outweigh the risks. The risk to the baby if I stay on them is a tiny fraction of a percent. The risk to the baby if I go off them is much larger because there's a high chance I won't eat, won't take care of myself, will try to hurt myself, and will do some risky shit.", "link_id": "t3_az0f6l", "time": 1552113680}}

Initially I did this just with the negative (or excessively positive) ones, but acknowledging the moments or days when I feel calm helps me accept it instead of anxiously anticipating the next storm. Right now you are okay. Embrace it. Go outside and notice the sounds and the smells that your mind usually doesn't notice because it's so preoccupied with racing thoughts and extreme moods.

{"eh0oje5": {"text": "Short answer: Do not try to diagnose anyone if you're not licensed to do so. Mental illness is a sensitive topic so I would be surprised if he didn't get defensive. Keep reading for how my husband brought up his concerns in a productive manner. My husband gently encouraged me to go to counseling for the better part of two years, during which my symptoms got progressively worse. Twice I made appointments upon his suggestion, only to later cancel them. I had poor prior experiences with counselors and, like your friend, didn't like being analyzed. Though I knew something wasn't right, I was not ready to face how wrong things were. It wasn't until I chose counseling for myself that any progress was made. That's the thing about seeing a counselor or a psychiatrist or completing any type of treatment, it doesn't do much good if you don't choose it for yourself.It was immensely helpful that my husband was supportive and nonjudgmental, even going with me to my first appointment, but if he had told me he thought I had a psychiatric disorder I would have shut him out. Shoot, I even suspected I maybe had MDD or BP2 when I went in, but I still got very upset and defensive when my psychiatrist told me I actually had BP2. It's a lot to take in. There's also a lot that goes into diagnosing any psychiatric condition. A lot of disorders have overlapping symptoms while still requiring different approaches in treatment. People should not be diagnosed by anyone not licensed to do so. I heavily caution you against telling your friend you think he has bipolar disorder. If you do talk to him, I would focus more on what is concerning you (e.g.: impulsive behaviors, not sleeping, outbursts of anger, talk of suicide, withdrawing, persistent sadness, etc). My husband's approach was to tell me it made him sad to see me so sad all the time and he was concerned because I wasn't getting out of bed and kept talking about how I wanted to die (note: if you're concerned your friend is actively suicidal, that's a whole other conversation). Honestly, what helped the most was him simply being there to listen and love me. He still expressed concerns and suggested I go see a professional, but he also made it clear he cared and accepted me no matter what. He asked what was wrong and how be could support me, and then he let me make the decision for myself.", "link_id": "t3_atel8u", "time": 1550824997}}

It's like the switch for my fight or flight response is stuck in the 'on' position. I just shy of begged him for something to help with the irritability and paranoia because I was worried I was going to lose my job over it.

Maybe a month ago I was talking to my therapist about my paranoid thoughts, about feelings of being followed and such. Then I told her sometimes I get really paranoid that my husband doesn't love me, that he's mad at me and planning to leave me. Her response was that this was not paranoia, but rather me holding on to untrue thoughts. At first these two things, paranoia and untrue thoughts, seemed to be the same thing. But I think the distinction lies in why I'm having those thoughts. When I'm truly experiencing paranoia, it's more related to my disorders (bipolar, PTSD), in which case the only thing that helps me is medication (at least that I've found so far). When it's untrue thoughts, it's more related to other things like insecurity and poor mental habits, in which case I can work through it by systematically questioning those thoughts and talking them out. I write out the thought and ask what evidence I have in support of or against it. I either find there's no supporting evidence and discard the thought, or I better understand what's bothering me so I can address it.This is my personal experience so I can't say what's true for you, but I've found ignoring my paranoia or rumination on untrue thoughts unhelpful in the long run. The more I learn about how to address the root issue, the faster I get myself out of the mental agony. If it keeps bothering you though I recommend talking it out with your girlfriend or a counselor.

So far most of the people I've told have been really supportive, but some make jokes about my tiny pharmacy.

No one understands the pain you go through as well as you do, so they don't comprehend the repurcussions of you not taking your meds, nor do they have to live with it. I've found it helpful to find others who are going through similar things (e.g.: bipolar, depression, etc). They haven't lived in my body but they are generally more empathetic and supportive, which helps me be more confident in my choices. Just because some people were born with bodies that don't require medications to function and feel okay does not give them right to mock or speak down to those who were born with bodies that do.

{"eell699": {"text": "First off, nursing school is a LOT to handle. I've been there. Especially in the beginning, I felt like I was still learning how to learn. Plus all the information felt foreign and I didn't have much context in which to put it. Nursing is also a lot but I can clock out and go home and pretend that I quit for a couple days before I go back.In terms of bipolar disorder contributing to that feeling of your brain not shutting off? Meds. My mind gets that way during mixed episodes and adjusting my meds helped just enough so that I can have a little more control over it. From there I have to either go outside (being alone outside helps me reset) or find something else to engage in (music, a fun book, a movie, squishing my dog's face). Or sleep.In terms of the school part, what helped me was writing down literally everything I had to do. I went through all my syllabi and thought of all the other life responsibilities I needed to address and made a master list. Then I broke that list down into what had to happen in the next week. What reading did I need to complete? What papers did I need to write? What tests did I need to study for? If it did not have to happen that week, it was not my problem. Then I took that week and broke everything up into days, based on how long it would take and how much time I had each day. I also put some kind of self care item down for each day, very basic things like taking a shower, buying groceries, doing laundry, taking a 20min nap. This was in part was to remind me to do them but also I like checking off boxes. It gives me a thrill :) Then when it came to each day, once I checked everything off, I was done. If I felt okay and wanted to keep going I could, but usually I stopped. Also, if I felt stuck on one thing and wasn't in the right headspace for it, I could exchange it for a task from a different day. This was a game changer for me in terms of setting boundaries on my time and making sure I did things that refueled me. It took a little practice. I also learned I didn't do well in study groups; I ended up comparing myself to the other students and it was more anxiety-inducing than anything.Nursing school, like life, is a lot to chew if you try to eat it all in one bite. Take it one day, one moment at a time. Small, digestible bites. Also, if what I just wrote doesn't help you or the thought of making those lists makes you more anxious? Ignore it.

But that helps for like five minutes because the negative Nelly in my brain counter argues. I was listening to a podcast the other day that had a suggestion though. The podcast is called Fun Therapy and the therapist guy interviews/does therapy with various musicians, authors, leaders of all sorts, etc. Anyways, in the first episode he is speaking with the Sleeping At Last artist (Ryan) who talks about going through a period of depression as well as perpetually dealing with his inner critic (i.e.: what you're referring to as self-chatter). The therapist suggests giving his inner critic a name (I forget what name they used but let's call him John) and when the inner critic keeps speaking and being mean and judgmental to literally say, \"John, stop talking. You are not allowed to talk to me that way. You need a time out. Go away.\" Call \"John\" out on his behavior. In essence he says you wouldn't let someone else keep speaking to you that way (hopefully), so don't let yourself speak to you that way either. One of my challenges is even in recognizing what I'm saying to myself. Years of being told I'm too emotional and being mocked for crying has also made me great at stuffing my feelings and trying to convince myself things are/will be okay, at least enough to put on a brave face. Of course eventually everything explodes so I'm working on recognizing earlier what I am feeling and what I am saying to myself so I can address it.

I told her I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of grief over the loss of what I thought life was going to be. I was also a very bubbly, passionate, friendly person, feeling every emotion to the fullest. Now I just feel angry and hopeless. She asked me to write out all the losses I've experienced lately and allow myself to/take note of how I feel about each one. I wrote about lost innocence, friends, what I thought my family would be. The last one I wrote was that I've lost the will to live, which is devastating. Then I sobbed for I don't know how long. That said, I'm trying to hold onto hope and the truth that knowing what the problem is means we can do something about it. Hearing that I'm not just being \"too sensitive\" or \"overemotional\" (as a character flaw, at least) and that it's not my fault that I can never seem to find a middle ground was very validating. Medication is helping me regain function. Therapy is helping me work through my grief and acknowledge the cornucopia of emotions I feel so strongly.

{"eeif91j": {"text": "One thing that helps me is to write out my thoughts. Then I go through each one and ask myself what evidence I have to support the thought. For example, common ones I have are that everyone hates me, thinks I'm terrible at everything, and that my husband is going to leave me. So then I think through interactions I have had with people to see if I can find evidence to back up those thoughts. Did they tell me they don't like me? Did they ignore me? Did they do or say anything to suggest they have any negative feelings towards me at all? Did anyone say anything negative about how I'm doing my job? Has my husband's behavior or attitude towards me changed at all? The answer is usually no to all of the above. If I can't figure it out, sometimes I'll ask people directly if I have a good enough relationship with them. I try to be blunt with my husband about it. It's not always easy, especially since I'm usually in a state of mistrust and self-doubt, but it does help. Also, I don't watch the news and avoid most social media - it feeds into the idea that the world is going to shit. My dog also helps me sort out reality when paranoia sets in.

And sometimes the types seem like two different monsters, more like comparing apples and oranges than two varietals of apples (but, ya know, both still fruit).
