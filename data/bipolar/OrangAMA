I know it's silly, but for me it feels like if I'm not doing that then I'm a failure. I've even had jobs that make me decent money and that I enjoy but still feel like if I'm not doing law enforcement then I'm not doing a real job if that makes sense. It's really crushing to have basically wasted 10 years working toward this to have my life plan and self worth to basically just be swiped away from me. I was a dispatcher before and managed fine although dispatch wasnt really for me, but mentally I always did fine and never had any problems that affected me on the job.

{"ftegruf": {"text": "The sho and police interceptor are both completely different cars.I own the police interceptor model. If your getting this one for like 3-5k than go for it, anything over that then run away.I would highly recommend getting a civilian SHO for 10-12k around 50k to 100k miles if you want a car to use for everyday. The only reason I got a police model is because it was super cheap and I use it for pizza delivery and wanted somthing I wouldn't feel bad about destroying. The sho is faster and better in every way compared to the interceptor, although they also require a bit more maintenance and are a bit pricier. But in my opinion its worth it if you really just want this car because you like the taurus.  If you just want a cheap beater then the police sedan is fine, although super fucking basic. Like literally most of them dont even have a AUX port. If you go though my comment history you will find some longer more in depth reviews of the ford taurus I recommend you read, I've owned it for about a year and a half, and have also worked in law enforcement and know them from there. If you ever have any questions when you get one feel free to send me a dmAlso a pro tip, if you get a police sedan, make sure you get one with carpet flooring and preferably a fabric back seat. If it's got a leather back seat and metal flooring it was probably used for general police use and will smell like ass, and the back seats will be disgusting. If it is all fabric it was probably used by admin. Dont belive the dealer if they tell you it was a detectives car, they say that about all of them and are lying. We dont tell people shit about who drove which car, especially since usually multiple people would use the same one.And last off all, dont be that guy and put fake antennas and shit on there.

The only thing the fpis has going for it is it shares parts with the explorer and wont flip over in a pursuit.

Be prepared to fix the transmission at some point though, they are known to break, and your going to end up needing a new fuel pump which will set you back around a grand. DONT buy one with more than 100k miles on it. If you really want this car specifically then pay 6-10 grand and buy one with 50k to 70k miles on it. If it has 100k then it probably was used for general police use, which means it will smell bad, will beat up really bad and probably have a lot of things that will need to be replaced. They sell them then because they are starting to break down. Ones at the 50k 70k mark are probably admin or detectives cars. Dont listen to the dealers, they will tell you whichever you are trying to buy was a detectives car but in reality they dont know shit. I used to work at a police department and we dont tell anyone anything about who drove what. If it has cloth back seats and flooring that's another sign its admin.If your looking for a cheap car stay away, repairs will be pretty expensive until more get retired. I would highly recommend getting the SHO model, make sure it has a back up camera and an AUX port. The AUX port will be where the glove box is, if you dont see it immediately than you dont have one. The trunks tend to leak water, make sure to clean out under the spare tire in the trunk.Also forget what you think about them being roomy, any other sedan is roomier. But they are comfortable somewhat.What you lose in MPG, room and friends you make up for in speed, the ability to scare people out of your lane and getting to work faster. when you do stupid stuff in the road like illegal u turns or accidentally going the wrong way down a one way road people will think \"oh that's a cop he is probably doing somthing important\" and wont honk.

It's important, however, to note that the foot fetishist salesclerk's perceptions aren't the ones that matter. If he thinks he's playing it cool \u2014 he thinks his perving is secret \u2014 but his customers or coworkers are creeped out by his behavior, demeanor, heavy breathing, etc., then his perving isn't secret and is therefore impermissible.\"What your doing wrong is announcing this to your co workers and customers on a public forum for customers and employees.

Parts are cheap, and will get exponentially cheaper in the coming years as police departments dump them for chargers and explorers. The fuel pump and transmission are the only things that seem to be problems among a lot of them. Those can be expensive to repair but you should only ever need to once. Water tends to get in areas, I've noticed leaks in the trunk and in a little area near the door in a few of them. Not anything major, but you will have to dry the trunk out once a year or so. They are very safe, I saw one survive a deer hit that was so hard it snapped the push bar. People have survived head on collisions, roll overs and all manner of collisions with relative safety. They tend to be basic, and there are not any after market radio options easily available to my knowledge, but they are easy to modify with forscan to enable things. They use 20MPG both city and highway in my experience. It can hold 19 gallons I belive. Overall, great car if you want a basic sedan. Everyone will stare at you and people will slow down around you.

Your relationships will probably improve because of it. Your relationships with people you dont live with are going to fade away. Your co workers are going to become your new non family social life, so don't get into a habbit of taking sides in drama, especially complaining about day shift people.

If 911 doesn't pick up dont freak out, that means everyone else is calling and the center is flooded and police are on the way. 2. Stay in place, especially if your alone and dont make noise. Put your phone in silent.3. While the shooting is still continuing Dont stay, dont try to help people, dont ask for help, the police wont help you until the shooter is dead unless you are far away from the shooting. Shouting, jumping out at or grabbing a police officer trying to find an active shooter is a good way to get shot or injured.4. Your probably not going to survive fighting against a shooter. Avoid getting yourself in a direct confrontation with the shooter, odds are you will die. If someone you know is involved in an active shooter situation and your at home/work1. Dont call the police, this includes the non emergency number. Keep the lines open for peole involved in the shooting.2. Stay tuned to the news or your departments facebook or twitter page for where the department will have a reunification area where you can meet your loved one.3. Dont go to the scene of the shooting, you will not be allowed in, all you will be doing is wasting your time and the departments time. 4. Dont call them or text them, cutting off their phone isnt going to be on the top of their mind. Just leave them be. Dont destract them.", "link_id": "t3_cyekcf", "time": 1567408642}}
