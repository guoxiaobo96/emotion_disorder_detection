With me, it manifested into having huge boundary issues- I'll take anything from anyone no matter how much it actually bothers me. I've turned into a huge doormat. I'm not a people pleaser in the sense that I try to impress people, or make things up to make them like me or anything... but I won't stand up for myself, and I try *very* hard not to upset people. If someone does show signs of being upset, I'll get so anxious I can't think and go into a kind of autopilot where I end up saying things like \"everything's fine\" and \"it's all good\" and doing what I can to calm *them* down. And I have an issue where I say sorry as a reflex. My therapist has actually spent a whole session with me having me question why I say sorry all the time and ask my self whether or not I have anything to apologize for because of it. I can't say I've had success yet because I am still going through therapy for it and I am still struggling with it, but I can definitely say its helping and I am starting to feel better. I don't even have to take my anti-anxiety meds as often anymore.If you have any questions or want to talk, I am here.

Having an anxiety disorder is a whole different monster, as it affects how well you can function and get through your day.Unfortunately people use the names of disorders to describe behaviors, and so some people seem to get confused and believe that if they have a symptom of a disorder they have the full blown disorder.As an example, I have obsessive compulsive tendencies because of my anxiety, but I do not have OCD. I can tell it is not OCD because it doesn't get in the way of my life, and I know that when I am making things neat around me to keep things clean, or checking to see if my door is locked for the second time because it helps my anxiety, that I am not \"being OCD.\" Just as I am bipolar, I hate when people have mood swings and claim they must be bipolar too because they had a very \"up and down\" day or call someone who is being moody bipolar as if it is an insult.I wish we could erase the stigmas, too.", "link_id": "t3_axvcou", "time": 1551906040}}

It is a very strange feeling. It probably is a sign that you're in a darker mentality than you are used to, for whatever reason (stress, underlying mental illness, etc.) and because you are not used to it, you aren't processing it as you.

I agree, the word for this is probably being sadistic.I had a parent who was incredibly emotionally unstable and had a I rough upbringing, mostly through my early teenage years.

In the past, I have emotionally detached from other people and their feelings, and when all the attention I could get from people was fear and anger, I ended up liking it because it was the only attention I really got. Thankfully I was able to get help and move past that, and am a very different person now. So it is possible, but it is hard.My biggest recommendation would be seeing a therapist if you could afford it, if that is something you would want to do, of course. They can help you through talk therapy, CBT, DBT, etc. and with other methods.

{"ehjytcb": {"text": "I am bipolar and have been on disability, and went through a period of stability until something happened to my meds. I am high functioning as well (unless I am switching meds or suddenly stop meds) so I hope I can help out with this.Pro- Sometimes you will NEED time off to manage those episodes because you definitely shouldn\u2019t be at work during those. I have, and a fellow coworker who is also bipolar has, and... that definitely qualifies as being too sick to work. It is awkward for both you and your coworkers, and it definitely impairs functioning which is what ultimately considers it a disability.I feel it is definitely true that it isn\u2019t like being in a wheel chair. However, I wouldn\u2019t say it isn\u2019t actually a disability just because you are high functioning and currently stable. It is more like an chronic illness that has flare ups sometimes that cause you not to be able to work.Con- I once got a job through a program that helps disabled clients find jobs- which meant having to disclose your disability to potential employers. Even though I have a very high IQ and am very able to do my job... they automatically assumed I was mentally incapable of doing most tasks. I was given less hours and given only basic tasks, and wasn\u2019t even given the chance to show that I could do anything. They didn\u2019t fully train me, and I almost feel like they assumed I wasn\u2019t worth their time. It was equally humiliating and irritating. After not scheduling me for a few weeks, I quit and decided not to disclose my disability in the future.So currently- I had to switch meds and the tapering process got messed up and I went through withdrawals, and had to go through a period of no meds, and am starting new ones. I ended up having to explain my disorder to my boss to get time off, and fortunately I didn\u2019t have to get on disability again, she just approved the time and I had hours left to use. However, if I didn\u2019t have an understanding boss and hours to use, I could have either been forced to work or potentially gotten fired for either not doing my job well enough at work or not coming in because I couldn\u2019t but couldn\u2019t get it approved.Its a hard choice.

The rushes were gone and I missed it.Now that I have been on nothing for a few months, though... I can REALLY see why being medicated was better. I missed being able to get angry because the feeling was gone, and I hated the nothing... but now I am so all over the place that I am losing sight of who I am.

But I did look at the sheet he was writing on and he had written that it was more likely BPD and had other possibilities written down.I hate that it is so hard to diagnose these things.

{"eeurh0u": {"text": "Okay so... I was on Clozaril for 13 years for bipolar 2.I was 15 at the time and I am 28 now, so its been a while since I was started on it. What I do remember about getting on in it, however, was that it was a hard process. I was knocked out from it for a few days straight. Had to be woken up to be fed, and I was so sedated I hardly remember it. It realllly knocked me out. I was constantly sleepy and it took me a long time to adjust. I had been on many, many meds before Clozaril and it was one of the heaviest, most mind-numbing meds I was put on. On top of that, it really slowed down my mind. In my opinion, way too much. Also... you can\u2019t miss doses. If you\u2019re on it... you are on it until your psychiatrist helps you wean off. You absolutely do not want to try to get off by yourself. Missing doses at all can not only be bad for your health, but you can get nasty withdrawals if you miss a few days. And remember what I mentioned about getting on it? You miss too many days and you could have to start that over again.Another point- blood draws. You are going to have to get your blood drawn A LOT. Eventually it\u2019ll only be monthly, but they need to monitor your levels because there are risks involved.HOWEVER...It really can be worth it if what you are dealing with is bad enough. It took the edge off of everything. I didn\u2019t enjoy things as intensely as I had before, but my anxiety and my highs and lows weren\u2019t as intense either.There are a lot of negatives. But if what you\u2019re going through can\u2019t be helped with lighter medication and therapy and lifestyle changes don\u2019t work... it could be worth it.Sorry that was a long post, but if you have more questions feel free to ask me more.
