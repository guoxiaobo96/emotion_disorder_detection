So I think about my mania more as a side effect of the Rx's instead of me being bipolar.I also feel like accepting diagnosis would be to excuse my behavior, but remembering what I did is like watching a movie about some crazy person. I also feel guilty because it's my thoughts and actions that are what is causing my current depression. I also feel like trying meds again would deny what God could do for my depression if I would just be faithful with my Bible study.", "link_id": "t3_eqnh21", "time": 1579402611}}
