It's REALLY EASY. He actually swears grilling is not the best method which blew my American mind.Take the steak out of the fridge and let it get closer to room temp (usually 20-30 min does the trick). Sit down and smoke a bowl while you wait. Throw a pan/skillet on the stove on high. While that's heating up rub sea salt on both sides of the steak. Once the skillet is nice and hot throw the steak on and let that side sizzle for 1:45 - 2 min depending on the thickness of the cut and how bloody you like it. Then flip that over and cook the other side for the same amount of time. I like mine pretty rare so I usually stop here but you can put in in the oven on 325* (literally pop the pan/skillet right in) for 2-3 min. Sprinkle a little more salt on top and have your mind blown by how easy that was and how amazing your steak is. I usually get a nice rib eye. Get some olive oil, green beans and minced garlic saut\u00e9ing in another pan while you cook for a full dope experience.Hope that helps! Once she sees how happy it makes you she will hopefully make it a regular dinner!", "link_id": "t3_1j8izt", "time": 1375102910}}

Now I'm laid back, accepting and an all around nice person to be around. I give old ladies my seat on the subway, open doors for strangers and let people do their thing whether I agree with it or not.Also I make it a point to get to at least a [6] on a daily basis.
