Usually my intention in my spells is to help someone, for example I spent a whole day preparing my ingredients and drawing a large pentagram on my floor to execute a spell meant to cure my friend\u2019s depression. I burn candles and see meaning in the melting wax. I decipher messages from the shapes of clouds that I believe to be sent by the source of magic.

It sounds terrifying to witness your child in such distress. I can relate to your point about not recognizing anxiety right away in kids- I work with children and had a long one-on-one relationship with a child who had selective mutism and generalized anxiety. Her anxiety presented as stomach pain. She had been through many rounds of doctors trying to figure out her stomach pain before her family was able to connect it to the psychiatric aspect. I\u2019m so happy to hear that your daughter is doing better with the medicine, and again I am deeply impressed by your decisions.

{"ey1hk1t": {"text": "Everyone experiences it differently, but in general people with bipolar disorder have periods of depression (most people understand this. You feel like shit.) and hypomania or mania (more difficult to understand). Its hard to live with because you\u2019re not in control of when these mood episodes happen, and when they do life goes off the rails a bit until the symptoms are back under control. My experience is a fairly reliable pattern. I have a hypomanic or manic period of a few weeks, where I feel pretty great usually but also very irritable when things go wrong. I have so much energy, a literal bounce in my step. That is followed by weeks/months of suicidal depression. Then I have a couple weeks/months of baseline mood. I can make these baseline periods longer with good self care and medication, but I can\u2019t make my mood episodes go away.  When I get depressed its a struggle to keep myself and my life together on a daily basis. The progress I have made in my life during my period of baseline mood slowly slips away unless I work really hard to maintain it. More dangerous for me tho is mania. If I were to let myself become manic and not get help from a doctor I would destroy my life quickly with irrational decisions, explosive anger, and massive overspending.
