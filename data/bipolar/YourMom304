We smoked on Tuesday night, Wednesday he got called for a job interview for a job he had applied for a LONG time ago. He interviewed on Friday and had to go in a few days later for a drug test. He had never been drug tested for a job in his industry before. It was soooo fucking scary and stressful. LUCKILY he passed, but this job was a big step up for us and it could have not happened because he smoked pot once in his life. Like what the fuck.

{"e7s0thv": {"text": "I'm so glad you wrote this out, it gave me a lot to think about. When I was in high school my awful psychiatrist sort of threatened to diagnose me with BPD if I didn't stop cutting myself. He laid it on thick about how this is the worst diagnosis and it follows you so he didn't want to put it in my chart but he would. I remember thinking well, the meds for depression don't help so maybe I do have BPD and if so, put it in my chart and treat me. He never did, but as I got older and my mental illness progressed I did a lot of reading on BPD and definitely fit the symptoms. I didn't have insurance so I never got treatment or a diagnosis. I did do a DBT workbook when I was 22 and that was a huge turning point for me. I had not realized before that I could control my emotions, and the workbook gave me some skills that really changed my life.After I did the workbook and practiced the things I had learned my symptoms decreased over the years until, like you, I don't meet the diagnostic criteria. But it's confusing since BPD is usually known as a lifelong illness, so what did I have? I brought it up with a therapist who told me that I definitely don't have BPD now and therefore never did. My dad has bipolar disorder and was untreated when I was growing up. He's medicated now but his bipolar is not well managed and I don't really trust him not to lash out. My mom has some undiagnosed personality disorder. These combined resulted in a very tumultuous home environment, so the FLEAS/CPTSD angle makes a lot of sense.ETA: though my experience growing up with mentally ill parents was traumatizing, I have several friends and have seen many moms on reddir with bipolar who are amazing parents. That was mind blowing to me at first, but it has completely changed my perception of people with bipolar. My dad was a bad example for sure.", "link_id": "t3_9o1pwl", "time": 1539561193}}

I still vividly remember a cake we got from the food pantry when I was around 10 years old. When I got my first job at 16 I spent a lot of my money on food. I was also suffering from depression and the combo lead to a lot of weight gain. I was able to lose weight to a normal BMI when I moved out of my parents' house and my stress levels decreased, but I still struggled with binge eating, for years and years. When I had my son I gained all the weight back that I had lost and then some because it's extremely stressful. Plus like you said, we're broke and junk food is a cheap luxury. I'm finally digging myself out from under this weight again by following a diet similar to food addicts anonymous, and I've cut all sugar and flour out of my diet, which has given me some insight into the way I use food as a drug to cheer myself up, deal with stress, reward myself. I haven't binged in over a month. I'm spending more in groceries up front because I'm eating massive amounts of fruit and vegetables daily, but I'm not going out for ice cream, buying snacks, buying takeout, so we are saving money overall.I'm hoping that over time I will lose the urge to eat for every feeling I have.

{"e55tkud": {"text": "He has emailed the head of HR, and is waiting to hear back. He is working his simmer job today and now even more than ever we can't forefit that money.They said that today's pay was the final amount to complete last year's salary, and that next pay period is the first 5 days of the new school year, that usually those two things fall together in a check but the mistake was that they fell in separate weeks. I seriously don't understand why they don't just divide his salary by 26 since he gets paid biweekly (I think they DO, but we have to wait to get his check stub to look at YTD plus last year's pay, last year was his first year so it will be easy to see if he got his entire salary or not). I am very confused about this whole thing and don't feel confident that it will be fixed.My husband is looking for a better job. This job pays a low salary and he has a masters degree so he should be making more. He struggles wuth anxiety which had held him back, but he's been making some progress and is applying to teaching jobs and other jobs that pay more.", "link_id": "t3_9btw3f", "time": 1535730067}}

{"e55rg12": {"text": "I have looked into WFH options online, but have yet to find something that actually pays a decent amount. I have yet to find anything local, just what's available online, and as far as I have seen those things are not paying much. We have to be careful about making just a little bit extra but not enough to make a difference because we qualify for WIC and lower cost health care now (our son is on Medicaid and we each pay $20/month) and we are near the threshold for that. Last year because I was working we didn't qualify but we couldn't afford the insurance on the marketplace so we had to pay a $1,400 penalty at tax time and we have to make sure that doesn't happen again. I do have a business that had started to gain some traction earlier this year but I had to put on the back burner while I dealt with getting some diagnosis and interventions lined up for my son who had some special needs. He starts part time pre k next week, 2.5 hours each day, so I'm going to use that time to hopefully pick up where I left off with my business and start generating income. There's no guarantee though.I'm also looking for a FT job that pays a little over minimum wage. There aren't a whole lot of entry level position where I am, but I send resumes anyway for any full time positions I see that I would be capable of doing, even if I don't meet every qualification. Like I said, my son has some special needs so he needs to be transported to therapy a couple times a week and to preschool, so I would have to make enough pay someone to care for him and get him places as well as insurance and then something leftover after that to put towards bills and savings. I'm chugging along with resumes and keeping us strict on our budget for the time being, and full day kindergarten is on the horizon, which will be a game changer for us. My husband is searching for a more lucrative job as well. I am trying really hard to focus on the fact that our cushion saved our ass for rent. I just needed a moment to let my panic out. Seeing that lower amount and then finding out that it would be lower again in two weeks really triggered my anxiety.", "link_id": "t3_9btw3f", "time": 1535728258}}

{"e4vtzwn": {"text": "I truly considered bringing my son to the fire station and leaving him there when he was 3 or 4 months old. I had severe PPD and I felt like I was drowning. He was VERY clingy and colicky and I felt like I could never catch my breath. I did take medication for PPD which took the edge off.He is four now and was recently tentatively diagnosed with ADHD, Sensory Processing Disorder, anxiety and Oppositional Defiance Disorder. I wish I had reached out for an evaluation earlier, but I just didn't realize that his behavior was a neurological thing. He has no gross motor or speech delays so it wasn't  immediately obvious even to his doctor. I thought I was a fuck up and was messing up this whole parenting thing. I read all the books, articles, forums, tried everything, and still felt like it was my fault. It turns out he needs some help. He's starting special ed services in September and there's a light at the end of the tunnel.Even with these issues, it is MUCH easier than when he was an infant. We have more good times than bad. I am so glad I got some help for my PPD to get me through those really hard times. I suggest you reach out to your primary doctor or OBGYN and ask to be screened for PPD. Also, if your child continues to be so difficult check into having them evaluated with your local school district to make sure it isn't something more than temperament.", "link_id": "t3_9agkpp", "time": 1535320229}}
