{"fk6i9be": {"text": "This will be buried, but might as well tell the story while I have a chance. I've worked for a small chain pet store for the past 2.5 years. I started out as a sales associate, but the coworker I'll be talking about today was hired on at the same time as me, but he was a keyholder. This guy was shady as I don't know what. At first, he seemed like a good worker, did what the managers told him to do, sold enough product that he'd be making bank if we had been paid commission, etc. Then, after a few months, things started going downhill. I worked with him the most during the evening shift, when there's only a manager and an associate in the store. He'd get lazy sometimes in the evenings and throw the work he didn't want to do on top of me. I'd do it, and it taught me how to become a better worker, but I'd always get the stuff he was told to do, but didn't want to. Since it was only the two of us there during those times, I was supposed to be the person to run out and get his lunch, but he insisted on going, while I was stuck at the store with no way to process returns because I didn't have a manager code at the time. He was told multiple times to send me to get his lunch instead of me going. He got his own lunch until he quit. He also was a pathological liar, and everything that he messed up on, when the managers asked for his side of the story, I was always to blame. It got to the point where they'd ask me what happened and would know I was telling the truth because of how over exaggerated his stories were. The one that boils my blood the most is we got a counterfiet $100 bill once. I asked him to double check it because something seemed off about it and he just glanced at it and said it was fine. When it was discovered that we had taken a counterfeit because he told me to, he threw me under the bus and said I never asked him about anything and it was my fault. He'd also make shit up when trying to sell stuff to customers. There were a couple times he was supposed to open the store, but didn't show up until the middle of the day. When our groomers showed up, they'd have to call the store manager and get him to come in since their first appointment was when the store opened. Then there's why he left. He came into the store acting funny, staring off at a bag of dog food for a literal 5 minutes, before the assistant manager told him to go home. He seemed like he was high and apparently sat in his car for a good two hours after being told to go home and sleep it off. The assistant manager said he came back into the store after those two hours to, \"Use the bathroom,\" and then just left. The assistant manager found a red envelope afterwards with his keys inside and a note that said, \"I quit,\" with his name signed at the bottom. After he quit, we did inventory and our stock was super off on certain brands of dog food; on hands would say we'd have 10 bags when we only had 3. There was a guy he knew that came in the store and was always tight on money, so it's believed he was giving them away without payment. One thing that the managers finally addressed was the former keyholder would be at the store for over an hour after we close, when most of us get out of there in 15 mins. I also learned then that he blamed me for a lot of shit that could have gotten me fired if they weren't understanding and hadn't asked for my side of the story. Four months after he quit, I ended up with his position so that was a plus. I've now been there the longest other than the store manager and assistant manager, and I've been told on more than one occasion that I get more shit done since the last guy.", "link_id": "t3_fghdvd", "time": 1583902939}}

{"fhv4l09": {"text": "Like I said in the response I made, it essentially looks better in person. It's hard to photograph at the angle it is on my arm which is probably why it looks bad; let alone, me photographing it myself. The guy has done all my tattoos, every single one. I also had it done yesterday so it's swollen from it being on a sensitive part of my skin so the lines probably look worse than they actually are. On top of that, it was a design based off of a patch; I told him, I wanted to keep the exact shape of the coffin, the scythe, and the scroll with the words. There were two roses on the coffin in the original design, so I had him take them out and instead wanted them coming from behind the coffin. I told him to let loose on the rest because I trust him. In the end, it matters whether or not I like it as it's permanently embedded in my skin. Like I said, I'll post a picture when it heals and probably have someone else photograph it under better lighting.If you want to see the other work he's done on me, I'd be more than happy to link some pictures of those.", "link_id": "t3_f4reii", "time": 1581893302}}

The only thing that really didn't follow the linework was the scroll looking a little more ragged than the design, which doesn't bother me. I wasn't expecting it to be perfect, but I still think it looks good despite the flaws. Another thing that may make it look wonky is the way I took the photo and the fact that I just got it done yesterday and it's pretty swollen. It's on a weird part of my arm so I had to bend it to show it off in photos, hence why it's taken in two parts. Like I said, despite the flaws, I like it.

My former manager gave the girl some toys out of the lost and found bin that we had in the back and sat in the office with her for about an hour before they realized that no one was coming to claim her; that's when they called the police. Another hour mins go by. No one still shows up, the cops are on their way with a social worker when the family finally comes back in trying to take her with them, but my coworkers honestly weren't letting them. The couple had other kids with them so it wasn't a case of the parents just being out and forgetting that they didn't leave their children with a babysitter. I don't exactly remember how the story ended, but I think social services ended up taking in the child and the parents were questioned by police about why they left their child abandoned in a store for so long.

My mother avoided divorce papers by giving my father fake addresses and moving to another state. She came back two years later when her baby daddy was arrested and brought back. Their divorce took place after she came back and was finalized when I was 6. The trauma I endured from her leaving caused me to not remember anything from this time. My father had full custody of my sister and I until we became adults. I learned part of the story of why she left when I was 9. She told me her side first and then I later asked my dad for his side because at the time, while I trusted my mother because she was my mom. She told me she fought for custody of us while my father left that part of his story out. When I was 11, my mom tried to get me to move in with her. She kept telling me that she'd buy me a phone and it'd be great and we'd always have a fun time with almost no rules and I thought that was great because my father had a verbally abusive wife and to a 11 year old, rules suck. I never brought it up to my father because I was afraid he'd get upset with me. When my mother wanted to take the whole thing to court and told my father that I had expressed wanting to move in with her, he shut it down and asked why she wanted me to move in and he made a remark that stuck with me for a while. My mother slept all the time when my sister and I visited her every other weekend. That remark ate at me for months and late one evening when she was asleep, I went looking through her file cabinet where she kept important documents. I found copies of letters she had wrote to her lawyer along with the divorce papers and while I didn't understand what the papers themselves meant, the letters I could clearly read. She wrote a letter to her lawyer telling him clearly that she didn't want custody of my sister and I and that our father could have us. She said he could have full custody, but she still wanted to see us on the weekends and one day a week (every weekend turned to every other, and that one day a week lasted for less than a month). I stopped trusting my mother's word after that and that's kind of a good thing.

{"f0ura6u": {"text": "There's a longstanding history between my mother and I. To make a long story short, she abandoned my sister, father, and I when I was 4 to run off with other men and essentially became a deadbeat. Wasn't required by the state to pay child support until I was 6 because she kept running from my father's divorce papers by moving to a different state and giving him the wrong address; didn't contact us at all until right before she moved back because her baby daddy was arrested and brought back to where we're from. I've been disowned 2 times, I've had things thrown at me in her bipolar rages, I've seen her off her meds, I've had her beg for my own money with the excuse she'll pay me back when she blows her disability on stupid shit and cigarettes, and I've seen her make numerous bad life choices. I am the oldest, and only child out of three who will talk to her and right now, that's not often at all. My sister hasn't had a conversation with her in over six years and my half sister, the only child my mother has raised, up and left my mother's house one day and is out on the streets doing drugs and acting stupid at the age of 15; my mother hasn't even tried to get her to come back. Six months ago, my mother's car was stolen. She was letting some dumbass drive it, saying she was going to sell it to him (even though it wasn't even in her name), and he took off with it one day. She had no transportation whatsoever. She was scared to tell her ex-fiance that the car was stolen though he was paying the insurance and had the title. A month later, she stops paying her bills. When I finally contacted her to see if she ever informed her ex about the predicament, she slams me in the face at 3 am that she's being kicked out of her house. I went up there a couple days later to help her get things that were sentimental (stuff that she absolutely does not need immediately) to her (and partially to me since she lost my baby stuff in an unpaid storage bin two states away). I told her I'd hold on to the things and would only bring them back if she followed two rules. One, she had to be back in her medication because I can't be around her when she's not; she had told me when I went to her house to get her stuff she was off of it. Two, she had to have her own place because she was moving in with her uncle and aunt. I wanted her to prove that she was responsible and not being stupid.  This happened in May. Every few weeks, she'll message me and ask for me to bring her, her stuff when she hasn't followed those two rules that I set. She offers to give me money, but I know I'll never see it (due to her inability to spend it wisely) and at that point, it's not the almost 1.5 hour drive it takes to get up to where she lives now (her old house was 30 mins away). Her last message last night is the equivalent of her throwing a temper tantrum because she isn't getting her way. If she texts me, her final correspondence usually ends in some bullshit, sappy, \"I love you so much.\" Her using my actual name is the same as her calling me a bitch, or saying fuck you. She only contacts me when she wants something anyways.", "link_id": "t3_d6oraq", "time": 1568948423}}

She disowned me a few times as well. When I got my first job at 18 and we started talking again, I'd offer to buy her a pizza or a pack of cigarettes if I was feeling generous, but it was still coming out of my pocket. She begged me for a pizza one day and I had it delivered to her house, though she lived less than a block away from the place (an extra $2.50 for delivery) because she didn't have money for gas and was too lazy to walk. She didn't pay me back until three months later, and when she handed me the money, she said, \"Don't ask me for it again,\" as if I had been the one begging her for money.

The other things mentioned in the question such as simple cooking was an elective for Family and Consumer Sciences (once known as home education), but it was hard to get in that class with the demand. Physical and mental health were mentioned in the health classes, but when you're 13/14 years old you don't think about it much.

My father luckily is a nice man, but his wife is the complete opposite. I didn't get my license until after I graduated high school, turned 18 two weeks later, and then didn't get a job until a couple weeks after that. We lived 30 mins away in the boonies; getting anywhere took a little over an 1/8th a tank of gas to get there and back. My dad had to sneak me gas money before I got a job because they made to go out and ask for applications when most were already online. Being thrown to the wolves sucked. I could live in the house, but I was expected to follow their rules. I had to buy my own food (which my stepmother and her son ate), and would get screamed at if I ate anything that my father paid for; he gave me a place to hide my food after a while. I couldn't stay out late, and she'd stay up if I missed my curfew despite letting my father know that I would be a little late. I had to keep everything spotless and if I didn't, despite trying to juggle college and work, she'd tear my room apart, making my so called \"mess\" worse and giving me more work to do. I left a little before I turned 19. I met my current boyfriend and almost immediately moved in with him and his dad; they knew what situation I was living in though. I couldn't take the verbal abuse anymore and when she got in my face at every little thing. To this day, I fear that I'll wake up in a room with pristine white walls and a tacky pink carpet and all of the past 3 years have been a dream and I'll be back in that nightmare.

She smokes to this day like a damn freight train. She's about a 2 pack a day smoker. When I came back from her house, I was always sick, hacking and coughing. My sister wasn't as bad as I was and despite our efforts of me complaining and my father telling my mother how sick I was after those weekends, she just didn't care. My therapist and I have agreed to this day that she only cares about herself, but that's a long story of our history together. Just to put some in perspective, she had three kids; she didn't smoke when pregnant with me, she smoked for a couple months during her second pregnancy, and smoked the whole time while pregnant with my half sister. At 18, I bought my first pack, which was a stupid decision. Despite it making me sick in the past, I didn't have any issues while smoking. Like my father, I was very respectable about it. If there was a child around, I'd go outside. When my best friend got pregnant and she didn't have a car, I'd drive her around to run errands or to appointments; I wouldn't smoke in the car or around her because to me, it seemed super rude. While I did quit for four months, I did pick up cigarettes again a few weeks ago and I'm in the process of trying to quit again. I smoke around my kids, whenever I have them, because I remember those weekends with my mom; I couldn't put them through that suffering of feeling sick all the time.

My scars aren't very visible due to my choice of weapon, but whenever I get a tan in the summer from driving or just being out in the sun, they start to slowly show.

I was having rapid mood swings and I blacked out while in the shower and when I came back to reality, I was sitting at a desk, with a torn up wrist. I was very upset.\u00a0Today, I went and got a tattoo. My original plan was getting a flower to cover up these barely visible scars, but then I fell in love with getting a ghost and possibly doing a Halloween related sleeve. The ghost and its rose have a very significant meaning though.\u00a0The ghost, is the \"ghost of my past\". It signifies my history with my mental illness and the harm I caused myself. Red roses mean love, and the rose itself stands for how I had to learn to love myself again after that dark time. The thorns, of course, are how rough that road was.\u00a0I've fought my mental illness for a long time since I was diagnosed young. I turn 21 tomorrow; I never thought I'd make it this far.

Whenever we get in a shipment of baby beardies, they all go together in a 20 gal tank. We used to get up to five at a time, but now our store orders 3 for this reason. Poe, my female, came from that store. I originally wasn't planning on having two bearded dragons as I was content with one, but I came into work one day to find her badly injured. Since we weren't getting tanks for us to sell with them, we weren't selling the dragons. The other four were a lot bigger than Poe and as she appeared to be the runt, no bigger than my middle finger, they started nipping at her. When I found her at the store, a piece of her tail was black, as well as one of her back feet; her back foot was so bad that her toes were just dangling from it and one fell off when I picked her up. I took Poe home. She lost her foot and small portion of her tail a couple of weeks later. She gets around fine, but from her injuries and me having to methodically put medicine on them until those pieces fell off, it made her very aggressive and it took a couple of months before I could get her to fully trust me. Poe has been with me since September of 2018. She gets around fine, but she's a testemant of why dragons shouldn't cohabitate.

In October, it was late one evening where the store had been busy my whole shift, it'd finally slowed down and I went to clean the cats when I found her. She was in the bottom cage, curled up in the corner, one eye shut and looking grumpy as could be (even the card for her said she was grumpy looking). She was super skinny like she'd been underfed and you could feel her hip bones. I instantly fell in love. My boyfriend and I already had two at the time, but I couldn't leave her there. The shelter was full at the time, so they dropped the fee to $5 and I filled out the paperwork and took her home. She had a cold and the reason why her eye was shut is because it was sealed due to infection. Some eye drops took care of that and she was healthier within a few days. She's a smaller cat, but she grew to be loving and picked my boyfriend as her favorite person in the house. She likes to wrestle with our 12 lb male and they do flips and roll around on the floor playing with each other. She snuggles up to my 6 year old calico and she's basically been adopted as her child.

{"erct1nd": {"text": "I grew up in the middle of the woods next to a state park so my family and I have seen a few weird happenings. My dad a few years before I was born was coming back from deer hunting late one evening. We owned a large amount of acreage so he had went pretty deep into the property. It was night by the time he was almost home when he heard rustling in the woods. He said he turned his flashlight over to the bushes and saw glowing eyes attached to a very large figure. The figure was much taller than him and it turned and ran away. He swears Bigfoot is out there after that experience. My cousin worked at the state park which was only about a 3 minute drive from my house. There was a big lake with a beach and it was chained up around the 6-8ft point. You could go further out to around 20 ft if you knew how to swim because there was a dock with a slide and s diving board. A teenager went out there one day just spending some time at the beach with his family and tragically drowned. The beach was shut down for about a week after the incident for investigation and retraining for the lifeguards. A couple days though during one evening, my cousin had to work pretty late. He was a maintenence guy and he was trying to fix one of the restrooms down towards the beach. One of his co-workers came in and told him that there was a light shining over the lake like a lantern and their boss wanted them to take one of the canoes to check it out because that part of the lake had been closed off with ropes with floats on them due to the incident. They thought someone was fishing on a boat and they were going to have to ask the person to leave. They canoed out towards the light and when they were about 100 ft away, they called out to where the light was coming from, telling the person they couldn't be there. They didn't receive a response so they went closer, calling out again. After their second attempt at yelling, the light went out suddenly. They pulled out a flashlight and shined it around (because all they had was a lantern light beforehand) and they didn't see anything. There was no boat, no canoe, and it wasn't like the person could escape in a matter of seconds. He still tells me that was the most unsettling thing to this day.

Finally, as an older cat, he was picked up and taken to the pound. The SPCA transferred him to us for adoption, but tragically discovered that this bobtail, Burmese mix is FIV positive. Now he needs an understand, loving home willing and able to care for him during his golden years; someone to show him how good life can truly be. I've spent a few days with Willy Wonka and he's super sweet. He's not a fan of dogs, but he'll love and adore you. When you pet him, he just kind of flops over and let's you pet his belly.

I was standing outside my workplace in 24 degree (F) air, shivering just to get a fix. I would walk from the middle of the parking lot to the doors of my school and be out of breath before I got to the stairs; I'm 20 years old, it was horrible. Peppermints were what helped me. I replaced the heaviest parts of the day where I Juuled (like driving) with a Lifesaver peppermint. Whenever I wanted to take a hit, peppermint. I still use the method two months later, but I definitely don't need them as often as I did. Also, if you just kind of let them rest in your mouth, they last 40 mins to an hour easily. Also, don't see relapsing as a failed attempt, think of it as another step closer to quitting. I caved and bought a pack of smokes the first time I quit after two weeks.

She doesn't have a check book or a debit card, but she's been known to take the credit cards, of just giving her name if they have a store card somewhere, and just racks it up. She tries to have yardsales with the things she purchase and never wore every couple of years, but she racks the prices up too high and donates them all so my family loses hundreds a year. It's good for the people they get donated to though, but it's a lot of money. As for why she was invited to everything. Sometimes she was sometimes she wasn't. Most of the time she was invited to keep the peace, but she acted up and we'd get upset. She came to my grandmother's that Christmas because it was to keep the peace and we didn't know about the gifts that were left at the time. It wasn't like my stepbrother got nothing at all either.

{"egqs7d0": {"text": "I've had a couple of ways with coming to terms, and how to prevent myself from getting out of control, but I have to explain what's happened in my previous relationship and my current one. My ex and I were together for four years. The first two, I was undiagnosed, but was being treated for severe anxiety and depression. They diagnosed me with BP2 when I was 16 and I was doing my own thing, but I wasn't fully in control of what I was doing. I was very manipulative in ways that I fully regret now and from knowing I was that way, I've had to stop myself at times now and actually think about my actions before I do something. My ex and I both tarnished our relationship heavily. I was again, being manipulative, cheated on him a couple of times, and I'd pick unnecessary fights on occasion. He, on the other hand, didn't care enough to listen to me when I talked about my illness, didn't try to calm me down when I was freaking out, and worst of all for my mental health, he was emotionally and physically abusive. I left him two years ago and started dating my current boyfriend. Communication is key for any relationship, but it's very important whether you're having your own issues to deal with or you SO is also dealing with issues in their life. My current boyfriend is a recovering alcoholic with a year and a half of sobriety. He went into rehab not long after we started dating and being 19 and never exposed to anything pertaining to that, I learned a lot in that short time since I went to a family program that his rehabilitation center offered. That's where I learned about the importance of setting boundaries and we've both done that when it comes to our situations. For example, if he's upset or angry about something, he prefers for me to be quiet and let him do his own thing (usually he sleeps it off); if I don't, it usually makes him more upset. A boundary that I've had to set is since I suffered some emotional trauma from my ex, my boyfriend can't raise his voice at me in an aggressive manner or it causes me to shut down and have flashbacks among other issues. The main thing I've found though is just to take a step back when I know I'm going to start unnecessary issues to my relationship and think about what I'm about to do. I question the actions before I put them into affect, but I've also been on a regular schedule of the same meds for the past few of years so I'm not as unstable as I was in my previous relationship; I'm better now, just not completely stable. I think twice about fussing over the fact that he didn't text me during his lunch break (yes, I have caused a fight like that in the past with my ex) because I know that that's not something serious that needs to be brought up and discussed heavily. I know I get super heated in arguments, but that's mostly because in the past, I had to go into fight or flight to protect myself with the ex. Do I sometimes go through with things without thinking? Yes, but my boyfriend understands my illness because he's actually sat down and listened to what I've explained about it and how he can help me in ways. So, just to make a short conclusion, boundaries are important to set, trying to think about your actions helps a lot if you can, and just finding someone who will listen and communicate with you is very important into coming with terms that sometimes your illness can greatly affect your life.  I wish you best and hopefully you can find someone today that'll listen and take care of you in the way that my boyfriend has with me. ", "link_id": "t3_artuto", "time": 1550513720}}

I left him three days after that, started dating my current boyfriend a month later. I understand the horror of the alcohol and drug enabling though; that's awful. My boyfriend went into rehab not long after we started dating for alcoholism, but he wasn't anything like my ex even when he was drunk. He has a year and a half of sobriety now and I wouldn't risk it for the world because I made a vow while he was away that I wouldn't drink in my life.

My ex boyfriend got him for me because I wanted a Betta fish and at the time, I was a total newbie and didn't know as much about him as I probably should have. He taught me a lot of things about the proper care of Bettas. He was a tiny thing when I got him with fins that looked like he'd been attacked at one point and I struggled with his fins for quite a while in his life. As I said, I was a total newbie. I bought him a 1.5 gal tank from Walmart with some fake plants, but browsing forums such as this one here helped me learn more about the proper care and I wanted him to live a long and happy life so I made changes to my tank to insure that. He grew quickly, his scales ended up with a dark outline around them and his white turned so a sort of tan color. His fins finally started growing back out and he turned into a beautiful Betta. He helped me a lot with my anxiety as I kept his tank in the bottom of a bookshelf and when I'd have panic attacks, he sit there and swim back and forth in front of his tank until I calmed down. Yukine passed a year and a month after I brought him home from ammonia poisoning. I made a mistake with the tank which resulted in his demise and I was absolutely heartbroken. I had purchased a 10 gal for him just days before his death, but I hadn't gotten a chance to set it up since I was working long hours. My other fish ended up with the tank in the end. While I was never able to give him the freedom I wanted to, I still cherish his memory. I buried him under a dogwood tree in my parents yard, right outside my bedroom window and a little over and a year and a half after his death, I got a tattoo on my thigh as a memorial to him. Three years ago today, he was the fish that started my hobby and I'll never forget what he taught me and how he helped me. SIP Yukine, you'll always be remembered as my sweet first boy.

I mostly hung out with a small mixture of an outcast group in high school where we had band kids, tech geeks, socially awkward people, super smart people, LGBT students, etc. A lot of us were made fun of since we lived in a conservative, mainly redneck and farmer community. A majority of us had some mental health issues such as depression and severe anxiety, but I was the only bipolar person out of the group and the one who became a huge mental health advocate. I guess we all fell into some similar categories in a way. I graduated 3 years ago in May and I keep up with a few of them still, but I've had issues with making friends in new areas besides coworkers and I moved an hour away from my hometown. I've noticed that I do relate a little more with people who suffer from similar issues as me, but that hasn't stopped me from talking to people who fit into many other groups, whether or not I'm able to become friends with them. I don't really know anyone else who is bipolar besides people in my family. I think one reason I relate a lot to people with similar issues is because they understand in a way what I deal with and I do like to help people who feel like they have to stay in the dark because of their illness because some think that they're \"damaged goods\" so to speak. I'm open about it so I can help others in a way. I'd like to make more friends besides the ones I had in high school since I only know a couple of people in my college classes who I can consider as friends, but I'm really socially awkward in situations and I tend to over share all the time.

I though, am very open about my bipolar for multiple reasons because I use it to show that my diagnoses is not entirely a label and to show that despite what I have can be a hindrance sometimes, I'm able to function in society like every other capable person. For example, I have a part time job, I'm currently in college, I have friends who I am very close with and go out to hang out with, I can take care of the things around me such as my bills and other necessities. I'm not trying to say that someone who has bipolar and can't have a job for any sort of reason is any less of what I'm capable of because they're not. My mother is bipolar and is on disability and she can take care of herself as well as I can despite also dealing with almost identical issues as me. She keeps her house in nice shape, she makes homemade meals often, etc. She also keeps in close contact with her friends and despite me and her both having bad days, we know we have things to take care of and we drag ourselves out of bed each morning. We all have different personalities and things that we need to do and while having a mental illness can cause some bumps in the road, you can still function with them. I became an advocate for people who are afraid to come out because of the stigma. I'm open about my disorder and how I'm feeling and while I've been having a rough time lately, I don't let that stop me. I've found that being open about it with my coworkers, teachers, peers, friends has helped quite a bit as I tell them how they can help me not get anxious or what days that I'm not doing great so that they know that I'm having a tough time and if they want to talk with me about it they're more than happy to. I can't say that I'm dealing with a total success story and I'm stable and that everything is all sunshine and rainbows because it's not.

Also, not everyone can even get their tongue pierced due to the placement of a person's veins.

A regular piercer will put a metal bar in your tongue so for a small bit, you're a risk for biting on it and maybe chipping your teeth. When I was 8, I hadn't even lost all of my baby teeth so I can't even imagine being in the process of losing a tooth and getting the tongue bar caught where the tooth is falling out. A child would play with it while it's healing an afterwards, it'll migrate due to that. Also, there's a possiblity that the mother would keep a metal bar in the child's mouth and that'll lead to her teeth chipping. Acrylic balls are likely to prevent that and if you bite down hard enough, they'll crack.

My boyfriend is a smoker himself and while I did have some issues in the beginning, I stupidly decided to pick up a cigarette one day and I've been addicted since. Whenever I have kids of my own, I plan on quitting. I assume my allergy may return and I'll end up getting sick again, but it's better for my kids not to grow up with what I did with my mom because I honestly don't know how it'll affect them as it did me. Back to the respecting my coworker thing, I think people who do smoke around their children don't respect their safety in a way. Secondhand smoke can cause may problems with kids, especially those with asthma or breathing issues. Smokers know what the effects are to themselves, I personally know with heavy breathing and the occasional coughing fits. Kids can have the same effect with breathing it in; I grew up with it as well. ", "link_id": "t3_afj52w", "time": 1547424970}}

As for a little google research for which ones are toxic for dogs, here's what I found. Cinnamon, citrus, pennyroyal, peppermint, pine, sweet birch, tea tree (melaleuca), wintergreen, and ylang ylang scented oils are poison to them if digested or put on their skin.

He's never done this before, but he does have a tendency to fall asleep on my shoulder when I have him out so should I put something in his tank that's safe for him to snuggle with if he'd like? I use some flat rocks to hold down the felt usually, but he just flipped them over trying to climb underneath the felt. ", "link_id": "t3_aa5lii", "time": 1545961324}}

I started dating my ex when I was 14. He was fine with doing stuff with me, but my eyes wandered then and kept on wandering. The last six months of our relationship, I started cheating on him with my coworker and I never felt satisfied. Fast forward almost two years later. I started dating someone not long after my ex and I broke up (we didn't break up over the cheating; he didn't know until a few weeks afterwards). I had broken things off with the coworker after I met my current boyfriend because I felt satisfied for once. Coworker didn't like that, tried to make advances when my boyfriend went into rehab (he is a recovering alcoholic; a year and 4 months sobriety) and that didn't end well; I had to quit my job. My eyes haven't wandered since meeting my boyfriend. The only person I want is him. It's not because he keeps me satisfied, but it's mainly because I'm just happy with him and I don't want to be with anyone else because I don't want to ruin what I have. I learned that the hard way with cheating because it made me absolutely miserable towards the end because I felt used essentially. So, in your case, I'm like you. I only want my boyfriend nowadays and I find it a part of my normal life, though I was different in the past. Yeah, I'm hypersexual almost all the time, and sometimes my boyfriend doesn't want to do anything, but I have to respect him, and take care of myself if you catch my drift.

The best option is to find someone who will listen and can help you in the ways you can while dealing with your illness. I know most of it is on your own with the mental aspect, appointments, medications, etc, but just having a person to listen helps a ton as well, and if you need a hug sometimes, they'll be happy to give it to you.

I have to keep an agenda or a calender to remind me of appointments or things that I need to take care of during the week so I don't forget about them; for example, I make appointments with my therapist and in a couple of hours, if I misplaced the little card that they write them on, I have no idea what time my next appointment is and I have to call them to ask. Another thing is the next day, if I had a shift at work, I don't remember driving home even though it's a 45 min distance. I know I drove, but I don't remember what happened on my journey from point a to point b; this happens often. I'll pull up what I was listening to on my phone to see if it'll spark some memory in some way, but I'll look at it sometimes and question why in hell I was listening to that. Strangely, I also have some memories that stand out to me more predomently than others like something my boyfriend said months ago even if it was a minor detail. It's weird really.

Well, I turned around and smacked him across the face with a shoe and he backed off, but I was really shook up about it. Boyfriend calls me the next day and I was really upset and told him what happened. I was living with his dad at the time and while I was in for an eight hour shift, boyfriend had called his dad and told him what was up. Without my knowledge, my boyfriend's dad shows up to my work place and kinda storms in. I ask him what's up and he asks where the guy is. I point him out kinda wanting a little petty revenge though I knew it was gonna backfire, but I didn't know what his dad would do. His dad pulls that guy into the stock room and shuts the door and from what I heard later on, my boyfriend's dad told him he'd find a nice cop and detective to come down and talk to him if he ever laid hands on me again. He left, I didn't know exactly what happened, but my coworker came up to me and said, \"I didn't sexually assault you,\" even though he clearly did.

I told my side of the story, it came out to the manager that coworker and I had a fling and she asked why I didn't report the assualt the day before and it was because mainly I was terrified. She says she has to report it to home office because him and I were on the clock, I'm shook up so I go outside to smoke and guy gets sent home for the day.I had issues with this place for about two months at this point so I walked back into the store and told the manager that I was just gonna quit.

I talk about them with my doc, but they still can't help much to this day, but I feel like the one thing that has helped me the most is when I wake up, I consistently remind myself that they're not real and that my anxiety shouldn't get worked up over something my head conjured up. If I wasn't in full panic attack mode when I woke up, I'd do some breathing excersizes and try to find my happy place before I got too worked up.  I know it's not the best advice to be honest, but I hope this may help some. I completely get your situation and I know it's rough. I hope you find something soon to help you out with them.

If they're not socialized yet though, you need to watch them while doing this because they may take off running and if it's a baby, they're fast. After he was semi-comfortable with me, I started holding worms (I used mealworms in the past, but they're shell is bad for dragons and can cause impactation; I use wax worms now) out in front of him with my fingers and let him get them out of my hand. Mine is most comfortable with eating in his tank and if I have him out, he's a little skeptical with eating them. If you have other animals as well (for me, I have three cats) keep an eye out for them when they get close. Mine liked to attempt to paw at my dragon not long after I got him which made him really nervous. If you want your dragon to be able to roam the house a little when they're much older, you have to introduce them slowly. Once you get them adjusted to you, they're sweet.

I went to my school student support system and they said they couldn't help me with my mental illness though it was affecting my work ethic, but at the time I was also living in a bad situation and my psych kept cancelling my appointments.

I moved schools and I've been working hard, but the past few weeks have been rough on me dealing with a lot of stress at the moment. The only advice I can really give is take some time off if you need to after this semester is over. It'll give you time to think about what you want to do and it'll help with some stress that school puts on you. I personally had to put myself first before school because I still wasn't doing well when the fall 2017 semester began.

If you need to take more than 2 to 3 classes, try to get then scheduled to where you're going to school only 2 to 4 days a week so that will also give you some time off.

Zeppelin fights pretty rough with Fatty so if you smack your hands together, he'll stop unless he's in a fiesty mood that day so you may have to do it a couple of times. Fatty likes attention and lays on the back of the couch. If she wants to be pet, she'll smack you upside the head a few times with her tail until you pet her. And Cleo, I've already started a bad habit with. The first couple nights she was home, I brought her with me when I went to bed and sat her on the pillow and put the blanket a little over her. If she's taking a nap now, she wants to be tucked in. If you go to bed, she'll start meowing when you turn off the light because she knows it's bedtime. She wants to be carried. She's a munchkin cat that only weighs 4 1/2 pounds. She wants to be treated like a baby even though she's over a year old. ", "link_id": "t3_9seftm", "time": 1540841084}}

He stands up for me now when she brings me up in a conversation, but I'm glad he watches out for my sister. Depression sucks.

They also slightly missed where the hole was previously even though they felt for it so the hole in my left lobe is slightly bigger than the right. I kept cleaning them and gave up, took my earrings out and got lucky that the holes had somehow managed to stay that time around, but I didn't realize they had until I was 16.

Don't recommend Claire's, don't recommend piercing baby's ears, and definitely hate the hell out of the piercing gun.

Some pet stores do have their own brand of products very cheap to help with these issues of whatever your dog may have. If someone is looking for a cheaper solution that I know works, I recommend my store's brand. Oils will make a dog sick and they're really not a good choice. If you're really looking for some kind of homeopathic way to treat your pet they do make products designed specifically for animals that will not hurt them in any sort of way. This is awful.

My step sister gave me a lot of courage because before then, I had only recently found out that she was homosexual and sadly she was forcefully outed and dealt with those consequences the hard way. I wrote my dad a letter when I was at school that day and I wouldn't see my dad until later in the evening because he was working late. I gave it to my stepmother first and a part of me feels like that if my step sister wasn't already out, my stepmom wouldn't have been so accepting. My dad read the letter and he told me I was going to have a rough life, and at the time, I think he thought it was a bit of a phase, but I'm 20 now and still going strong. I feel like the only issue I've had with it is that since I've only dated men, but I've been with women before, that people seem to think that I'm not bisexual anymore, which isn't the truth. My ex got mad when I was adamant about my sexuality because he wanted me to be straight. Current boyfriend doesn't care and he gets a kick out of when we're watching tv shows and I see an attractive actress or whatever and point it out to him. Sometimes I'll even ask him if he finds the actress attractive as well. Congrats again for coming out. I hope your life goes well and you find a partner who is accepting that you're who you are.

Wasn't allowed eyeshadow until I was in 8th for a formal dance the school was having, and since then, I haven't looked back. High school I stuck to more neutral tones again and had one of those emo phases where I used my first eyeshadow compact throughout my high school years. I keep it for memories now since it's been with me for so long. I don't use it anymore. I feel like makeup at a young age isn't a problem if you've really got an interest in it.

I tell them no, but they're welcome to go down to the Spca and look because they provably have some. \"Nah, I'll just wait until you guys get some in.\" My store is less than a 15 min drive from the Spca and on top of that, our cats come from them so I just don't understand some people's logic with that. People usually hang up before they allow me to explain that nice little piece of information. ", "link_id": "t3_9h5zy2", "time": 1537455127}}

As long as they fill out the paperwork, aren't sketchy because I have a crazy intuition, have the money, and aren't on the SPCAs list of \"Do Not Adopt\" in my area, then they're free to take the cat home the day they fill out the paperwork. I look over everything of course to make sure there are no \"warning signs\" of sorts, but I mean if someone is genuinely interested and are wanting the paperwork to adopt one of the cats then yeah, I'll let them hold it. Eight out of ten times, if they are already ready to fill out the paperwork and are planning on taking the cat home by just looking at it, I'll definitely let them hold it for a moment. It's frustrating for them to have several applications out on cats though. I've had people ask if we could put the cat on hold for them while they run and get cash or whatever, and we will, but only if they fill out the paperwork. If they don't show up by the next day though to pay, the cat is free to have someone fill out the paperwork for it once again and pay to take it home.

April of 2017, I ruined my schooling and stopped going to class because I was in the middle of a mental breakdown. I failed two classes of three (I had to drop two others due to my bipolar), and lost a full ride scholarship, which threw me in a deeper pit. Was put on academic probation, and was even at risk for losing my federal financial aid. I took a year off. I've been back at school for a month and only took enough classes for my aid to cover. I have to bring my GPA up in order to keep my aid.

Monday, I get to class and realize that I forgot to do an assignment over the weekend. My teacher cuts me some slack and says to turn it in today (he changed that to Thursday, but I'll get to that in a moment). My stress levels shot through the roof. Like I was having flashbacks of when I messed up before and I've had two anxiety attacks in two days. I woke up this morning and was supposed to go to class, but from where I had my attack yesterday, I couldn't even get out of bed because I'm in a slump. I had another one today and I emailed my teachers to let them know why I wasn't in class. The teacher I owe the assignment for gave me a deadline of tomorrow evening, which I can do, but I just still am all over the place and my meds aren't helping. So yeah, I can relate in some way.

I have had some good times when my medication was in line, my episodes weren't as long and they weren't as frequent. I've honestly never felt what some consider normal, but then again each person's definition of normal is different. I've had good times, but in all honesty, I've also had mental breakdowns, and those are the lowest points I've ever been, but there were other factors involved. I will do a small comparison though of my experience when it comes to people with bipolar, medicated and unmedicated. My mom will be the unmedicated person, and I shall be the medicated one. My mom is manic bipolar, she stopped taking her medication after she was diagnosed, and became manipulative, irrational, angry all the time to the point where she threw a glass at my head once and thankfully missed. She's disowned me three times and she's pushed my sister and I as far away from her as possible with her impulsive decisions. She's also crazy hypersexual. I, on the other hand, stay on my medication. I have a healthy relationship, a steady job, I'm going back to school in a couple of weeks, and while I do have my highs and lows, I can function in my normal life. I deal with my mania by staying productive in my work and home life, I do a lot of cleaning during my manic episode and I get crafty as my current choice of hobby is working with clay. During my depressive episodes, I kind of wilt like a flower. I express how I'm feeling to my boyfriend and he understands if I feel like sleeping more, or just watching t.v., he knows I have my bad days, and when he knows I'm really low, he tries to find things for me to do so that I can try to focus on at least something. Same with my workplace, my managers (I'm in retail) know when I'm not feeling well and they try to keep me productive and will handle customers or give me a moment if I need it. It's all about how you handle your episodes really. When I'm depressed, I write poetry about how I'm feeling and I make sure to have my support system. When I'm manic, I've just got to do something or I feel jiggerty and get irratible. I make sure to express with my psych about what's going on and how my highs and lows are so she knows what medicines to adjust and whatnot. I know it's rough going through it at the age you're at because I've been there. My symptoms were present early because it's hereditary with my family.

ZooMed makes kits made towards bearded dragons, but all of the supplies that come with it may not be of use depending on the size of the dragon. For example, there's a 20 gal kit and a 40 gal. I bought to 40, but ended up with a baby beardie. That being said, I had to find a different water dish because he was so small that I was afraid he'd be unable to get into the one I bought. The kit I bought was close to $300, while the 20 gal I believe is somewhere between $150 and $200. The kits themselves come with some samples of food (and ReptiCalicum), the lights and bulbs, a water and food dish, some sand (which I decided not to use based on some research), and the tank itself. As for other estimates on prices, I'll give a rough amount:To replace the sand, I used felt for the time being (I got it from a craft store): I spent $~10 for 2 yards of felt. I still have enough felt left over though to replace what's in the tank now about 5-10 times. Decorations for the tank: I decked out my tank since it was so large, I spent around $60. Food for a weekly basis: Crickets at my store are $0.16 apiece. I buy 35 at once and give a few to my dragon a day. $~7. Mealworms in any pet store run around $5 for a thing of 50. I also keep my crickets in a Critter Keeper which I paid $5 for. Dragons themselves I've seen go for anywhere between $40 and $100 in pet stores, but as I've seen other people post about expos and such here, they're usually higher priced at those.  Replacement bulbs are anywhere between $7 to $20 apiece depending on the store. I hope this helps some, if you decide to get one. I'm not sure if my type of pet store is in your area, but if you send me a PM, I'll be fine with telling you which franchise I work for; my store is usually lower priced and we're running a great sale on a lot of stuff until September. I've learned in my years of keeping Bettas and getting my lizard that spending the money to give them a nice home is always worth it though. ", "link_id": "t3_934ef2", "time": 1532968419}}

I was struggling really bad, but this particular lesson, I was really understanding what was going on. It was about three minutes before class ended and everyone was packing up around me, so I decided to do the same. I was one of the last kids to put their books in their bag and I was the only one called out for it and asked to stay after. You had 7 minutes to get across a huge campus to your next class and I was expected to be at lunch after math. He made me sit in my chair for 5 minutes while his next class rolled in and I was taking up a girls seat. Everyone was staring at me, especially the girl who looked kind of pissed off at me being there. I started tearing up and he could see that I was visibly upset, but kept me there. He told me not to do it again and I ran off downstairs and started hyperventilating because I did not like attention being drawn towards me. Had a panic attack during lunch and I did not speak to that teacher unless I really had to for the rest of the semester. After that incident, he stopped calling on me to answer problems anyways because I think he knew he pushed a button he wasn't supposed to. I have never been more thankful to not have math in my life.

It took 4 vehicles to get all their stuff down to Florida as 3 of the cars were my cousin's, and my aunt was taking my sister and I down there for a short vacation. Out of the vehicles, there were two trucks in the front (my cousin driving one alone, my aunt and sister in the second), and two cars in the back (my cousin's wife, me, and her dogs in the third, and her brother and his then girlfriend in the fourth). My cousin's truck had a net over the cargo in the back of his truck while my aunt's didn't. Everything was going great until we got somewhere down in South Carolina and we were on the highway. Since my aunt's truck didn't have the net in the back, they did their best to secure everything down, but apparently a clear duffle bag carrying about 20 pairs of shoes wasn't having it. It flew out of the truck and proceeded to fling shoes all over the highway and my cousin's wife and I saw the chaos happen first hand as it hit the windshield of her car. Shoes were all over road, cars running over many of them, and after all four vehicles pulled over, my cousins had to scramble through traffic to grab as many as they could without getting hit since this was all of their shoes.  When we finally arrived to Florida a handful of hours later, they realized that out of the 20 pairs they brought down with them, they now had 13 sets and 5 single, lonesome shoes; two pair were completely missing. They look back now and laugh at it as it's happened many years ago at this point, but I'll never forget the amount of chaos we dealt with that trip after the shoe incident.

Whenever it was feeding time, he knew, and he'd swim right up to the front of the tank to greet me. He'd like to spend a lot of his time resting on top of his plants and behind the filter and he was the only one that almost never flared at me. He was my little anger fish, but I loved him. He helped a lot with my anxiety also and it was almost like he knew when I needed to calm down. I'd lay on the floor (his tank was at the bottom of a bookshelf) and try to calm myself down and he'd just slowly swim back and forth at the front of the tank and allow me to watch him. He'd never try to hide during those moments. About six months after he passed, I had someone draw me a design of him and I had it tattooed on my thigh. Onto the second, Niji. He used to be really aggressive when I kept him in a 1.5 gallon cube. He didn't get along with snails at all and he'd always flare at me even if I glanced in his direction. After Yukine's death, I moved him into a 10 gallon which he still resides in today. He likes to show off a little, but he's shy when I pull out my phone to take pictures of him. Going back to him not liking snails, after upgrading him, he was given a snail friend and the snail continued to live quite a while before it passed. He has a black mystery snail in his tank now that I've had for about four months now and they get along well. Sometimes Niji will swim right over top of him and watch him as he moves along the tank.

{"drvgi7u": {"text": "I worked for a shoe store from July of 2016 to August of 2017. I had a coworker who was a notorious flirt and me being dumb, fell for his tricks. The two of us had sort of a fwb kind of fling that no other coworkers knew about. I ended up cutting off that relationship in April of 2017 when I met my current boyfriend. The day before I quit, he sexually assaulted me at work and when I told a coworker about it that night, she had admitted that he had done the same thing to her shortly before I started working there. She filed a report with our boss and nothing ever came of it due to him being one of two males working there. I didn't report it, but got someone to have a nice little chat with him the next day. When that little chat was brought up to my former boss, she asked why I did it and I told her everything; the fling, the assault, and all the nasty little details he had told me (stealing from the store, taking money from the register, etc) that would get him fired from the store. I quit then and there because I knew I was going to be fired for a \"personal relationship\" with a coworker and not filing the assault. He kept his job for another month and a half until he quit. Everything I had said about him turned out to be true and, after looking into it, corporate just pushed it under the rug because he was a male in a female-dominated store.

{"dquz7yj": {"text": "There were one thing (and its kind of serious) for the shoe store I formerly worked at for a year. We had a coworker who was notorious for hitting on other girls in the store. I happened to be the one that he targeted and since I was in a very unhappy relationship with my boyfriend, I accepted this guys advances not once, but five times. Needless to say, I found out later on that he had done the same thing with another coworker, but when she rejected him, he ended up sexually assaulting her and she reported it to our manager. It was swept under the rug by the company and the guy got to keep his job since he was one of two males that worked there. After cutting ties with him after I left my former boyfriend and started dating someone else, he too sexually assaulted me during work, but I didn't report it since I knew the company would sweep it under the rug. Instead, I had someone come talk to him and that day I quit my job without notice after the boss was informed and reported it to home office. He again, kept his job, worked there for another month before he too quit. This guy did a lot of bad things in the year and a half he worked there such as stealing merchandise, doing what he did to me, stealing money from the drawer, etc. All times the boss knew about, but acted like it didn't exist because she needed male workers in a female dominated store.

I lived in a blended family; my dad married my stepmother 12 years ago (I was around 7; they got together when I was 5), and with her she brought my stepbrother into the family.  Six months ago, I started dating my boyfriend and at the time, I was dealing with a lot of mental abuse from my step mom. We've always clashed heads for years, but around the time I turned 18, she talked my father into more or less throwing me into the wolves. They'd let me live in the house, but I had to buy my own food and take care of myself more or less. Around that time also, instead of targeting my father (she always calls him a dumbass, takes ans spends his money, threatens to leave him and divorce, and berates him constantly). When he wasn't around though, she'd turn to me. She called me lazy, stupid, I'd never amount to anything, etc. It was pretty rough. So, I got fed up with it and started staying with my boyfriend literally two weeks into our relationship. I've moved in officially at this point in time, but the sibling I left behind is my 16 year old sister. My sister struggles daily because my step mom now turns to her to abuse and honestly, my sister is fed up with it. She lashes back and she's began to think about being emancipated. She texts me all the time and rolls her eyes at what my stepmother says, but my sister has a thicker skin than me and she knows how to brush the abuse off like it's nothing. I ran away and left her, but we still make sure that the other person is okay because we're sisters; we've been through a lot together from dealing with our family problems to other personal issues.
