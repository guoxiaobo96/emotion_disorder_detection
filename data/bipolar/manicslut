She's not even 40 lbs but is so strong and determined (especially with her prey drive) I almost couldn't control her. So I recently switched to a harness mainly because I was worried about trachea damage with the collar + pulling.I clip on front + back so the leash almost acts like a steering wheel and I have complete control now over her direction.

Like \"hell yes I killed that exam I'm such a queen\" or \"I got out of bed today like the queen I am\".And it extends beyond the individual into community approaches towards praise and love. Me and my friends always call each other queens when we are proud of each other. I'm sure there might be instances where the term is not used in this way, but I think overall it's rooted in allowing yourself to be proud of yourself and love yourself no matter how big or small your accomplishments.
