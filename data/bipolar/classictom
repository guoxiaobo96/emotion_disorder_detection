I know it sucks, but if you are sincere, most people are willing to work with you. I have done things like taken \"incompletes\" before that allow you to re-take an exam. The school technically has to provide you with this. Anxiety is a real disabling condition. Granted, you typically need some sort of documentation, but even from a GP, they must accommodate you. After that's over, contact your school's disability office. I know it sounds extreme, because no one wants to be \"official\" like that, but if you're \"in the system\" then it is way easier for the school to work with you when it happens again (and it will). I had a friend who made the mistake of never formally notifying the school of her speech disability and nothing could be done for her by the time she wanted to opt-out of a presentation. Side note, and I'm not a provider (just a nurse), but slowly titrating up on an antidepressant nearly made this problem go away. For me, good ol' fashioned fluoxetine is what allowed me gain control so I could apply anxiety reducing skills I learned in therapy. Again, personal choice, and it may not be appropriate for you, but it's worth considering. I know therapy seems to be recommended first, but when you are at the point of losing control and having a physical vomiting reaction then it's time to more aggressively take a hold of it. It really can take hold of your life when you're always behind it. I'm not sure how serious your problem is but reading your post made me feel really feel for you and I had to comment because I've been through situations like this where you feel like you have to explain yourself all the time you and don't think anyone will understand or be accommodating or anything and the thought of just having to write an email is anxiety-producing in and of itself. For me, though, the problem got progressively worse. I couldn't do a simple powerpoint presentation to a small group of people, and sometimes would run out of the room to throw up. At some point,  I was no longer even able to take the bus or train without having to step off and find a place to vomit. I can't explain why I developed that, it's not rational -- but thats just it -- anxiety isn't rational!I hope this post helped you even a little bit and I'd be willing to talk if you feel like at some point you might need guidance.", "link_id": "t3_gdb5ha", "time": 1588608818}}

Subtle enough that people slept through it, but I was definitely awake and aware and I am also just pretty observant of things.There are no more updates and no more attempts to descend, and I don't think people were paying attention. About 20 minutes later an attendant comes on and says something along the lines of *please remain with your seatbelts fastened, and please work with us and be patient during this difficult time*.We finally landed. As I was exiting, the pilot was standing there with the attendants, waving people goodbye per usual. But the guy was SOAKED. I mean SOAKED in sweat. His entire button up shirt was drenched. He looked pale, and I could sweat droplets on his forehead.

The real self has the potential for growth, happiness, will power, realization of gifts, etc., but it also has deficiencies. The ideal self is used as a model to assist the real self in developing its potential and achieving self-actualization.

{"dksu25i": {"text": "Here are some options you may not know about or aren't too familiar with:Check to see if your insurance covers TMS therapy (transcranial magnetic stimulation). * There are two kinds - Neurostar (which is rTMS or repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) and Brainsway (dTMS or Deep Transcranial Magnetic Therapy). * It's a great treatment for those who want to add to an antidepressant, or if many different classes of antidepressants haven't been effective.Also look into: * DBS (deep brain stimulation). It does require minor surgery but can be very effective, * Vagus Nerve Stimulation - the vagus nerve runs through your neck into your brain, and stimulating this nerve has shown to have a statistically significant antidepressant effect against a control group* Lastly: Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is very powerful and very effective. Don't be scared by the media portrayals. Science has come a long way. It is a procedure done under anesthesia that induces a small seizure. It is either done unilaterally or bilaterally. A consult will explain the ins and outs for you. This is a VERY commonly done and very misunderstood therapy and has changed many peoples lives.Don't give up hope - there are other options besides pharmacological intervention. A note about therapy: keeping up with therapy is important as well, but if outpatient therapy isn't doing the trick, you can:* step up to IOP (intensive outpatient therapy) which is more intensive, * a step up from that is PHP (partial hospitalization) which is generally 9-3pm every day of structured treatment at a hospital (you just don't sleep overnight there). * Of course up from that, is inpatient, but reserved for those who are of immediate danger to themselves. If you are concerned about  the time commitment of these options or making it work with work, the FMLA (family medical leave act) qualifies this. If you are too depressed or exhausted to use the mental energy to look into these things, that is completely okay and normal, ask someone you trust to help you. If you feel you don't have anyone to ask, a visit to your doctor, an urgent care center, or hospital can you connect you to these resources for you.Good luck, I know you can do this!Edit: I'm sorry I wasn't able to provide informational links to each of these things, I'm a quite busy ATM, but I will get back on later today and add some hyperlinked resources of websites I find to be informative, easy to understand, and most importantly, based on empirically-backed evidence based medicine.

Medicines interact with each other; with THC, there isn't enough research out to know how it interacts with other medications, especially ones that affect the brain. Doesn't mean there won't be in the future, but I 100% can see where your doctor is coming from: at this point in time, you are adding in another variable that has unknown interactions with other medications, and he isn't comfortable prescribing under those conditions.It's like any other medication. I used benadryl (ZZ-quil) pretty heavily as a sleep aid, and my doctor said she could no longer prescribe to me if I kept doing that, because the math in her head of my cocktail only involves those medications she is prescribing.

Well as we were boarding, my little six year legs could not mind the gap, and I slipped and fell in. I landed on the sooty ground underneath the train platform, right next to the wheel. I looked up at it and I remember it being at  least twice my height.I hear a commotion starting above me and people screaming that a child had fallen onto the track and to not move the train, etc. and who I assume was my mom was screaming. The distance I fell was too great and I couldn't crawl out. Right as I was giving into to the idea the fire department was going to have to come, I look up and the gap to the outside was bright with light, blinding everything else, and there was a man's hand reaching down towards me. I instinctively jumped and grabbed the hand and was pulled to the surface. My mom immediately scooped me up and people started surrounding me asking if I was okay, etc. I looked around for the man but he was nowhere in sight. He just absconded away. I only saw him for brief second after I was pulled up but I don't remember him having a face. I asked my mom to thank the man that helped me and she said she hadn't seen anyone. I'm not sure how people thought I got out. No one mentioned this man.

He's on disability and lives with my mom because he's so mentally ill and so I've stayed completely out of that life and I'm scared (1) to start down that same path and (2) bother my parents, because his situation has been so bad for so long.I actually remember once in college I left in the middle of the semester due to some kind of depressive episode, and my mom basically was like \"you're a lot more functional than you think you are, you just aren't trying\" but I think that's because she didn't want me to come home and have to take care of two ill children.
