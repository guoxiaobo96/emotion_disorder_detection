That is going to put a big dent on areas of the world that placed social distancing practices into effect, and ultimately will keep the virus spreading into flu season. So hosting an event with 100,000 people from all over the world is not likely to happen this year unfortunately. There is good news though. The second wave is less likely to be as severe as different therapies are being tested in hopes of better treating patients with COVID-19. So more effective options will be available rather than resorting to ventilators. It also looks like the virus is not mutating quickly, whereas influenza mutates rapidly every year. Many scientists are predicting that a single vaccine will also be sufficient enough to protect against COVID-19, and this information comes from just one team out of dozens around the world looking to develop a vaccine asap, Source: https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/03/30/covid-19-gene-sequencing/", "link_id": "t3_fvw4o6", "time": 1586214541}}

I'm required to be tested before returning to work as I had a cough earlier this week, and our hospital is mandating testing for any employee with respiratory symptoms. Every hospital needs all hands on deck, because the worst is yet to come. I have a grandfather with pulmonary disease and a grandmother with diabetes. Both are at extreme risk to having complications due to COVID-19, yet there is no way they can get a test right now. Why the hell are basketball players being tested when the season is on hiatus? Give those tests to grocery store employees who are being worked to death with no PPE whatsoever. Provide to EMTs and other public officers risking their health to check the well being of the elderly. This whole crisis is exposing just how well you're looked after according to how much money you have or how medical networks and retail chains are hanging onto precious profits by exposing their employees to swarms of potential carriers each day. Reminds me of the South Park episode where scientists discover that money is what's keeping Magic Johnson alive. Thousands of lives are at stake, yet the rich can rest easily in isolation and the rest of us have to fight just to keep our assess clean with toilet paper.

{"ez9fvtt": {"text": "I work in a clinical microbiology lab. My manager has been an MLS (medical laboratory scientist) for over 30 years. When she first began, she told me there were one or two strains of bacteria that were beginning to show resistance to certain antibiotics. Today, that number is quickly rising, at a pretty alarming rate. In fact, one of the primary roles of an MLS working in a microbiology lab is to determine the susceptibility of certain strains of bacteria or fungi to antibiotic drugs. In other words, doctors cannot just administer treatment to patients with bacterial or fungal infections because they are not always effective. Determining how susceptible an organism is to a certain drug takes a lot of work, and more often than not, only a few antibiotics show effectiveness in stopping bacterial growth (this is determined in several ways). Thus, patients who have some form of resistant strain of bacteria (like MRSA) are very unlucky, as first line antibiotics are useless. Several, very potent, and VERY expensive drugs are given in a last resort case. So even if the patient recovers, they will have a very hefty hospital bill when discharged. It is a very alarming time for infectious diseases considering how public knowledge of treating the common cold or finishing an entire dose of antibiotics is very low. And don't even get me started on anti-vaccination. PSAs like this are needed, but the public really needs to engage more in community outreach programs to better treat themselves for the sake of their own health, finances, and keeping infectious diseases from mutating quicker than they already are.", "link_id": "t3_d0dkc8", "time": 1567781313}}

House/techno are easier because it's just a 4/4 rhythm that you mash up with a steady rhythm, but if you're mixing hip-hop/R&amp;B that is definitely a skill that takes a lot of time to nail. Often, songs are at a different tempo or key, and being able to SMOOTHLY transition these genres is tough. Mainstream DJs don't usually mix live tho, so I do agree that the talent for today's DJs/Producers is mostly held in the studio. Most just plug in a USB drive into a CDJ with pre-recorded sets. That's why I give credit to DJs like A-Trak and Alison Wonderland who are more well known but actually mix live. Vinyl DJs are some of the most talented people on Earth imo.
