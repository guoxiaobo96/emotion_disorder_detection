Good mental health allows an individual to cope with internal and external stimuli, stressors, conflicts, and change in s healthy and adaptive way. The individual\u2019s self-concept is stable and and lacks major distortion. The individual has a high degree of autonomy over cognitive functioning and possesses an ability to regulate mood states and emotional responses to an acceptable degree. The individual possesses reasonably accurate self-awareness and takes reasonable steps to build and maintain self-esteem in objectively healthy ways. The individual is free from addictions and dependencies. The individual\u2019s neurochemical functioning is within  standard limits. The individual is free from disease and disorders that are a result of trauma, genetic abnormalities, injury to the brain and/or central nervous systems, any of the supportive hormonal systems, or etc. Poor mental heath would be deviation in some degree of one or more of the aforementioned biological systems or traits. To reiterate, mental health is not a \u201chave it or don\u2019t have it\u201d binary state. Most people will deal with one or more mental health issues over their lifetime.

Some people think it\u2019s a psychic or clairvoyant ability. Personally I would define it as somebody who has an immense mount of empathy and intuition, not in a mystical sense, but as a result of having high emotional and perceptual sensitivity. Empathy is something that has been studied empirically in many domains including sociology, neurology, and psychology. As for empathy, it\u2019s a process that falls on a spectrum. We have all met people with little to no empathy, and this is usually a factor in psychopathy, narcissism, and machaevellianism (not correct spelling) which is called the \u201cdark triad\u201d. Worth looking into as a basis of comparison. Those with high degrees of empathy can identify/sense the moods and emotions of others and in some cases even experience those states in themselves. I think empaths are distinct in their ability to actually experience these states as if it were there own which is distinguished from highly sensitive people by the degree and frequency. Through empathy people can use perspective taking to better understand others, even if their values, history, and personality are different. Though it\u2019s been studied for years there is still a lot that is unknown about empathy, particularly in regards to how it functions. I should also point out that people with exceptionally high levels of empathy are often vulnerable to wind up in unhealthy codependent relationships where they find themselves trapped in a savior role.

On the other hand if you have a simple script with a small cast there is not reason why you can\u2019t do it yourself, it will just take significantly longer. If I wanted a lean crew I would definitely want another brain to collaborate with in the writing process, and then when it comes time to shoot it, a DP who would handle camera and lighting.

There is definitely some truth to the idea of \"write to market\" and if one's intention is to write and publish genre fiction, this is excellent advice. However there is a danger in adopting this as an absolute. I doubt David Foster Wallace was thinking about marketability when he wrote Infinite Jest, and the same could be said of many other ambitious novels by both experienced and first time authors that defied the odds and ended up being successful. Let me be clear - I am not comparing myself or my writing to anybody, nor making any bold claims about my ability to produce a work that would even be remotely comparable to them.

Be patient. You can't just barf out gold onto the page every day. Sometimes things need to brew in your subconscious. Focus on the problem, then sometimes doing something mindless or rote (e.g. washing the dishes) helps let this stuff process and the next thing you know, you're hit with a \"ah ha!\" moment of insight or inspiration.2. Sharing with others that you are actively writing something is good. They will help keep you motivated, especially when they ask, \"how's the book/screenplay/play/essay coming along?\" I would caution against sharing broad plot or story elements until you have it worked out enough to be like a tight \"elevator pitch.\" As you develop the elements your vision will become more clear, especially the details that someone not familiar with your characters or story would need. Other people are great sounding boards for details or ideas, just dont pitch your story until you are ready.3. Writing is rewriting. Writing is rewriting. Don't be afraid to write utter crap, especially when it comes to prose. Think of it like clay. If you are sculpting a head, you don't start with fine strands of hair or pimples. You rough it out so it looks like a face and then go in for the fine details. Along these lines, sometimes you have to kill your babies.

If the characters just said \u201cI\u2019m sad\u201d or talked about their feelings, that wcene would jot have the same emotional impact. It\u2019s important to to realize that \u201cshowing\u201d and \u201ctelling\u201d are sort of abstract. Don\u2019t confuse dialogue with \u201ctelling\u201d and action as \u201cshowing.\u201d Good writing can use dialogue to reveal a lot about a character. What the character DOESN\u2019T say is arguably more revealing than what they DO say. Remember in Empire strikes back when Han was just about to be frozen in carbonate? Princess Leia says, \u201cI love you\u201d and it\u2019s an important moment in the love subplot. If Han said, \u201cI love you too\u201d this would be boring. Instead he says \u201cI know\u201d.

This sounds a lot like affiliate marketing which is often used in the context of influencer marketing and is very common on YouTube and blog sites.

Affective empathy allows us to experience what another person is feeling. The degree in which a person can experience empathy falls somewhere on an infinite spectrum.

Rate of return: 17920 scarlet credits / 30 (minutes) = 597 credits/minuteSure, it's a *little* less, but still a good deal. I would recommend telling your squad to suck it up and finish two full runs if somebody wants to leave early.", "link_id": "t3_g1ovqh", "time": 1586956678}}

Overall I feel that farming focus is a tremendous investment in time for very little reward. Duviri may change that.As for Eidolon hunts i think the drop in interest is temporary. The way I see it, people did hunts for one or more of the following three reasons:1. They are fun and engaging2. They are currently the most efficient way to farm focus3. They were the easiest way to farm arcanesThe SS event made arcanes super easy to acquire, which tanked the market, though this is short-term. Once the event is over the prices for arcanes will steadily increase over time and we could expect to see a rise in eidolon hunts to rise with them. Right now you can buy an arcane energize for 15p. Three months ago they were 118p. New or returning players that didn't acquire arcanes through SS will want them, and as prices are driven up due to supply being cut off, more and more will look to eidolon hunts to farm them. This is of course based on the assumption that easy availability of arcanes will be limited to temporary events like SS.Crazy fun fact : arcane strike's average selling price has been trending higher every day over the last week or two than it was 90 days ago prior to SS. I agree that the current lens system is annoying, but be careful what you wish for; increasing the ease of farming focus in alternative ways would create a disincentive to eidolon hunting.", "link_id": "t3_g0meee", "time": 1586798778}}

Your base melee speed of this zaw is high, so instead of any attack speed mod I would try out drifting contact for the combo duration and status chance. You can pair this with a warframe that either has attack speed buffs (wisp and gauss for example) and/or with arcane strike.

They have added a lot of complex stuff and have identified that they need a more robust QC program (especially for Scarlet Spear, Steve said so much). The pandemic has caused major problems for them, and many companies that require teams working together. The pandemic has also created problems for the player base. Many people have more time to kill, some lost their jobs, others are scared. This magnifies frustrations and we see a disproportionate amount of complaining, sometimes to crazy levels, e.g. the conspiracy theorists that think \u201cDE is vindictive and hates the players,\u201d or \u201cDE is totally incompetent!\u201d", "link_id": "t3_fyekya", "time": 1586522480}}

You\u2019ll want to keep and reuse your ranked mods because they work with other weapons. As you continue to play you\u2019ll start wracking up tons of duplicates. I think the best thing to do with these are to dissolve them for endo. You can never have enough endo, and this is a good way to get some just for playing the game. Just don\u2019t accidentally sell any mods that are worth decent plat! And always keep one or two just in case. I think you can sell those for credits too, but I personally just sell extra (non prime) warframe parts since you can\u2019t trade those. For example I sold close to a million credits worth of Oberon and harrow parts last night. By \u201csell\u201d I mean out of my inventory. Same rule applies as above - keep one or two extra warframe parts because I think they are crafting requirements for certain things (e.g. chroma). Rivens are a different story. You can transmute 4 unveiled rivens to get a new unveiled one. Some players think this is a total waste, because even trash rivens or unrolled ones have some value in terms of plat that really depends on the weapon. I personally enjoy the thrill of unveiling rivens, so I will transmute 4 of the same type but only if they are for shit weapons. You should never transmute rivens for good weapons.

Using the liches as Ana example, if you can farm them in an hour then you would have everything you need in a short time.

As you progress through the game, the sub-MR7 weapons will become a lot less useful, though properly modded, just about any weapon will deal with star chart enemies handily. As you start getting access to better weapons you can always sell off the old ones to free up slots. Warframes are always going to be useful, and you\u2019ll want to keep those. I find boosters extremely helpful. The longer duration ones a a much better value than the 3 day versions. I usually buy the 30 day ones. An affinity booster will make it easier to rank up weapons and warframes making it faster to rank up your MR and add forma. Resource drop boosters are great for increasing the drop chance for rare resources like orokin cells, mutagen samples, etc which you can never have enough of.

Leyou said the downturn can be attributed to three items in particular, the first of which is competitive titles that have entered the market. The second reason that revenue has fallen is because people are holding back their console purchases because new systems, the PS5 and Xbox Series X, are due to launch later this year. The third reason is that f was so substantial in nature that the team couldn't release smaller updates as fast as it could before.These issues that impact Warframe's revenue are \"fleeting,\" Leyou said, adding that the company expects Warframe to remain popular going forward.In the statement, Leyou also mentions that Digital Extremes is planning to launch Warframe on the PS5 and Xbox Series X, as well as \"other devices,\" which should help the franchise grow further.\"Looking ahead to 2020, content updates for Warframe in the story quest The New War and another open world are planned to be launched in 2020. Besides, we will have further content updates of Empyrean , and optimise the beginner guidance process and beginner\u2019s level. 2020 will be another prospering year for Warframe , and more plans will be announced to players in TennoCon in July 2020,\" Leyou said.", "link_id": "t3_fqwqz0", "time": 1585515280}}

The premise is what binds the story together both from a write standpoint and intimately how the viewe interprets meaning from it, and therefore can immerse themselves in the characters and story. How this helps the writer is that they are forced to adhere to the premise so that everything they write works to prove the premise true. This sounds restrictive, but it actually makes things easier because it helps with the million creative decisions we are faced with.

If you have a 50% login bonus this comes out to $.024 per plat. $140 prime access comes out to $.035 per plat. Plus you get a frame, weapons, and accessories. If you were planning on buying the Ivara prime and both weapons off players anyways, using current lowest prices on warframe market, it would set you back about 300 plat. This brings your net plat cost down to $.033 per plat. Is it a good deal? Yes, and it falls somewhere in value in between the 25% off and 50% off discounts, plus you get accessories that are unavailable via trade. But the origin pack ($5 for 200p). It\u2019s roughly the same per plat rate as a 50% off discount.", "link_id": "t3_fpjyva", "time": 1585259848}}

You probably already know this but capture, survival, defense, and interception are best. Capture because enemies spawn until you extract, unlike exterminate missions.", "link_id": "t3_foukng", "time": 1585158439}}
