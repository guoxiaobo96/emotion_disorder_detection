For us, it requires a student to send their accommodation's letter to their prof/TA's that show the required accommodations. However, when doing it ask for a meeting with the instructor just to talk and let them know, beforehand, that your disability includes other aspects of it. I highly recommend going back and getting the updated accommodations list and fight for those absent days.   Someone I know has ME/CFS, which makes them incredibly and constantly exhausted and in pain. Whenever they hand in their accommodation letter, they always sit down with the instructor and inform them upfront about anything in addition that might happen because accommodation letters can be quite sterile.

I have bipolar disorder and I have a long term SO. He is fantastic, amazing, loving, and the best person I know. We've gone through a lot together both negative and positive. He has brought out the best in me and makes me want to be better. With that being said, you've only met him a little over a month ago. Relationships with bipolar people are intense and often very quick to get serious when we want it. You've experienced the \"fun, lovey dovey\" side of things and you're now experiencing the opposite, and it's okay to feel like you don't understand it. We a lot of times don't understand it ourselves, our brain's are misfiring and giving us some seriously intense emotions/states we are trying to control. It take a lot of time and energy. Depression is an extremely vulnerable state and he might not feel comfortable sharing that side with you yet. It does not mean he doesn't love you. Depression changes a person; the way they act, their ability to process events and their energy levels. He might be scared because he doesn't want to lose you. It might be because he doesn't have the energy to be able to be lovey dovey (check out spoon theory, it can give a basis to understand illnesses). As a partner wanting long term, the best thing you can do is learn about the disorder. Learn everything you can, when he's not feeling depressed, ask him about his experiences, his medications, what he does to stay stable, his triggers, etc. The more you learn, the more prepared you are.

{"flyq2yz": {"text": "Every brain is different and can have different side effects to certain medications. It's very possible that you experienced one of the more severe side effects that aren't talked about as often as the manic side effect of antidepressants for bipolar disorder. When I took my original antidepressant, I had every side effect under the sun with the exception of \"coma and death\". It may be unusual, but it doesn't make it impossible. I once had a professor tell me that \"all people on medications are experiments\". Comforting xD Basically, the way that a lot of these types of medications work is they target the neurotransmitters. Just going over the basic antidepressants: A SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) works for depression (and other conditions) because it causes the synapses clefs to slow down it's uptake of serotonin. Kinda like, serotonin is produced, but isn't automatically picked up by it's receptors, it's able to chill in the clef instead of automatically being transmitted through nerves. When done in the brain, it allows for additional serotonin to positively effect the brain. A SNRI stands for serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake Inhibitor. NDRI for Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (this is the classification Wellbutrin is under and it's the most commonly used antidepressant for people with bipolar disorder with hard to treat depression). They kind of all work in the same way by allowing the brain to take in the additional neurotransmitters. There are also more types, but these are the most common/well known ones. Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressants. I'm not going to lie, I'm not as familiar with this type, it is a less common one normally given to elderly individuals. I did a little bit of research to better give you an answer; it also blocks the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. The main difference, it seems, between an SNRI and a tetracyclic antidepressant is that an SNRI blocks/slows down the neurotransmitters from reuptake as the tetracyclic prevent or stop the neurotransmitters from binding. This then increases the amount of those particular neurotransmitters in the brain.Like many psychiatrist that don't want to admit it, I'm going to say, quite informally \"your brain be wack\" xD. Medications can effect us all differently. I'm glad to hear that you're managing and doing well on your medications.

{"fhn0qoo": {"text": "I got my nipple pierced last year. My best advice is to know that it takes time to heal. To begin with, I didn't have sensitive nipples (large breasts) but mine has become a lot more sensitive. I barely flinched when I got them done. I also had flat/inverted nipples, so having them pierced made mine look a lot more normal. The piercer that I went to was a really old school piercer and did the \"don't fucking touch it\" rule, which basically meant, you don't use any saltwater and you don't touch your piercings other than when you're taking a shower, and while you're in the shower you run the bar throughout the piercing allowing water to get all the way through it. A few times, my piercing flared up and I used saltwater on it and they've healed relatively nicely.   Be prepared, around your period, they get tender, annoying, and I find itchy. It does take about a year (or more) to heal completely, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun with them before that, the first few months should be limited contact with them, but once the channel has started to form well, you can play with them more as long as you clean them afterward.", "link_id": "t3_f3xfaq", "time": 1581720519}}
{"fh86r0s": {"text": "https://www.worldcat.org/title/community-psychology/oclc/1090812998Here is a textbook from 2019 called community Psychology. One of the biggest thing that this textbook talks about is how being on a lower socioeconomic status scale makes you more prone to many disadvantages later in life. Blue collar workers are much different than minimum wage workers. Blue collar workers tend to have full time jobs with benefits, they may not make the best money, but it is steady and possible to save some money. In comparison, minimum wage is unsteady, stress inducing, and extremely hard to save money. If someone has an unsteady job, any factor not planned for causes additional stress on the family. People lower on the SES are more likely to have lower life expectancies, worse health outcomes, and lower education prospects than individuals higher on the SES. Idk where you're from, but look up the social determinants of health. That's another great resource for understanding why people struggle. https://ontario.cmha.ca/provincial-policy/social-determinants/https://www.booktopia.com.au/health-psychology-edward-p-sarafino/book/9781118425206.htmlThis textbook discusses how stress affects the human body, especially when children are younger. Children put through higher levels of allostatic loads (stress) are more likely to develop autoimmune conditions, mental health, and additions. Children born into abusive homes are more likely to have increased neuro-connectivity in the amygdala causing a drastic increase in \"fight or flight\". I'm not saying that the original couple are likely to be abusive, but, financial troubles is a major issue for why couples break up. There is science behind that, I'm not even going to skim my textbooks for information regarding this. If you look up anything related to finances and couples, lots of results come up relating it back to it. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.smh.com.au/money/planning-and-budgeting/financial-stress-is-big-cause-of-breakups-how-to-moneyproof-your-relationship-20170908-gydyc5.htmlRelating back to the OP, I'm 24 myself still in university. I couldn't imagine having a child now (I'm also confirmed CF), but that doesn't mean that everyone my age is like that. However, the way you reacted is very much YTA. Yes, there is science to back up your claims, but that does not mean you should \"play the devil's advocate\".", "link_id": "t3_f1pi3r", "time": 1581353259}}

It's a day surgery and you can go home the same day - with no complications. I have to start with the fact I had a supportive medical team behind me that allowed me to get one as young as I did. But the process there is most likely talk to your family doctor, get referred to a gyno, if they approve, get referred to another gyno for confirmation. Then get a surgery date. The survey day itself if different everywhere, but mine went like this: arrive two hours early before your surgery. No eating after midnight the evening before and only clear fluids (apple juice, black coffee or tea, ginger ale, etc) up to two hours before your surgery. You're going to be moved in and out of multiple rooms as they double check you and take blood, hook you up into an IV and give you sedation medications to help your through surgery. Finally, they'll bring you to the OR. The OR is what freaks me out the most. Here I am sitting on a table and all the doctors and nurses introduce themselves with me and explain why they're there. I had two nurses and three doctors including the anaesthesiologist. They put something in the IV that makes you extremely drowsy, it's like instantly behind it with an extreme body high (if ever had weed edibles might understand the feeling, it's just stronger). It becomes hard to concentrate, and they will put an oxygen mask on to make sure you are doing okay. Eventually, everything goes black and you're just out. Waking up is different for everyone, I have very negative experiences waking up since I wake up in a panic attack. This is a me thing though and nothing bad on the procedure. It's happened before to me.I'm currently sitting 7 hours out post op. I have back pain (common side effect from the air they use during the procedure) and I'm using a heating pad on my incisions and a electric blanket on my back for soreness management. I wasn't given any type of pain meds to take home. Just take Tylenol when needed. No antibiotics. So, using heat currently is a good thing to help soreness and pain.

I can explain though why the Keto diet can help with mood disorders, particularly bipolar disorder though. I have bipolar disorder and, because of that, I have done research into this diet and how it works. There is still limited amount of research though outside of case studies. Many people that have bipolar disorder aren't actually out of balance with their dopamine and serotonin receptors like many with depression. It's commonly a misfire of neurons similar to someone with epilepsy. Often, people with bipolar disorder will often be taking some form of epilepsy medication because of that(I take two types) to balance things out. The Keto diet was originally used to help people with uncontrolled epilepsy when medications didn't exactly exist the way it does now. It changes our body from running on carbohydrates to running on ketones. It's a small change, but in the brain it makes a big difference. Since in some ways BD and epilepsy are similar, it can help control the symptoms. BD is very different that depression when it comes down to it, the way it is handled in the brain. It's common to have depression for only a year or two or after a traumatic event compared to BD which is a lifetime disorder. If someone was to change their diet from the typical diet most have now, it would help to promote the change needed in the body to get out of the slump.

In Northern Canada there can be 10,000 people without a family doctor meaning walk-in clinics are the go to which equals long wait times and sporadic hours. Even if you have a family doctor, it can be best to go to a walk in clinic as it is quicker than waiting for your family doctor. In Urban Canada like Toronto, it's finding a doctor that is accepting patients, but again, it's the ratio. Walkin clinics have a lot of pros to them in both senses, a major con is you're a number and they're treating the symptom not the root problem. I once needed to be taken to emerg for a potentially life threatening rash that covered my whole body, that equaled me getting into the bay within 10 minutes and hooked up to an IV. Compared to the time I had a severe panic attack where I hyperventilated until I couldn't feel my limbs and they put me in a quiet room for 4 hours. Ah, memories of all the different medications I've taken.&amp;#x200B;It always seems like the severity is often correlated with speed. In both cases for me, the emerg phoned my family doctor and I was in to see him the next day for check up and debrief. This was also in more of a rural setting.

{"e5skghc": {"text": "Something really important to note is that 25% of people with schizophrenia won't have a medication that works for them. I don't have schizophrenia but I do have bipolar disorder and some of my medications are used for people with schizophrenia. Side effects can include basically everything you can imagine. Going off of a medication known as Lamotrigine, common side effects are dizziness, shaking, sleepiness, loss of coordination, double vision, blurred vision, nausea, upset stomach, back pains, sleeping issues, weight increase and/or decrease, worsening symptoms, suicidal idealizations and thoughts. Long term usage side effects are things like hair loss, vision issue,  short term memory issues. Atypical antipsychiotics are also used which have a wide range of side effects too. Almost no one on any serious mental health medication gets it right on the first go. We take a literal concoction of medication considered to be experimental and we are the experiment. When taking medication like this, it effects more than just the symptoms of the condition. Many antipsychotics have side effects with antibiotics, antihistamines, and other medications. Certain foods interact with the medication. You're not suppose to drink on medications due to the increased risk of multiple things.Something I've had to come to terms with for my medications I take is that I'll most likely have a shorter life span due to the quantity of medications I take. It'll be a higher quality of life, but a shorter life span.

Fun times all around. Okay, more psychological talk. Reason medical professionals tend not to believe it is because of the way it manifests. BD often is defined as long withstanding periods of elevated or depressed swings generally weeks or months at a time. URC tends to manifest, well, rapidly, and emotional swings like that can be similar to other conditions. Borderline Personality Disorder and BD are often confused with each other as they have many of the same traits; especially when it comes down to URC. The impulsive traits, anger, irritability, black and white thinking, depression, etc. Personal experience with URC, it's... Complicated. It sucks, It's hard to do anything with.

All the little skin folds and crevice, make it squeaky clean. It ends up tasting just like you're licking someone's skin. At first it was one of the things that threw me off, but eventually it's just that. Skin that you're licking/sucking. In my mind, it's really no different than hickies or kissing, just with a penis. Also, make sure he is fully aware no cum in mouth. Deal breaker, no sexy times, gag gag. I felt the same way for a long time. Eventually it didn't bother me to have it in my mouth, but I still don't like swallowing. How you decide to give him oral is pretty much up to you. The main thing to me now is just remembering that the penis is just sensitive skin. When clean, it should taste no different than licking his hand. Some people like it when people don't clean up, but preferably, for me, PLEASE clean your dick. :) I hope this takes away some anxiety relating to it.

If looking at books such as the very well know *Interview with the Vampire* by Anne Rice, there is a lot of homosexual undertones in the between the main characters, even with them raising a vampire daughter together. It's very interesting looking at academic literature around this topic because of how much vampire literature has changed in the last 100 years. Even the great and revered *Dracula* can be viewed as having a homoerotic relationship with Jonathan, from the way the text is written. However, *Dracula*  uses the homoerotic undertones to describe otherness.   As for homosexuality as a whole, I disagree with your opinion on it; however, depending on the vampire literature you're reading or watching, it is fully up to the author to use it to their advantage or disadvantage. It common to see vampires still have the same tics and quirks they had as humans because, often, vampirism only changes their physical body and not their mental state. On top of that, when you're dealing with a creature thousands of years old (possibly) that lived in completely different time era than you, who says \"faggotism\" was bad there.

Have fun meeting them most of all. It can be very fun, however, don't be surprised if you end up not liking them. It's very possible to end up feeling resentful about their \"better life\" than you had. This happened between my sister and me. She resented my \"better\" life because she was physically and emotionally abused by our parents (quotations because I'm on this page for a reason too, I was adopted to \"heal\" a broken marriage... never works). Later down the line, we ended up working things out and now we're the sibling that get along the best out of all of us. I have another brother who was adopted out, oldest of all of us. Once they got back in touch with him, my birth-mum ended up basically disowning him and refuses to speak with him due to her basically preferring her beautiful image of \"Joseph\" the son stolen away from her by her mother. If you want a relationship with that sibling outside of your parents, I highly suggest trying to keep up with him without them. It's possible that that could happen to you too. You might end up hating your sibling altogether. Their life might have been very difficult too and if there are any common mental illnesses in your family (genetics are a bitch) they could have it too. My other brother is... a piece of work. I refuse to speak with him due to, well, his corrupted nature.

{"dw6xdoh": {"text": "I've been doing keto. It's a strict diet that has health benefits that help bipolar disorder^1. It still requires CICO but it doesn't really require exercise the same way other diets do since your body changes from metabolizing carbs to ketones. Anecdotally I've found that it has worked very well for me and has helped me maintain a better mental balance but it is *very* strict. Check out  if you're interested in more details about it.1. A lot of this is still in preliminary discussions within the academic communities about its effectiveness with BD. A few case studies have been done examing it, however, it is not enough to say will work for everyone. A more in-depth look at why it works is that the keto diet was originally designed to help individuals suffering from epilepsy that wasn't treated well with medication (back in like the early 20th century). Basically being on keto changes your body from running on carbs to running on ketones.  Medications like depokate (or valpuric acid) are epilepsy medications that effect the same area of the brain that ketones tend to therefore can create a better overall health. That being said, it could very easily be said that it's because the diet is very strict and eating healthy on it is a must. therefore creates that feeling in general.

It is November at the time, it's not a great time to be on those types of roads in Northern BC, as it is possible that there is a lot of snow on them. The officer thought that he might be a poacher. After a second officer arrived, they approached the vehicle and noticed the driver had blood smeared on his face. He says it's because he was poaching but he had no carcass on him, the officers call the conservation officer to do some tracking on his vehicle. The officer found the body of Loren Donn Leslie, a 15-year-old girl he murdered in the snow.

The second day in the trip we got to one of the first rivers, my Aunt and I were in a canoe that didn't turn very quickly and was very back end heavy no matter what we did. This river was moving fast. My uncle was in front of us with their two grandsons in that canoe. Our canoe ran into a log jam and flipped. I was able to scream as it flipped and my uncle watched in terror as he saw both my Aunt and I race to try to get put of the water with a canoe pushing on us. There was a log jam not far after that first one that I got pinned against with the water rushing onto me pulling me down. I luckily wrapped my arms above the log jam and held myself up. My uncle walked onto the log jam and held my arms for me as I eventually got tired of holding from the weight of the water pushing against me. My Aunt was lucky enough that she was put onto the edge of the log jam and was able to crawl her way along it. My uncle told md afterwards he was terrifed that if I went under it was certain death for me. It was a long jam, around 100 feet of just tangled logs and branches with water pushing you through it. They eventually got me off using rope to pull me. Ha, then the third day happened. I'm still fresh off of my best death experience when our canoe runs into another log jam. Luckily it didn't tip and it just gracefully landed on it. I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life being on that log jam, I remember staring into the water and seeing this small cyclone in the water. I had to walk onto the log jam to pull the canoe over it. Once I got into it I was fine and did so methodological. My Aunt wad able to get onto the log jam after a bit to help me push the canoe over the log. Just as I was suppose to get back into the canoe I watched as my Aunt fell into the cyclone under the log jam. Nearly the longest seconds of my life was watching if she would come up the other side. She eventually did and a few days afterwards showed is the nasty bruise she got from the branches that attacked her underneath. The canoe trip went swimmingly from there on out.

When John got married (all of these are back in the 80's), the brothers got John as drunk as possible the night before his wedding. Once shitfaced, they put him in a cab and told the cabby to drive as far as possible with 100 dollars and leave him there. John ended up about three hours North of the city in a different town. Oh, and the brothers managed to make it worse: they took his shoes, wallet, and all forms of money John had before putting him in the cab. John made it back to the wedding about 20 minutes before it was supposed to start. Tom also got a wonderful wedding present like this. Although a lot less severe. The brothers got him shitfaced, a common theme in all these parties, and managed to get him in the drunk tank at the Police station for the evening before his wedding. Now, my father, Luke, also got the lovely prank. Although, he managed to prank them back. The brothers do their common theme of getting the groom hammered, but they ended up locking a heavy chain around my father's neck and walking him from bar to bar in the city and locking him just outside of the bar. People would ask him what was going on and feel bad enough for him that they'd bring him a beer every so often. Around 2 am, they brought him to a park and chained him to a tree and left him there. Morning rolls around and a jogger runs by, Luke gets his attention and asks if he could get someone here to unchain him. Soon the police come and get him out of his chains and all have a good laugh. Luke phone his wife-to-be and gets her to phone his mother explaining that she hasn't seen or heard from Luke since before he went out with the brothers. My mom says she heard my grandmother scream at the brothers to wake up and she starts laying into them to find Luke and it better not be one of those pranks that they play on each other and so on and so forth. Of course, once the brothers get to where Luke was, he's no longer there and they're confused as hell.

He invited me to a bar to hang out for a bit since we hadn't seen each other since my birth-grandfather's Celebration of Life that previous summer. The whole time I was there visiting my birth-family, he was getting drunk somewhere else and I only saw him once that whole weekend. Anyways, I sit down and it's about 12 pm and he's already had about three long island ice teas and a burger. He tries to get me to have a drink too, but due to having bipolar disorder I rarely drink and if I do it's only around people I trust. He starts heckling me about not drinking, and I'm very honest about the fact I don't drink due to mental health reasons. His literal response: \"Oh yeah, they once tried to put me on some kind of medication shit, but I didn't like the way it feels so now I just drink my worries away\" Awesome. A few minutes later, he starts asking me about some things I do in my free time. My favourite comment was \"So, why do you hang out with the gays?\" due to my volunteering with the local LGBT organization and marching in the Pride Parade, etc. \"Oh, because I'm bisexual\"silence. Then, \"But you have a boyfriend... does that mean you're not monogamous?\" \"We are monogamous, being bisexual doesn't-\"\"I don't care and I don't want to know.\"Thanks bro. idk, I guess this is more of a rant than anything.

He loves to say things like \"I never finished school and yet I'm smarter than 80% of people in university\". He does nothing with his days but drink.

It wasn't well maintained and he didn't really care about the house, so he didn't maintain it at all himself. When I first moved in with him when I was 15, he had a girlfriend that he'd stay at more often than at the house. Thing is, this house was *creepy* old. I lived in a house that had wallpaper literally peeling off the walls, when the wind blew you felt it throughout the house, the house itself didn't have a \"furnace\" instead it had a single heater in what was supposed to be the dining room turned my father's bedroom. In winter (I live in Canada), the floors would feel like ice, during a snowstorm the windows would blow some snow into the house. Jeez, I accidentally broke a window in the house and my father never replaced it. To this day it still just has some industrial styrofoam over it. If you dropped something in the house that was liquid or ball-shaped, it would roll to a specific spot in the house. I guess one of the worse/creepiest things about this house happened to be the basement. I already said this house wasn't properly maintained, but this basement was the worst. It was more of a cold room because that time era people needed those, but due to improvements over years it became the place that the hot water heater was moved into and the shut off for the water was. Due to a leaking faucet and my father being too lazy to fix it (which my uncle fixed in LESS THAN 30 MINUTES, and before someone says \"maybe your father didn't know how to fix it\", no, he does. It's literally his Job to fix things like this at work but he never does anything at his house &gt;.&gt;) we had to turn the water on and off manually. To get to the basement, you had to open a trap door under the main stairs and go down about eight steps. That doesn't sound bad, but the whole one side of the wall was caving in so when you originally had about 45 cm to work with was cut down into half of that.

{"dqkppu1": {"text": "I happened to be part of an open adoption. To make a terrible story short, my birth-mum was sexually assaulted when she was very young and had a child from that abuse. She ended up giving birth and that son was adopted out via closed adoption. It wasn't her choice, tbh there is more to the story but it's really heartbreaking and disturbing. This leads to how I was adopted. My birth-mum ended up with two children (not adopted) living on welfare by the time she was 22 and couldn't afford life. By 23, she was pregnant with me and she couldn't afford nor care for another child with her mental health, money, and other issues. She was a friend of my extended adoptive family and ended up finding out that my parents were looking to adopt for various reasons not worth getting into. She thought they were the perfect family and chose to let them adopt me. There were conditions she asked for and this was the major one: She never had to be my \"mum\" but I had to know my siblings. As a child, I was ashamed of the fact I was adopted. The feeling of \"my birth family doesn't want me\" and things like that. My parents were very good at NEVER making me feel like my adoption was a bad thing. Although they ended up getting a divorce when I was about five which lead into a bunch of \"I broke apart my new family\" type feelings. Although I knew about my birth family, I knew very little about them since we lived very far from them. I \"first\" met them when I was seven or so. Later when I was about twelve, I met my sister and I found out I was an aunt. The older I got, the more I realized I am *so* happy I never lived in my birth family's household. I may have faced abusive in my adoptive home but it seems better than what my birth family was/is like. Education was never important to them, alcoholism is a very common theme, mental health problems are rampant, teen pregnancy is extremely high, etc. Sure, genetically I have mental health problems and other genetic conditions that are because of my birth family, but fuck, I feel like I dodged a bullet being adopted. I was born to a one night stand of drunken stupor and my birth-mum has no idea who he is. Half of me is a complete mystery, I sometimes wonder if I ever met my birth-father if it would be a good idea. But honestly, I've come to the point that I'm happy with being at a distance from my birth and adoptive family. I am very lucky in certain aspects.

{"dqevh0l": {"text": "Something I wish people understood about Bipolar disorder is that it isn't instant mood swings. There is no size fits all medication. There is no cure. It's an episodic condition. Someone with bipolar is more likely to be depressed than manic due to doctors being unwilling to prescribe antidepressants to bipolar folks due to the likelihood it'll trigger mania. Mania isn't fun. Hypomania isn't fun. Extreme irritability, lack of sleep, not eating, sense of constant dread, forced talks, feeling like your mouth isn't moving fast enough to talk, rapid conversation jumping, shaking, paranoia, hyperfixation, spending ALL your money because it's a \"good idea\", hyper sexuality. A lot of people know what depression is or at least some of the effects of it, but a lot of people don't understand hypo/mania. One of my best friends who had depression asked me what the downside to mania was because people often describe it as \"being on top of the world\", yeah, you can feel like that. But you basically can destroy everything else around you while being there. Mix-states are terrible. The feeling of depression with the energy of mania. Medication can work for a while and then stop working. Blood sugar is extremely important and finicky.To this day, I correct people that say \"oh she's just bipolar\" or \"that's bipolar of them\". These types of conversational lingo can be a reason why people don't seek help. Bipolar is so much more than just mood swings, I wish people would understand that.

It's important to note that my department didn't have a manager because she was fired two weeks after I was hired for I don't know what reasons. I was left as the only full time employee in that department with a bunch of part timers. Anyways, this new girl was okay. Mediocre, rude, and snappy. I was 18 at the time of training her and she was 23. I remember telling her that she needed to fill a certain wall of doom (small hanging pieces, no one liked filling it, but it was her second day and she needed to learn). I stood beside her helping her for a few minutes explaining things and I noticed she missed a few spots. I pointed to the item she missed and to the empty spot and she snapped at me. This was the first thing she did in what turned into a chaotic two months. The store was fairly small and the staff all knew each other by name; we often got together after shifts to hang out and just be friendly with each other. So you have to imagine when this new girl goes up to people that know me both at my work and outside of work and calls me a terrible person and other nasty names how they would react. Since I was no longer on the floor as much as I was previous, she tried to turn the floor against me and failed spectacularly. This might be extremely petty, but basically what caused her to get fired was when she went to the store owner (open door policy, if you felt the floor manager or store manager wasn't doing their job you could go to him) and tried to tell him that she was being bullied by all the staff. Other staff had complained about her behaviour and her complete and utter disrespect for me and the part timers in the department.

Well, I'm very proficient in cooking, and genuinely enjoy cooking so I asked her if I could borrow a few pots and pans while I was staying so that I could make some meals, and she agreed. One day, I decided to make spaghetti. Just spaghetti and some sauce heated up, we didn't have meat or really any spices so the typical boring spaghetti and sauce meal. I go to boil the water. He asked about salt to add to the water.I say basically salt is irrelevant, it changes very little to spaghetti other than boiling temperature. He basically says he refuses to eat it without salt in the water. I refuse to cook and we did something else for dinner. Anyways, a few days later, he brings out a different pasta (may I mention we had a few days before too) and says that this one doesn't need salt. I, internally, lost my shit. I refused to make the pasta and basically, politely, told him that he'd have to make it. I'd help him, but I was not his mother and, in no way, making the pasta.

It only requires 5/9 to be diagnosed and because of that, it is considered one of the highest diagnosed personality disorders there are out there. The issue with this is that most people with other personality disorders *don't realize they have a personality disorder*. Someone that has antisocial personality disorder is unlikely to realize that they have it, but many people with BPD can self-recognize symptoms. This being said, this doesn't mean that BPD does not exist, it most certain does, but looking at the DSM that is supposed to be for clinical practitioners who understand the jargon and self-diagnosing, as someone who does not, is a very bad idea. If you believe you have the symptoms, you're more likely to present them and rationalize your negative behaviour with the idea. Even if you think you present all the symptoms, there is probably a very good reason behind why your therapist is not diagnosing you with it. BPD is already over-diagnosed and misrepresented a lot. If you feel like you need a certain type of therapy try for Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is probably one of the most common therapies that are done.

I also have a little bit of a different perspective on this than others might have because I'm studying psychology in university. This might not work perfectly with what you and your SO are going through, but hopefully, it'll give you some help. Medications/therapy is important. As much as you love your partner and want to help him, you cannot do anything unless he's helping himself. It's extremely important for him to realize the strain and stress that he puts on you if he is not even trying to help himself. The on and off again cycle of medication is a really big warning sign that he believes that after a while that he's \"cured\" or \"fine\" once he starts feeling better, which is not the case. Bipolar is a lifelong mental illness that requires medication the majority of the time, and the only exception is when discussing with a psychiatrist. Hypersexuality is a thing, but people can control it. This is a sad point to make known, but if he truly did not want to cheat on you, he would not have. If you are completely monogamous this should be a warning sign to you because even in a hypersexual state people are able to direct it towards someone or something. The manias can make it difficult to rationally think about doing so, but it's still possible. But this leads back to proper medication and therapy. For this particular case, it's therapy and how to work through bouts of irrationality and hypersexuality. Next, blaming it on his mental illness is never a good sign. Mental illness a reason for difficulty within one's life, but it, and never should be, considered *the* reason someone does or doesn't do something.  There are exceptions to this, but him using it as a manipulation tactic is wrong. If he cannot see that, you have a problemI understand that you want to be a supportive partner and, in all ways, it seems like you really have been but there is only so much you can do. My SO likes to say \"There is only so much warmth you can provide a person before setting yourself on fire for them\".

This being said, many asexuals have a very active sex life and some do not. It's really up to you to figure out but because this is your first few times, I really suggest trying to relax before deciding. Going on from that, sex for a while can be very... lackluster. It takes practice and understanding in yourself to be able to enjoy yourself fully in it. If you had high expectations for sex to begin with, you're going to be disappointed.

Yes, it does take a mental illness and sensationalize it, but it does a great job at explaining what real people with DID face on a regular basis, even the stigmatization in academic/medical circles.

Well, one day we were in our drama elective and goofing off; to be honest, we were being little racist dickheads without even realizing it then. We were making stereotypical cheers and chanting in a circle, after a bit I got tired of doing so and decided we should get back to what we actually should be doing. I touched one of these girls arms but because she was still moving my hand missed and it touched her boob instead. Well, I tried to apologist but she got so offended that I accidentally touched her that she reported it to the teacher, who subsequently reported it to the principal, and the next thing I knew we were in some sort of \"therapy\". Want to know something stupid though? It was grade 7's giving up advice on how to better our friendship and it never actually helped anything. A year later the same girl ended up getting busted for wearing makeup against her parents wishes in school. I took more pleasure in knowing that her parents made her do additional homework than all of the other students.  ", "link_id": "t3_4xymkj", "time": 1471366211}}

I had a bilingual friend that often would hang out with me and I swore I asked him how to pronounce more words in his native tongue than what we spoke in English.
