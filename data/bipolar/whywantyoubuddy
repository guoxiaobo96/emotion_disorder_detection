Teachers across the US are walking out in hopes of getting higher pay, which is great and we deserve the respect and salary raises we are fighting for. However, it does mean that going for art education right now is something to really contemplate. You'll be sinking in money and time into a professional that you might not really want to be in. Reading into what you've stated about yourself, I would suggest finding non-school teaching opportunities. Local art museums and community art organizations typically have art programs for the community. This would be a great place to flex your skills as an artist and still pursue a part time career in instruction. These types of teaching opportunities are also devoid of the assessments, school meetings, conferences, etc that go along with being a teacher. If you want to be serious about teaching in a classroom setting, I would suggest getting retired from an accredited college with a strong art education program. You'll want to get into a classroom and student teach with guidance from professors. Maybe find a way to shadow a teacher now and get a feel for it. Explore different schools in different communities as well. Pay scale will vary. Underpaid by all standards. Public sector will typically net you a higher salary and better benefits. Private will usually be lower by at least 5k to 10k and won't have as strong of benefits. Growth in positions will depend on the needs of a school or district.

Would you be willing to do a small map where it's a few modules with check points and a room where it starts the perma death? My map basically has a player start within a cylinder volume around it. That way it activates some settings I have in place. It has about 4 or 5 modules for a linear game. It has a room where it locks and spawns several hell knights. It unlocks when they are all killed. So I want that room to start the perma death. So its like, the player can risk not spawning again for a reward or get killed and lose the match. I have a volume in that room that engages the encounter. So I would love for there to be a way to disable the original gameplay settings, enable the new settings just for that challenge area (which is about 6 small modules connected together), then disable the gameplay and go back to the previous setting. Sorry if that sounds confusing. I really really enjoy making maps a lot and want to learn as much as I can. Are there any good videos on buleans and things like that?
