Full blown manic episodes are not these productivity/happiness overloads that you feel when hypo or in the beginning of a manic episode.On top of that, depression ALWAYS comes around and makes it difficult to do ANYTHING. Idk about you but even knowing the good things that bipolar can make me feel and do I would definitely not lump it into my personality. I\u2019ve personally never felt like killing myself but based on my personal experiences, all the information out there, all my friends with this disorder and all the people on this sub - if we were in a different period (generals or not) most of us would probably have ended up getting hunted down for being crazy or committing suicide.", "link_id": "t3_ccox5r", "time": 1563029077}}

I was diagnosed with bipolar a month ago and that\u2019s when I started taking lithium. Honestly I really like that I take vyvanse because the lithium definitely makes me a drag a little bit. I feel like they kind of balance eachother out for the majority of the day I guess. I don\u2019t take it every single day, some weekends I\u2019ll take off to reset my system if i feel like my tolerance has gone up. I also like that I can skip a few days without any major repercussions. I know a lot of medication needs to be taken every single day to work and what not. Just my experience!
