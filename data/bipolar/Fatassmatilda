I find nobody really judged me for being bipolar well at least to my face and some jobs even have me accommodations. But idk after this last hospitalization which lasted 5 months I had to get a new job. At home my family knows I have mental illness so even though I react to something appropriately they always say I'm over reacting and must of \"not taken my meds\" so idk I got an interview and everyone told me not to talk about my mental illness so I didn't but my resume is so bare because I can't use any job I've had as a reference and I'm 22 so having one job on your resume looks bad. I do however have alot of.volunteer work from my stable days so I talked about how I have bad anxiety and instead of going to lunch room at highschool I taught special needs kids. My boss really respected that because he has special needs kids and he hired me just based on that story. So my co-workers do know I have anxiety but they do not know I'm bipolar. I dont think they would judge me if they knew but I made the personal decision to not tell anyone because of how I'm treated at home and I wanted work to be a \"safe place\" and it works for me. I will never tell them and I stopped over sharing. It's made work do able for me . Longest job I've ever had. But I do not think telling ur work your bipolar is hypothetically bad but you have to read the room but never hide who you are but just keep some things private if u can because even today there is so much stigma like crazy amount but most people will not care they either understand or don't but some are willing to learn and I find a rare few will actually use it against you.

I want Justice for the things done to me, or for someone to say \"that's terrible, it's not your fault\" but I've never come across that. So romanticizing and fantasizing is all I got. And it makes me feel disgusting but for once in my life I don't feel like a victim. I don't know. I probably not explaining myself we'll n I know people will judge me.

{"elznf3f": {"text": "I would not change a thing. Not to say living with bipolar among my other mental illnesses is a walk in the park but it's turned me into the caring, empathetic, loving person I am. I am queen of the misfits and all the misunderstood. People flock to me because they know I don't judge and they admire the way I've accepted who I am and want me to show them how to live that way. Honestly, if I wasn't bipolar I most likely would have a chip on my shoulder cuz I was the hot cheerleader in school and I would of turned into one of those Instagram fitness tea models. Instead I spend my time trying to help others and educate those who have stigma against mental illness. Actually if I wasn't bipolar I don't think I would want to go to medical school I'd probably would of been content being a house wife. Psychology and the science of medication deeply interests me. I know my purpose on Earth is to help others with mental illness and I could never have done that if I didn't know what it was like. Bipolar doesn't define me but it definitely showed me I am a complex human being and there's more to me than looks.

He said I would be fine this time because I take gabapentin which stops the RLS.
