{"fqy2d0r": {"text": "It varies day by day, and I would assume varies based on where your focus is. Eg I'm in supportive living for adults primarily mental health diagnoses, 93 beds and 1.7FTE assistants working with new. I'm thy only therapist, normally I'm one day a week at our other site but no longer with covid. With our resources a lot of our focus goes to recreation participation rather than functional intervention and leisure education. This is often the case in these type of settings from what I've seen, although I've also seen it in hospitals with large tr departments where I worked as a casual therapy assistant and where I first attempted my practicum in another mental health hospital with small units - I didn't go through assessments or intervention /treatment plans for any client at either facility and was never instructed to do specific interventions with specific clients, generally just go invite and do what is scheduled with whoever comes. Of course leisure participation is important in overall well being but its such an over emphasized part of our profession.Since we normally focus on rec participation and only offer interventions to a small caseload (like max 10 between myself, two assistants, and three personal support workers, which usually all occur between m-f), a lot of the stressful times I experience relate to feeling like I don't have enough time to do the work I need to do along with also doing rec participation tasks such as developing a general rec calendar (I prefer not to just have the same thing every week repeating and try to vary it a little bit), helping with organizing big events (which was never what I went into rec for). My duties generally involve creating a monthly calendar, shopping for supplies as needed, updating or starting new assessments (we use fairly generic, non standardized assessments and this is something I wish we changed a bit such as having a leisure inventory list rather than just asking so that there's a bit more to go off of), developing treatment plans for those on intervention, charting and documenting on program attendance and interventions, planning for intervention group programs and recreation programs, going to case conferences, facilitating programs and interventions, other misc meetings that come up, doing audits as necessary... That's the main gist of what I do. Not daily but some things I will do very often and others less often.I find that any stress I feel only really every manifests from lacking time to do things, and then especially if I voice my stress over having to work late or not be able to do everything and I get \"well that's what happens when you're in management\" from my boss. She's great but... I don't agree that just because you are management that it entails doing so much work that you aren't even following your designated hours or become so flustered with work that you become burnt out sooner. I also have bipolar disorder which I know affects things like memory, concentration, ability to handle stress, but this isn't disclosed. Perhaps it if were I wouldn't get that reaction. So for example we've have a lot of turnover in our 0.7fte position, and our full time likes to call in sick a lot, so some days I end up being the only person on site to do everything recreation. I'd be expected to run ideally 2 programs at least, but then maybe I also need to catch up on assessments or I need to plan for something next week or I have case conferences and meetings etc. In February we had the 0.7 for maybe a few weeks before letting her go, but while I was helping train her my full time called in sick a handful of times which meant I was alone or just with the part time and had to be with her visually at all times because we were monitoring troubling concerns. This meant that for a few weeks I did very little of my administrative duties. Or other things got forgotten, or postponed... And if I express that frustration in not really met with the most support. It has at times made me want to go to hr to see if we can work something out, or to speak with my boss herself as I have no fears of discrimination from her, as I feel it is important that there be a better understanding of how I might need a different form of support.The duties of the job themselves, assuming staffed properly, aren't all that stressful or at least no more than any other job likely would be of a similar quantity of work. I'm sure that there are things I could do to make those tasks quicker, better prioritize my time, so that I'm not feeling like I don't have time for everything. But I think that the biggest issue as I've already mentioned is the lack of support in this vein regarding that lack of time, that if I express frustration or unhappiness i don't get empathy. Or I'll get from my boss \"I wad in charge of 345 beds both sites and only one assistant for everything and we did everything on our own\"... But then I'm guessing that they likely didn't run 4-6 programs a day, she didn't do programs and interventions every day, etc. Really it's job dynamics that creates the most stress for me, not at much the duties.", "link_id": "t3_gjl1f1", "time": 1589741463}}

I have struggled with anxiety and even panic attacks, but this is now very minimal and few occurrences once I got the moods themselves stable. My guess is that big episodes of anxiety were due to my episodes rather than just a comorbidity. Your panic attacks are going to be linked with anxiety, so maybe you don't need two pills for each - especially if you can have management of anxiety through mood stabilization, maybe you'd only need PRN for panic attacks. Or your can just use one medication for both purposes. So looking at your meds, maybe you could come off Cymbalta and try just Trazadone at a higher dose of Abilify doesn't work well on its own.

So for some that will be sedentary, but this is not the case for all people. With my job being on average half desk work and have on the floor engaging with clients, as well as doing normal activities of daily living, I find my neat is closer to lightly active. So let's say that this option yields a 2300 maintenance (atm I can't recall the exact number for the estimate). With a 20% deficit I could set my goal to 1840. This is what I eat every day. If I do any exercise, I then add those calories to my goal. So if my workout burn is approx 200 calories then I eat 2040 calories that day.Option 2 would require setting your activity goal to reflect your neat and exercise you do regularly. So for me I normally would be lifting weights 4x per week, which in average is moderate intensity or between moderate and vigorous, and about 70 minutes let's say for duration excluding rest between exercises. So with that activity my activity level is closer to usually very active on drop down calculators (based on having maintained data and comparing to calculators). So let's say that puts my tdee to 2900. With 20% deficit that means I would consume 2320 calories per day.Option two is great if your routine is consistent. I used it for years but switched to neat because it gives me more flexibility. Whichever you choose you should have similar results, assuming activity level in both are chosen correctly and that you are choosing correct intensity levels for you exercise (ie don't go with vigorous if you're really only moderate. Your rate of perceived exertion is actually pretty well aligned with actual energy use so IME as long as you know what each intensity level is supposed to feel like for your regular exercises you should be fine with estimating your needs).", "link_id": "t3_gcncrh", "time": 1588522796}}

I don't even know how that would be remotely possible. The only \"bias\" (to go along with your wording) is if you decide to eat your food without logging it first or at all, and then find you've eaten too much. Which then ties into you're logging incorrectly. Let's take a typical breakfast for me. My current daily goal is 1800-2000 for weight loss (Latuda did a number on me with regards to binge eating so I still struggle with that every day even though I've not been on it for a long time). For breakfast I might have some eggs, bacon, fruit, maybe some Greek yogurt. Here are my steps:1. Decide what I'll be eating (ideally the night before if it's a work day as I'm more prone to over eat on work days) and pre log those foods in estimated weights/quantities.2. When actually preparing the food, weigh it as it goes on my plate (if not needing to be cooked)  or before putting it in the frying pan.3. Change the weights on my app every time I weigh something.4. Eat.Within two minutes I'll know how many calories I'm going to be eating for breakfast. If I do this for 3 meals of the day then I have a good idea before the day even starts what my day will look like, so that I have a good distribution of calories across the day and balanced macros with higher protein (especially something I need to really focus on with covid and no longer powerlifting). As you can see, eat is my *last step.* you track what you're going to eat, not what you've already eaten. There is no bias in tracking. I just googled, found one non scientific article indication bias towards eating more because you exercised... Which is actually the correct logic. The issue here is only if you overestimate energy expenditure in any step (too high neat, too high tdee, adding calories to your goal through exercise but you've already accounted for exercise on your initial estimates, etc). If you choose to eat before you log, to eat above your goal because your don't care (rather than because you're finding it hard to stay full at that amount) then that's your choice. Regardless, even if you don't manually track your intake, you need to eat at a caloric deficit to lose weight, and tracking helps keep you aware of your intake, accountable to your actions, and can make it easier to fine tune your eating habits for best results.As for the second point, op is doing just that - going online to see if she can find second opinions, and clearly based on her wording, hoping to hear from others who share her comorbidities. Those are excellent people to get info from, as she can then use that to go back to her doctor to ask about specific medications. This is what I did in my example with Abilify. I spoke with many users here regarding efficacy with depression symptoms, side effects, etc and went to my then psychiatrist to ask about this medication, to which I was denied despite saying that the medication I was on wasn't working and him telling me that it actually was (ie not listening to me). My current psychiatrist himself has said that we don't have all the answers about how things work, things are still trial and error. Medications get used off label because they are found to work, people can have varying responses to medications. It's foolish to restrict a patient to only a portion of medications that are available (for their specific cases) based on literature, when all of these antipsychotics are labeled for use with bipolar disorder. Meaning when I go to my psychiatrist and want to try new meds, he knows that my preference is to try medications that have low incidence of weight gain, sedation, and sexual side effects. So we work together to pick medication and adjust dosages. Even when I was on wellbutrin from my old psychiatrist and he asked me about that, I said it had been working for me and he said well that's fine even though anti depressants and not strongly advocated for with bp treatment (making my old doctors choices ironic). I ended up going off it later on but he was still using the combo of his knowledge and **my lived experiences** to shape decision making. This is a quality not all doctors have, and patients must advocate for themselves. Op here is clearly working towards trying to advocate for herself in wanting to find alternatives that may have better side effect profiles and still safe for her.", "link_id": "t3_fyigey", "time": 1586539870}}
{"fn09eax": {"text": "Op has every right to see if there are other options that are safe for her with lower weight gain side effects. Tracking caloric intake is actually far from imprecise unless *you* track imprecisely. Meaning if you don't weigh or even at least measure all of your food, don't use accurate entries based off of usda data or direct from labels, don't take care to log your recipes properly, etc then you will see lesser results. But if you get an average starting caloric expenditure estimate and create a 20-25% deficit from that and read up on the correct way to log most efficiently and accurately, you'll see reasonable and predictable losses in weight unless you're an outlier (greater or lesser muscle mass than average, greater or lesser neat than average, which would both simply mean adjusting your goal up or down) or you have metabolic issues such as what could be happening with op due to  medication. Weight loss is all about math and numbers, you're going to have a significantly easier time eating fewer calories than you burn versus burning more calories than you eat through exercise as that is not at all predictable. No amount of Cbt will reverse any metabolic side effects from medication, and if her issues are just due to overeating then Cbt won't change how meds affect her hormones and thus her cravings and hunger. Caloric restriction **is actually the only method. Doesn't matter how you achieve it, you cannot lose weight unless you consume fewer calories than you expend through daily living and exercise.** unless you're eating only fast food and high caloric foods, you're unlikely to accidentally erase your deficit from your food choices. Just because someone went to med school doesn't mean they are competent. My first psychiatrist was young and very focused on following \"the science\". I was prescribed Latuda by my gp before starting with him and I had bad weight side effects along with some others. Went off it after 6 months and tried lithium with very poor results, then I went on a journey of going off and on Latuda along with wellbutrin and lamotrigine. I regularly told him I wanted to try other things because of the Latuda side effects. At my last appointment with him I told him that I wanted to try something new, and from having talked to people on Reddit here I decided I wanted to inquire about Abilify. He said no, because based on science Abilify will not work for my depression-heavy presentation, and he would only allow me to try either Seroquel or another (maybe risperodal?) because they are for depression side of things. And he said let's stay on Latuda because it's working for you.... The reasons I wanted off Latuda were not just weight gain, but also sedation (those other two meds he suggested are very bad for that) and that *it did not positively change my moods and help me get out of episodes.* All that it did was keep me in whatever episode I was in prior to going on it. So I had bouts of being depressed on it and being hypo on it, and it was great and keeping me in those states. And even with me saying to him that I was still having issues with feeling depressed, he said that it's working for me. Suffice to say I changed psychiatrists and my current one immediately agreed to letting me try Abilify, and it was one of my preferred medications for symptom relief. Even though first doc said it would do nothing. Doctors aren't perfect. Some of them are just plain shit at their job or are great at making their patients not feel heard, respected, etc. If OP is feeling like she wants to explore her options, that is something a *good doctor* will do with their patients.", "link_id": "t3_fyigey", "time": 1586537815}}

That doesn't mean that your body will respond to it the same as the other medication because of differences in non medicinal ingredients which could in theory change how your body absorbs medication, or maybe you have an allergy to an inactive ingredient, etc. But your reaction to generic A does not necessarily reflect how I would react to that same generic. From what I can tell there does not seem to be conclusive evidence scientifically to support the claim that overall generic medications are inferior to name brand medications, and I am not finding anything indicating particular generic makers are inherently less bioequivalent than others.This article I'm reading through is actually pretty interesting, here are some snippets : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3721767/&gt; The concept of individual bioequivalence proved to be an intermezzo but it proved to be useful after all. Critical and clinically relevant questions were asked about the traditional concept of average bioequivalence, and this concept emerged strongly. In particular, the crucial question, namely whether bioequivalence implied therapeutic equivalence, was answered in the affirmative. In a highly competitive market and litigious society such as the United States one would expect cases of therapeutic inequivalence of bioequivalent products to be publicised quickly and widely. Nevertheless, Rheinstein15 could state in 1990 that \u2018To date, there is no evidence of therapeutic inequivalence in a properly manufactured generic drug which has been approved as bioequivalent by the FDA\u2019.A literature search conducted by Gould11 10 years later to answer the question whether average bioequivalence implied switchability of drug products in practice came to the same conclusion: essentially no evidence of therapeutic failure of bioequivalent products could be found. Chow and Liu2 reported how in the United States innovator companies file citizen petitions in order to convince the regulatory agency (FDA) that a generic copy of a brand-name drug will not achieve therapeutic equivalence even if the generic has been shown to be bioequivalent to the brand name drug. Those authors cite no case of a generic that has been approved as bioequivalent by the FDA but has been shown to be therapeutically inequivalent to the innovator. [However, it should be noted that there are classes of drugs whose safety are particularly sensitive to the conditions of administration. For example, responses to immunosuppressants, and the contrasts between different drug products can vary with time after transplantation, the target organ, ethnicity and concomitant disease conditions (e.g. diabetes) of the patients.16]In summary, the fundamental bioequivalence assumption, namely that bioequivalent products are therapeutically equivalent and can be used interchangeably, has survived strong scrutiny; scrutiny that was inter alia a by-product of the discussion of and research on the individual bioequivalence concept. The conventional concept of average bioequivalence seems to have served the consumers of drugs rather well.It also talks about the equivalency range being different for drugs with greater or lesser range of therapeutic index as they call it. I don't know if this has gone into effect or was just a recommendation, I believe it is in effect on EU if I read correctly.", "link_id": "t3_fi8gl9", "time": 1584150470}}

The Dermatologic Drug Eruption Scale (Table) lists the signs of a potentially serious rash.2 Patients with severe reactions should be referred to an ED or urgent care center (where they are usually treated with a prednisone taper).Rechallenge is a reasonable option for many patients who discontinued lamotrigine after a rash. Among the 85 published cases of lamotrigine rechallenge, none developed Stevens Johnson syndrome; however, 10% to 15% developed a second rash.2,7 That risk is lessened by retitrating very slowly and waiting at least 4 weeks before reintroducing lamotrigine. Start at 5 mg/d and increase the daily dose by 5 mg every 2 weeks until 25 mg/d is reached. Then proceed with the standard titration.2 A dermatologist should be consulted if the initial rash was serious (eg, \u2265 3 on the Dermatologic Drug Eruption Scale [Table]).", "link_id": "t3_feobpf", "time": 1583565279}}

Honestly in the real world I've only encountered goals and objectives in regards to true intervention plans in my practicum and in my current job. In my first try at practicum (not under ctrs but within the most common organization for therapists in my province) I did not see any assessments on the patients in my month there, let alone goals and objectives written for them (but then again in a whole week there were about 3-5 programs total, not daily but for that actual whole week, and that's with two therapists for two units with maybe 15-20 patients on each unit).In my current position we started our writing using cheat sheets to help with understanding wording, structure, and the types of goals that made the most sense for our mental health and dementia clients. For those first few months we definitely were taking extra time to draft our goals and objectives to make sure we set realistic goals and objectives and utilized performance, condition, and criterion in our objectives (although i would say I'm the only one of us four therapists actually really sticking to that three part formula).Your first month will likely be just shadowing. Assuming your preceptor does true intervention plans, you will be able to see how they write them and practice with them. You can always have your reference materials with you to develop those goals and objectives. It still can take me a bit to figure out the right objectives and it has taken us a while to learn what are realistic objective time lines for our clients.Yes, you'll do a project or maybe more than one for your course. Mine was a project meant to develop something that could be left with the site, so I developed a music based fitness program that runs for 6 weeks with specific things we were measuring which I decided on based on the literature I read to support this program. I took the whole four months to develop it from start to finish, and my preceptor was the one who suggested the premise of the program as it was something she was interested in having at her sites. Yes you may contribute to care plans (based on my own experience in health care you are NOT responsible to writing them, that is the nursing department's job - for us that falls under the role of what we call case managers). Yes you will do presentations, which will probably only be in class for your fellow students and based on specific assignments. You're likely not going to be expected to just right off the bat start doing an independent job as a therapist. The first half involves a lot of shadowing and learning and slowly growing into independence.I felt very much like you, worried I made a mistake with the field even though I excelled in the tr courses, especially as my psych degree background complemented the rt degree. But getting into the practicum itself showed me that it was what I did want to do and my fears decreased early in the practicum. You have the knowledge even if you feel like you don't, unless you just barely paid attention and just coasted. You'll learn to feel more confident in your knowledge and ability even if you start off very dependent on your practicum supervisor.

I believe lists multiple programs on their side bar for beginners and other levels. Beginner programs will utilize linear progression and if you're unable to follow that progression then your weight is too heavy and form is likely incorrect.This website (https://powerliftingtechnique.com/how-to-warm-up-for-powerlifting/) has the warm up routines I use now and it has helped with my strength as I used to warm up inefficiently and tire out larger muscles before my lifts. Form on my bench has very likely been contributing to my plateau which I'm still working on. Form will vary for everyone based on body proportions but there are some fundamental things that apply to all lifters that need to be part of your unique form. Eg on squats you can either low bar or high bar, wide or narrow stance, wide or narrow grip, but your knees should always track with your feet so that you don't experience knee Valgus which can lead to injury, and the lifter should aim to achieve parallel (top of thigh parallel to the ground) and raise the butt at the same time as the chest. Deadlift your lower and upper back should produce a straight line from top to bottom and shoulder blades for conventional should be over the bar vs sumo arms themselves should be perpendicular to the bar as much as possible and fully lockout without hyper extending at the top. Bench should always touch your chest without bouncing off or sinking deeply and there should be some degree of tucking in the elbows on the descent with more flare on the accent and there should be at least a mild arch to the back and elbows should be directly or slightly in from the bar when it's on the chest. But all of those lifts can then be adjusted for your proportions and to best utilize leverages.Pick a linear progressive routine that is well established, set your protein higher (eg 0.8g/lb) and at least have high carb around your workouts, start with very light weight, warm up properly, set a moderate deficit (usually 20% below maintenance), and monitor your form.", "link_id": "t3_f84zt0", "time": 1582466406}}

{"fifxtie": {"text": "HIIT doesn't involve strength training. Any cardiovascular exercise can have benefits for some lean mass retention for the specific muscles being most utilized, primarily if combined with a high protein intake and non excessive caloric deficit. But you're not going to bulk up doing HIIT, eating high protein, and eating at a caloric surplus, in the way that you would if actually using free weight exercises with progressive overload included.Based just on article abstracts (either lack of access or not wanting to read full articles at this current moment), this article suggests there is no difference for actual fitness results between both forms of exercise and that HIIT is actually perceived as less enjoyable https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4657417/Another study suggesting similarity between metabolic effects on metabolism syndrome with no significant difference https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28558739Another one showing no significant difference for vascular function and only a difference in aortic pulse wave velocity (unfamiliar with what this is). - however the study had both groups working out 3x per week and I would assume for a similar duration, which Imo is not an ideal approach since HIIT can often lead to on average higher intensity utilized versus if you're doing lower intensity. Eg if you run for 20 minutes you'll probably have to walk for at least twice that amount for a similar caloric expenditure, and it could be that this is echoed for other fitness parameters.Another one stated \"Low-volume HIIT (51\u2009min/week) was as effective as high-volume HIIT (114\u2009min/week) and MICT (150\u2009min/week) in ameliorating MetS severity.\" ie metabolic syndrome https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28846513As far as body composition, this article seems to counter your claim: \"These data suggest that low-volume HIIT is inefficient for the modulation of total body fat mass or total body fat percentage in comparison with a non-exercise control and MICT. A novel finding of our meta-analysis was that there appears to be no significant effect of low-volume HIIT on lean body mass when compared with a non-exercising control, and while most studies tended to favour improvement in lean body mass with low-volume HIIT versus MICT, this was not significant. However, despite its lower training volume, low-volume HIIT induces greater improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness than a non-exercising control and MICT in normal weight, overweight and obese adults. Low-volume HIIT, therefore, appears to be a time-efficient treatment for increasing fitness, but not for the improvement of body composition.\" mict is moderate intensity continuous training ie steady state cardio. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401727I was able to find a study indicating effects on body composition but it was in conjunction with strength training. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26484952This study suggests some greater benefit to visceral fat loss with HIIT, but like one of the studies above my worry is that the two groups were not equal in that HIIT and MICT were both done 3x per week. HIIT was 29 minutes, mict 50 minutes, or 87 vs 150 minutes each. Generally speaking moderate intensity duration should be double that of high intensity duration to have similar benefits, so that means mict group should have averaged 174 minutes. It's possible that having the exercise spread out over 5 days for 35 minutes or 4 days for 44 minutes or 3 days for 60 minutes could have increased some of the benefits, but that's just a hypothesis of mine https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31903682This study also suggests HIIT might b fee better for losing visceral abdominal fat but that there are similar changes in body composition with both types of cardio. However I do have concerns /questions over this part of the conclusion - \"Overall, energy intake and physical activity levels did not vary from the beginning to the end of the intervention.\" does that mean that if everyone ate at their current maintenance and did not lower their intake in a way that resulted in everyone losing the same amount of weight every week to account for rate of loss variable affecting visceral fat loss, that some groups inadvertently created larger deficits? And the only group that also included resistance training was HIIT, why not also a fourth group for mict + resistance training? But this part of the results seems to contradict your claims - \"When expressed in percentage, total FM, fat-free mass, and muscle mass were significantly modified only by HIIT + RT training. FatOx did not change at rest but increased similarly in the three groups during and after exercise. Therefore, the HIIT-induced greater FM loss was not related to higher FatOx during or after exercise.\" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524825I could look for others but overall it doesn't seem like there is any conclusive evidence to support the claim that HIIT on its own better supports lean mass retention and change in body composition and that benefits overall for health are similar. My take on this: utilize the type of exercise you most enjoy and utilize other means to best support any specific body composition changes you're interested in achieving (ie high protein intake, moderate vs aggressive deficit, strength training, frequency of cardio and strength training, etc)", "link_id": "t3_f6lrn3", "time": 1582394255}}

Of course it burns fewer calories. The same would happen with hiit cardio. Same happens with lifting weights, you won't build strength by not increasing the weight, you'll just get better at lifting that same weight. Your body also burns fewer calories when you weigh less overall. A half hour run for me would not burn the same as someone twice my size even if we had the same exertion level and the same terrain etc. Years ago when I only did cardio, I only did steady state cardio and I increased the resistance whenever it started feeling easier.

{"fg26fyu": {"text": "I'm a recreation therapist in supportive living working with adults (30-90+) whose primary diagnosed are mental health illness. I am the only rec therapist to 93 beds and have 1.7fte assistant under me. My work follows apied process - I assess all residents and determine if any should be placed on specialized case load to have specific intervention provided. This will include more specific goal setting with measurable objectives. I plan our monthly rec participation calendar and our intervention people as well as the two groups im running. I implement programming, mostly just for intervention purposes. I will assist with larger programs and run one normal program at most once a week or every other week. I evaluate how things are going by doing follow up assessments with case load, looking at program stats to see if programs are still being enjoyed, and getting feedback from residents. I document things as necessary, not just related to intervention plans but if course any normal day to day things going on. I will do other managerial tasks such as case conferences, meetings, shopping for supplies as needed, creating program plans when there is time, etc. I mingle with residents when I can and very much love the clients even when there are behaviours. I worked for a few months as an assistant prior to this at our sister site which also has mental health but also dementia. I've worked with dementia as an aid before as well and did my practicum in long term care. I do not find those populations to be any less engaged than my current clients, as a lot of it has to do with what you're providing them, how you engage with them, learning about them and sometimes just doing a group activity has to be done by going from person to person or having smaller groups over the time span. In older adults we can get as few as 1 person for a program or like 20+. It's really usually coming down to how the staff approach getting residents involved.I enjoy everything about the work other than I feel like I don't always have time to do all of my work. I also recently have been having negative experiences with one of my staff and some managerial coworkers so I'm really not a fan of work place drama. I'm also not keen on the focus being rec participation and I wish we could focus more on the specialized programming but considering we don't have much for staff that really wouldn't work. I like that it helps me get out of my comfort zone and be more involved with people and that I get to engage with a population in personally passionate about. I don't love how draining it can be though, and having my own mental health diagnosis (bipolar) i have been finding the recent staff drama to be triggering for my mood although thankfully it hasn't destabilized me... But eg in a meeting this week being completely disrespected and not having my expertise listened to (no other managers on site are in recreation or have rec experience), I started to shut down and really would have benefited from stepping out for a few minutes but I couldn't do that. I've only been a therapist for a year so I know that I'll continue to grow into being a manager as it takes time to get comfortable managing others.

{"ff0u3s6": {"text": "Then the third article...\"with regard to bipolar disorder, research on cytokine action is still scarce compared with studies of schizophrenia and depression.Some studies reported increased pro-inflammatory cytokines(Kupka et al., 2002, O'Brien et al., 2006) and Th1 (T helper 1 cell) hyperactivity in bipolar disorder (Breunis et al., 2003, Maes et al., 1995, Rapaport et al., 1999, Tsai et al., 1999, Tsai et al., 2001), but other studies failed to confirm this (Maes et al., 1995). The Th1\u2013Th2 balance in bipolar disorder and the effect of mood stabilizers on the balance are still controversial.Regarding the effect of mood stabilizers on cytokines, Th2 cytokine production was found to increase after lithium treatment (Rapaport and Manji, 2001). However, some researchers did not find any significant change of Th2 cytokines following treatment in bipolar patients (Su et al., 2002). Taking all findings together, the Th1\u2013Th2 cytokine balance in bipolar patients in the manic phase and the effects of mood stabilizers are still at issue.\"\"3.3. Changes in cytokine levels before and after treatmentAfter 6 weeks of treatment, the levels of IL-6 significantly decreased (Table 3). However, there were no significant changes in TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, or IL-4 values before and after 6 weeks of treatment. There were no significant correlations between the changes of the cytokine levels and the changes of the BPRS or YMRS total scores. Manic patients showed a decrease in IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 ratio after treatment (Table 3).\"\"We demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly elevated during an acute manic episode of bipolar disorder. These results are consistent with some previous studies that showed higher production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in bipolar patients (Kupka et al., 2002, O'Brien et al., 2006). However, in our study other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 were not different between the manic patients and normal controls. These results are in disagreement with earlier studies that demonstrated Th1 hyperactivity in bipolar disorder (Breunis et al., 2003, Maes et al., 1995, Rapaport et al., 1999, Tsai et al., 2001). However, another recent study showed that IL-2 production was not significantly different between pre-medicated manic patients and normal controls (Liu et al., 2004). In our study, the different activities of these inflammatory cytokines in bipolar disorder suggest that specific subtypes of cytokines, monocytic pro-inflammatory cytokines, may be associated with the immunopathogenesis of bipolar disorder.\"Based on this it does seem that the inflammatory differences between affected and non-affected people is not set in stone, is still contested, and cannot be irrefutably proven. At least not currently. None of these articles addressed whether or not lifestyle changes could improve symptoms though, just that lifestyle changes could potentially reduce inflammation in the body that is also found in other illnesses/disorders that may be co-morbid with BP. I was also looking to see what kind of research there is on lifestyle changes and BP though, and found this title \"Pilot study of a lifestyle intervention for bipolar disorder: Nutrition exercise wellness treatment (NEW Tx)\"\"Background:Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) are more likely than the general population to develop riskfactors associated with cardiovascular disease, one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in thisclinical population. To address this disproportionate medical burden, we developed Nutrition Exercise andWellness Treatment (NEW Tx), a lifestyle intervention for individuals with BD.Methods:In this study, participants were randomized to NEW Tx (n= 19) or a treatment as usual waitlist(n= 19). We examine the intervention's efficacy to improve the physical and psychological outcomes of in-dividuals with BD. Assessors were blind to participant condition throughout study duration.Results:The NEW Tx group reported increased weekly exercise duration and overall functioning, and decreaseddepression and illness severity over the study duration. However, only improvements in functioning were sig-nificantly greater in the NEW Tx group than in the control group. There were no group differences in weight lossor mood symptoms over the study duration.Limitations:Limitations to this study include lack of objective measurement of exercise and a small and relativelyhomogeneous sample.Conclusions:These data suggest that a manualized lifestyle intervention for BD may not be ideal to improvelifestyle changes in this clinical population. Further research is needed to pilot personalized approaches tocreating a healthy lifestyle in BD.\"So some promise but it's not cut and dry. Would be an interesting read if anyone wants me to email them the full PDF (I am reading through an educational institution's database that requires a student or teacher log-in). I've also previously read at least one study indicating that exercise can actually induce manic symptoms if too much exercise is done - which is something I can actually attest to based on personal past experience. This isn't the original article I remember reading but this came up in my search: \"Exercise in bipolar patients: A systematic review\"And looking at the summary table of the studies, some of the interesting ones include:\"\tIncreased physical activity was associated with high incidence of BD. Co-morbid mental disorder associated with less exercise\"\"Vigorous exercise was associated with BD II and alcohol dependence\"\"Almost 50% used exercise to regulate symptoms. Exercise had different effects on mood according to intensity\"\"Less exercise was associated with higher BMI, depressive symptoms, lower quality of life and functioning. In contrast, more exercise was associated with mania\"Overall some pretty interesting stuff, although I wasn't able to find any research articles specifying the ways in which engaging in activities/lifestyle adjustments that are meant to help reduce inflammation can also help reduce bipolar symptoms. Perhaps my search terms were just not specific enough, or too specific. Who knows.", "link_id": "t3_er14q5", "time": 1579472329}}
{"ff0u2ql": {"text": "As a heads up, this will be a 2 comment response due to there being too much text for one response.Thank you very much for sharing. Going through these articles now...Reading through the first article right now... I find this interesting: \"Moderate increased levels of C-reactive-Protein (CRP), and in particular hsCRP, are highly correlated to manic episodes (Dickerson et al., 2007) while high hsCRP is also a risk factor for cardio vascular disorder (Greenland et al., 2001)\" simply based on the fact that my CRP has been high since at least 2017 which is one of the earliest times it was tested to my knowledge, which is one of the reasons I was dx'd with rheumatoid arthritis this past year, but I've not had any manic episodes and at most I sometimes have had very short lived minor hypomanic symptoms or mixed episodes while being medicated. I predominantly struggle with depressive episodes. This first article is pretty much just honing in on inflammation from a cardiovascular point of view. The authors are discussing different things that seem to be associated with inflammatory conditions that are also seen in BP. \"This review highlights evidence that the magnitude of early and severe medical burden in bipolar disorder is an indication that it might better be viewed as a multi-system disorder. Secondly, it asks whether inflammation might plausibly explain the link between bipolar and cardio-vascular disorders. Although there are gaps in the evidence to support this hypothesis, the review provides an important first step in framing critical questions that could be tested in future research and changes that could be implemented in clinical practice.\"So based on that, they aren't saying that BP is caused by inflammation, but more so that there may be a link between BP and cardiovascular disease (which they are saying, based on research and after having controlled for other variables, is higher in those with BP than those without) due to inflammatory processes in the body. \"More research is thus needed to explore if immuno-inflammatory processes are general risk factors for stress and severe mental disorders, or if they are unique to bipolar disorder...What is the take home message for clinicians? Currently, bipolar patients are undertreated for co-occurring medical disorders and are less likely to be monitored and appropriately treated for cardio-vascular risk factors than the general population\". They didn't address anything regarding treating inflammation in order to treat the disorder, unfortunately.Study 2... ooh boy kind of dry and hard to get through. PIMS are pro inflammatory markers, some interesting info here: \"Inflammation During Mania or DepressionTaken together, findings regarding PIMs during mania generally provide evidence for increased PIMs, particularly CRP, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. Findings regarding anti-inflammatory markers (such as IL-4, IL-10), or imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory markers, are less consistent. For example, 2 studies have found increased levels of IL-4 among subjects with mania compared to controls,31,39 whereas a third study37 found that subjects with bipolar disorder demonstrated significantly higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, significantly lower levels of IL-4, and significantly greater ratios of pro- vs. anti-inflammatory cytokines versus controls. Relatively fewer studies have examined inflammation during bipolar depression, although elevations in several PIMs appear to overlap with those elevated during mania, including sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, CRP, and TNF-\u03b1 (see Table 1a and Table 1b; e.g., Kim et al.,31 Papiol et al.,44 and Middle et al.47). Finally, there is preliminary evidence of increased IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 during depression versus mania, and increased sIL-2R, IL-4, and CRP during mania versus depression.44,55,56Changes in Inflammation After Treatment and/or Symptomatic ImprovementMost studies that have tested for associations between PIMs and treatment and/or resolution of symptoms have not reported significant findings. The nature of this association may vary between cytokines. Several studies regarding sIL-2R and IL-6 suggest that changes in these PIMs are associated with treatment and/or symptom resolution.29,45,54 In contrast, although several studies49,53,55 have found increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 during mania and bipolar depression, significant associations with treatment and/or symptom resolution have not been reported.\"More specific to lithium in this section: \"In summary, it appears that lithium attenuates the pro-inflammatory milieu in bipolar disorder, although the opposite effect may be observed among nonbipolar disorder subjects. Although studies of bipolar disorder have examined changes in inflammation following medication treatment, to our knowledge, none have examined whether inflammation is a moderator or mediator of treatment response. Preliminary data from MDD indicate that treatment response may be predicted by certain baseline IL-6 levels, whereas TNF-\u03b1 levels correlate with changes in depression symptoms during treatment.60 It remains to be determined whether the same correlations are true in bipolar disorder.\"\"In summary, comorbid medical illnesses, smoking, and excessive alcohol use, which differentially affect individuals with bipolar disorder, are also associated with altered inflammatory networks. The same is true of decrements in physical activity and sleep parameters. In some cases, such as obesity, there is a bidirectional association between inflammation and comorbidity. In other cases, such as smoking and alcohol use, inactivity, and sleep disturbance, inflammation is generally a consequence rather than a cause. Nonetheless, the latter behavioral parameters are inherent to bipolar disorder and may contribute significantly to the cumulative burden of inflammation in bipolar disorder.\" I take this as basically saying that these variables are associated with inflammation, reduce those = reduce inflammation. Then there's this part about anti-inflammatory meds with psych meds: \"Taken together, the findings regarding celecoxib suggest that the principal benefit of adjunctive treatment may be the acceleration of treatment response among acutely ill patients at early stages of the illness. Larger controlled studies are warranted to corroborate and extend these findings. Future studies of celecoxib and other anti-inflammatory medications are need to identify predictors of response such as age, duration of illness, comorbidity, inflammation-related genotypes, and cytokine levels in order to maximize the risk-benefit ratio of these medications. Similarly, studies are needed to evaluate whether changes in cytokine levels mediate treatment response.\" So it's not saying that it is used in place of psych meds or that it improves the efficacy of those meds, but more so that patients had faster response time for medication improvements of their symptoms with this added medication.", "link_id": "t3_er14q5", "time": 1579472318}}

Im sure bring introverted could have influenced that.Or I'll just be more productive, music can feel super... Just something else like it plays from my head rather than external.If you're having a true manic rather than hypomanic episode, you will probably end up engaging in very destructive behaviour that has great ramifications on your social and work life.

{"fbr48yb": {"text": "Bipolar disorder is a life long disorder. Think of a comparison between developing an infection vs having rheumatoid arthritis (which I was dx with this year). If you have an infection you take antibiotics for a short while, then it goes away and you're off the medication. With RA, I take my medication daily and over time my symptoms have gotten much better. I still have little flares here and there, but overall my body feels better. But if I stop taking it, those symptoms will start to come back worse. The medication didn't cure my RA, it just helps me to manage the illness, reduce its symptoms, slow down its progression (and as a 28yo I would rather not have the body of a 90yo when I'm 50). If I were to just take medication when I notice a flare, it would take time to start getting into and working in my system, and I'm essentially just setting myself up for more flares by reacting to then rather than being proactive about preventing the major ones. Bipolar disorder is the same thing. Our medication helps reduce (or for lucky ones, stop) symptoms such that we feel more like our other brain-healthy friends. Stop medication, you'll likely cycle. Maybe not right away, might not even be for months or years. But it will happen. Medication, if wanting to minimize your symptoms and the worsening/progression of the illness, needs to be taken every day.Some medications we use are not ideal for long term use, but these are the options we have. If there are side effects that come up, we work with our doctors. Perhaps in the coming decades changes will be discovered and medications will be made to be safer for long term use. But the long term side effects of medication for many will be outweighed by the real dangers of the illness being untreated.Eta my guess is that if you took your antipsychotic daily rather than prn you would significantly reduce the frequency or likelihood of any \"crises /emergencies\" and overall maintain a relatively balanced, stable mental health. Along with reducing how often you have episodes in general, even those that are mild.

He's also more accepting when sex doesn't \"go\", I have made the effort to try or even just start with kissing if I'm not feeling in the mood to see if I can get there and if we don't he's been much better about not getting upset over it (sex has been an issue since I have a low sex drive both from psych meds and from my own preferences).

Looking at the link about shallow breasts I went to another link where there was a woman with an athletic build and small breasts as well wearing I believe a 30D and the post was saying her breasts actually start pretty high. Looking at mine they are similar to hers but a bit fuller, and I never thought mine started high, so just now I put on the 34A and *really* scooped what appeared to be *all* of my breast tissue in and my nipples were almost fully coming out the cups lol.

{"f9453tc": {"text": "**What is your current position how long have you been in the field?**Recreation therapist/volunteer coordinator. I've been in this position since January this year and I had a part time rec t position for about 3 months before that where I was mostly useless. So about a year in the field as a therapist but I've worked in rec since 2016.**Why did you decide to become an RT?**I started with my psych degree, about halfway through my sister was hit by a car and went into a coma. My next year was bad in school, she had brain damage and lives in long term care and is non verbal. I had a poor relationship with her but was still really hit by it. I also have bipolar 2 disorder and have struggled with depression since my early teens. I've always wanted to work in a field that helps people, and after her accident I thought of going into occupational therapy. I had a chance to volunteer in my third year and kept doing it into my fourth year, where I realized I didn't really like it. Also volunteered with pt and rec t and really loved both of those. But I thought of I'm not doing OT I'll become a psychologist. After graduating I took a few courses for prerequisites to grad school and one was a counselling interviewing course where I practiced with my parents. I had panic attacks literally in the middle of practice. The whole 4-6 months of applying to grad school I kept thinking about rec and whenever I read up about it it seemed to better fit with who I am and what I want to provide for people. I got into grad school and into a ba for rec after that and declined my grad school offer. **Is there anything that is unique about your position or the population you currently work with?** I don't think my population is that unique other than its not acute or impatient but rather residential mental health. So they live there permanently and I am always working with the same people. It's also unique compared to most recreation therapy (at least here) in that we are actually trying to provide goal based programming for specific clients. We have rec participation but now that we're properly staffed we've been providing (slowly) interventions that are goal based for the resident's specific goals and needs and interests. Most places and everywhere I've worked does not do this, even a major hospital that has 40-some staff just in recreation, they just do participation. What I learned in school is quite different from the reality of most places. **What is a typical day like?** Don't think I have a typical day. Things I might do in a day include assessments (initial or update), running a program, doing intervention, planning programming and researching things, developing my calendar, going to meetings, shopping, mingling with my residents, documenting and charting, lots of emailing or phone calls to places or people, coordinating monthly outings, writing my intervention plans... Some days are busier than others, lately has been pretty busy though. **What has your career path looked like?** I'm new to the field but basically was during school I worked as an aid in a retirement home and eventually casually as an assistant in a rehab hospital with various populations did my practicum with ctrs in long term care, when I graduated I started on as an assistant the following month with supportive living mental health and dementia units, two months into that I got a part time job as a therapist in supportive living and dementia and worked there 3x a week and stayed on twice a week as the assistant, then I got a full time job with the company I started with as an assistant and I've been there since.**What jobs and experiences prepared you for your current position? **My practicum prepared me for true therapeutic recreation. My own illness prepared me to be able to understand and connect with my population. My psych degree is a good adjunct to my profession not just for mental health but overall and has helped with the research side of things. **Is there anything you would have done differently in pursuing your current position?**Possibly different university. My program wasn't rt specific, just a recreation one but had the option for rt. There were few rt courses, and it doesn't lead to certification. I had to take additional courses through other schools to have enough courses for Nctrc, and thankfully I was able to have a PhD student at the time with his certification act as my school supervisor. I think I'm the only graduate from the degree to have taken that option (a group of us essentially petitioned to make it happen) so I'm glad the timing worked out. **What skills are most desirable and important in this field?**Personally I would say compassion, good interpersonal skills, not being turned off by lack of cleanliness, able to have fun and a good sense of humour, ability to treat people in an age appropriate way (ie don't baby talk an older adult and ideally don't baby talk even children Imo), ability to work under pressure, ability to work collaboratively with others, having a good balance of task and person orientation, at least some creativity (honestly I'm not that creative), open to trying new experiences, good communication skills both oral and written, comfort talking to strangers, patience. Those are the main things I can think of**What is the most rewarding part of your job?** Development of genuine relationships with your clients, being able to see clients benefit from what you do with them (eg seeing a client socially isolated coming to group programs and chatting with others after your interventions), being able to provide people with an improved quality of life that isn't just focused on the strict physical health but on a more holistic note. **What is the most challenging part of being an RT?**People not understanding what you do, what your job is, what your purpose is, what your scope of practice is and what your treatment can provide, being seen as just someone offering fun and games, not being taken as seriously as other medical fields, lack of being a regulated profession affecting some of the things we can do.", "link_id": "t3_e26cm1", "time": 1575077622}}

But those foods make up, calorie wise, no more than 10% of my intake on the days I consume them. As well, my caloric intake is appropriately set to not be so low that it reduces my ability to obtain overall nutrients my body needs. Op is 17, quite tall, and still on the heavier side, meaning 1000 is definitely not appropriate for her especially from a nutrition stand point. We don't just need to have a well balanced macro intake, but also micro intake. Looking at a serving of quest protein chips from their website, a 32 gram bag only has 140 calories and the only micro with any notable amount listed is calcium at 15%. The other nutrients are below 2%.Based on this website http://www.exercise4weightloss.com/teen-calorie-intake.html she could maintain on as much as 2500 even though she's sedentary. She's lost on average 11lbs per month which is an aggressive rate, if she eats let's say on average 1100 (and assuming actual accuracy with logging) then she would maintain possibly around 2300, which isn't that far off the initial estimate I provided. If she more often eats around 1000, that maintenance goes down by 100, if eating 1200 most of the time it increases to 2400. Considering the variance in caloric intake from fast food (ie could be more calories than listed in nutritional info) and possibly from the dinner she eats, she could be eating a bit more than what's logged.Let's say that her average tdee is 2300, a deficit of 1100-1300 calories is not at all recommended especially taking into consideration her age.It doesn't matter if she's eating supplement based foods. They are not nutritionally rounded to also provide a variety of micronutrients. If only 700ish of her calories are coming from foods with greater micronutrients, she's still missing out on variety of foods which reduces the variety of nutrients she's consuming. With her very low caloric intake, since you're so focused on macronutrients, her fat could be too low for hormonal health - recommendation is 0.35g/lb minimum or ideally closer to 0.4g, which would be about 60g-70g a day or 45%-50% of her upper caloric limit. In her op she's said nothing of her macronutrients intake, looking at the chef meals only some of them are high fat which means many days she'd be eating too little fat. As for protein, even if you use a low recommendation of about 0.6g/lb which for her is 102g, she's eating on average possibly around 60-80g which is definitely low for supporting lean mass retention (not just muscle but also bone mass).So yeah, op could stand to greatly improve her diet for health reasons.", "link_id": "t3_dy7h9k", "time": 1574197399}}

Any time I've wanted to switch, pdoc gave me the options that he suggested based on side effect profiles I wanted to avoid, and from those I would choose the one I thought might be best to try, either based on side effect likelihood or cost when I didn't have insurance /benefits.

The first two could easily be from medication and if that's the case you should speak with your psychiatrist and discuss adjusting your medication. You may also want to talk to your gp about blood work or other tests for fatigue if you've struggled with it before going on medication. I have struggled since I was about 13 which coincides with my first depressive episode, so I'm aware that some of my fatigue is just due to the disorder, but I also was diagnosed this year with rheumatoid arthritis after pushing for some blood work (didn't even suspect RA but Dr requisitioned lots of less common blood tests). So there could be a physical cause. Or it could be the disorder, if you're chronically in a low state. For me medication I've been on has definitely affected my energy levels, the last few I've been on and what I'm on now don't though and I do think that the RA medication is having a positive effect on my fatigue now. I've been working full time just over a year after graduating last summer and the fatigue definitely did make it hard, especially the first few months. But even on one medication that really affected my energy I still made it to work. So it's very possible that you can too. You may need to work with a therapist to address stress management especially if there are particular underlying causes at play making it worse. I also know how different school vs work life is, so it might be good for you to try part time work first to get into the swing of things and see how you can handle it.I've never worried about romance stuff or living arrangements but I only just moved out earlier this year (28yo).

{"f2gf5vn": {"text": "You'll require a degree to be a rec therapist in Alberta. If you're set on being a therapist and not just an assistant, then you have some options...1. Take a diploma and try to work for a little bit to make some money and gather some work experience, and if you're still interested in being a therapist then take the post diploma through Lethbridge which is online.2. Look to see if you qualify to take the Lethbridge post diploma right now, as they changed it a few years back to allow applicants with non tr education to apply. https://www.uleth.ca/future-student/post-secondary-transfer-student3. If you're not concerned with having your ctrs, as it's not currently required in Alberta, you can look into the uofa BARST program and see if the admissions people can help you see what credits will transfer over and how long it would take to complete the degree. I did my degree through this program having done a psych degree at the same university before this, and it took 2.5 years to do the BARST program with me taking courses every semester including spring and summer. I also took additional courses through uleth and EWU online so that I could sit for the nctrc exam. When I was finishing up the degree one of the PhD fellows who has his ctrs agreed to act as program supervisor on the school's end so that anyone doing a practicum under his advisement could do the practicum with a ctrs. I'm not fully sure if he's still acting as the practicum supervisor for students who request it since I believe he has moved to Regina, but if you're going to look into this as an option consider asking the practicum supervisor for the department of he's still in the role - Tristan Hopper is his name. If I could have chosen a different degree to take I honestly would have as this degree is not rec therapy specific, but I was still able to get into a good position with it.Therapy assistants make 24.08/hr minimum, goes all the way up to around 30/hr based on experience, through AHS only. Covenant health and capital care are very similar but do fall behind by a dollar or two. These companies are hard to get into, and most often hire internally. So you'll likely need to start off with temp and/or part time positions. Other organizations can pay far less. My company currently pays on par with HCA wages, which starts at about 20-21 an hour for diploma, yet the therapists are making AHS wages. For assistants I believe Bethany Care Society pays the same as AHS, or maybe its Bethany Group. Some private places will pay terrible wages for therapists as well.Alberta is a great place for having greater chances of landing a higher paying job, but it's no guarantee. My first therapist job with points west living payed 28/hr, which is mid tier. I'm making 35.81/hr now, not with AHS.Btw I'm in the same city as you based on your posting history, so if you have any other questions I'm happy to chat with you in pm or even in person if you're interested.

In 2012 my older sister was hit by a car, which I found out about around 10pm the night before I was supposed to go write a final exam for my uni class. It was my last exam, wasn't ready for it, and either earlier that day or the day before while being driven to campus I remember thinking to myself that I wished I could be in a car accident or something like that so I wouldn't need to write my exam. I was living at home at the time so my parents ended up going to the hospital, I think I stayed home... Emailed my professor bawling my eyes out. I had a very strained relationship with my sister and we were not on speaking terms before this happened other than cordially at family occasions.She ended up sustaining severe brain damage, was in a coma for months. It's been over 7 years, she's alive but she's non verbal save for some noises she'll sometimes make, doesn't walk, lives in a long term care facility. So yeah, she's not dead, but she's not really *here* in the same way.We weren't close as I said, and with what I had been thinking to myself before the accident I ended up becoming severely depressed for the following year if not longer. I still stayed in school but I took all of my classes only twice a week and stayed in my room the rest of the time. I barely passed many of my classes. I very likely could have been diagnosed with PTSD at the time as well, even though I hadn't actually seen the accident I did relive how I imagined it to have occurred regularly in my head. I am very easily triggered by driving related things as well which is probably one reason it took me so long to get my license. I've had near misses that have made me practically go catatonic after because of how much I got triggered. I very much blamed myself even though that makes no sense. I started getting more into drinking again in 2013 as well and did some stupid stuff.It was very hard. It's still hard, I'm definitely not going to say that it's harder than death since it's totally not fair to make comparisons like that, but it's also so much easier to be reminded of how much it has changed my family's life because she's still alive. My parents are visiting her daily, I can't stomach doing it because I feel too uncomfortable. I have to think about what's going to happen when my parents are too old to do what they're doing with her, what kind of responsibility I'll have to take on once they are too old or themselves gone, how she'll technically be there for big life changes but not really be there at the same time, how any children born into our family will grow up with her and not know her on a personal level.But it did get easier. The pain did get easier to manage. Life did go on. Things did improve for me. I went back to school after my first degree to get a degree in the field I'm working in now, and my decision to go into this field was directly influenced by this experience. My relationship with my family has gotten much better, and I was able to open up with my parents and get help with them to be diagnosed in 2015. For all the sadness it brought there were still good things that I was able to take away from it.You're very close to the pain now, it's very fresh. You'll never not have that pain in your heart but it becomes livable.

For example, your tdee may be 2500 so you eat 2000 for weight loss. Your neat or non exercise activity thermogenesis (maintenance without exercise) may be 1800. On rest days you eat 1800 and on workout days you eat back exercise calories so that on average you're eating around 2000 every day. If you set your goal to 2000 and also log exercise to eat back calories, you decrease your deficit and lose more slowly. Now lets imagine you're wanting to maintain your weight. So you need to eat 2500 on average. If you set your goal based on neat maintenance which is maybe 2350 and you don't eat back your exercise calories, you're now eating at a small deficit and will lose weight. If you set your goal to 2500 and log exercise again and eat back calories, you'll be at a small surplus and gain weight.All this means is you have to decide if you prefer tdee or neat method so that you know when and how to account for your exercise caloric burns in your intake every day.I have seen women with pcos speak about weight loss. Virtually every single one of them said that their caloric intake needs did not vary or at least not significantly from the average for someone of their stats based on calculators. At your size you would still 100% be better off increasing your intake, I would venture a guess to over 2000, so that you minimize health complications. Weight loss alone will reduce pcos symptoms and you should not require an extremely aggressive deficit to be able to do so.

My bf and I spent time together but he stopped inviting me to things because they were later at night, or he figured I wouldn't enjoy myself. Ultimately it resulted in us going on a break this week. Being the person not providing enough to the partner, I can tell you that it is something you need to talk to them about. In my case, my reasons stem a lot from fear of changing my habits because I don't want to worsen my chronic fatigue or destabilize myself by staying up late all the time etc. So we had to be open with each other to try and figure things out. Like me, your partner might not realize that you're getting lonely. Bf and I spend lots of time together so I didn't even consider he'd be lonely.

{"eytwih4": {"text": "Geodon is not the only antipsychotic considered weight neutral. Latuda, Abilify, saphris, and possibly rexulti (which is very similar to Abilify) are all considered weight neutral. Weight neutral doesn't mean won't cause weight gain, just means that it is less likely to do so than others based on research. But I've tried all of those meds and gained on all but rexulti (currently on) and geodon. Latuda is thought to be the most weight neutral and it is what made me develop severe binge eating.Wellbutrin is an atypical depressant. It can be used with bipolar but it can still potentially lead to manic symptoms. It *can* reduce appetite but that's not a guarantee, just a possible side effect. This side effect never occurred the two years I took it.You should not be seeking out a stimulant for weight purposes. If medication increases your hunger and either changing dose, pill timing, or even diet doesn't help then changing medication is a far better idea than adding a stimulant.Your suggestions for hunger with food wouldn't help me. Veggies and fruit are very easy to over eat on due to their low satiety properties. Back before I tracked my calories I was able to eat a whole bag of cherries, or three pomegranates in a sitting. That's a lot of calories that add up, and I could easily eat more after that. Although carbs and fat can be equally filling depending on the person's physiology, fruit on its own is just lots of sugar which isn't great for appetite suppression. Protein is the most satiating macronutrient which means that having protein rich snacks or meals would be the better option, or should at least be paired with carbs and fat based snacks. Some people don't do well with snacking and are better off with a few large meals.My \"tips and tricks\" include1. Track your caloric intake based on your weight goals2. If medication prevents you from eating at your necessary caloric needs based on weight goals, then either change when you take your meds, adjust your dose, or try different medication.3. If your medication doesn't change your eating habits and you still gain or fail to lose, get your doctor to test you for metabolic conditions and again consider changing medication.", "link_id": "t3_cyrtk4", "time": 1567447303}}

I regained and lost 15 lbs the four years I did this due to my disordered eating and almost weekly binge eating of restricted food, and then when I discontinued the excessive exercise in favour of more realistic amounts and stopped banning foods I enjoyed and instead worked on moderating my intake, I regained almost everything I lost because i had never learned how to eat for my activity levels or how to eat high calorie food within an overall diet to sustain good weight.Tracking allows me to eat what I want and not worry, as I am able to both adjust my intake needs based on activity levels and based on weight changes without having to guess how much I need to eat.

It was a combination of getting real world life experience that made me want to work health care, and then volunteering that made me discover rec, and that combined made me decide it was for me. Stuck through two extra years of school for it without making changes in my decision.I suggest you look into job shadowing if you can if you want a decision made more quickly, volunteer if you have more time since you'd not directly be seeing all the work done by the staff. But as a rec therapist I can tell you what my days can look like. I'm also a volunteer coordinator though which is not mandatory in the job so I'll skip over that.When I started my job in January I spent a lot of time updating resident assessments. This means meeting with them and discussing how they've been, what they do for leisure currently, are they coming to programs, do they have any goals they want to work on. Can be a 2 minute or 20+ minute convo depending on the resident. Other times you'll do new admission assessments, and depending on your clients you might not even have them long enough to update. A new assessment process depends on which Ax you use, we have an in house interview style one. There are standardized ones as well that are more scale or yes and no questions. So I meet them, have a conversation, ask for the info on the Ax, and we set a goal together. These are basic assessments for most of them so it's goals that are not intervention driven. The last few months we've been developing intervention plans, so that means setting more specific goals for a resident and having programs for them set out, which atm is mostly 1:1 visits. Then there's documenting any Ax or progress made with a resident, or any behaviours (I work in mental health). Then there's the programs. I develop a monthly calendar and have to organize how it's laid out and balance the domains, and then we run programs. I run a few every week and my staff do the rest. I am engaging with residents the whole time which can go up to an hour. I'm also developing those specialized programs, and even basic ones will need to have a program plan written.So my day varies, from working on the computer to coordinating my staff and soon my volunteers, to meeting Ruth residents for assessments or running programs. And then add in multidisciplinary things for meetings. If hands on socialization is something you thrive with then it's a great job, even myself i am shy but I really like it. The hardest part is the creative part of developing programs because it's not just so laid out already for you to develop. It pays great here but the scale varies so much country to country and province or state.

If your don't compensate by significantly increasing your activity levels or building new muscle mass, then your overall maintenance needs decrease. During the deficit itself as well, your non exercise activity thermogenesis decreases - you fidget less, might sit more than you used to, overall your body is burning just a little bit less at rest. Thus your total maintenance decreases.None of this is enough to make your caloric needs decrease so much that it's not logical to your stats at the moment.When I was 133lbs a few years ago, I was only a little more active than my starting weight of 188lbs. But my maintenance was only about 200 less at my lowest than at my higher weight, because my activity level very slightly increased, and I had built muscle mass through numerous small regains from binge eating on psychiatric medication. Now I'm up around 156lbs and a bit less active than at 133lbs, but I'm maintaining on about the same as when I was 188lbs because of that added muscle mass. I'm leaner than I would have been at this weight when I didn't do powerlifting so my body uses more energy.What I will tell you however is that from my own experience and from some things I've read (would be to do more solid research though), being at a prolonged deficit cab lead to longer plateaus. My longest 3 month plateau was broken by eating at maintenance for a week or two and then going back to the exact same deficit that didn't allow me to lose weight.

{"estj5ac": {"text": "Tracking by weighing and measuring food is not micromanaging. It is using a tool effectively. I weigh my cherries at 188g, I log it, I eat, I move on. No obsessing, no concern over whether I'm eating too much or too little. It's simply awareness of how much you've eaten and how much you have left to eat for your weight goals. You're making a shit ton of claims without any evidence and just making assumptions. Plenty of people who are naturally slim engage in behaviours that help them maintain their weight. They go out to eat dinner one night, they might skip breakfast the next day. When I was younger and lost weight through restricting what I ate and exercising, I remember I also would do things like not eat if I was drinking alcohol that day, which effectively reduced my intake for the day. Just because someone isn't tracking doesn't mean they aren't engaging in behaviours, knowingly or not, meant to prevent increases in weight. To vilify tracking is just painfully unnecessary and uncalled for.You're failing to even grasp the comment I've already made: inaccuracy balances out. I accidentally don't eat 20 calories I've logged, next day maybe I eat a bit more than I realize due to natural allowable errors in caloric values. But on average I end up eating the appropriate amount and losing at my expected rate based on my known maintenance needs. If tracking were so inaccurate or if was impossible to get even close to being as accurate as possible through measures such as weighing food, then I would not lose as expected based on my set goal. I would lose at a very variable rate that doesn't average out to the same every week. But that doesn't happen.I make a salad with raisins, I've weighed those. I know how much is in there. I make a recipe of cookies, I weigh my batter so that each cookie is a even as possible and the inaccuracies average out with their intake.Weighing a prepackaged food item can make all the difference. I have protein cookies at home. 3 at 28g for 130 calories. I need to select 4-5 cookies to reach that weight. If I only eat 3 cookies at around 23g then I'm eating 105 calories. If I consistently ate food like that that was off the label weight and was trying to bulk to build muscle, I would be reducing my surplus every day and gain more slowly. Same concept of the food weighs more than the label. The more calorie dense the food, the larger the discrepancy in logged VS eaten calories meaning greater chance of reducing your deficit and losing more slowly. Plenty of people on  have posted about stalling in weight loss, and the most common denominator is failing to weigh and measure their food and create their own recipes by scratch to know their true calories per serving.Op made it clear that they are exhibiting lax logging behaviour overall. This can easily prevent weight loss right from the start. You're clearly putting your own personal bias onto this, when you should realize that for the vast majority tracking is not going to cause problems psychologically. Hell, I had disordered eating because I **wasn't** tracking and eradicated those behaviours **because of tracking**. There is nothing inherently wrong or damaging about tracking calories, however you decide to do it. Which you've admitted that you're doing, just more loosely. If there was an inherently flawed element of tracking on the human psyche then even your very relaxed way of going about it would trigger your disordered eating.", "link_id": "t3_c920h4", "time": 1562268279}}
{"estb5el": {"text": "Tracking calories is fairly accurate when done correctly. Any little inaccuracies get balanced out over time. Meaning that I estimate my maintenance to be around 2900 with exercise, if I eat on average that amount every day I maintain my weight within a few lbs fluctuation which is inevitable and not due to caloric intake at maintenance. If I consistently eat below that, I lose. Exercise only promotes weight loss indirectly b by changing your caloric intake needs. If I maintain on 2900 and double my exercise without increasing my caloric intake, I'll lose. But if like many people I increase my intake without realizing then I don't lose. Exercise itself isn't causing weight loss, your diet is. Whether you track or not doesn't matter, only the presence of a deficit matters. Tracking just makes that deficit far more likely to actually occur and be maintained throughout the weight loss period. To assume that tracking inherently leads to disordered eating behaviours is terribly uneducated. Tracking is what allowed me to *stop* having disordered eating and stop fearing food.", "link_id": "t3_c920h4", "time": 1562264716}}

{"eptdfrg": {"text": "It still doesn't result in you eating 15k calories every day.Quoted from a website...There are several factors at work to lead you to believe that insulin is \"to blame\" for your weight gain.People who have poorly controlled diabetes also sometimes experience weight loss because their bodies are unable to properly convert food into energy. This is because they either are not producing enough insulin or their bodies are unable to use the insulin they produce properly. This food winds up as excess glucose circulating in the blood (resulting in high blood glucose!). Ultimately the body can't use all that extra glucose circulating in the blood and so it is eliminated in the urine.When your blood glucose runs high, you can become dehydrated as your body works to clear itself of all that excess glucose \u2014 which makes you think you've lost weight, but you've only lost water. Then, when you start taking insulin and get your blood glucose under better control, you start over-retaining fluids initially to make up for your dehydration, which makes you think you've rapidly gained a lot of weight. You associate it with taking insulin, but really what is happening is taking your insulin properly is just enabling your body to better use food and maintain a proper water balance.Also, once you start taking insulin injections and start getting your blood glucose under control, you now have enough insulin circulating in your blood to help the glucose get into the body's cells where it can be used as energy. So the glucose produced by the food you eat is no longer spending time in your bloodstream and being excreted out as urine. You gain weight.Your high blood glucose may have also made you feel more hungry because not all the food you were eating was able to get into the cells as energy to nourish the cells. Then, you started taking insulin \u2014 and continued to eat the same amount of food. Only this time, because your body has enough insulin to process the food you're eating, you gain weight. Before, you were getting away with eating more food because your body couldn't use it properly. But once your blood glucose are in a more normal range, you're just using the food properly \u2014 and you gain weight.", "link_id": "t3_bvxrrv", "time": 1559487825}}

Also as an aside,  you likely would not have either BP or schizophrenia,  but rather BP or schizo affective disorder.

No one exclusively eats cauliflower. Or snickers bars. You're making up people and diets that are not only ridiculous but not feasible. No one would literally eat only cauliflower and happily maintain that diet. Nor would one happily maintain eating only snickers bars. Both would lead to malnutrition and hunger. The average person eats a variety of foods every day and is they are overweight its because they consume too many calories, meaning from both their chocolate and their fruits and veggies. I used to eat a whole bag of cherries or up to 3 full pomegranates for snacks. That's upwards of 500 calories if consumed all in one sitting. My body won't negate those calories just because of their source. That's not how science works.Then don't eat kfc. Eat whatever you want within your calories. Eating whatever you want doesn't mean eating every food known to man, it means eating what you enjoy eating. Kfc won't prevent weight gain, and many likely are able to enjoy some of their food every now and then without being hungry and gaining weight. You're saying yes it's a deficit, and then saying that no one can get fat by eating vegetables. Vegetables have calories and contribute to your total daily intake. Meaning any food contributes to weight changes.You were at a healthy weight because the portions you ate of the foods you ate were within a healthy weights caloric needs. If you ate that same number of calories of the food you've been eating up until now, you would lose weight as that intake would be below what you currently maintain on being at a heavier weight. Nothing magical or special about the diet, only the calories. If you eat one donut in your entire day's caloric needs, you will not fail to meet other nutrient needs. Having one lower nutrient food for the day doesn't prevent mineral and vitamin absorption.

Yes if you plan to log exercise and eat back the calories. You can find lifting under cardiovascular on mfp and it is listed as strength training, i only count the time spent on each exercise including rest but not rest between exercises. No if you want to have exercise averaged or across every day to be eating more calories every day. Both methods give you similar end numbers, it's just about your preference and how consistent you are with exercise.2. No. 1100 for a large male is not healthy. I have a high caloric maintenance needs due to my body composition and overall activity levels so eating for a 750 deficit doesn't leave me with a tiny unhealthy intake, but if my needs were lower then I would not go below 500 deficit.3. I'm not sure what you mean. If you want to determine your actual maintenance you need to pick a calorie goal and eat for minimum 1 month that amount.

Generic recipes will not at all be an accurate representation of your recipe because you have no idea what ingredients and how much of them went into the recipe, and in most cases you have no idea what the serving is in relation to the whole dish - my macaroni casserole could weigh 2000g when finished cooking and I set it at 6 servings (in reality I just leave the number of servings at 2000 so I can take different quantities at different meals), and could be 400 calories per serving. Yours could be 3200 grams, still 6 servings, and 550 calories per serving. You can't know which one is accurate to what you are eating until you see the recipe itself and how much of everything was used and how much the servings are in relation to the total dish.

You're essentially doing multiple muscles on one workout and hitting similar muscles many times a week. I suggest looking into 3x a week full body programs for beginners or a simple upper lower split so you work out 4x a week, 2 days each quadrant. If you don't already know your 1rm then use your numbers through a1rm calculator and estimate it so that you have numbers to work with, and I would take 10% of those estimates and then use that as your training max for whatever program you run. So with my deadlift 1rm at 325lbs if I needed to reset I would use 292.5lbs as my training max. Do not use your true 1rm to base your working weight off of, it should either be based on 85-90% 1rm or a 2-3rm number. For you i would choose whichever is lower.I suggest maintaining your intake where it is and switching programs, and make sure you eat back your exercise calories either each workout day or include exercise in your multiplier to create a new goal. Try out a new program with fewer working days or just better separation of muscle groups, and after a month or two see how you feel.

I'm eating 1900 before exercise calories are included.I regained and lost for 3 years due to medication and since November the binge eating behaviour from those meds has gone away for the most part, but in the new year I plateaued for a few months. I didn't change anything about my logging, and I use a food scale and usda entries and only occasionally eat out. So I took a diet break for a few weeks. I had essentially been eating on and off at a deficit for like 4 years at this point. After getting off the maintenance intake, i am below my original lowest weight before the plateau started. I lost while still doing the same lifting program (gzcl) but a few weeks ago switched back to 531 as I feel like I've been stalling in numbers with gzcl and I think i needed the lower training max and lower percentages rather than always working at 80+% of my 2rm.I would suggest that you use a tdee calculator such as health calc or bwp niddk. You can omit exercise if you'd rather log it and eat back calories after workouts only. Take the numbers and subtract 500 from it. If you don't already, use a food scale. I would also suggest looking up whatever established program you're on and using the actual novice template. I assume ppl would mean 3 days on 4 off throughout the week (eg mwf), as that is what would allow proper rest. A simple upper lower split is efficient for most lifters and allows ample recovery time.

Also, just because you can finish school faster doesn't mean you will or that is the better choice. You might find the work load too much and have to take smaller course loads meaning graduating later than anticipated. Nurses also work all hours of the day and you may wind up having to work nights, not to mention you might have to work shift meaning 12 hour shifts.I don't know what your stability is like. My suggestion is that you take a break and find medication that makes you stable. Do some job shadowing or volunteering to learn what both careers are actually like. I turned down grad school for counselling in favor of doing a whole new degree for recreation therapy because I took a counselling interview course and had panic attacks during sessions. I volunteered in rec departments and loved it. Having practical experience is far more beneficial than blindly making a guessBut to be honest, it sounds like you're trying to make a choice based on fear. I initially decided to be a psychologist because it sounded like the safe option, and to me you sound like you're doing the same thing with nursing. You said being a doctor has been your dream, and you are trying to rationalize why you shouldn't follow your dream. You could easily have a psychotic episode being a nurse. If you think that a psych nurse has less work to do than a md, you're wrong... The work is just different. I started as a therapy assistant and now am a therapist, and I don't have more work now.

Either log exercise to eat back calories, or change your activity multiplier on loseit or any reliable tdee calculator such as the one I suggested to include exercise.

Most of those sites underestimate for me though, which is one reason I have to pick that level. I personally do the first method. I simply search for weight lifting in the myfitnesspal app and use that - i do not find the database entries to be inaccurate for me. You can even google to find other sources but your app should have a similar feature. Or you can use the machines, or even buy a heart rate monitor with a chest strap for the most accuracy.

It did make me gain weight slowly though which is why I'm not on geodon which is similar in results but I feel a bit less effective (but I'm also only on half the smallest dose so that could be why). Abilify helped me with my anger and irritability, for not induce anxiety in the way latuda did, helped keep me at a durable baseline for the most part and helped get me out of depression, really the only downside was the weight gain. It caused compulsive eating, but I already struggled with binge eating because of latuda so its possible that if that behaviour wasn't already there that abilify wouldn't have had that side effect.Pbi your latuda dose was high to begin with, even abilify at 5mg isn't the lowest dose. Perhaps you respond better to smaller doses like myself, and I would ask your doctor if you can start of with half the 5mg pills for a few weeks and then move up to 5mg based on how you feel. Then you can determine if you even need to go up to 5mg. When I was on latuda I didn't even need to go up above 20mg for the dose effects to kick in, and anything above just made the side effects worse. It didn't work for me as it kept me depressed or hypo rather than being me out of episodes, but I still didn't even need to go above 20mg to foodie that out as the increases I temporarily made for not improve the situation.", "link_id": "t3_bhtrke", "time": 1556378705}}

{"ekepdyp": {"text": "Any tdee calculator will give you an estimate of your current maintenance needs, either your tdee if you included your average exercise routine into the multiplier or your neat if you excluded it and planned on eating back exercise calories on workout days. From there you subtract 500 calories for about 1lb per week loss. The higher your maintenance and/or the heavier you are, the larger of a deficit you can maintain with fewer side effects. So at your size you may be able to handle between 750 and 1000 below the numbers given to your by calculators.You cannot know which one is the most accurate without accruing real data and manually calculating after at least a month of tracking accurately. I personally always suggest both health calc and bwp niddk as the two most accurate calculators as they are designed to allow you to calculate your needs taking into account both gym activities and non workout activities. Every other calculator underestimates my needs even if I put the highest activity multiplier. These two come a lot closer with bwp niddk being slightly closer to my true numbers. Both still have a tendency to underestimate but nowhere near other sites.My suggestion is **go with the biggest number to create your deficit from**. Especially since you want to lose 1lb per week, if you start with the biggest number you reduce the likelihood of losing weight too fast, which can result in issues such as lean mass loss, nutritional deficiencies, hunger, difficulty maintaining your deficit, etc. The \"worst\" case scenario of you starting higher is that you lose less than 1lb per week, but you've been 100+kg for I'm assuming quite some time. What's the big deal if you lose 2lbs your first month rather than 4? I'm the grand scheme of things you're going to be doing your body better justice by approaching weight loss with a healthier intake and have an easier time transitioning into deficit. It's also not going to significantly increase your time eating at a deficit.I suggest that if you calculated your neat that you log exercise and eat back the calories. Again, go with the biggest goal in this case eating back 100% of the calories. You can adjust down if you lose too slowly, but it teaches you how you'll have to eat on maintenance.

But I'm not unhappy that I was on it.You are your own agent in making decisions about meds. Ultimately all your doctor should do is help guide you to make the best decision for you, not make choices for you. In your shoes i would potentially ask about going up in dosage - how much do you take atm?In the end I ended up going off of it twice. The first time I was doing okay and wanted to see if abilify worked on its own. I developed depression and went back on Wellbutrin, but this can be a discontinuation side effect so its possible that my depression would have lifted if I waited longer. The second time I was still on it with abilify but I was feeling depressed, and having already previously tried a higher dose with poor results (insomnia and a strange body sensation) i opted to try discontinuing it since I was already feeling depressed. I did this without asking my doctor first, which others will recommend you not do, but my doctor has given me expressed consent to decrease or taper off meds in between appointments if I feel something isn't working well for me (because ultimately I can just go back to what I was taking). I told him and he was fine with that, and after a few weeks my moods got a bit better. At this time my depression was more circumstantial than brain based, but the abilify ended up working well on its own for my depression after giving it a bit of time. Now I'm in geodon monotherapy, lowest possible dose, and it's working well.If you want to go off it, that's your choice to make not your doctor's, but it's a choice that would be worth discussing with him to get his expert advice and assistance.

{"ejfsjuk": {"text": "From what I have seen it varies greatly. Comparing average wage in Canada vs the states, province to province, state to state. So I can only give you my experience living in Alberta, Canada.In Alberta CTRS is not currently required. At the moment you can become a member of our provincial body atra with either a diploma or degree in recreation and leisure or recreation therapy, and by 2021 it will be degree only to practice as a recreation therapist. However, even now there are places that hire individuals in a rec therapist titled role when that person doesn't have a recreation degree/diploma and is not a member of atra. Those jobs honestly tend to pay piss poor.There are about 5 or 6 organizations that I am aware of in Alberta that pay roughly the dame amount, with starting wage being around $35 an hour going up to $47-50 an hour. I currently work full time in an assisted living facility for mental health and make $35.81 starting wage. I previously had a part time position with a different organization, working in geriatrics with and without dementia, and I only made $28.28 an hour working part time. I have seen private organizations who pay about $20 an hour for a recreation therapist. There are also other jobs within the field such as coordinator, director, etc that pay in the low to mid $20's an hour.It is very much dependent on the organization you work for and how stringent they are with memberships and education. Usually the more they ask of you, the better they pay.I know that Saskatchewan pays a similar high wage to what I make, I believe British Columbia averages closer to $30 an hour from job postings I've seen in the past. I'm not as familiar with other provinces.And I've been told that my wage is double what people in the states make, whereas I've also seen posts from American RTs making 70k a year. You have to be smart, job hunt and see what different areas pay and what the job market is like. You also need to be aware that you are not going to be able to easily pick your population, you essentially get what you can find. I'm lucky to be working with my passion, mental health, which is a smaller subset of the rt field. I worked with the company as an assistant first and now am a therapist.

Even though I'm passionate about mental health and life psychology, the degree pretty much just made me qualified for some low to mid pay admin jobs. Not something I actually wanted. I graduated and started applying to grad school for counselling, and I was rejected by 5 schools. I took it very hard and personally because I had disclosed my disorder in the letters. I got into 1 school in the end, and decided not to go into it because the practice counseling sessions I was doing as a prerequisite were literally giving me panic attacks and I kept going back and forth on wanting to be a psychologist.

The lower your weight the slower you lose, both by design and by choice - lower weight means lower caloric maintenance needs which means a fast rate of weight loss likely necessitates an unhealthily large deficit that prevents getting adequate nutrients for health, and means that you are likely to be hungrier by trying to lose fat too quickly while losing more muscle mass than desired.At your size weight loss of around 1lb per week is likely reasonable. If your maintenance is very low due to high inactivity in general life the half a lb might be easier to maintain. If like myself you have a higher tdee than average for your stats due to being very active then a 1.5lb per week rate might still give you enough calories. So you're looking at a deficit ranging anywhere between 250 and 750 from your maintenance needs (either from tdee with exercise accounted for in daily goal or from neat value u and you eat back exercise calories on workout days only).You're looking at about 70 days give or take, and based on that you'd be needing to lose over 1.5lb per week to reach a loss of 17lbs by the end of may.

Stop increasing when your weight is mostly stable.Alternatively you can set your activity multiplier to exclude exercise and instead separately log it and eat back exercise calories. If you decide to set a1lb per week goal and lose that much every week on average for 1-2 months, you can then manually calculate both your neat and tdee. Neat being your non exercise activity thermogenesis and tdee being total daily energy expenditure.(total calories eaten + (3500 x lbs lost)) / number of days.If you want to calculate your neat (and thus figure out how much you maintain on without exercise included) you would only look at your net intake values meaning omit any extra calories eaten from exercise. For tdee you use your gross intake. Then your can compare these numbers to activity multipliers on calculators if desired.You may also be overestimating your tdee. I lift weights 4x per week for up to about 80 minutes max, 60 at the least, of excluding time between exercises, and my tdee is at the descriptor you have used, so I'm not saying that you actually are overestimating, but I'm saying that there are multiple factors to include when choosing a multiplier. For me I look at both my neat activity levels and my exercise, the latter includes frequency, duration and intensity. Both of these go into my multiplier. I would recommend health calc and bwp niddk calculators though to double check your current estimate as these are the two most accurate calculators I've ever used and are more detailed compared to most drop downs.Also if your goal is weight loss, 3500 is your estimate to maintain, not lose.

I also had tachycardia once according to my boyfriend, normally I have a very slow heart rate (high 40s bpm) and a benign heart murmur.

I had taken a diet break and increased my calories to maintenance and have not weighed myself since I did that a few weeks ago. I am going to be asking my pdoc for a new rx of metformin in case I decide to try it again, as I have previously used it when struggling with weight loss but it didn't help much because I still binge ate. Aside from not currently losing weight, the only other down sides are having to take it with 500 calories (which is not hard as I track calories already and 500 is a normal to small sized meal for me) which means I cannot take it at the exact same time every day, and I struggle I bit with fatigue but I can't tell if it's the meds or just natural fatigue.Overall, it comes first as being the best for side effects and second for being the best for overall mental health, of the 7 medications I've tried.

Which is why your diet can be varied with lots of nutrients while also promoting weight gain.If someone is asking about weight loss, caloric content of their intake is what needs to be addressed, not the nutrition of it. Often if someone has a specific question or delves more into the nutrition part then that gets addressed (eg recommending higher protein intake for better satiety).You're just trying to make things more complicated than they are from a weight loss stand point.And pbi the type of calories eaten, ie the foods themselves, will not slow down or speed up weight loss. If you eat 2000 calories for weight loss, whether it's 10%fat or 90% fat will have little impact on the actual fat you lose. The only way your food choices tend to affect scale weight differences are worth regards to water retention (low carb vs normal carb) and body composition and therefore amount of muscle lost (adequate protein or not enough protein). But of I eat burgers once a week within my calories, I'm not going to lose fat any less easily or any slower than if that burger was replaced by an equal quantity of calories from other nutrient dense foods.An allergy won't prevent weight loss. Mineral deficiencies are not going to prevent weight loss. Your sleep won't prevent weight loss. These things may affect how easily you can maintain a caloric deficit, but it's that deficit that will be affecting the weight lost, not those variables in and of themselves.If someone told me when I first started that I needed to track calories and make sure I met x micronutrient values and only ate x foods, I wouldn't have lost weight. I'm not stupid, I know inherently that nutrient dense foods are a good staple, and I don't think anyone who is in need of weight loss fails to know that it's important to eat those foods. But what was a game changer was realizing that for weight loss, none of those things matter. Only my calories matter. To separate my health from my weight loss meant that I was able to actually make progress. So I eat chocolate or fries when I crave them because I know that for weight loss those foods won't affect me. I don't even have to focus on details for my health because I simply eat a variety of food in average from a variety of sources, and if I notice that I've eaten a lot of lower nutrient foods for a few days then I just start eating more fruits and veggies.

I chose to get ctrs because I knew that's where the field is headed and it gives me an edge, especially in Canada.Realize that equivalency paths might not be easy, considering you may not be able to find work under a ctrs.

{"eg4499g": {"text": "By little progression do you mean with your clients or for yourself? I'm in Canada so it might be different than the states, but here in Alberta i started off as a therapy assistant making 20.20 an hour full time in September 2018, got a part time job in November 2018 as a therapist paying 28.28 an hour, and just started a new  full time permanent position in January with the company I was an assistant with earning 35.81 an hour as starting wage. I finished my practicum and degree in August 2018 and and have been working full time in the field since, and I'm now working with my dream population (mental health). So professionally I've been able to make a lot of progress in less than 6 months. The most I would ever be able to make in this position with this company is around 50 an hour, and I'm not even with AHS which is one of our province's best employers for RT in terms of number of opportunities and wage. There are managerial positions as well, and CTRS is not currently required in Alberta but I fought to get mine (went to a school that doesn't normally allow for CTRS certification but we were able to get a PhD student with CTRS to act as the program supervisor for students that requested, and I've sadly been the only student so far too request in the year he's been in that role).So honestly, professionally speaking I would say there's plenty of room to grow and progress but you need to be willing to either start off small or relocate. Eg Saskatchewan pays similarly to Alberta but then some provinces pay much less, and private pays an absurdly low amount, like 20 an hour and often doesn't even require a degree. My province is moving to degree only in 2020 though which is amazing.If you mean progress for clients, it depends. You need the support and funding to actually implement true TR and not just activities. My new job is moving towards that, with our public calendar for residents to attend as they please and then we are working on developing functional interventions and leisure ed for specific people based on specific goals of the population. These would be things that can be measured and we can do the actual APIED process with. My practicum site was doing something similar in long term care with respect to making sure treatment plans were based on client goals and needs and evaluating effectiveness. It was more rec participation but it took my preceptor 2 years working there to start getting support, and we were able to show residents meeting their goals and having improvements In measurements of life satisfaction and depression by simply following a specific intervention plan.As far as I know, here in Alberta at least, you can apply for an SLP masters degree with any bachelor's. I would personally take more time to look into programs both nationally and in Canada for slp to see what the requirements are, and to research the different types of requirements and opportunities for rec therapy in the us and Canada. If you really have zero ambition towards working in tr then don't bother getting your CTRS, i mean it's a paid certification and why pay all that money for something you won't use? But if you're willing to relocate to places with better opportunities and pay then I would suggest getting your degree with certification. ", "link_id": "t3_aibk2w", "time": 1549748123}}

In my second degree I immediately got accommodations when I first started - extended exam time, programs for my laptop and assistive devices, writing exams in a different room, ability to extend course work deadlines if given enough notice (never used that), and again I had good relationships with professors. I had panic attacks during two exams for two different courses and was able to work things out by talking to the professors, one we agreed to shifting the marks to the next exams and the other we agreed to an assignment in place of the exam.

Tdee method means selecting a multiplier that actually reflects total activity levels in and out of the gym therefore gym calories are already averaged out across your daily intake.You're small. If you set a 1-2lb a week deficit (500-1000 below maintenance), especially while eating low protein, you're just setting yourself up for failure.

I've been very bloated and bowel movements haven't been consistent. I randomly googled about more potassium symptoms and I had pretty much every symptom, although a few of them I've had for years. So just for the hell of it I started using potassium salt (iodine free) with my cooking, even on salty things like my cheesy nachos yesterday I added potassium salt.

So I'm not saying you're low on potassium but it may be that like me there's something going on that is resulting in water retention if your logging is accurate. New exercise, changing frequency or intensity of exercise, these can lead to retention.Just keep eating 2000 calories, or 1800 if you're not feeling too hungry on that, 0.8g/lb protein, watch your sodium and potassium intake, and just keep making sure your logging is as accurate as can be.

If all you eat is chocolate or fast food, if course you'll probably not be very full. Having a small quantity of calorie dense foods along with other filling foods can mean being able to eat everything you love and still be satiated.If you can see yourself restricting what your eat essentially indefinitely then that's fine. Your deficit diet should basically reflect what you'll eat when maintaining, just fewer calories. If you know that you'll not eat things you've restricted, then you don't need to learn how to eat them within a moderated quantity that still promotes fullness. But if at your goal weight you plan on eating those foods or know that this is not a for life diet, then you should 100 % learn how to eat your maintenance diet now. I eat my maintenance diet right now, just at fewer calories.I just had lunch. I ate a protein bar because I don't have protein food on hand to make, and I also had nachos with salsa. Was about 650 calories, and I'm completely full even though nacho chips are essentially as filling as regular potato chips. The combo of having enough calories in the meal, keeping my protein high, and having a good balance of my macronutrients means that I'll probably be able to postpone eating again until even 8pm (2pm here). I am going to the gym later so I will eat something carb heavy like a banana or oats, but otherwise i will not be hungry for hours. My goal for overall calories is in line with my actual tdee, as in I'm eating for my activity levels which means that I can eat more food and still lose weight at a reasonable pace. Eating for my true activity level makes it pretty easy to eat everything I want, in smart portions, and still be full.I have a roughly 750 calorie deficit. I eat 130g protein minimum, which is roughly 0.8g/lb. I also eat things like sweets and baked goods on a regular basis. Some days i might be able to eat a whole chocolate bar at night because my remaining calories is pretty high, other times it's 10g of chocolate because I'm eating it with my breakfast protein pancakes and want to favor satiety. My body feels great, in great part because my diet contains a variety of nutrients and I eat a non aggressive deficit and I am physically active. Based on your post, it doesn't really sound like you've ever done moderation in the true sense. Just based on the info you've given, it sounds like you've taken a mostly black or white approach both times - either not eating anything \"bad\" as you do now or eating a lot of those foods every day. True moderation is usually advocated as a more 80/20 approach. So you might eat nutrient dense foods all day and then with supper have a 200 calorie dessert. You may go out for supper and choose something that is vegetable heavy in order to save room for a little frozen yogurt. It's not eating half your calories in lower nutrient foods every day.I would say that it's worth it for everyone to try doing true moderation because whatever you do while losing should be teaching you how to structure your maintenance diet. I would think that a majority of people are more likely to consider a non restrictive diet to be more sustainable than cutting out foods and making them off limits. That is the approach I once took way back when and it just led to regaining and losing the same 15lbs for 4 years. It didn't teach me how to eat for my activity levels. It just taught me to fear food and have a bad relationship with food and binge on sweets every week because I convinced myself it was just this one time.

I stopped washing my face entirely, even with water, went through maybe a month or two where my skin accumulated dead skin but that entire time my acne cleared up slowly until I essentially stopped breaking out.

I stopped doing this method when I started wearing makeup again and my skin became a bit more acne prone from cleansing. I don't get many zits though but I have a lot of dehydration. I've not gone back to cleansers, I've only ever done methods of oil cleansing (true ocm without castor oil or oil with an emulsifier on the lowest concentration possible) and water only washing.

If I eat a 500 calorie burger I'm not going to gain weight if it's within my 1800 calorie deficit goal.

If I decide to eat 2 burgers and am still at 1800 by the end of the day I'm going to lose weight. Some days I'll eat a donut and a muffin and chocolate because I'm just really craving it. I'm still at my deficit for the day. Increased sitting time is only a factor of weight gain if someone is eating for the activity levels of a non sedentary person. I spend much of my time sitting when I'm not at the gym or walking sound a bit at work. I also factor that activity level into my caloric needs.If I start walking 5 hours a day in top of physical activity, and let's pretend my tdee shoots up to 3000 from that, if I eat 3100 calories I'll gain weight. I won't fail to gain weight simply by virtue of walking more if my calories aren't in line with my activity levels.You cannot not lose weight if you don't eat below your maintenance needs. Going for a 3 hour walk is not a sustainable or realistic method for the average person to create a caloric deficit. You like eating a burger and large fries every day and are gaining weight? Though luck, if you want to lose weight you have to shave off those calories by eating it less often or having a lower calorie burger and /or a side salad instead of fries. Increasing one's activity levels as the primary method of creating a deficit simply is not efficient nor does it guarantee that you won't end up eating more as a result of increasing your intake.It is not at all that many **cannot** eat less. I was on a minority of those who could not eat less because medication made it so that I couldn't even eat to my maintenance needs. With that taken out of the equation, eating less is a **choice.** therefore the more accurate statement is that many **are not willing** to eat less. Many are strangely more willing to stop eating foods they love in favour of eating a diet they know they don't stick to, rather than just eat less of everything they already eat. This is not a factor of cannot. Unless there are extenuating circumstances such as my medication issue, no one is physically incapable of consuming fewer calories.Physical activity is for your health. It in no way guarantees weight loss, and is a poor option for weight loss. What happens if you become ill. Or injured, or change which activity you do, and thus your tdee decreases but you still eat for your previous activity levels? You gain. That is why focusing right management on your dietary intake and caloric needs is a much smarter and useful method. If you know that your weight is managed through diet and calories specifically, it's pretty easy to figure out how to adjust your intake up or down with corresponding changes in physical activity levels. That was something I didn't learn my first go around, i had no idea that changing how active I was would make me gain weight even though i \"ate clean\".

Many people always want to know \"the secret\" to weight loss, looking for a solution that is more contrived and out of their control than necessary.A sub like this lets people know what scientifically produces weight loss, which is eating fewer calories than you currently burn. It provides people a place to ask for advice or guidance if they are unsure if they are doing the right things. It allows for accountability. It lets people connect and share experiences.There are a slew of common misconceptions of how weight is managed and this sub exists to dispel those myths.Before going on antipsychotics which ended up increasing my hunger tremendously and making me eat compulsively, i ate per my activity levels. I calculated my tdee for my stats, set my goal to be a deficit of that number, and ate sufficient protein while lifting weights. I ate anything I wanted within those parameters. I got down to 140lbs, lean and with muscular definition. All while eating sweets and calorie dense foods within my goal when I pleased. After regaining due to the meds (about 15lbs) I eventually lost to 133lbs very quickly due to becoming hypomanic and having an easier time reducing my binge episodes. Again, i was eating per my activity levels and protein needs /calorie needs, any foods I wanted. Regained again, eventually changed meds this past November and have been able to maintain a deficit almost every day save for a few days alone the holidays when my old habits crept up a tiny bit. I've been able to lose weight and overall inches by again doing exactly the same thing, eating whatever I want within my personal needs. On days I don't exercise, I eat for my non exercise needs. On days I exercise I eat for my increased activity needs. Exercise itself isn't determining the weight, because I'm adjusting my calories to reflect my activity levels every day. My food choices aren't determining the weight, because it's all about the amount of calories I consume from said choices. If i eat 200 calories of chocolate vs fruit, my weight loss will not differ.\"eating bad\" doesn't exist, because no food is bad. I'm not unhealthy because I ate one piece of chocolate or one bowl of ice cream. What is bad is quantity choices. I can choose to eat ice cream every day within my calories and not gain, or I can choose to eat 1000 extra calories worth of sweets on top of my maintenance needs and gain.

There is a common misconception that only a person who is severely underweight is at risk of malnutrition. However, this is not the case, and malnutrition can result irrespective of weight. An individual who struggles with anorexia, bulimia, or binge eating disorder may develop malnutrition as a result of erratic and irregular eating behaviors.In reality, i was eating my more nutrient dense foods at a caloric deficit. Meaning that I probably was still short on some nutrients because I was not eating at maintenance levels, however because I also had an excess of low nutrients it caused problems.It was a few years ago so I don't recall in detail, but as far as my symptoms I suffered from fatigue, lack of energy, and lanugo (which is a lot of fine white hairs) on my face. The last one was the most obvious, i naturally have a bit of baby white hair on my upper lip but I had a thick covering of it all over mostly my jaw line and lower cheeks. My mood wasn't the best either. However, some of these are hard to distinguish from my mood disorder and the medication I was on, but I didn't have any of these issues until I started doubling my intake and having too large of servings of low nutrient foods.Now I'm on different meds, have been for a few years (tried 3 meds in the last 2 years or so) and haven't had the symptoms despite over eating a bit. Big difference being much slower weight gain, much less of low nutrient foods.Now i am losing weight, i am eating an overall well balanced diet, and I can occasionally eat larger quantities of low nutrient foods without problems. Yesterday for instance I had a small piece of cake, half a toblerone bar, a few pieces of chocolate, and a few small pieces of some baked goods. I would estimate the intake being between 400-500 calories. I logged about 2350 calories, which is still a deficit for me (was only over by 100 calories) as i had accumulated about 350 calories from exercise earlier that day. I finished off the day with an estimated 170ish grams of protein, ate a few servings of fruit, lots of veggies, some good fats.Today I have had a bit of turkey and am not planning on eating any more chocolate, just not necessarily craving it after having had 2 small chocolate bars and candied popcorn on Christmas eve (again within my 1900 calorie goal).

I've seen girls on Facebook talk about walking in laps at 11pm just to teach their 10k step goal, how is that a healthy mind set? Instead of setting a step goal, how about setting a goal such as \"in going to go for a 15 minute walk every lunch break\"? That's about 1 hour of walking every week, which isn't too bad to start with. Some days you might walk faster and have more steps than others, but you're setting a more manageable goal. It's like how I used to have an 80 minute exercise goal. Every day that i lifted weights I wanted to reach 80 minutes of activity in order to maintain my estimated maintenance /tdee, which resulted in me forcing myself to do more exercise than I wanted to some days.

Because you were eating more on workout days vs rest days, that inconsistent carb and calorie intake can definitely affect water retention. I used to do tdee method by having exercise included in my daily average goal even if I didn't exercise daily, and now I do neat method wherein I eat more on workout days. I do find that my weigh ins are less consistent with this method than tdee method and my weight fluctuates more, but it's continuing in a downward trend and my actual size is decreasing. So you may find that for scale measurements that having one goal every day is easier, however it will also mean that for consistent results you'll need to maintain roughly the same activity level every week. This is why I switched to neat method, so I can have shorter or longer workout sessions and not force myself to be on a specific time table.

Still need to manually calculate my maintenance but ive been lazy with weighing myself and need to restart the calculations. But anyways, depending on how active you are the whole day, not just with exercise, you could very easily have a high tdee.It is highly unlikely that the additional 300 calories is yielding weight gain. Unless you are binging at night as you describe with the night eating if you miss your snack, the weight on the scale is a function of water retention. Give it a few months while continuing to eat at a reasonable deficit based on your new activity levels and you'll continue to lose.Yes, you do need to eat more the more active you are. There are a lot of people on this sub who say that exercise calories are not important. That's bull. When maintaining you have to eat those calories, and weight loss is just practice maintenance in terms of your eating habits. Learn how to eat reasonably for your activity levels now.If you don't eat for your activity levels you do risk binging and thus failing to lose. You also risk greater muscle loss of you wind up sticking to the deficit without eating back exercise calories, and affecting both your performance and recovery at the gym by not eating enough.Prior to lifting, how much did you eat on average and how much did you lose on average per week? How much does your Fitbit estimate you to maintain on now with your lifting added vs before lifting?You have a few options.1. Go with what your Fitbit tells you. I don't know if your Fitbit is synced with a calorie tracker but this should tell you how much to eat to lose.2. Estimate your tdee with a tdee calculator. This means including all average activity, both exercise and non exercise. Then subtract 500-750 from this and eat that new number every day. This necessitates a fairly regular and consistent exercise routine.3. Estimate your neat with a tdee calculator. This means only including non exercise activity in the calculation. Then subtract 500-750 from that and set that as your daily goal. Then on days you exercise, log exercise either through your Fitbit or through eg myfitnesspal database and eat back the calories. You'll eat more on workout days than on rest days. If your exercise is pretty consistent in terms of time and intensity you can pre log an amount to get an idea of how many calories you might have left over after exercise, then change that amount with the real data after you're done.I do method 3.

And then using a separate calculator like health calc tdee calculator helped give me an idea of how my daily activity lined up to get me to that average. So at that point I was on school, standing and walking alone a few hours a day then a few more for activities of daily living. Worked once a week standing and walking most of the day. When I was 150, a bit less active (60 minutes or so lifting 4x per week, maybe a bit of cardio), and just a bit of waking and standing, and less muscle mass, i only maintained on 2500.

I'm around 155-160 (due to medication I regained, but new medication seems to not be causing binging episodes) and maintenance with a job that has me on my feet most of the day and lifting 300ish minutes a week at high or at least moderate intensity, im estimated to maintain around 2900-3000.

First is a pixie or buzz cut. I had a buzz cut to pixie for years and trust me, it doesn't require much cleaning. This is with me working out 4x per week as well. The other option is to go no-poo, more specifically washing your scalp and hair through brushing. What this means is taking a boar bristle brush (there are gentler ones) and you essentially brush the oils from scalp to end. One blog suggests wooden bristle brush as an alternative. I used to do this combined with water only washing but it didn't work the best for my hair type which is wavy curly when long, and caused my hair to become a bit is a mess. I never tried the wooden brush though so that could be why I had issues plus i brushes daily which may not have been ideal for my hair. But it has worked for others which is why I recommend it. There's also scritching for scalp care which is using a fine wooden comb or finger pads on the scalp, you'd have to google for a proper explanation. Both tools work to help get excess dead skin cells and oil off the skin and hair.For your body and face, you can use non water cleaning methods. Let's start with face, if this is an area you want to wash. There is caveman routine wherein you literally don't wash your face. This is what I did inherently before getting into makeup and my skin was amazing, and now I have to wash it because I wear makeup. But I went a long time doing caveman and after a month my son looked great but I wanted to get back into makeup. Then there's dry oil cleansing which is just oil cleansing with a dry towel - rub oil over face and dab and wipe off with a gentle cloth. This is something I might try again because I feel like water does dehydrate my skin, but we'll see. Right now I do actual oil cleansing and water rinses. And then there are no rinse cleansers that are either wiped on or off the skin. These include milk cleansers and micelle cleansers. Just use a gentle cotton pad.For your body... Same concepts as the face, and realize that your body doesn't really need that much cleaning. Really you only need to look at the areas that get smelly or dirty easily line under arms and genitals. So you could try the same products you'd use on your face but on those areas. You can also dry brush your limbs top help remove dead skin cells but this is not necessary.So ultimately, if water causes pain, avoid it when you can.Eta for exercise.You need to do something you enjoy.

Here are some studies.\"Fasting Increases Risk for Onset of Binge Eating and Bulimic Pathology : A 5-Year Prospective Study\"Although adolescent girls with elevated dietary restraint scores are at increased risk for future binge eating and bulimic pathology, they do not eat less than those with lower restraint scores. The fact that only a small proportion of individuals with elevated dietary restraint scores develop bulimic pathology suggests that some extreme but rare form of dietary restriction may increase risk for this disturbance. The authors tested the hypothesis that fasting (going without eating for 24 hr for weight control) would be a more potent predictor of binge eating and bulimic pathology onset than dietary restraint scores using data from 496 adolescent girls followed over 5 years. Results confirmed that only 23% of participants with elevated dietary restraint scores reported fasting. Furthermore, fasting generally showed stronger and more consistent predictive relations to future onset of recurrent binge eating and threshold/subthreshold bulimia nervosa over 1- to 5-year follow-up relative to dietary restraint, though the former effects were only significantly stronger than the latter for some comparisons. Results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that fasting is a stronger risk factor for bulimic pathology than is self-reported dieting.\"The effects of short-term food deprivation on caloric intake in eating-disordered subjects\"The primary aim of this experimental investigation was to examine the effects of short-term dietary restriction on caloric consumption in eating disordered subjects. Subjects with bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and overweight non-eating disordered subjects, attended a laboratory experiment during which they were randomly assigned to either a 1h or a 6h food deprivation condition prior to being served a multi-item buffet. The primary measure of interest was calories consumed during the laboratory experiment. Subjects deprived of food for 6h consumed significantly more calories at the buffet compared to subjects in the 1h food deprivation condition. However, caloric intake during the entire laboratory day was not affected by the experimental manipulation. Subjects in the longer deprivation condition apparently compensated at the buffet for the caloric restriction, but did not overcompensate.That one isn't in if specifically but does demonstrate that a longer fasting length affects eating behaviours.This one is based on rats and would be worth following up with humans\"Intermittent fasting induces hypothalamic modifications resulting in low feeding efficiency, low body mass and overeating.\"Intermittent fasting (IF) is an often-used intervention to decrease body mass. In male Sprague-Dawley rats, 24 hour cycles of IF result in light caloric restriction, reduced body mass gain, and significant decreases in the efficiency of energy conversion. Here, we study the metabolic effects of IF in order to uncover mechanisms involved in this lower energy conversion efficiency. After 3 weeks, IF animals displayed overeating during fed periods and lower body mass, accompanied by alterations in energy-related tissue mass. The lower efficiency of energy use was not due to uncoupling of muscle mitochondria. Enhanced lipid oxidation was observed during fasting days, whereas fed days were accompanied by higher metabolic rates. Furthermore, an increased expression of orexigenic neurotransmitters AGRP and NPY in the hypothalamus of IF animals was found, even on feeding days, which could explain the overeating pattern. Together, these effects provide a mechanistic explanation for the lower efficiency of energy conversion observed. Overall, we find that IF promotes changes in hypothalamic function that explain differences in body mass and caloric intake.Pertaining to other forms of fasting ie no food at allAltered Appetite-Mediating Hormone Concentrations Precede Compensatory Overeating After Severe, Short-Term Energy Deprivation in Healthy Adults.Background: Adaptive responses of appetite-mediating hormones to negative energy balance are thought to contribute to a counterregulatory response that drives weight regain, but they have not been studied while controlling for reduced diet volume.Objective: In this secondary analysis, we aimed to determine the effects of short-term, severe energy deprivation (ED) on appetite and appetite-mediating hormone concentrations.Methods: Twenty-one adults with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 21 \u00b1 3 y and body mass index of 25 \u00b1 3 kg/m(2) consumed isovolumetric diets provided over separate 48-h periods while increasing habitual energy expenditure by 1683 \u00b1 329 kcal/d through light- and moderate-intensity exercise. Energy intake was matched to energy expenditure to maintain energy balance (EB) (-44 \u00b1 92 kcal/d) or was &lt;10% of energy expenditure to generate a -3696 \u00b1 742-kcal/d energy deficit. Postprandial appetite, glucose, insulin, acyl ghrelin, peptide YY, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) responses and ad libitum energy intake were measured as secondary outcomes after both experimental periods.Results: Fasting insulin (-56% \u00b1 42%) and acyl ghrelin (-60% \u00b1 17%) concentrations decreased during ED but not during EB (condition-by-time interaction; P-interaction \u2264 0.01), whereas fasting leptin concentrations decreased more during ED compared with during EB (-47% \u00b1 27% compared with -20% \u00b1 27%; P-interaction = 0.05). Postprandial insulin (57% \u00b1 63%; P &lt; 0.001), GLP-1 (14% \u00b1 28%; P = 0.04), and PP (54% \u00b1 52%; P &lt; 0.001) areas under the curve (AUCs) were higher, whereas the acyl ghrelin AUC was lower (-56% \u00b1 13%; P &lt; 0.001) after ED compared with after EB. After ED, self-rated appetite was greater, and ad libitum energy intake was 811 kcal/36 h (95% CI: 184, 1439 kcal/36 h) higher relative to after EB (P = 0.01).Conclusions: Short-term, severe ED suppressed acyl ghrelin concentrations and increased postprandial anorexigenic hormone concentrations. These effects preceded compensatory overeating, suggesting that in adults without obesity, altered sensitivity to appetite-mediating hormones may contribute to an adaptive counterregulatory response during the initial stages of negative EB.Considering the poor amount of research on the potential negative side effects of if with respect to binging, anecdotal accounts are perfectly fine to provide to others to get an idea of what kind of adverse effects a method of eating can have.

No chest or shoulder movements (push ups would be difficult to progressively overload and depending on how you do it rather the triceps more than chest), and people should follow a well designed program that provides progressive overload. Cardio and exercise in general aren't required for weight loss either, and that much cardio would make me quit.Deal with hunger? You know how I deal? By eating when I'm hungry and eating enough calories and protein overall. There is zero need to be hungry and zero necessity to eat only 3x a day without snacks. Some people eat one a day, others every few hours. I can't skip meals, others can. It's entirely your physiology that will decide what works. Your meals can be any style you want. I was lazy and ate protein bars for breakfast. No veggies or fruit, no lean meats. For lunch I am having chicken thighs, a bowl of fruit, tomatoes and potatoes with cheese. Tonight I'm probably making some bacon chicken ranch spaghetti squash, plenty of fat in there. Meats don't have to be lean, or even eaten every meal, veggies don't need to be eaten every meal, and quantities of everything you eat will be determined by your own tdee and calorie goal.

{"e42iwzx": {"text": "PBI 800 calories is not enough unless you are being medically supervised, as this is considered a **very low calorie diet and must be doctor supervised.** Let's say you're averaging 1100 calories every day, that's very low for someone who is both at your stats and active. From what I've seen from women with PCOS discussing this topic, PCOS doesn't significantly affect TDEE and amount of calories needed to lose weight.[https://www.reddit.com/ [this TDEE calculator](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp) which I find to be one of the most accurate, and assuming a PAL of 1.7 (very light work, active exercise), and assuming average age of 25, you may maintain on upwards of 2700 calories. Assuming at most a 10lb water weight loss (IME at around your starting weight, I had **no extra water weight loss** so your loss of water weight could very well be less) and thus a fat and muscle loss of 5lbs, your TDEE could actually be upwards of 3300 [http://www.health-calc.com/diet/weight-loss-calculator](http://www.health-calc.com/diet/weight-loss-calculator) assuming you are averaging as low as 900 calories a day. If averaging 1100 then this is well over a 2lb/week weight loss rate, meaning you maintain on well over 2000 calories, meaning your deficit is excessively large and would explain your drop in energy. Your hormones may also be affected resulting in greater retention of water weight, and the very quick initial drop could be masking any losses you are experiencing as it may take time for the scale weight loss to rebalance to a normal rate. I lift weights 4x a week, I'm in the gym about 2 hours, I do cardio maybe once a week or for about 10 minutes after lifting if I have the energy (otherwise I do half an hour once a week or 20 minutes twice a week) and I currently maintain on 2900 calories being in the 150s and only an inch taller. Basically, you won't *not* lose weight with an excessively large deficit, but you are putting your body at risk and potentially lowering your caloric burn due to the decrease in NEAT expenditure and reduction in ability to work out as long/intensely, and likely affecting your hormones in some way. Choose a 1lb/week deficit rate goal, and if you are setting your activity level to exclude exercise then separately log it and eat back at least half the calories. HOwever I'd suggest the TDEE method as that will be more consistent and easier to adjust up or down, therefore you'd use a good TDEE calculator such as the one I linked and create a 500 calorie deficit from that. For now, I'd suggest absolutely no lower than 2000 calories. If you lose more than 1lb/week on average after 2-3 months, increase your goal unless you stay within the 1-1.5lb/week weight loss range and are not suffering from health complications. As for your actual question, YMMV. I cannot do IF, it makes me binge eat. I eat 3-4x a day usually, sometimes 5x. I set a reasonable goal for myself, aiming for \\~1.5lb/week weight loss at most and averaging around 2200 the past few weeks (I'm also on metformin due to changes in my physiology due to an antipsychotic I used to take, and since changing my schedule from morning and night to lunch and night I've stopped binging/over-eating above my TDEE or close to it).Eta you don't need to take metformin with food unless your vet gastric side effects.

{"e38sc2e": {"text": "Sorry but you need to weigh yourself at least once for an accurate TDEE calculation, and to know if you are losing at your expected rate or at all (it can be pretty easy to not notice non scale differences sometimes since we are with ourselves every day). Sites use different calculation methods. I prefer to recommend sites like BWP NIDDK or health-calc because they allow you to input both your NEAT and exercise. What you are referring to TDEE is not what true TDEE is - your TDEE **includes your jiu jitsu exercise.** Your NEAT would be what excludes that exercise and would be what you calculate if you want to eat back exercise calories on workout days. Your TDEE is what you calculate if you want to eat the same daily while accounting for exercise. Cronometer likely has your goal at 1442, not your TDEE. I've not used it myself but from the apps I have used for calorie tracking they automatically give you your deficit goal unless you explicitly put a maintain or gain goal, then you'd get those respectively. So a (I am assuming) NEAT of 1900 at your goal stats isn't unreasonable, and depending on the rate of loss you chose 1442 makes some sense as well although could be lower than necessary. Especially if you're barely hitting below 1900 I assume based on the 100 calorie deficit... too aggressive a deficit goal = less likely to adhere to deficit. Based on BWP NIDDK, you may maintain on around 2150, meaning that 1650 would be a good goal for you to try to aim for. This is assuming a very light non-work activity and active exercise activity, or a PAL of 1.7 on their website. If you want to just eat at your goal weight's estimated maintenance needs, you can try for 2000, which will be a very slow loss but then you'd be used to what your possible maintenance might be. So your choice really. You'll need to weigh yourself at least once a week to see if the deficit is working, and do that for a few months, then you can manually calculate your TDEE:((Total calories eaten + (3500 x lbs lost)) / number of days.

Truth it, that's not how maintenance works, and an active person (someone who exercises, has an active job, or both) setting their \"tdee\" to sedentary is not actually going by TDEE at all, since TDEE is **total daily energy expenditure.** What you are referring to in the above quoted is the **NEAT method** wherein you calculate your NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis) based on non-exercise activity levels (which is NOT sedentary by default - my NEAT is lightly active and all I do is a bit of walking during the day) and then logging exercise and eating back the calories.

Results: Lifetime  use of cannabis among bipolar patients appears to be around 70% and  approximately 30% of patients with a bipolar disorder present a  comorbidity of cannabis abuse or dependence. Cannabis use is associated  with younger age at onset of first mania and with more frequent  depressive or manic episodes, although the evidence is somewhat  inconsistent. Likewise cannabis consumption is related to poorer outcome  and an increased risk of rapid cycling or mixed episodes. In contrast,  neuro-cognitive functioning seems to be positively affected in patients  with psychiatric comorbidity. While cannabis use often precedes first  manic episodes, the causal direction remains to be determined.  Limitations: Variations in definition of cannabis use/dependence. Lack  of controlled studies limiting definite conclusions about a putative  causal relationship between cannabis and onset of mania. Conclusions:  Further investigations are needed to clarify the relationships between  cannabis use and first manic episode  The influence of cannabis on the course of bipolar disorder: a longitudinal analysis **Background:** Research shows that the use of cannabis has  a negative impact on the onset and outcome of schizophrenia, but little  is known about possible effects on mood disorders. **Aim:** To  study the influence of cannabis use on clinical and social treatment  outcomes in patients with bipolar disorders who had been treated for a  period of 12 months. **Method:** 3459 bipolar patients  were enrolled in an observational study. The influence of cannabis on  various clinical and social treatment outcomes was examined over a  period of one year. In addition, tests were applied in order to find out  whether third, mediating variables had effects on possible associations  between cannabis use and treatment outcomes. **Results:** During  12 months of treatment cannabis users showed less compliance and higher  levels of illness severity, mania and psychosis than did non-users. In  addition, cannabis users were less satisfied with their lives and had  less chance of forming relationships than non-users. There was little  evidence that associations between cannabis use and treatment outcomes  were mediated by third variables. **Conclusion:** Cannabis  use clearly had an independent impact on clinical treatment outcomes in  patients with bipolar disorder, but the impact on social outcomes was  only modest. Does cannabis use affect treatment outcome in bipolar disorder? A longitudinal analysis. Research suggests that cannabis use affects negatively on onset and  outcome of schizophrenia, but less is known about possible effects in  mood disorders. Bipolar in- and outpatients (N = 3459) were enrolled in  an observational study. The influence of cannabis exposure on clinical  and social treatment outcome measures was examined over the course of 1  year, as well as the effects on these associations of third mediating  variables. Over 12 months of treatment, cannabis users exhibited less  compliance and higher levels of overall illness severity, mania, and  psychosis compared with nonusers. Additionally, cannabis users  experienced less satisfaction with life and had a lower probability of  having a relationship compared with nonusers. There was little evidence  that cannabis-outcome associations were mediated by third variables. An  independent impact of cannabis use on psychopathologic outcomes in  patients with bipolar disorder was apparent, whereas the impact on  social outcomes was modest.

Three cannabis  use groups were: current use (between 12-week and 24-month visits); no  current but previous use (during first 12 weeks); and never use.  Associations between cannabis use and outcomes were analyzed using  regression models.  **Results:** Of 1922 patients  analyzed, 6.9% were current users, 4.6% previous users, and 88.5% never  users. Clinical outcomes differed between groups (P&lt;0.019): previous  users had highest rates of remission (68.1%) and recovery (38.7%), and  lowest rates of recurrence (42.1%) and relapse (29.8%). Logistic  regression showed previous users had similar outcomes to never users  (all P&gt;0.05), whereas current users had lower recovery (P=0.004) and  remission (P=0.014), higher recurrence (P=0.014), greater work  impairment (P=0.016), and were more likely not to be living with partner  (P=0.006) than never users.  **Conclusion:** Bipolar  patients who stop using cannabis during manic/mixed episode have similar  clinical and functional outcomes to never users, while continued use is  associated with higher risk of recurrence and poorer functioning.   Cannabis and development of dual diagnoses: A literature review. &lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;The use of cannabis has garnered  more attention recently with ongoing efforts at marijuana legalization.  The consequences of cannabis use are not clearly understood and remain a  concern.&lt;bold&gt;Objectives: &lt;/bold&gt;To review the acute and  persistent effects of cannabis use and associations with psychiatric  disorders.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;Using Pubmed and PsychInfo,  we conducted a narrative review of the literature on cannabis and  psychiatric comorbidity using the keywords cannab\\*, marijuana, schizo\\*,  psychosis, mood, depression, mania, bipolar, and  anxiety.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;There is substantial evidence  of cannabis use leading to other illicit drug use and of an association  between cannabis use and psychosis. A few reports suggest an association  with bipolar disorder while the association with depression and anxiety  disorders is mixed.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Whenever an  association is observed between cannabis use and psychiatric disorders,  the relationship is generally an adverse one. Age at the time of  cannabis use appears to be an important factor with stronger  associations observed between adolescent onset cannabis use and later  onset of psychiatric disorders. Additional studies taking into account  potential confounds (such as withdrawal symptoms, periods of abstinence,  and other substance use) and moderators (such as age of initiation of  cannabis use, the amount and frequency of drug use, prior history of  childhood maltreatment, and gender) are needed to better understand the  psychiatric consequences of cannabis use.  Cannabis use and first-episode psychosis: relationship with manic and psychotic symptoms, and with age at presentation  **Background:** Cannabis use has been reported to be  associated with an earlier onset of symptoms in patients with  first-episode psychosis, and a worse outcome in those who continue to  take cannabis. In general, studies have concentrated on symptoms of  psychosis rather than mania. In this study, using a longitudinal design  in a large naturalistic cohort of patients with first-episode psychosis,  we investigated the relationship between cannabis use, age of  presentation to services, daily functioning, and positive, negative and  manic symptoms.  **Method:** Clinical data on 502  patients with first-episode psychosis were collected using the MiData  audit database from seven London-based Early Intervention in psychosis  teams. Individuals were assessed at two time points--at entry to the  service and after 1 year. On each occasion, the Positive and Negative  Syndrome Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale and Global Assessment of  Functioning Scale disability subscale were rated. At both time points,  the use of cannabis and other drugs of abuse in the 6 months preceding  each assessment was recorded.  **Results:** Level of  cannabis use was associated with a younger age at presentation, and  manic symptoms and conceptual disorganization, but not with delusions,  hallucinations, negative symptoms or daily functioning. Cannabis users  who reduced or stopped their use following contact with services had the  greatest improvement in symptoms at 1 year compared with continued  users and non-users. Continued users remained more symptomatic than  non-users at follow-up.  **Conclusions:** Effective  interventions for reducing cannabis use may yield significant health  benefits for patients with first-episode psychosis.  Cannabis use and mania symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  **Background:** Whilst cannabis use appears to be a causal  risk factor for the development of schizophrenia-related psychosis,  associations with mania remain relatively unknown. This review aimed to  examine the impact of cannabis use on the incidence of manic symptoms  and on their occurrence in those with pre-existing bipolar disorder.  **Methods:** A  systematic review of the scientific literature using the PRISMA  guidelines. PsychINFO, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase and MEDLINE databases  were searched for prospective studies.  **Results:** Six  articles met inclusion criteria. These sampled 2391 individuals who had  experienced mania symptoms. The mean length of follow up was 3.9 years.  Studies support an association between cannabis use and the exacerbation  of manic symptoms in those with previously diagnosed bipolar disorder.  Furthermore, a meta-analysis of two studies suggests that cannabis use  is associated with an approximately 3-fold (Odds Ratio: 2.97; 95% CI:  1.80-4.90) increased risk for the new onset of manic symptoms.  **Limitations:** We were only able to identify a small number of studies of variable quality, thus our conclusions remain preliminary.  **Conclusions:** Our  findings whilst tentative, suggest that cannabis use may worsen the  occurrence of manic symptoms in those diagnosed with bipolar disorder,  and may also act as a causal risk factor in the incidence of manic  symptoms. This underscores the importance of discouraging cannabis use  among youth and those with bipolar disorder to help prevent chronic  psychiatric morbidity. More high quality prospective studies are  required to fully elucidate how cannabis use may contribute to the  development of mania over time.   (Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.)  Cannabis use in first-treatment bipolar I disorder: relations to clinical characteristics.  **Aims:** The aim of this study was to investigate the  associations between recent cannabis use, current symptomatology and age  at onset of first manic, depressive and psychotic episodes in a large  sample with first-treatment bipolar I disorder (BD I).  **Methods:** One  hundred one patients with first-treatment Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) bipolar I disorder  were included as part of the Thematically Organized Psychosis study. The  Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was used for DSM-IV diagnosis  and identification of episodes of illness. Earlier suicide attempts were  recorded. Manic, depressive and psychotic symptoms were rated using the  Young Mania Rating Scale, Inventory of Depressive Symptoms and Positive  and Negative Syndrome Scale correspondingly. Cannabis use within the  six last months was recorded.  **Results:** After  controlling for confounders, recent cannabis use was significantly  associated with lower age at onset of first manic and psychotic episode,  but not with onset of first depressive episode (both P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).  Recent use was also associated with more lifetime suicide attempts  (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.01). No group differences were found on symptom levels.  **Conclusions:** The  present study confirms earlier findings of an association between  cannabis use and a lower age at onset. Recent cannabis use was also  associated with more lifetime suicide attempts. The current findings  suggest that recent cannabis use is associated with a more severe course  of illness in the early phase of BD I.", "link_id": "t3_90a78q", "time": 1532229651}}

CTRS isn't required in my province but we do have some, and one program officially offers CTRS designation at the end of the program (not the program I am in).

So definitely not really a fair fight in that respect. In order to find CTRS I had to look outside of the union I was interested in, outside of the population I was most interested in, and outside of my home town.

I came into RT with the original intention of going into either OT or counseling, which is how I discovered RT. Personally I'd say that Psychology is a lot more applicable to RT, partially because you require abnormal psych to become certified (if CTRS is required for your area or you plan on writing the exam anyway, which is what I'm doing despite it not being a requirement in Alberta) but also because depending on the courses you take in psychology you can learn a lot of things that can be applicable to RT. Behaviour modification is at times a goal of treatment in RT, so taking behavioural psych courses can be a good way to learn about behaviour. Developmental courses are great for getting an idea of how different age groups differ. I found that it was a pretty easy transition from psych to RT and I hope to be able to utilize techniques that are within the psych realm in my RT practice as beneficial or as it makes sense to use. I would agree that a kinesiology background would also be helpful. I have my degree in a sport/rec/tourism program and took some leisure-based courses, and some of them were actually applicable due to learning about theories that are used within the TR literature as well (e.g. the infamous FLOW). Also took some health promotion courses which I think were interesting and could be helpful in e.g. leisure education for clients.But then again if you're going into RT with the intention of going into OT afterwards, I don't think it matters too much. A kinesiology minor might be better for OT though.

However, I doubt that carbs are your issue. It is most likely an issue of eating more than you think you are eating, since you are not in control of the calories you are eating for much of your food. Those meals you describe? Also high in fat, meaning calorie dense. Are you logging everything you eat? All the candy, which is also calorie dense? If you can, get a better grip on your logging. If not, reduce your intake to say 1800 calories and see if you lose. When you return to a normal living situation where you control your intake, continue at 1800 and monitor - chances are you'll lose more weight more quickly due to a combination of eating fewer calories (despite thinking you were eating 1800 at camp, could easily be that your 1800 is actually 2200) and less sodium, assuming you were to remain as active as you are at your job. Otherwise, when you return home just eat per usual for a few weeks until you get a handle on your activity level and recalculate your intake needs based on what your Fitbit tells you. This will be a good chance for you to determine how accurate your fitbit is. After those first few weeks, let's say your fitbit says you burn 2500 calories, eat 2000 calories and see if you lose 1lb/week. Assuming accurate logging (weighing food, using USDA entries for fresh ingredients, double checking labels from scanned entries, using the recipe builder) you will be able to tell within a month or so if the deficit is appropriate and how accurate your fitbit is.", "link_id": "t3_8wxtza", "time": 1531014623}}
{"e1zc6ud": {"text": "It's possible that it could be BP but it could also be e.g. seasonal depression, or that you have treatment resistant depression that is cyclical (recurrent depression) and your ups are actually just normal. Do you notice any actual signs of hypomania during non-depressed states, either euphoric such as grandiose thoughts or racing thoughts or impulsive behaviour or decreased need for sleep etc, or dysphoric such as extreme anger and irritability? Excessive energy? Pressured speech? Being on medication I can tell the difference between when I've likely been hypomanic pre-meds (or on just an antidepressant) and now being stable. I am stable which for me is what you describe: happy, not pessimistic (other than when life hands me something shitty and it makes me sad for a bit, which is a normal response), I can get my work done and my sleep is good enough (although I've always had trouble with fatigue since \\~12-13 which is when my symptoms fully emerged), but I'm not in an episode. I see no reason to be mad at your psychiatrist. I saw my primary care doctor for depression as a teen and went on Cymbalta which like you resulted in having \"normal\" periods (as well as some very elevated periods where I'd do some interesting things, but just seemed like hyper teen behaviour at the time) and depressive periods so I discontinued it, and when I told her that I would still get depressed she didn't jump on the possibility of BP. I personally searched it when I was a teen, and possibly again as a young adult, before going back on Cymbalta my final year of my first degree at university and went to the max dose, which is when I rapid cycled tremendously and exhibited both euphoric and dysphoric hypomania and depression. When I brought up the potential that I could be BP to my doctor and requested seeing a pdoc for that specific diagnosis, that is what the pdoc came in to see me for. So my guess is... you go to see a pdoc with a specific diagnosis in mind, that's what they will screen for, they won't just screen for everything. I've seen three pdocs and at each time I was asked questions specific to BP but not to other things like schizophrenia or unipolar depression, but I wasn't expecting them to do that either.

Exercise (4x a week lifting, average 80 minutes active physical activity per day including any additional cardio I might do, excluding rest between exercises) is about moderate-high active.

{"dys51ew": {"text": "This sub is pro \"don't eat back exercise calories,\" which is a terrible maintenance lesson.So, I will give you my (unfortunately unpopular) opinion.There are **two** ways to set a calorie goal: TDEE method and NEAT method.1. TDEE method: Account for **all activity level including exercise**. For example, I work out 4x a week lifting weights, and I walk around a little bit doing daily activities, which means that that activity together makes me highly active on calculators. So, I set my activity level accordingly. Then take off 500-750 calories for a 1-1.5lb/week weight loss. My current goal is set to 2000.2. NEAT method: Set your activity level **excluding any exercise and then separately log exercise to eat back at least half the calories.** After a month or two, you will know if half is too much, too little, or just right. So like I mentioned, without exercise I do a bit of walking around for daily activities, which makes me lightly active. So I set my activity level to lightly active. I lift weights for 76 minutes (excluding time between exercises, including time within exercises ie rests) I enter that into MFP under strength training in the cardio section, and I eat back all the calories because that's what I've learned I need to do with all MFP entries. Again, set a 500-750 or 1-1.5lb/week deficit goal.

My activity level wtihout exercise is lightly active, and with lifting 4x a week with up to an hour cardio max (sometimes none - I decide based on if I met my minutes goal for the week with lifting alone) I am highly active. Then you would just reduce calories by 500-750 or 1lb-1.5lb/week.2. Keep your activity level the same (which should be lightly active for you) and **log exercise and eat back at least half the calories, adjusting that amount up or down if you do not lose per your weekly goal after about a month or so of doing this.** Strength training is under cardio, and I personally only count the time spent on the exercise (including rest), but not between exercises.

So first think about how active you are without exercise, do you do a lot of walking or standing? Again, use your own judgement. I am lightly active for neat by doing normal activities of daily living and a bit of walking. Then consider exercise, hope many hours to you spend a week? What intensity level? I work out 4x a week lifting at moderate to vigorous intensity, about 70-80 minutes of actual lifting plus rest between sets, up to 2 hours at the gym itself with warm up included. The combo of intensity and duration puts me closer to active ime. So on a drop down, to include both neat and exercise I choose highly active.

There are other ones less prone to weight gain such as wellbutrin. If you're on antipsychotics then ones like Abilify, saphris, geodon, likely rexulti (similar to Abilify) and for some Latuda (makes me binge eat severely) are considered weight neutral, and along with metformin (Latuda Fucked me over re: blood glucose) Abilify is not causing weight gain.

{"dxxhe4l": {"text": "Pbi iifym essentially means eat anything within your calorie and macro needs over the entire day. So... You can choose any recipe you want. If a recipe looks low in protein and you want to have more protein, just adjust the meat/protein sources and possibly carbs to get a better ratio. I lead an iifym lifestyle and do not at all use services that create recipes with specific macros because then I'm not really truly eating what I want, when I want. It's pretty easy to see during the day what macros you need to focus on later on in the day, and easy to adjust meal choices when prelogging your meal. For example, i had a moderately lower protein intake during the day so for my preworkout meal I added greek yogurt, and for my post workout I made an omelette with lots of egg whites and some low fat cheese. I am at my minimum goal for protein. If i want to be smarter about things I just prelog many of my meals either in the morning or the night before so i can see where I need to make ingredient swaps (eg changing bacon for turkey bacon to reduce fat, changing pasta to veggies with less pasta, etc) or adjust portion sizes of recipes I've made via the recipe builder.So yeah, eat whatever you want. Look up recipes on things like Pinterest or just google using the base ingredient of your choice for searching purposes, look at the recipe and decide if it looks like it is fine for macros and calories as is or if you want to make ingredient adjustments /swaps, then make said recipe. Make meals with a couple of single ingredients rather than recipes at times to better adjust your meals macro and calorie needs. In the end iifym is best suited to keeping track of your most important macro (for me that's protein) and being able to eat whatever your want within your overall calorie need for the day.

There is a very good chance that my tdee lowered because of this and possibly hormones in some way.  It will take longer than a week to know if a deficit goal will work or not, keep au a goal for one month and see how it goes. If you can't maintain 1600 then try 1700 or 1800. If you can maintain it, monitor for a month then see how much your rate of loss matched your goal rate. If it was way off up or lower your goal by a few hundred. But you need to give it time initially to see if the goal will work because of the many random weight fluctuations that can happen. The worst that happens at 1600 for a month is maintenance, minimal gain, or minimal loss. Life a few lbs either way. You'd have to be binging on like 10000 calories every day to gain any significant weight. Even for me when I ate about 4000-6000 a day within 2 months I only gained 15lbs (medication induced binging). So your weight won't balloon up on 1600 calories. You'll have much more energy for workouts as well which means more intensity can be used and likely a better calorie burn in general. You'll get a lot of more out of exercise by fueling yourself well.I hope the weighing ends up being the solution, or even increasing your goal, or both.

{"dwhbnj2": {"text": "In this instance, no I don't. Because eating at a caloric surplus is not an addiction. I even recall one study about sugar, I saw a report on stating that people cannot be addicted to compounds in food, because ultimately instead if someone has a compulsion to eat that isn't physiological (eg blood sugar or medication side effect or trying to eat significantly too few calories) is actually due to a behavioral problem.&gt;  different areas of the brain are activated in rodents when they crave food compared to when they crave drugs.  While both types of cravings activate the nucleus accumbens (a brain region associated with motivation and the reward system) they activate different parts of the nucleus accumbens.  Another reason is that, when rats obtain the desired sugar or drugs, their brains release dopamine, a chemical which is important in motivation and reward; however, this dopamine release quickly returns to its original levels after repeated administrations of sugar, but not for cocaine.  Additionally, in many studies claiming to find sugar addiction in rodents, researchers pre-select animals for the study which already have a strong response to sugar. Furthermore, the addiction-like behaviour only occurs under very specific experimental conditions, such as food deprivation.  \u201cIt is important to be aware that these studies were conducted under conditions that do not resemble our typical environments,\u201d says Margaret Westwater, the lead author on the study.And &gt; Edinburgh University scientists found no strong evidence for people being addicted to the chemical substances in certain foods. They found the brain does not respond to nutrients in the same way as it does to addictive drugs such as cocaine. However, people can develop a psychological compulsion to eat. This is driven by the positive feelings that the brain associates with eating, the researchers said.My previous failure to understand that my body maintains on x calories and that a full plate of pasta and sauce at home was easily 1000+ calories wasn't an addiction. It was my brains inability to eat intuitively and instead I ate by sight. I will have to track indefinitely because I lack the ability to intuitively eat for my size unless I'm about 200lbs.I filled up my plate not due to an addiction to food. It was habit from years of learning how to eat based on what my parents gave me and likely from learning how much volume filled me up. Learning is not an addiction.I've \"eaten clean\" and now follow iifym. Gotta which one I feel better on? The latter. My health is the same, if not better now due to my type of training, I'm happier, and I don't suffer from the disordered eating I had while \"eating clean\". I am eating two protein coconut cookies I made with breakfast right now because I felt like eating them and it fits my desired calories. Much better than when I literally had anxiety and fear over whether it was safe to eat yogurt or rice cakes. As long as I maintain good prison intake and decent volume, I have no satiety issues. So might as well eat what I like within my calories while being mindful of overall nutrition.Please give me scientific claims about how eating more = better metabolism. Because afaik, that is a horrible fallacy. Eating 6x a day vs 2x a day won't change weight unless the calories change. And I'll maintain on 2700ish regardless of what or how often I eat.I also eat whatever I want. Sometimes that means 5 brownies or 5 apples. I track my calories so that I know how much I can eat.

Imo the training max being 90% of your rep max means you should  be able to hit double or triple on it.

If i get 5-6 reps 10lbs, 7+ 15 lbs (or something to that effect). I am not just automatically increasing my tm on anything anymore, I'm doing it by autoregulation of sorts. anyways lol.

With exercise (4x a week lifting, a bit of cardio thrown in max an hour per week) 1800 is the absolute bare minimum I can do well on. This would be for a more aggressive deficit. So chances are you can definitely lose on more than 1400 and succeed. If you'd like to try manually calculating your TDEE you can do so through this link: http://www.health-calc.com/diet/weight-loss-calculatorOr through this formula:  (total cals eaten + (3500 x lbs lost)) / number of days.Then create your deficit from that. This approach would entail not logging exercise for calories, as it would be representing your true TDEE rather than your NEAT (non-exercise maintenance).", "link_id": "t3_847jru", "time": 1520974736}}

For now I'll leave this topic with an abstract from a scientific based journal article :&gt; Abstract: Meat has exerted a crucial role in human evolution and is an important component of a healthy and well balanced diet due to its nutritional richness. The present review attempts to sum up meats role and importance in human nutrition as well as examine some pejorative beliefs about meat consumption. Meat is a valuable source of high biological value protein , iron, vitamin B12 as well as other B complex vitamins, zinc, selenium and phosphorus. Fat content and fatty acid profile, a constant matter of concern when referring to meat consumption, is highly dependent on species, feeding system as well as the cut used. Pork meat can have the highest fat content but poultry skin is not far behind. It is also crucial to distinguish meat cuts from other meat products especially regarding its association with disease risk. As in other dietary components, moderation is advisable but meat has been shown to be an important component of a balanced diet\"Meat nutritional composition and nutritive role in the human diet\" unfortunately cannot get the full text for free if not a university student.This may be another interesting read https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/101/6/1346S/4564497", "link_id": "t3_840ux4", "time": 1520965148}}

Obviously if you lose faster or slower you adjust the goal and possibly the multiplier depending on how severe the difference is. But like I do, if that's extra exercise on top of your normal exercise that you happen to do (eg let's say you add an extra running session or double your lifting) and it's basically a one off, logging the exercise for added calories is fine. Then it's kind of like dipping into neat method a bit or a hybrid.Neat you just set your base activity level to exclude exercise but include any non exercise activity. So let's say you have a job where you walk throughout the day, or you do a lot of standing, that's included in your multiplier. No one is automatically sedentary when exercise is excluded, much like not everyone is athlete level active if they exercise. Then once you set your level you log exercise or use a device that tracks exercise and syncs calories, and eat back at least half the calories. After a while you'll figure out if that is too little or too much through your rate of loss.There's nothing wrong with the method you mention, or neat method. I just prefer the tdee method as I think it's much simpler and more convenient. Ultimately if tracking the calories only on exercise days works better for you then that's totally fine. But perhaps, let's say you're lifting is consistent but running varies, you could include lifting in your multiplier and then log running for extra calories.The calculator I linked first is great for estimating both neat and tdee.

Not only will not eating those calories make it hard to work out as best you can, but **you should be learning maintenance techniques, and you cannot maintain weight while ignoring the effects of exercise on your maintenance needs**. This sub is horrible for strongly advocating ignoring exercise calories, and I think it's the wrong approach. My preferred methods for calculating TDEE are:http://www.health-calc.com/diet/energy-expenditure-advanced (this one might under-estimate for me a bit though)https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/bwp/index.html (will be offline some time this year possibly indefinitely)manual TDEE calculation: (Total calories eaten + (3500 x lbs lost)) / number of daysI personally do not prefer the NEAT method you are describing (more info on the difference between NEAT and TDEE method [here](https://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/discussion/1183428/tdee-vs-neat)). I personally prefer to set my activity levels to include all my activity, both my NEAT and exercise, and then create the required caloric intake needs from that. If you choose the NEAT method, then log exercise and eat back at least half of the calories, and after a few months of data you can determine if that amount is too much or too little. Then you can adjust the intake if needed to better match your desired rate of loss. The NEAT method is basically just a bit tedious and can make it easy to make one want to be less active. If on a day I have no exercise, what happens if I'm way more hungry than on the day I do exercise, and yet I don't know how many exercise calories I will have and don't know if the next day I'll be hungry? So rather than say 1600 3x a week and 2300 on workout days (to equate my max 2000 calorie goal), I can eat the average of that number every day and I will a) have more calories on rest days to help wtih recovery, b) know my actual allotted calorie amount every day at the start of the day.I have however done both. I lost more on the NEAT method because I only ate back about 2/3rds of the exercise calories - I need to eat back 75-100% of them to match my needs. I just prefer having a steady intake goal every day. If I happen to do exercise outside of my normal routine then I will log it, but that is only for things additional to my established routine.ETA on drop down menus I am generally \"highly active\". I work out 4x a week lifting weights on average for 70-80 minutes (excluding rest between exercises, but includes rest between sets) and do maybe an hour of cardio per week. I am a little less active than I was in my NEAT but I'm going to try to get that back up a bit by being less lazy (life circumstances = no school or work atm = mild depression). I would suggest that you look at your exercise in terms of minutes/hours and consider the intensity level. I'd assume that *exertion-wise* running is at least moderate. I don't know how long you run for, but let's say a few hours per week, you would easily be at least moderately active. Let's say you run 6-7 hours a week, you might be between moderate and highly active.

{"dv337ic": {"text": "&gt; estimate the portionWhen are you estimating on a regular basis? I only estimate at parties and family events. Every other time *I weigh the solid or measure the liquid* and get an accurate account of how many calories are in what I eat. I know I can't stop tracking. I plan on bulking which necessitates proper tracking if wanting to minimize fat gain, but I'm also terrible with estimating my food intake on a *regular long-term basis* because eventually my portion sizes either get bigger or I start to eat more food of small portions. THere's nothing wrong with tracking indefinitely or periodically to get back on track.Going over the points however, I honestly don't really agree with this post. 1. This will take maybe half the time less than it takes to log properly, so why not just log properly? Writing that I had half a burger and a side of fries gives me no indication of how much food I can eat the rest of the day. Nor does it help me see if I'm meeting protein needs, which I care about.2. Only necessary for people who prefer to eat these meals. Some people don't eat breakfast, and might skip lunch as well or just have a light lunch. I eat both to prevent blood sugar-induced binge eating but I am not everyone. This also doesn't guarantee that you'll a) be able to maintain a deficit or b) be able to maintain your maintenance caloric needs.3. This is unnecessary. Craving chocolate? Open up my log and see that I have 1100 calories left for the day and I can easily fit in half or a whole chocolate bar? Decide it's worth eating? Buy it. The beauty of knowing your balance is being able to make these types of choices, because I guarantee you in the future there will be moments where it's maybe not a vending machine but instead someone offering food, or at a party, and you have to decide what you'd like to eat and how much. Tracking is a great way to learn how to incorporate high calorie foods into your diet, **which do not only include nutrient poor foods btw.** Avocados, nuts, nut butters, oils, cheese, these are all calorie dense foods.4. Or you can just accept a donut and eat part of it with breakfast so as to increase satiety, or eat it *later in the day* when you don't need to maintain satiety for nearly as long. 5. Some people *need* to snack. Sometimes I need a snack. I do better with larger meals but you know what, a day or two ago I had a popsicle midway between two meals. No big deal, I logged it. 6. Drinking tea has no magical value to weight loss/maintenance. If drinking liquids helps prevent hunger for you between meals, good on you, but I don't see how this relates to not bothering to track intake of food.7. If I have the calories for it, I don't always care if I'm not hungry. That popsicle I mention, I probably was thirsty or just had a taste craving. But it fit my day so there's no issue.8. There is no rule as to what a meal should look like. Right now my lunch is 3.5 chicken strips, some turkey breast, and an apple. I monitor my protein and calories, and will be working out later so I'm deciding that my protein cravings win out over eating lots of produce right now.

You are conflating weight management and health. If someone truly doesn't want to exercise, that's their prerogative. I work out on average 340 minutes a week. Guess how much of that is actual cardio (excluding 5 minute warm up)? About 40-60. THe rest is powerlifting style resistance training. We all have different goals. 11. Fuck no. Desserts are something I enjoy, and while maintaining I damn well do not plan on only having them on special occasions. But by tracking my intake I can fit that dessert into my day.13.

This is especially likely important for women who tend to gain fat more easily than muscle.Right now, you're new to lifting. Your best bet is to lift and maintain your weight. Do so with a full body beginner program, or some type of weekly linear progression program where you add weight every week. You will experience newbie gains and adapt to the lifts. Once you are no longer able to progress on a linear progression program, switch to some other type of program for intermediates and then consider gaining weight slowly.

Maybe get up to 150lbs and then cut down.Every change in weight will require you lift weights. 0.8g/lb protein is a good minimum to aim for and you need to use a tdee calculator to determine a starting point with your maintenance needs. I doubt you'd maintain on 1500 right now. I like health calc for calculating tdee personally.For weight gain, 2-3lbs a month would equal about a 250-300 calorie surplus per day. MyFitnessPal can help you sort out all of this. For maintenance purposes, if you choose to do the neat method and eat back exercise calories, set your activity level to exclude exercise.

That's when I have to remove myself from the environment and distract myself. But I also have to make sure i'm eating enough overall, and especially eating enough protein. Currently I'm aiming to eat 3 meals a day (on workout days the eating varies a bit depending on when I can work out) and not eating anything past my last meal in the early evening because it is likely that there is a combo of hormonal shifts in my body at night and the learned behaviour that will prompt binging/over-eating if I consume anything. You have to figure out what causes your desire to eat, and if it's even something you need to try avoiding. Snacking itself isn't bad, it's only bad if you are over-eating above your caloric needs and eating a poorly balanced diet as a result.", "link_id": "t3_7oretr", "time": 1515346131}}

{"dr0q1pb": {"text": "PART 2 of studiesLooking at it cross culturally:&gt; \"Unprocessed Meat Consumption and Incident Cardiovascular Diseases in Korean Adults: The Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES)\" Meat consumption has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in Western societies; however, epidemiological data are limited on the Korean population. Therefore, we examined the associations between unprocessed meat consumption and CVD incidence in Korea. Data were derived from the Ansung-Ansan cohort (2001\u20132012), including 9370 adults (40\u201369 years) without CVD or cancer at baseline. Total unprocessed meat consumption was estimated as the sum of unprocessed red meat (beef, pork, and organ meat) and poultry consumption. In the fully adjusted Cox regression model, the relative risks of CVD across increasing quintiles of total unprocessed meat intake were 1.0 (reference), 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55, 0.95), 0.57 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.78), 0.69 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.95), and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.97), but no significant linear trend was detected (p for trend = 0.14). Frequent poultry consumption was significantly associated with a decreased CVD risk; this association showed a dose-response relationship (p for trend = 0.04). This study showed that a moderate intake of total unprocessed meat was inversely associated with CVD risk. A significant inverse association between poultry consumption and incident CVD was observed in Korean adults, requiring further confirmation in other populations.And another &gt; \"Processing of meats and cardiovascular risk: time to focus on preservatives.\" Dietary guidelines emphasize selecting lean (low-fat) meats to reduce saturated fat and cholesterol, but growing evidence suggests that health effects may relate to other ingredients, such as sodium, heme iron, or L-carnitine. Understanding how meats influence health, and on which nutrients this relationship depends, is essential to advise consumer choices, set guidelines, and inform food reformulations. A recent study published in BMC Medicine involving 448,568 participants in 10 European countries, provides important evidence in this regard. After multivariate adjustment, intake of unprocessed red meat was not significantly associated with total or cause-specific mortality; conversely, intake of processed meat was associated with a 30% higher rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (per 50 g/day, relative risk 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.45) and also higher cancer mortality. These findings are consistent with our previous meta-analysis, based on smaller studies, showing strong associations of processed meats, but not unprocessed meats, with CVD. Preservatives are the notable difference; the calculated blood-pressure effects of sodium differences (around 400% higher in processed meats) explain most of the observed higher risk. Although unprocessed red meats seem to be relatively neutral for CVD, healthier choices are available, including fish, nuts, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Public-health guidance should prioritize avoidance of processed meats, including the low-fat deli meats currently marketed as healthy choices, and the food industry should substantially reduce sodium and other preservatives in processed meatsI'm sure there are others but I don't really feel like spending more time on this than I already have.", "link_id": "t3_7imnp2", "time": 1512869079}}

PART ONE of studiesHere's one study that discusses the health benefits of poultry, which is a form of meat: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462824/Another one pointing out how serving size a day affects the effects of meat on one's health:&gt;\"Total red meat intake of \u22650.5 servings/d does not negatively influence cardiovascular disease risk factors: a systemically searched meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\" Background: Observational associations between red meat intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are inconsistent. There are limited comprehensive analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigate the effects of red meat consumption on CVD risk factors. Objective: The purpose of this systematically searched meta-analysis was to assess the effects of consuming $0.5 or &lt;0.5 servings of total red meat/d on CVD risk factors [blood total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, ratio of TC to HDL cholesterol (TC:HDL), and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP, respectively)]. We hypothesized that the consumption of $0.5 servings of total red meat/d would have a negative effect on these CVD risk factors. Design: Two researchers independently screened 945 studies from PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases and extracted data from 24 qualified RCTs. Inclusion criteria were 1) RCT, 2) subjects aged $19 y, 3) consumption of $0.5 or &lt;0.5 total red meat servings/d [35 g (1.25 ounces)], and 4) reporting $ 1 CVD risk factor. We performed an adjusted 2-factor nested ANOVA mixed-effects model procedure on the postintervention values of TC, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TC:HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, SBP, and DBP; calculated overall effect sizes of change values; and used a repeated-measures ANOVA to assess pre- to postintervention changes. Results: Red meat intake did not affect lipid-lipoprotein profiles or blood pressure values postintervention (P &gt; 0.05) or changes over time [weighted mean difference (95% CI): -0.01 mmol/L (-0.08, 0.06 mmol/L), 0.02 mmol/L (-0.05, 0.08 mmol/L), 0.03 mmol/L (-0.01, 0.07 mmol/L), and 0.04 mmol/L (-0.02, 0.10 mmol/L); -0.08 mm Hg (-0.26, 0.11 mm Hg); and -1.0 mm Hg (-2.4, 0.78 mm Hg) and 0.1 mm Hg (-1.2, 1.5 mm Hg) for TC, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, TC:HDL cholesterol, SBP, and DBP, respectively]. Among all subjects, TC, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TC:HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and DBP, but not SBP, decreased over time (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The results from this systematically searched metaanalysis of RCTs support the idea that the consumption of $0.5 servings of total red meat/d does not influence blood lipids and lipoproteins or blood pressuresCopied from another research article:&gt; \"A Contemporary Review of the Relationship between Red Meat Consumption and Cardiovascular Risk. \" Red   meat   consumption   is   considered   a  dietary  risk  factor  for  CVD.  Most  of  the   risk  of  red  meat  intake  has  been  related  to   saturated   fat   and   cholesterol   content.   This  led  to  the  large\u2011scale  suggestion  of  lowering  meat  consumption  and  preferring  lean  meats.[10]  However,  there  is  increasing  evidence     challenging     this     view.     The     daily   intake   of   saturated   fat   has   been   demonstrated  to  be  related  to  the  incidence  of    CVD    if    adjusted    for    the    overall    background    diet    and    for    carbohydrate    consumption.[11\u201113]   Other   ingredients   used   in     the     processation     and     preservation     of   red   meat,   such   as   sodium   or   other   preservatives,  can  account  for  most  of  the  risk.[14]  Moreover,  heme  iron  may  increase  the   risk   of   diabetes[15\u201117]  and   L\u2011carnitine   may   be   metabolized   by   gut   bacteria   to pro\u2011atherosclerotic  compounds... Figure 1: Meats rich in visible fat and preservatives (red box on the left) have been demonstrated to increase cardiovascular risk while lean fresh red meat (green box on the right) has not...Red meat has been associated for a long time to an increased the  risk  of  CVDs.  However,  recent  findings  demonstrated that  despite  the  presence  of  heme  iron  and  carnitine,  red  meat  does  not  significantly  increase  cardiovascular  risk when  it  is  assumed  in  recommended  doses.  Visible  fat  and  preservatives  are  the  major  issues  in  the  link  between  red  meat  and  increased  cardiovascular  risk,  thus  leading  to  a  significant  causal  role  for  preserved  red  meats,  especially if  they  are  consumed  daily.  Despite  some  other  links  have  been  advocated,  there  is  still  debate  regarding  their  role.Another one on red and processed meats, and mentions frequency of consumption:&gt; \"Applied nutritional investigation: The impact of red and processed meat consumption on cardiovascular disease risk in women\" Objective Recent studies suggest that red and processed meat consumption is strongly linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in Australian women. The aim of this study was to examine the association of red and processed meat consumption with CVD using the Framingham score. Methods Included in the analysis were two separate female cohorts, one from an Internet-based health survey (n = 13 509, age range 30\u201374) and the other from a longitudinal epidemiological study (n = 176, age range 65\u201374). Information was available on red and processed meat consumption, exercise, and all parameters required for calculation of the Framingham score. Binomial regression was used to examine the association within the Internet-based cohort, whereas Kruskal-Wallis H tests and a Mann-Whitney U test were employed for analysis of the data in the epidemiological study. Results Consumption of red and processed meat 3 to 4 times and &gt;5 times per week was associated with Framingham scores 1.064 (P = 0.002) and 1.108 (P \u2264 0.001) times higher, respectively, compared with consuming &lt;1 time per week (n = 13509). A similar pattern was observed in the more detailed cohort, where those in the highest quartile of processed meat consumption had a relative 28.5% increase in median Framingham scores compared with the lowest quartile, with a difference of 4.5 observed (P = 0.043). No relationship was observed when red meat was investigated exclusively. Conclusion The results of our analysis support an association between red and processed meat consumption and CVD risk in women and suggest that the association is stronger for processed meat alone.", "link_id": "t3_7imnp2", "time": 1512869060}}

{"dqf5lwt": {"text": "Part 2 articles:\"**Dietary protein for athletes: from requirements to optimum adaptation.**: Opinion on the role of protein in promoting athletic performance is divided along the lines of how much aerobic-based versus resistance-based activity the athlete undertakes. Athletes seeking to gain muscle mass and strength are likely to consume higher amounts of dietary protein than their endurance-trained counterparts. The main belief behind the large quantities of dietary protein consumption in resistance-trained athletes is that it is needed to generate more muscle protein. Athletes may require protein for more than just alleviation of the risk for deficiency, inherent in the dietary guidelines, but also to aid in an elevated level of functioning and possibly adaptation to the exercise stimulus. It does appear, however, that there is a good rationale for recommending to athletes protein intakes that are higher than the RDA. Our consensus opinion is that leucine, and possibly the other branched-chain amino acids, occupy a position of prominence in stimulating muscle protein synthesis; that protein intakes in the range of 1.3-1.8 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 day(-1) consumed as 3-4 isonitrogenous meals will maximize muscle protein synthesis. These recommendations may also be dependent on training status: experienced athletes would require less, while more protein should be consumed during periods of high frequency/intensity training. Elevated protein consumption, as high as 1.8-2.0 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 day(-1) depending on the caloric deficit, may be advantageous in preventing lean mass losses during periods of energy restriction to promote fat loss.\"\"**Higher Protein Intake Preserves Lean Mass and Satiety with Weight Loss in Pre-obese and Obese Women**: Objective: To examine the effects of dietary protein and obesity classification on energy-restriction-induced changes in weight, body composition, appetite, mood, and cardiovascular and kidney health.Research Methods and Procedures: Forty-six women, ages 28 to 80, BMI 26 to 37 kg/m2, followed a 12-week 750-kcal/d energy-deficit diet containing higher protein (HP, 30% protein) or normal protein (NP, 18% protein) and were retrospectively subgrouped according to obesity classification [pre-obese (POB), BMI = 26 to 29.9 kg/m2; obese (OB), BMI = 30 to 37 kg/m2).Results: All subjects lost weight, fat mass, and lean body mass (LBM; p &lt; 0.001). With comparable weight loss, LBM losses were less in HP vs. NP (\u22121.5 \u00b1 0.3 vs. \u22122.8 \u00b1 0.5 kg; p &lt; 0.05) and POB vs. OB (\u22121.2 \u00b1 0.3 vs. \u22122.9 \u00b1 0.4 kg; p &lt; 0.005). The main effects of protein and obesity on LBM changes were independent and additive; POB-HP lost less LBM vs. OB-NP (p &lt; 0.05). The energy-restriction-induced decline in satiety was less pronounced in HP vs. NP (p &lt; 0.005). Perceived pleasure increased with HP and decreased with NP (p &lt; 0.05).

{"dqf5lc9": {"text": "Part 1 Articles:\"**Physical Activity Modifies the Association between Dietary Protein and Lean Mass of Postmenopausal Women**: Maintenance of lean muscle mass and related strength is associated with lower risk for numerous chronic diseases of aging in women.Our aim was to evaluate whether the association between dietary protein and lean mass differs by physical activity level, amino acid composition, and body mass index categories.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort.Participants were postmenopausal women from the Women\u00a9\u00d8\u2117\u20ac\u2117\u2122s Health Initiative with body composition measurements by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (n=8,298).Our study measured percent lean mass, percent fat mass, and lean body mass index.Linear regression models adjusted for scanner serial number, age, calibrated energy intake, race/ethnicity, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and recreational physical activity were used to determine the relationship between protein intake and body composition measures. Likelihood ratio tests and stratified analysis were used to investigate physical activity and body mass index as potential effect modifiers.Biomarker-calibrated protein intake was positively associated with percent lean mass; women in the highest protein quintile had 6.3 percentage points higher lean mass than the lowest quintile (P&lt;0.001). This difference rose to 8.5 percentage points for physically active women in the highest protein quintile (Pinteraction=0.023). Percent fat mass and lean body mass index were both inversely related to protein intake (both P&lt;0.001). Physical activity further reduced percent fat mass (Pinteraction=0.022) and lean body mass index (Pinteraction=0.011). Leucine intake was associated with lean mass, as were branched chain amino acids combined (both P&lt;0.001), but not independent of total protein. All associations were observed for normal-weight, overweight, and obese women.**Protein consumption up to 2.02 g/kg body weight daily is positively associated with lean mass in postmenopausal women**. Importantly, those that also engage in physical activity have the highest lean mass across body mass index categories\"\"**The effects of dietary protein intake on appendicular lean mass and muscle function in elderly men: a 10-wk randomized controlled trial.**: Background: The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein intake in the adult population is widely promoted as 0.8 g \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1 Aging may increase protein requirements, particularly to maintain muscle mass.Objective: We investigated whether controlled protein consumption at the current RDA or twice the RDA (2RDA) affects skeletal muscle mass and physical function in elderly men.Design: In this parallel-group randomized trial, 29 men aged &gt;70 y [mean \u00b1 SD body mass index (in kg/m2): 28.3 \u00b1 4.2] were provided with a complete diet containing either 0.8 (RDA) or 1.6 (2RDA) g protein \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1, aimed to balance energy needs. Before treatment and after 10 wk of intervention, whole-body and appendicular lean mass were measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Knee-extension peak power was measured with dynamometry.Results: Both groups were found to have been in a moderate negative energy balance (mean \u00b1 SD RDA: 209 \u00b1 213 kcal/d; 2RDA 145 \u00b1 214 kcal/d; P= 0.427 for difference between the groups). In comparison with RDA, whole-body lean mass increased in 2RDA (P = 0.001; 1.49 \u00b1 1.30 kg, P &lt; 0.001 compared with -0.55 \u00b1 1.49 kg, P = 0.149). This difference was mostly accounted for by an increase in trunk lean mass found in 2RDA (+1.39 \u00b1 1.09 kg, P &lt; 0.001). Appendicular lean mass also decreased in RDA compared with 2RDA (P = 0.022), driven by a reduction in RDA (-0.64 \u00b1 0.91 kg, P = 0.005 compared with 0.11 \u00b1 0.57 kg, P = 0.592). Adjusting for energy imbalances did not alter these findings. Knee-extension peak power was also differently affected (P = 0.012; 26.6 \u00b1 47.7 W, P = 0.015 in 2RDA compared with -11.7 \u00b1 31.0 W, P = 0.180 in RDA).Conclusions: **Consumption of a diet providing 2RDA for protein compared with the current guidelines was found to have beneficial effects on lean body mass and leg power in elderly men. These effects were not explained by differences in energy balance.** This trial was registered at the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (www.anzctr.org.au) as ACTRN12616000310460.\"\"**Higher compared with lower dietary protein during an energy deficit combined with intense exercise promotes greater lean mass gain and fat mass loss: a randomized trial.**: Background: A dietary protein intake higher than the Recommended Dietary Allowance during an energy deficit helps to preserve lean body mass (LBM), particularly when combined with exercise. Objective: The purpose of this study was to conduct a proof-of-principle trial to test whether manipulation of dietary protein intake during a marked energy deficit in addition to intense exercise training would affect changes in body composition. Design: We used a single-blind, randomized, parallel-group prospective trial. During a 4-wk period, we provided hypoenergetic (w40% reduction compared with requirements) diets providing 33 \u00b1 1 kcal/ kg LBM to young men who were randomly assigned (n = 20/group) to consume either a lower-protein (1.2 g \u22c5 kg-1 \u22c5 d-1) control diet (CON) or a higher-protein (2.4 g \u22c5 kg-1 \u22c5 d-1) diet (PRO). All subjects performed resistance exercise training combined with high-intensity interval training for \u00b1 d/wk. A 4-compartment model assessment of body composition was made pre- and postintervention. Results: As a result of the intervention, LBM increased (P &lt; 0.05) in the PRO group (1.2 \u00b1 1.0 kg) and to a greater extent (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the CON group (0.1 \u00b1 1.0 kg). The PRO group had a greater loss of fat mass than did the CON group (PRO: 24.8 61.6 kg; CON: 23.5 \u00b1 1.4kg; P &lt; 0.05). All measures of exercise performance improved similarly in the PRO and CON groups as a result of the intervention with no effect of protein supplementation. Changes in serum cortisol during the intervention were associated with changes in body fat (r = 0.39, P = 0.01) and LBM (r = 20.34, P = 0.03). Conclusions: Our results showed that, during a marked energy deficit, consumption of a diet containing 2.4 g protein \u22c5 kg-1 \u22c5 d-1 was more effective than consumption of a diet containing 1.2 g protein \u22c5 kg-1 \u22c5 d-1 in promoting increases in LBM and losses of fat mass when combined with a high volume of resistance and anaerobic exercise. Changes in serum cortisol were associated with changes in body fat and LBM, but did not explain much variance in either measure. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01776359.\"\"**Research: Lean Mass Loss Is Associated with Low Protein Intake during Dietary-Induced Weight Loss in Postmenopausal Women**: The health and quality-of-life implications of overweight and obesity span all ages in the United States. We investigated the association between dietary protein intake and loss of lean mass during weight loss in postmenopausal women through a retrospective analysis of a 20-week randomized, controlled diet and exercise intervention in women aged 50 to 70 years. Weight loss was achieved by differing levels of caloric restriction and exercise. The diet-only group reduced caloric intake by 2,800 kcal/week, and the exercise groups reduced caloric intake by 2,400 kcal/week and expended \u223c400 kcal/week through aerobic exercise. Total and appendicular lean mass was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the association between changes in lean mass and appendicular lean mass and dietary protein intake. Average weight loss was 10.8\u00b14.0 kg, with an average of 32% of total weight lost as lean mass. Protein intake averaged 0.62 g/kg body weight/day (range=0.47 to 0.8 g/kg body weight/day). Participants who consumed higher amounts of dietary protein lost less lean mass and appendicular lean mass (r=0.3, P=0.01 and r=0.41, P&lt;0.001, respectively). These associations remained significant after adjusting for intervention group and body size. Therefore, inadequate protein intake during caloric restriction may be associated with adverse body-composition changes in postmenopausal women.\"", "link_id": "t3_7fw3bc", "time": 1511813839}}
