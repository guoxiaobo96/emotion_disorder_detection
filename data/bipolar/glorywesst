That enabled me to be with a pet but not have the commitment. I signed up with a fostering agency and got certified as a foster. And then started taking in foster animals. It was perfect because I was so horribly depressed and still very unsure if I could keep up with the responsibilities. Also the foster agency took care of all the expenses for the pet. So it was even less of a risk for me. I ended up becoming a foster failure and falling in love with a white scruffy senior poodle! He died after a year and I couldn\u2019t bear to be without him, so I found another dog, this time not a foster, I made the commitment right away! I\u2019ve now had a dog for over three years and it helps me unlike any other effort I\u2019ve made to combat depression except therapy. I walk my guy three times a day, so I get a minimum of 30 minutes of exercise seven days a week. I\u2019ve lost weight, my cholesterol has dropped, I made friends with my neighbors, and my back hurts less because I walk more. For me, a miracle drug!!! All those benefits.

So I would say some of the first things to do are to read up on how to run a business so you understand the numbers and legal requirements that will help keep you operational.

I\u2019m not sure what kind of freelancing you\u2019re doing, but you should also make sure you have months of money saved up because your income will be irregular. (Save as much as you can)For me, repeat business is critical. I have clients who have regular ongoing work who just keep sending me work. In your business, what does regular work look like? Who are the clients that have regular work? How can you make sure they know about you and what makes you great? Or if you are a business that just does one offs, how will you find those people? Will you have to advertise, will you need to network, will you need to belong to trade groups or other kinds of groups to meet your clients? What will it cost you to find your clients? What will it cost you in time and effort, not just money? How comfortable are you with networking and advertising? Are you good at it? Do you have contracts? Do you have a lawyer? You may need one to review your contracts when you get started to make sure you have a proper legal foundation for your working relationships.Will you need subcontractors to be able to deliver your services/products? There are just so many things to understand, I could go on and on. But I will say this, maybe don\u2019t even think too hard about it, just make sure you have a ton of money saved up and go for it.

I have joined groups here on Reddit to help me learn also. Since I build websites and create graphics I always need to keep learning. To give you a little backstory, I love doing social media for my clients and was so excited with the advent of phones with cameras and other things that made it easy for me to do videos for my clients. I specialize in small business, and previously they were never able to afford that kind of work because it was too expensive. I had to hire too many outside people and so forth. But what I learned in doing the video myself, is that even though I can, I really hate video editing. So I found a video editor. And I\u2019ll bet there are a lot of folks like me. Even though we could do it, we may really hate it or not be good at it. I started with simple little video editing apps, and then graduated to a more sophisticated editor, which was a step above and allowed me more control over the editing with layers of sound, graphics and video. But really, video editing is not for me. I\u2019m a good art director, but I don\u2019t have the patience for video editing.Do you live close enough to a big city that would have the types of businesses you fit? If so, maybe you could be researching the businesses in that city, with an eye towards meeting up with people at events.I found my video editor through networking. I had met a woman at a WordPress meetup and we ended up becoming friends. She had a video background and did not want to do the type of work I had, but knew someone I might be interested in. She gave me the name, I contacted her and hired her. I\u2019ve never met her except via phone and she works remotely.

A counselor or therapist cannot prescribe medication so they will work with you using things like CBT, DBT, talk therapy one on one or group to help you figure out new skills for dealing with issues. A psychiatrist (and I\u2019m not sure if a psychologist) can prescribe medication. They also, depending upon your health insurance, offer talk therapy and other types of therapies to help you.I was on meds for a while and didn\u2019t want to take them anymore because of side effects I was having so I started doing a lot of research about non-pharmaceutical methods of dealing with mood disorders. I found that there were a whole group of psychiatrists and mental health professionals who did not use medication as their first line of defense or even believe in medication. They were advocating for lifestyle changes, nutrition and talk therapy rather than medication.My health insurance a while back unfortunately required that I take medication to receive treatment from a psychiatrist because they did not have alternatives at the time. I have different health insurance now, Kaiser, which does believe in different types of therapies and will not exclude you from treatment with a psychiatrist if you do not want to take medication.

It\u2019s a real bedrock for me.And I have to say people at church believe all kinds of different things. The more I learn about the people in there in the way they feel about face the more I learn absolutely everyone has a different idea.My church is very focused on service to the community and learning and living a Christ-centered life. We welcome everyone. We have a female priest a female gay assistant priest and the LGBT community is very welcome at our church. All are welcome!! Which to me is the message of Christ.I think there are people that come who have maybe even an agnostic background, but they come for the fellowship, support and service to the community. So obviously I would recommend a church community for helping navigate this, but any kind of community is good.

{"emkmr35": {"text": "I think WIX, Weebly and Square Space all have an important role to play for those who cannot afford web design services. So you need to set your sights on businesses who have no interest in doing it themselves. For example, I know that I am a good fit with businesses around 10 million and under in sales. And really, I am the best fit at around $5-$10 million in sales. At that size, the business owner understands that they need something that works, they understand the value of it and they are willing to spend money to keep those sales up.For many businesses, WIX and such are a godsend, and I actually put people on there if they\u2019re little guys that need to do it themselves. I set it up. I teach them. I do some nice graphics for them and then in a few years when their business is growing and they are ready for a new website\u2014because now they know what they need and how valuable it is\u2014I\u2019m ready to help them. And the other side of that, is that they get tired of looking less sophisticated than their competition. Because rarely are people who do it themselves able to produce something as professional as what we do.There are still plenty of businesses out there that value what we do. You can do research on your local businesses through an economic development office or maybe your library or some other place that keeps economic information for your area and the statistics.For example I can go to my library (US) and look through the databases about businesses in my region and pull a marketing list for myself of businesses that are in $5 million in sales and up for example and then I can concentrate my efforts on those.And I should say, if you are focusing on lower dollar volume businesses then this will continue to be difficult for you because the site builder technology is getting more and more sophisticated and will continue to evolve and take our jobs just like other industries. So if that is your competition, your job is to find a better arena where that is not your competition. You may have to develop other skill sets or services that will enable you to stay in the field.

I\u2019ve been designing websites for over 20 years, and I think the key to getting what you want is to make sure you understand what that is before you meet.I have my clients make up a list of five or six websites that they feel have good content\u2014how it looks, what it says, or its functionality. I also ask them to give me a summary of what it was they liked on the website so I have an understanding of what appeals to them. I also have them go look at their competitors and come up with a list of websites for me so that I understand who they will be working against online. This makes them perform some due diligence if they haven\u2019t and you would be surprised how many folks don\u2019t. But it also is really valuable for me to understand their aesthetic and goals. For example, if they consider eBay a competitor, maybe they\u2019re not really being realistic in their goals and I have some teaching to do so they will be able to be successful.  (I serve small businesses and I\u2019m not interested in taking someone\u2019s money who has no clue and then leave them in the lurch, I want to have my clients for years)Too many startups and small businesses want to take on the big boys, without a clear understanding of what\u2019s involved in the task, let alone the money involved. I especially like the folks who want me to build a Facebook-like site for $1500 so they can launch their own empire. As others have mentioned, knowing your goals upfront is really important, having your outline of all pages needed and the functionality on those pages is critical, and then really the next step is just making sure that you can convey the sense of your ideas. And the best way I\u2019ve found to do that is go look for things that appealed to you so you can share them with your designer. The more they understand about what it is that floats your boat the better. Another thing that\u2019s really good is coming up with a set of adjectives that they can use for design criteria.Do you want a site that\u2019s humorous, clinical, clean, or minimalist? Whatever it is that you want to look like or convey to your audience, try to find examples of websites that do that well so you can share them with your designer. Sometimes a really great way to find website ideas is to look through template websites.

{"e8uiogl": {"text": "Sorry-this is long TD;LR at the bottomI\u2019m 59 years old I\u2019ve had periods of no meds, many different meds and now just barely a med. I\u2019ve also read a lot on psychologists and psychiatrists who believe in a non-pharmaceutical approach to treating mental health. It\u2019s amazing that there are so many people out there that are anti-medication. So with that in mind you may be able to find medical professionals who are not so gung ho on medication and will help you with the lifestyles side of managing your illness. I finally was able to find them within the Kaiser health system.For me the biggest helps over the years: talk therapy one on one, CBT, DBT group therapy. Also getting a dog, was believe it or not, one of the best things I ever did. Walking him 3 to 4 times a day, every single day, has improved my mood, lowered my cholesterol, and I\u2019ve lost weight. It gets me out of the house and interacting with people, and since I work for myself it\u2019s very lonely and isolating and plays havoc with my head. Plus he loves me, makes me smile, is my buddy and constant companion. A loving, wonderful, little ball of joy.The cornerstone of my sanity however is my faith in God. I can\u2019t overstate that enough. That when my brain is filled with lies and hatred and telling me what a lousy literal piece of shit I am, I remember my church family, my faith in God, and the fact that none of what my brain is saying could Possibly Be True, since I have the proof of love all around me, even when my brain can\u2019t  acknowledge it or denies it. Prayer for me is meditation, and I\u2019ve learned through DBT (which I have gotten in my 50s) that mindfulness is actually a form of prayer for me. And learning how that works has opened up a great skill for coping. Non-pharmaceutical approaches to this illness will require a great deal of effort on your part. You must be committed. But you will find great results if you stick with it.I really couldn\u2019t stand all the side effects of drugs, the wackiness, the up and down, the unreliability of sleep, unpredictability of side effects and ability for me to trust my emotions or anything going on. Prayer is what holds me together. And a small dose of Lamictal currently.If you don\u2019t have a lot of tools in your arsenal for fighting the illness, I encourage you to look at volunteering, exercise, regular hours, and hobbies. Finding things that bring you joy and peace will be also critical. I forgot to mention I\u2019m a gardening fiend. Completely obsessed with plants. Gardening gives me hours and hours of peace and a feeling of satisfaction that\u2019s really important when your brain is full of mush. Sometimes the only feelings of joy, (if you could really even call it that, when you\u2019re in the middle of a three-year depression) were from my gardening. When I was younger sewing was my go to obsession. It would bring hours of peace as I was caught in the flow, art is the same way. The process of creating, building, making something brings a sense of peace that is not found with other types of activity.I would also encourage you to volunteer. Helping others is a long-standing way for me to get out of my head. I find that when I\u2019m saddest, if I make up a big pot of soup and take it to my neighbors, they are so happy, and their happiness brings me some happiness. A regular volunteer gig is positively amazing. I worked for a year at our homeless shelters teaching computers to the residents. It was sad, and also profoundly moving to me\u2014when I could make a difference. It\u2019s now been two years since that activity and one of the fellows that I worked with is still in contact with me. So that is an important  thing to me as well\u2014I\u2019m actually helping a person, really helping.Faith of course for me is a major component, and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a person of faith, but I would encourage you if you are to find a church family and dig in to the journey of faith. I was able to participate in a medical mission to Tanzania through my church. During that trip I experienced such a profound joy like I had not felt since my daughter was born. I made a difference. My work made a difference in their lives. And I\u2019m still in touch with the medical team there since I provide IT support for them. Truly a life-changing event. Especially since I had been in the period of one of my longest bouts of depression\u2014three whole fucking years of nothing but despair and sadness and not a glimmer of real joy or happiness in there. Just dull plodding through daily life. So to feel that joy in Tanzania was mind blowing. I\u2019m crying while I\u2019m writing this.I first started seeking help when I was 18. And since I\u2019m 59 that\u2019s 41 years of living with this illness. Wasn\u2019t even diagnosed as BP2 until I was in my 40s. Prior to that it was just hit or miss from the type of medical help that I got. Talk therapy good\u2014antidepressants, awful.TL;DR Many people who get the drug combo right swear by it, so I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to say you shouldn\u2019t pursue meds, just know that there is a big contingent in the medical world that feels that pharmaceutical intervention is not the be-all end-all of mental health.", "link_id": "t3_9t76sl", "time": 1541079316}}

So I would suggest joining the sub Reddit for meal prep Sunday  with simple things, on the days you have off soak and cook beans. Chop vegetables, cook rice or other grains, Maybe cook a whole chicken, or make a roast in a crockpot for example. Then during the week you can throw those things together in different ways. Some types of cooking are really simple. Especially crockpots, they are truly a godsend for healthy, large quantities of food. Mostly you just put all the ingredients into the pot and let it cook for 6 to 8 hours. That\u2019s simple right.https://newleafwellness.biz/ This woman blogs about crockpot freezer meals. She has a whole set up where she provides recipes and labels in her emails free, but you can also buy her cookbooks, and they provide instructions for how to prepare 5 to 10 meals of 4-6 servings each at one time. Her method is so simple. She writes up all of the quantities of everything you need to purchase and then you just put it all into freezer bags, label it and freeze. Then the night before you\u2019re going to cook it you thaw it and the next morning put it in the crockpot with the ingredients you didn\u2019t freeze (because some ingredients you may not freeze) and then at the end of the day when you come home you have a lovely meal. Processed food is much more expensive than cooking yourself. Even buying pre-washed vegetables is much more expensive. Like those packs of fresh washed lettuce\u20145 to 10 times more expensive than buying the head of lettuce yourself and washing it.Since I eat a lot of beans and lentils, I find it much tastier to make those from scratch than buying cans even though cans are not expensive. But I can tell you when you make fresh hummus from dried chickpeas that you\u2019ve cooked yourself it\u2019s an amazing taste. And you won\u2019t go back to canned chick peas.Since you\u2019re not really a person to cook, maybe something like the crockpot freezer meals could help you have healthy, quick, as no cook as possible, meals! Also, maybe you start really small with a few recipes of things that you love, but you don\u2019t wanna give up because of your budget constraints. For example I love shrimp but I\u2019m certainly not going to pay eight to $15 for shrimp at a restaurant. An occasional small bag of frozen shrimp can add a lot of interest to meals for a much more modest amount of money. (I buy them peeled and deveined because I feel that\u2019s worth it)I love steak, but it\u2019s pretty expensive, so instead when I get a piece of steak I chop it up and stirfry it with vegetables or put it in a soup so that one steak makes four meals or six meals rather than just one.I learned how to make eggs my favorite way, because it\u2019s my favorite breakfast, sunny side up. Took me a lot of yucky looking breakfasts before I got that right.Also if you eat meat, roasting a chicken or other large cut of meat, and then using that all week as a base for other things is a way to keep cost down and have fast food!I have found that I don\u2019t like to eat more than about three servings total of the food I made, so if I make six servings I have to freeze the others or else I just simply won\u2019t eat them. I get bored and tired of them. I cannot eat the same thing every day or say every night for dinner. Over at the meal prep sub Reddit they tend to make a lot of the same meals\u2014maybe 8-10 or more servings of the same thing\u2014I would go insane. I tend to make 4 to 6 serving meals and freeze some.I think it really sucks that for people who are poor, time becomes a luxury. Cooking almost becomes a luxury. And cooking is vital for survival when you\u2019re poor. But if you don\u2019t cook, then you end up having to spend more money or buy cheap unhealthy crap to feel full.Maybe you can find ways to add a little bit of cooking into your routine, and as you get more comfortable and find ways that work for you, you will be able to get a better handle on it.As others have suggested, buying herbs and spices to liven up food is an excellent idea. I buy mine from stores that have bulk herbs so I can buy a few teaspoons of something for $.30 instead of a bottle for three or four dollars. Since I\u2019m a gardener I grow herbs. Nothing beats a baked potato with fresh chives all over it! That\u2019s pretty simple cooking.", "link_id": "t3_9as4be", "time": 1535633672}}

{"dxtbp3x": {"text": "If you have an EAP please make sure to let him know he can use the services for help if he ever needs that. Depression usually means people tend to keep to themselves and may seem antisocial or aloof, but really, we typically don\u2019t want to be around other people because it\u2019s hard. People keep telling us to cheer up and why can\u2019t we just smile and you know, buck up,  just think it away. I look at them and want to say, can you think away diabetes or epilepsy? Or necrotising fasciitis? But I usually don\u2019t have the energy to be so hostile. When I\u2019m healthier and happier, then I get much more righteous about it.My point is not to take the distance, if that\u2019s what they are most comfortable with, personally. I would make a safe place for them, by being sure that you didn\u2019t press them to do things they weren\u2019t comfortable with, like for example insisting they socialize after work, or during lunch or other breaks if they obviously are trying to decline. Be generous with flexible scheduling so that if they need to go to medical appointments they can do that without fanfare. Make it easy for them to make up the time, and don\u2019t really press about it unless they want to talk.Absolutely, do not share his medical status with anyone, as a side comment or asking advice from someone else in your office. If he wants to share it with anyone in the office it\u2019s his story to share. But you should absolutely not share his medical status with anyone, even if you\u2019re sure it\u2019s going to help him, unless it\u2019s a medical professional that needs information.Unfortunately there is still a great deal of bias and that\u2019s why I say those things. You sound wonderful, and thoughtful. He\u2019s lucky to have you as a boss.It\u2019s easy to take our need for emotional distance and the need to cocoon as a personal affront. I understand the concept quite clearly because I suffer from depression, but being on the other side of it from my depressed friends makes me sad and worried when they push away, and I understand the need! So, if you find yourself feeling that way and wishing that you had more of a relationship with the person, just work with them on that at their pace.EDIT to add: There are plenty of functioning employees in the world with depression who do just fine in terms of getting their work done and being productive employees. And in some cases that sense of responsibility and being part of the team is what helps people get up and get out of bed. I\u2019ve had clinical depression for years, and my teammates at work were why I loved going to work. Even though terribly depressed and i really felt like keeping to myself, work was a place of refuge because of the great team I worked with.I have also worked in a very toxic and hostile work environment while I had a heavy bout of depression, and the place nearly broke me.

I recommend a great book, \u201cWhy does he do that?\u201d By Lundy Bancroft. You are only six months in, and in a year you will have experienced more controlling behavior. This is just the beginning. He sounds exactly like a man that I had thought at one point I would marry, and two years later broke it off. I had suffered so dearly from his covert abuse that it took me several years to recover. It\u2019s called covert, because you don\u2019t even recognize it while it\u2019s happening to you. It\u2019s sneaky and insidious how the small digs at your self-esteem add up. The next thing you know it\u2019s a few years down the road and you are a shadow of your former happy and  loving self. You have been isolated from your friends and family, and your only goal is to make him love you like he did at the beginning.And the thing is, you don\u2019t even know this is happening to you while you are in it. Normal loving people do not behave as he is. While I may sound alarmist, and a bit over blown considering you\u2019re only talking about what seems a small surmountable problem, when you read that book I mentioned, you begin to understand that the mindset of a man who feels you need to change for him, is a mindset you can never change.It is the same if the genders are reversed. A controlling person is a controlling person. There may even be a bit of narcissism in there, especially if they feel like you are not living up to the arm candy ideal they need to impress everyone else.Looking at your photo, obviously there\u2019s not a thing wrong with your body shape and size (and even if you were heavy there is still no excuse for his behavior), so I am leaning toward the ruin-your-self-esteem-so-I-can-control-you scenario.It happens in very small, almost imperceptible bits until you are a very different person.You are already doubting your own desirability and looks because of his comments. Your own perception of yourself is being called into question. Why would you want to be with a person who makes you doubt yourself, instead of loving you as you are? There are more good men who would support you and love you just as you are rather than men who would take away your self-confidence. Being in a loving relationship should increase your self-confidence. Their love and caring should be a source of strength for you.It\u2019s important to know and understand what a loving and healthy relationship really looks like.", "link_id": "t3_7g3dwb", "time": 1511880838}}

{"dlx5515": {"text": "There are some drag and drop bootstrap builders that make it pretty easy. I started learning bootstrap a number of years ago. I am a front end developer and designer. I loved bootstrap because it allowed me to have all kinds of functionality in one package. Instead of having to cobble together a bunch of scripts and trying to get things to work together, it was already working and all I needed to do was simply call it in my HTML. Look at http://pingendo.com/ or google \"bootstrap builder\" for other similar tools. There are a lot of them now.Also you may want to look at purchasing a basic theme, from someplace like themeforest.com and then modifying it as needed. They also have bootstrap themes you can purchase and there are app themes. The only problem with buying themes I find is that I usually have to mess with them quite a bit to get them to do what I want unless I'm lucky enough to find a theme that has a layout that would lend itself to the information I need to display. Sometimes wading through other people's code (and maybe troubleshooting) takes much more work than simply writing it myself.You can go to the bootstrap site and configure it with whatever you need and download the files and then customize it with your colors, fonts. I have bootstrap v2 sites out there still humming along just fine. I also agree that the web is starting to all look like one big bootstrap website. So that could be a downside that everything looks like. Especially if you're not comfortable with front and developing and are unsure of how to make it much more unique.But on the same token, having visual cues that are similar across websites is a better user experience overall, because users don't have to keep relearning navigation and other types of visual cues to get to what they need.", "link_id": "t3_6v179j", "time": 1503316791}}

Show up each day and make them do it. I had to do that with my mortgage company. BoA bought my mortgage and somehow did not credit the first payment which ended up making each successive payment late. I had to do all the legwork to figure it out. The mortgage company had withheld a huge bundle of payments in the neighborhood of $12,000 or something (30 years ago that was a lot!), and consequently all those people were being considered late. I went to the mortgage company and sat in their office lobby and told them I would not leave until I knew that they had Fed Exed those checks off to Bank of America so that it would be credited properly. I got Bank of America on the phone while I watched them put all the documents in a FedEx envelope that I gave them the address for. I was not rude, or threatening, but I was firm and I told them I would not leave the premises until they did their duty with getting that money to Bank of America. I ended up getting a letter of appreciation from Bank of America for solving the issue.So just get a really big set of balls, and refused to move until they do the right thing. It's not an easy thing to do, and many people wouldn't do it. But it works. I have had to do it in other situations as well such as bill collections.
