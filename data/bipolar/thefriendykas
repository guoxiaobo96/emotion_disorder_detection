{"f8qurb1": {"text": "Funny you should mention that you haven't had them in a while.That's why I wondered if it was a bi polar related type of thing.One of my friends has been micro dosing mushrooms recently and it's amazing that the experiences he describes are almost identical to those I feel and have when I am manic. He also mentions that he has had a few lucid dreams after as well.I'm quite spiritual in nature to start with. But I always have this itch in the back of me that tells me there is more to bi polar than we know. The manic stages might just be a higher altered level of consciousness where by everything becomes increasingly sensitive.We just don't experience it enough to know how to channel it.And the depressive lows are needed to balance us out after such high brain activities. But because of the way we stigmatise depression it makes it seem like we can't handle it.Haha ooops soz about the rant.

I think the main thing I'm hearing is that it helps with the death of the ego. I personally believe that this is why we get those feelings of suicide. Society puts this pressure of being \"normal\" on us when what we do in our day to day lives is not very simple or normal.I think personally when I've been elevated in the past a little bit of fear and ego die and that's why I feel so good and on top of the world. Most people will never experience this with out drugs. I think we need to consentrate on that feeling but keeping it stable and making it more functional in today's world. Try some holistic things like grounding yourself to the earth. Drinking actual alkaline water etc I know it sounds full of shit but really helps me. Better to try it all something's bound to stick.Sorry I know it's hard to hear this type of stuff when your down. But I hope this helps you at some point in time \u2764\ufe0f.
