I was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety in my 20s and was displaying schizophrenic symptoms by 30. My smoking quieted my mind for a bit, but I got so much worse.I quit cold turkey after a psychotic episode and basically just finished my baggie one day and that was that. I didn't sleep well for about 6 weeks, I was also in a manic episode so that played a big part in my insomnia.By 2 months I was sleeping a bit better and I got married in June, after the wedding I slipped into a deep depression and craved it like a mother fucker. I knew it wasn't going to help so I basically just slept all I could to fight both feelings.By 3 months my lungs had evacuated all the funky bong gunk. But I was eating and eating so much I put on 20kgs. This had A LOT to do with my antipsychotics, my anxiety meds and antidepressants. By 5 months I was pretty much out the the pot woods and feeling more energetic and productive.  I cleaned my house for the first time in forever, and was more present with the kids. Helping with homework is so different when you're not smashed lol.By 7 months I found a job, and started working after 2 years of unemployment/maternity leave. And for the first time in 17 years went to work straight. And now I'm here. One of my darling crotch fruit smeared soap all over the shower floor and I slipped over, hurting my back. I always used pot as a pain relief and even today I'm fighting the urge to go score and puff the pain away. But I'm staying strong and trying my best to ignore it. Ibuprofen is working but only just.
