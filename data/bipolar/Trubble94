I stayed on the condition that they would offer me a full-time position and whilst I got bits of paid work here and there, they never did. But I built up such a relationship with the kids and the people I worked with that I couldn't bring myself to leave and in hindsight, didn't put as much effort into applying for other places as I should have done.  Eventually, I figured the only way I would get anywhere would be to leave the safety net of the school and register with an agency. Turned out they were not great and despite knowing I was without my own transport and physically disabled, would send me to places that were totally impractical for me to get to on public transport. It sent my anxiety through the roof to the point where most nights, I didn't sleep. After six months, I left with no job lined up.  I was out of work for around a year and it was one of the worst of my life. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and prescribed medication. It made looking for work really hard and even now, I try not to look back on the opportunities I missed because I was too scared to go through with them. However, after a year of searching, a school I worked for whilst at the agency got in touch with me and offered me my old job back. It wasn't much, but it got me back into work again.&amp;#x200B;Three years and several failed job interviews later, I made the decision to go to university and it was one of the best things I've ever done. I also have a part-time job which allows me to earn money over the summer. I still live with my parents for now which has made things a lot easier on me financially.&amp;#x200B;I still have good and bad periods with regards to my mental health, but I'm in a far better place now.

There isn't a set rule. If you're looking to get back into writing after a long period, I'd suggest setting yourself a small word goal each day and building up from there. When I did Camp NaNo, I set myself the goal of writing 15,000 words in one month, which was around 535 words a day.You'll get an idea of how long your novel is going to be as you write and the story unfolds.

They caught my interest so we stopped to take a closer look. He was really good.One particular drawing caught my interest. It was a picture of Jesus on the cross. We talked more about his drawings and I found out that he was a travelling artist, not based in one location and simply travelled from place to place. He found himself in different countries on a regular basis and drew pictures simply for the pleasure of it.At that point, I was going through a tough time with my anxiety/depression. I don't know if it showed on my face, but he took me by the hand and told me that I was special and strong. He told me that I didn't have to be like other people. I didn't have to be normal. They could think what they wanted about me and none of it would matter.It made me smile. To get a genuine compliment like that from a stranger meant a lot to me, especially at a time when my own self-esteem was at an all time low. I'm not ashamed to say I welled up a little. He could barely speak English.We continued on our day trip. But as we walked away, I heard a voice shouting from behind me.

But this beast, who was all muscle and hair and big teeth, would have had a job fitting in the living room.Timmy had watched out of his bedroom window as the beast got closer and closer, gnashing its teeth and swiping trees out of their roots as though they were no more than twigs. The storm thundered and lightning came crashing down all around it, just to make it even more terrifying. However, Timmy was a brave little boy and with his mother still asleep, he took it upon himself to protect her and battle the beast alone.Just outside Timmy's bedroom window, a ladder ran up to the roof of the house. Despite the thundering storm and the rain that came pelting down, Timmy managed to climb it without falling. He had lodged a stick down the back of his shirt, the only weapon he could find quickly enough, and balancing himself on the roof, he took a moment to survey the beast that was howling and lumbering its way towards him.Damn. The thing really was huge. It was covered with dark fur which had become matted by the rain and it had teeth which could have been the size of Timmy's arm. Swallowing a lump in his throat and ignoring the cold rain which made his clothes stick to his body, he pointed his stick at the beast and shouted.\"Hey you! Leave us alone, you monster! You don't scare me!\"\"RAAAAAARGH!\"The beast was now close enough for the force of the beast's voice to almost send Timmy falling from the roof. However, he kept his balance and tried again, his voice straining so much that his throat burned.\"Didn't you hear me! Go away!\"The beast ignored Timmy and as he came closer and closer to the house, he felt sick with fear. It wasn't working. Still holding the stick out in front of him, he wasn't sure whether to run, jump or throw up. His knees were starting to knock together.Suddenly, the beast was within grasping distance of Timmy and without thinking, he took a swipe and caught it full in the face. The beast reeled, taking several steps back before stopping and fixing its eyes on Timmy without moving or making a sound.A small puddle formed around Timmy's feet. He had never been more terrified in his life.\"RAAAAAARGH!\"The beast had suddenly straightened itself up and was launching at full speed towards Timmy, its eyes burning and teeth gleaming in the moonlight. The horns were aimed straight for Timmy's stomach and without thinking, he ran over the edge of the roof and was falling, falling, falling...\"Timmy? Timmy, wake up! You're having a bad dream!\"...into his own bed with his mother shaking him by the shoulders. His bedcovers were wet and his pyjamas were stuck to his body. His face was a pallid white.\"Mum?\"\"I'm here, sweetheart. It was just a dream, OK?\"\"Yeah, sure. Just a dream...\"But after that night, Timmy slept with the light on and the stick under his bed.

{"diad1a9": {"text": "\"Fizza-ma-wizza-ma-dill!\" cried the old man as he stared at the mirror, his face convulsing and his eyes practically popping out of his head as he stared at the mirror.The cat-like being which stared back at him began to chuckle. With his hollowed eyes and toothy grin, it was a sinister sight.\"Is that all you've got, blubbering old fool? What's the matter, cat got your tongue? You didn't think I'd make it that easy, did you?\"The old man stammered and spluttered, trying desperately to get his words out. It was as though his mouth and tongue simply didn't belong to him any more and were now at the mercy of the ugly reflection. Nevertheless, he was brave and tried once more to destroy the creature.Making a series of gestures with his hands towards the mirror, he attempted to cast the spell. \"I shall goe intil ane catt, with sorrow, and sych, and a black shott! And I sall goe gluppity glupp and a humpf-humpf-a-dumpfer!\"The cat roared with laughter and the mirror shook with the force of it.\"Ha ha haaaaa! What a tongue-twisted gnarl of a wretch you really are! Don't you realise that it would be no effort at all to sit here all day and have you kwigger and kweet and spazzim to my heart's content?\"The man was breathless and exhausted now, but his determination was steely. Seeing that the cat was about to launch into diatribe, he began to form a plan in his mind.\"I mean, really? You try to destroy me with your Latin and your hakken-kraks spell casting, when really it is no good at all. You would do better to accept your fate and realise that I have the power. Not that I intend to do anything important with it, of course. What a waste of time that would be. No, I intend to simply dissolve your happy little household into chaos, and destroy anyone who intends to get in my way.\"The man continued to say nothing, but stared at the cat intently.\"Speaking of which, I can't help but remark on your most charming little daughter. I'd hate for it to be her caught up in this murky-mooshy business...\"As though she had overheard the cat's remark, the daughter was making her way up the stairs, into the room which she had been forbidden to enter. She could hear yowls and cries of pain as she ascended but before she reached the door, there was silence. A zillow of grey smoke seeped from under the doorway.It is very easy for me to describe to you what the girl saw when she opened the door and let out an ear-piercing shriek. Far from the nizzards and skritz of books and clutter that usually made up her father's study, what the little girl saw instead was very different.In the middle of the room stood a mirror. Her father's clothes lay on the floor. But of the man who once wore them, there was no sign.

{"dgeb0lz": {"text": "**The Lonely Boy**It was a quiet and peaceful night. Henrietta the elephant was lay asleep in her bed, with the sound of the rain pattering against her bedroom window. She was in such a deep sleep that she wasn't even dreaming.Suddenly, she awoke with a start and found herself off on an adventure. Being a pink elephant who entered the minds of people who were struggling to get a good night's sleep, this happened quite often. She would help people who were kept awake by their problems.This time, she found herself in the mind of a young boy, who couldn't have been any older than nine. Henrietta could feel how tired his mind was and yet there still seemed to be something niggling at him. He had been tossing and turning for most of the night.Not wanting to frighten the boy, Henrietta spoke in a whisper.\"Hello? Can you hear me?\"The boy stopped and looked around his room. His parents were both asleep. Hearing a voice inside his head scared him.Henrietta tried again.\"Hey, there's no need to be scared. I'm here to help you. I'm a pink elephant and I  help people who are having problems and can't get a good night's sleep.\"The boy hid underneath his bedcovers.\"W-where are you?\"\"I'm inside your head. Only you can hear my voice. Don't worry, it doesn't mean that you're going mad. I've done this lots of times before, you know.\"\"Um, OK. So, why are you here?\"\"I'm here because you seem to be having a problem that is stopping you from sleeping. If you tell me what it is, I might be able to help you.\"\"I'm not sure about that.\"\"Well, why don't we give it a try? I've helped lots of children with their problems in the past, so I'm pretty sure that I can help you.\"The boy sighed. He had one of two choices. He could either accept that there really was a pink elephant inside his head who wanted to talk to him, or he could go running and screaming to his parents who would cart him off to the nearest doctor. He decided the first choice would probably be easier.\"If you say so. It's nothing really. I just feel like I'm a bit rubbish at everything.\"\"How so?\"\"Well, I've been at school today and I hate it. I don't have any friends, I find it really hard to keep up with my lessons and my teachers don't help me at all.\"\"That is a shame. Did something happen today?\"\"Yes. We had a piece of homework that was due in today and I forgot all about it. The teacher is one of the strictest in the school and if you forget to hand in a piece of homework, they give you an instant detention.He really did shout at me when I didn't hand in my homework. Most of the class laughed at me and none of them offered to help when I had to stay behind and do it. The worst thing is, he'll be sending a letter to my parents to let them know about my detention and of all days, it's on a Friday afternoon.My parents are going to go mad. I've never had a detention before. If I tell them, I'll probably end up being grounded all weekend. But they're going to find out anyway and now I don't know what to do.\"Henrietta felt sorry for the boy. It was clear that he was having a rotten old time and simply wanted someone to listen. Of course, that was what she was there for.It didn't take long for the pink elephant to come up with a solution.\"Are you certain that your parents would punish you for having a detention?\"\"I don't see why they wouldn't.\"\"I bet if you were to explain to them what's been happening at school and how lonely you've been feeling, they would understand. You've only forgotten your homework this once and it isn't the worst thing in the world. If your parents care as much as I think they do, they'll be more bothered about how you don't have any friends and feel miserable about going to school.\"\"How do you know that? You don't know my parents.\"\"No, but I do know that I don't enter the minds of children who aren't nice. Nice children usually have nice parents.\"\"If you say so. I suppose I'll have to tell them. They'll find out when the letter arrives anyway.\"\"Exactly. I bet they're kinder than you think. If they're not, I will come back and you can tell me off properly.\"\"I'll hold you to that. Especially if I end up being holed up in my room for two days.\"\"I very much doubt that. Do you think you'll be able to sleep now?\"\"I think so. I feel better now that I've told someone and I know what to do. Thanks for listening.\"\"You're very welcome. Sleep tight, now.\"The boy was asleep before Henrietta had returned to her own little bed.He told his parents about the detention over breakfast the following morning. In fact, he told them everything; how miserable he was, how he had no friends, how was struggling to keep up in school. To his surprise, they listened. They didn't get cross or shout. They simply sat and listened until he had finished talking.Little did the boy know, his parents had noticed that he didn't have any friends, but he loved reading. They had arranged for him to join a book club where he could meet other children who were like him and the first meeting was due to be on Saturday. He wouldn't be grounded for his detention; there was no sense in punishing him twice, and his parents made it clear that he was to tell them if he needed help with his homework.You may think that people won't understand if you tell them what's on your mind.

Letters began to form on the front cover, as though they were appearing from behind a mist. I held the book in my hands and watched as the letters spelled out HELLO.I didn't know whether to be terrified or excited. With shaking hands, I turned to the first page and began to read.*\"Wow, I've never seen that before.\"**\"She's inspiring, going out and about like that.\"**\"I want to talk to her, but I don't want her to think I'm taking the mick.\"*I had no idea what the book meant at first but as I continued to read, I started to realise that the book was about me. Every thought that anyone had ever had about me started to appear on the pages and there were so many of them that they became almost illegible. The first few were what I expected; looking the way I did, people usually took more than one glance.But then I continued reading.*\"I wonder if she knows what a good person she is.\"**\"She might be small, but she's one of the biggest people I've ever met.\"**\"I wish she'd stop caring about what other people think.\"*That was the point that I stopped reading. There were tears in my eyes and I still wasn't sure whether or not to be afraid. I set the book back down on the shelf and walked away.From that day, I learnt that thoughts are like books on a shelf.

Everything was a different colour, like floating through a neon rainbow. Pinks, reds, oranges, purples and greens screamed out at me from every corner. It was like I'd jumped head first into a bag of Skittles.Just when I thought things couldn't get any weirder, I discovered that this world was inhabited. Out of nowhere, a line of small blobs, who were also each a different colour, came bouncing in front of me. They had eyes that never blinked and made noises as they bounced -\"Boop beep boop.\"I thought I had seen everything, but I was about to make the strangest discovery yet. As the blobs continued to bounce on ahead of me, I noticed that they were eating the shapes around them. Out of morbid curiosity, I took a piece from one of the shapes and put it into my mouth. It was the sweetest thing I had ever eaten. My stomach turned in on itself and my face must have contorted into one of disgust. The blobs started to gather around me and tried pushing me to eat more.I ran as fast as I could away from the blobs and away from the world made of sugar.
