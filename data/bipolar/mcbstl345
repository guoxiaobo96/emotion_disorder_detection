I used to have mania so bad that I would have paranoid delusions terrifying that I was living in a constant state of fear. It was truly a kiving3 nightmare. Without going into detail too much they were basically your typical government conspiracies. I thought the government was spying on me and watching everything I did and could read my thoughts. I'm a law abiding citizen but I had a delusional mind that made me think Big Brother was after me. As far as atypical antipsychotics, I've been prescribed Risperdal, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Ability, Latuda, Invega, and finally Vraylar. Honestly, they all made things worse with awful side effects with the exception of Vraylar. I was somewhat mentally stable from that new generation antipsychotic.I decided to start smoking flower and WOW, I instantly fell in love. No more panic attacks, the paranoid delusions were gone, my GAD wasn't bothering me anymore, and had minimal depression. I was in such bad shape I didn't go out in public for a span of 4-5 years unless I absolutely had to. When I did go out, I thought I was being followed and under surveillance. I don't have those thoughts anymore now that I've been smoking regularly now for a year.My quality of life has become so much better that now I actually enjoy going out to eat by myself and can do so with no thoughts if paranoia.Well there's my journey, if anyone has similar issues that I used to have, hit me up!
