[Here is one](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-transport-and-logistics/our-insights/distraction-or-disruption-autonomous-trucks-gain-ground-in-us-logistics).  You may be underestimating the power of a cumulative industry worth a collective $800 billion.  They will buy off any politician they need to grease the wheels on regulations.  And it's an easy sell to the public by \"saving lives\" etc.   The technology doesn't have to implement after being completely baked in.. rarely does that happen with anything.  What will happen is it will hit when the ROI outpaces the risk.I'll broaden by narrative because that's where I'm at with it.  I don't work in your industry but I did recently help my company implement a machine learning bot that replaced 150 white collar workers.  The tasks it handles are more than simple data entry and required the ability to navigate multiple applications and databases and adapt to unexpected data.  While much different than the challenges of autonomous driving, machine learning is starting to have impacts.  This was just the opening salvo and more efforts like this are funded at my company for 2020 and beyond.  &amp;#x200B;&gt; When reception is bad? When the fault sensor fails? When the fault leads to a catastrophic failure? It's clear you're just speculating. I would hope the AI is trained to handle anomalies by stopping and calling for help.  But again, when ROI indicates that revenue gain is safe from the risks of lawsuits, it will happen.  &amp;#x200B;&gt; Ok weird are you skipping over the totally false statistic after quoting it? Nah, the statistic passes my smell test.  I can't find a good comprehensive source but almost 1/3 of American's have no savings at all.  It's not tough to extrapolate an additional 20% of folks at around $500 or under. &amp;#x200B;&gt; Anyways, you're making two mistakes: assuming UBI would work as advertised, instead of working the way it works in practice, and assuming there's *anything wrong* with a small town in the middle of nowhere with no productive industry disappearing Can you point me to anything that can inform me how a program like UBI would work on a national level?  Seems to work decently on a smaller scale in Alaska.  I agree with you that towns need a reason to exist but you are forcing change on folks that don't want it.  And for many that would want change they lack the economic resources or training to do so.  This makes people very angry.  Angry enough to vote a short-sighted, narcissistic, protectionist. race-baiting, authoritarian into office.  Our current political climate looks like white nationalism because it's primarily white small town communities that are angry.  Look at the election result maps again.  The only blue areas were cities because things are going mostly ok there.  The rest of the country wants change - and it's not going to come.  What do you do for those people?&amp;#x200B;&gt; The solution to these 'problems' has been around for ages, and has been the same for ages. Broad-based economic growth How do you possibly achieve this when the technology that is driving our current economy gravitates towards centralized hubs closer to larger populations?  Not only for a larger consumer base but for an educated labor force that can learn and work with modern technology?   It's this centralization of good paying jobs, coupled with e-commerce, that's draining small towns of opportunity and tax revenue.  I live in Illinois.  The southern state has been dead since the 90s.  Now the mid-state is dying and in hindsight that started a decade ago.  Anything 100 miles away from Chicago is being drained.  Part of this is state politics but the larger national economic picture is also to blame.  Lots of parallels of this in the interior 35 states.   &gt;Local cities cause housing to be expensive when nimby policy causes housing shortages.  &gt;  &gt;Healthcare is effectively controlled and run by the US gov't, and is as a consequence getting more and more expensive.  &gt;  &gt;Retirement savings are also strongly impacted by government, most notably in SSRI.Mostly agree.  To have a 401k a person needs to have a good job.  A lot of small businesses don't offer it or don't incentivize their employees to use it because it's a shit plan or has administrative fees or whatever.  A lot of folks in small towns are working multiple part-time jobs or as a cashier, clerk or contractor that don't offer comprehensive benefits.  That's not the directly government's fault.

But there are processes and additional technologies that are being developed to help with that.  Some adaptation may be needed by business like building staging warehouses that work within the limitations until AI can catch up.  If the ROI is there for business then it will happen and judging by the money being spent on R&amp;D this is a solid bet.An example of a mitigating technology is truck AI that will call into a centralized support center whenever it needs assistance.  A live person would connect to the truck and use the cameras to drive.

Never been to the rust belt have you?  Jobs and cash are being consolidated to cities at an ever increasing rate.  All those red states that voted Trump did so because of lack of jobs.  There are few good ones in their communities.  UBI is a mechanism to even out the wealth consolidation to cities caused by e-commerce without the specter of income redistribution or regulation.  This would provide more economic incentives to small town communities that are rotting away.I'm not saying UBI is the answer.. but it certainly can be one and should be considered.  I think Yang's issue is he's fighting narratives both parties are trying to sell to voters.  Democrats want to institutionalize the solution and enslave their voters to public programs.  Republicans want to encourage business by reducing taxes and regulations at the expense of ordinary citizens.  In the middle, Yang is proposing UBI which hits at the problem in a light touch and fair way (fair in the sense that most people could rationalize it as such if they truly understood it).", "link_id": "t3_ed5196", "time": 1576855379}}

It also appears your information on Mueller is sorely lacking or misguided.  It's pretty apparent if you read the Mueller report (instead of relying on partisan pundits to deliver the information) that he would have sought Obstruction charges but was respecting current DoJ posture that a sitting president cannot be indicted.  Secondly, Mueller went into detail on how the Trump administration stonewalled his investigation by destroying communications, lying, or flat out not answering questions.  These are not actions from an innocent party.  And given how this Mueller situation has shaken out, I think the Special Counsel was **overwhelmingly** fair in regards to Trump.  The retractions you mention are minor points (with a couple notable exceptions) that Fox/Rush/Levin and whatever other partisan you can name use to shoot holes in an entire story - but the rub is they require their listeners/viewers to never go and look at what was retracted.  Or at least that they be so emotionally compromised that they look straight past the facts of the matter.

Neither adopted parent seemed to want kids.  I lived with my father and step-mother, both narcissistic, neglectful, and prone to incredible displays of anger at my expense.

{"ezxjfrj": {"text": "The Tempest draws on Jungian concepts of the Shadow (46 and 2) and Shakespeare's play The Tempest.  Your Shadow is your primal instincts and selfish by nature.. The Shadow represents the truly morally reprehensible shit that every human is capable of doing.  When someone is acting on their Shadow they seem impulsive, deceitful, chaotic, selfish, or worse.  Except in the lyrics it's clear that this person is masking their shadow with a Persona of calm control.. a Jungian archetype known as The Trickster.  The Tempest play is about the journey to enlightenment of a man who is led by his Shadow.. his ship is literally smashed to bits by a Tempest of his own making.   *We know better*   *It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you*   *We know your nature* ... *Control, your delusion*   *Insane and striking at random*   *Victim of your certainty, and therefore your doubt's not an option*   *Blameless, the tempest will be just that* The Tempest is a metaphor for the bad shit a person can do when their Shadow is in control while they don't know it.. or in the case of The Trickster, they do know it.  The chaos and darkness that a person like this can bring about is real.  At the same time, the Tempest is an opportunity to let the consequences of their actions smash them to bits so that this person may learn to bring it under control.. to integrate both the light (self) and dark (shadow) sides of you .  When this is done, enlightenment can be reached.  [You can see this in the album art where the left side represents the shadow and the right is the self.](https://i.imgur.com/IuHVA8x.jpg)  The self also is ascending in a pillar of light.", "link_id": "t3_d2tgw1", "time": 1568241969}}

People first. If you do this and he finds that you are a flaming liberal later on.. he may just think, wow they aren't all so bad.  Not like Fox News is making them seem.

Survivors with Complex PTSD have a very difficult time with emotions -- experiencing them, controlling them, and for many, just being able to comprehend or label them accurately.\u00a0 Many have unmanaged or persistent sadness, either explosive or inaccessible anger, and/or suicidal thoughts. They may be chronically numb, lack the appropriate affect in certain situations, be unable to triage sudden changes in emotional content, or struggle to level out after a great high/low. It's also very common for these survivors to re-experience emotions from trauma intrusively - particularly when triggered. These feelings are often disproportionate to the present situation, but are *equal* to the intensity of what was required of them at the time of a trauma -- also known as an [emotional flashback](https://www.instagram.com/p/BLXJK-ZDvyF/?taken-by=beautyafterbruises).There are trauma based therapies that you can partake in such as EMDR, IFS and such.  So if the shoe fits... I encourage you to go down that path and seek a trauma therapy or at last a trauma-informed therapist.

Being adopted was probably the main reason I was undiagnosed with ADHD for so long.  My adopted family didn't have the genetic history of it.. nor did they have the understanding or patience to deal with a child who had it.   I grew up thinking I was unwanted and just... bad.  That's how I was treated so that's what child me thought of myself.  Later on in life, I racked up experience after experience that was tossed into the unwanted and bad buckets in my head.  It seemed everything was reinforcing the fact that I sucked.  Life was hard due to my ADHD symptoms, and doubly so because of the emotional trauma issues that were shaping my thoughts and views.  I ended up succumbing to anxiety and depression in my mid-20s and have been fighting that for over a decade.Then I discovered CPTSD.  After I realized that my ADHD treament wasn't fixing my inner emotional turmoil I kept on looking for answers that no one has given me.  CPTSD just clicked and I broke down crying when I found it.  I'm not crazy, I'm not broken.. I just have CPTSD.   I've been in a trauma based therapy for this and I am so much better now.  I, too, see the light at the end of the tunnel.

The medication has been amazing and it allows me to moderate my personal intensity and mental focus during the day which allows me to succeed without the added effort that I used to need.  But living so long with untreated ADHD symptoms has taken it's toll.  I wasn't well received in school, had limited friends, and would always be in trouble. Me = trouble.   Led to feelings of not belonging and being misunderstood.. among other things.  Then, through-out life, those themes of not belonging and being misunderstood became accentuated and ballooned into depression and (social and generalized) anxiety a bit later in my life.  When I considered the symptoms of ADHD, they were all there but emotional dysregulation was the symptom that had the most impact on my life.  I was keying in on that aspect because I felt it described my internal emotional struggles that would derail me on a daily basis.  However, my ADHD medication was doing nothing for it despite it helping me with everything else.   About a year or so after my ADHD diagnosis I went back to trsearching and found CPTSD.  It's been a life-changer.I feel my hardships of being undiagnosed and reeling from rejection over the course of my life inflicted a heavy trauma on my younger self..  one that I struggled to reconcile into the present.

The most important thing is that I feel like I'm whole again.  My life story is a cohesive book (including the trauma) instead of torn pages scattered on the floor.  I do have my set backs still but its mostly from dealing with triggers that are rare or I otherwise missed.  Things that I've processed to completion are good.

I got to see enough benefit early on to keep at it.  If you do try it, give it a dozen sessions.  I also built in some breaks because i have a life to live and some weeks I knew I just couldn't take on the additional emotional burden.  That burden will cloud over you for a day or maybe two after a session.  It's part of the process of reintegrating the memory.  Make sure your therapist prepares you to handle triggers outside of the session.  Once you open a memory and haven't fully processed it, it can come back on it's own.

It will help modestly in the beginning and over a period of a few months you should see a dramatic lowering of symptoms.  The consistent exercise will moderate your anxiety by boosting neurotransmitters that make you feel better.   A proper diet will reduce the easy energy - carbs.  I find anxiety loves carbs.  It just feeds on them.  I cut my carb intake to 50 grabs a day and increased protein and fat intake which is harder for the body to break down.  Meditation will teach you to pay attention to your inner state and thoughts.  Over the long term, it will help you be able to learn about yourself and moderate your anxiety to a certain degree.

I have to connect dots and learn about myself and my emotions.  I am having this attack because of X.  Sometimes its easy to find and other times its very hard.  Meditation keeps me safe when I do this.  Therapy has also helped me uncover more of my triggers and to identify when I get into an emotionally precarious position.  I know everyone is different but this works for me.  Some people use prayer but I'm spiritual, not religious.I was able to quit drinking but struggle with other vices.  What type of therapy are you in?  I wish I was more of an expert for people in your financial position but I do not have any advice for that.  I do believe you need to seek out trauma therapy in addition to what you are currently doing but I'm not sure what opportunities are available for you in your area.My parents were extremely neglectful and abusive.   So was everyone in my life.  I'm also 40 and, like you, I feel like I've lost 20 years of my life to this.  The good news is you can heal and it can get better.  The bad news is it wont happen in a hurry or without serious effort and bravery on your part.. not to say you haven't tried or been brave in the past.. as you said, you escape.  So do I.  I run from everything and everyone and then I wallow and cry in the mess I've made.  Sometimes it's my fault and sometimes it's not.  It hurts all the same.   You have to stop.  Not immediately.  But at your speed.  You need to learn to see when you are doing it and question it.  Learn why you do the things you do.  I was lost and you sound lost too.To get better this will take focus, persistance, hope, and love.  And compassion for yourself and others when faced with your past or your present situation.  Acceptance of how things were and how things are is also crucial because its unchangeable.  To learn self-care because no one taught you this essential skill.  Have to stay focused on the future because that's where you are going.  You will have wins, large and small.  And you must take time to recognize them.. laughing and probably choking back tears at the absurdity such a small step but its a step nonetheless.   And your bravery will likely not be recognized by anyone but you or maybe your wife.  It sounds like she should walk with you.  It sounds like there is still love there... hopelessness maybe just hides it.  I have no details but maybe you could provide the help each other needs.  I'm not perfect and I'm ok with it.  I take steps back.  I fail.. and I fight the negativity, the anger.  I take deep breaths.   I meditate.  I practice self-compassion and forgiveness for myself and others.  I'm open to others that i feel safe with.  And I calm down because it's ok and I've got a plan.  And the more I practice my plan the easier it's getting.  I will fall again.  Maybe tomorrow.  And I will calm myself.  I will reflect.  And I will move forward.  The storm will subside and the sun will shine again.  I'm beginning to believe it because it's true. I do recommend learning about whats going on inside.  It helps so much being able to recognize and overcome. For me, its not so much of a fight any more.. more like a conversation.  Its hard but it gets easier. Youtube and google for cptsd material.

A mild example; I'm in public having dinner with friends.  They are all talking and laughing and I'm there.. force a laugh so I don't look weird.. nervously glance behind after someone drops a fork on the floor.  I'm not 'present' with my friends.  I'm half listening and not emotionally engaged at all.  Emotional flashbacks are a pretty broad spectrum as well.  When I was first learning of C-PTSD, trying to figure out if what I experienced matched up was difficult.  There is no cut and dry explanations because of the vast number of variables that make this a somewhat unique experience to everyone.  Emotions and experiences manifest differently in everyone's bodies but here is an example of an emotional attack I had a few weeks ago.  Some people know exactly what triggers them.. mine are hard to nail down sometimes.  This one, I think, was caused by laughter in a loud place with lots of people... bad stuff from childhood.    Trigger warning maybe... Think about how fear and rejection make you feel in your body.  Focus on the body, not the mind because your mind is not driving this.  Trauma is remembered and replayed by the body.  You are out with friends and enjoying the night for the most part.  All the sudden, your stomach tightens, your breath slows, your body tenses, you feel intense sorrow and isolation, like a big rock, or pit, in your stomach, similar to when your stomach drops on a roller coaster except this doesn't stop...it keeps going.  You feel your blood pressure rise and a slight tension headache as a result.  Now that your body has your attention.. your thoughts start catching up.  What's wrong?  WTF just happened?  I was just sitting here with my friends enjoying a drink.  You start nervously glancing around.  You have to get out of here.  Panic starts setting in.  Your friends notice something is up.  \"Hey, you OK dude?\"  But that acknowledgement of a problem just reinforces your need to leave ASAP... people are noticing and you are losing control.  So you get up and say something about needing to go to the bathroom and get on your phone and grab an Uber home.  The longer this feeling goes on the more emotions get mixed in.. and they aren't good feelings.  Shame, guilt, anger, fear, sorrow, abandonment, worthlessness... and it drives terrible thoughts and brings up terrible memories.  You curl up in bed and, somehow, you fall asleep after a couple hours of emotional torture.  In the morning you wake up, \"Oh, hello anxiety, my old friend........\" and this continues until it breaks.  Whenever and however that is.  ", "link_id": "t3_aqtczd", "time": 1550211530}}

I quickly changed careers before things careened out of control.I provide that experience because it helped me objectively learn to handle conflict and I have tried implementing that into my personal life with mixed results (although more on the positive side).  So my answer is to remain as objective as possible.  Remove yourself from the issue.  Set it on a \"metaphorical table\" and discuss it.  Listen to what the other side is angry about and dig past that to their real issue.. put that on the \"metaphorical table\" and try to rationally talk about it.  From my experience being the 3rd party in so many disputes, this is something that anyone can do but so frustratingly few bother.  It's much easier to react with anger and indignity at another party rather than try to understand.  But... people can be people and sometimes rational is not an option.  For that.. I run.  Flight is a healthy response sometimes, right?  ", "link_id": "t3_9vvm3r", "time": 1541871426}}

{"e86ht9y": {"text": "I'm seeing lots of parallels.Here is some of my background:  Adopted at birth, divorced upbringing, shifting caregivers for ages 3-5, obvious (in hindsight) untreated ADHD issues, liberal use of physical and verbal punishment, significant neglect, narcissistic/authoritative parents and step-siblings, and peer bullying in grades 3-8.Here is the narrative I've built by attempting to sort through my issues:ADHD - I'm a combined type.. periods of hyperactivity with periods of inattentiveness.  Low working memory - When I get busy, the task I'm performing consumes me like I'm in a bubble.. I'm forgetful because my brain is consumed with the task and can only hold so much.  The plus side is I'm an extremely deep thinker and whatever task I am doing gets 110% of my attention.  I just tend to forget about anything else.  An example is I have went almost an entire day without eating or drinking anything while working on a project.  Poor emotional regulation - I get lost in my emotions which causes me to seize up.. this ties into my freeze response and it's hard to separate.  This is especially true in romantic and platonic relationships.  I also have a history of overreacting when those emotional gears start turning again.  Poor executive control  - I can plan and prioritize all I want.. but it goes out the window the minute I start doing and...oooh shiny.  My preference is to operate on instinct which is great for the things in life that I have mastered and I can be incredibly proficient and creative.  But for new things I'm trying... I tend to make poor decisions and fail.  I've had to learn to not take this personally and keep trying.  Poor impulse control - games, movies, anything other than what I need to be doing.  I've also struggled with nicotine, alcohol, and drug addictions.   Again - all this stuff and the failures it generates is what I see as my dysfunction which then feeds into CPTSD.CPTSD - All related to the trauma listed above.  I am primary freeze type with a bit of flight mixed in.  The fight was beat out of me at a young age before I knew that was an option.  I have issues with fawning early in relationships (which almost always has negative consequences).  I used to consider myself a social chameleon that would do or say anything for approval. I've developed a habit of ghosting people (flight) either by leaving when I get overwhelmed or never showing up in the first place.  I have a very strong abandonment response which is the result of attachment disorder.  In fact, this is my strongest response and can send me into a tailspin of despair.  This threat of emotional dysfunction keeps me detached from people for the most part.. because to be attached is a threat to my being according to my inner brain.  My triggers are:  Emotional Attachment/fawning, abandonment, fighting and yelling, physical fighting/punishment, loud noises, laughing, and verbal abuse.  Kind of crazy how that mirrors the trauma above.  I can tie all those triggers directly to the trauma in my childhood.It's all very intertwined though.. hard to keep it all in separate buckets.  ADHD is stuff I do and how I do it because of my ADHD.  CPTSD is the trauma resulting from my negative experience for which my ADHD may or may not have contributed.  Another way I see this is I am a mix of who I am (biology/ADHD) and what has happened to me (environment/trauma).It's crazy you mention rebuilding yourself because I've done exactly that a few times in my life after I hit rock bottom.  The first time was my initial collapse at 22... and it took me years before I realized that I need to try to stand up again.  The other was my late 20s which prompted me to visit a therapist for the first time.  The other was when I was 34.... and realized that I wasn't as cured as I thought I was and everything I had built up was a house of cards that came tumbling down - because... therapy was not addressing root cause.  I was just slapping bandages on and saying I was healed.  So I began a  period through current day where I doubled down on rebuilding myself and trying to figure it out.  Now, though, I'm closer to understanding especially now that I've found the basis of my issues - trauma during an age where my brain was still developing.  It's unfortunate but I do think this stuff is deeply ingrained inside.  As I've told my ex-fiance, I can't \"just get over it\".  Wow what an amazing idea I've never thought before as I shame and berate myself for being a fucking mess.  /sarcasm.I can tell though that you are very self-aware like myself... almost to a fault where that level of self-awareness also causes issues.  Not entirely sure but I think that is a product of the trauma.

My therapist simply told me to take some pills and keep coming in for CBT.... not until recently have I felt like I was closing in on the root cause.Yeah, impossibly fucked up fits.  Everything I touched turned to shit it seemed.  I was self-isolated for almost a decade of my life (I'm 40 now) because I was sick of hurting (or being hurt) or disappointing people.  I could never figure it out so I just stayed away.  The constant result was people hurt me or I hurt them.  And like you, I got sucked into games and internet culture because that seemed to be a safe way for me to get the little human interaction I needed without freaking out internally.What you say about shame also fits.  I was very ashamed of who I was - to my absolute core.  I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror.  I hated that guy.  In fact, one of my own recovery exercises I used to do years ago was stare at myself in the mirror and battle whatever thoughts came up.  It sounds like you are a bit more connected locally than I am which is good.  I was so happy when I was diagnosed with ADHD.  I felt like there was a real reason I was fucking up and it wasn't entirely my fault I was this lazy, forgetful guy with his head in the clouds.  My life is just governed by a different set of rules for which I was oblivious.  All I had to do is learn about the disorder and change my life to work around those limitations.  The medication was a miracle, as I mentioned, as it allowed me to start living my life and keeping my mind on task.But I quickly found out that there was more going on inside my head than the ADHD.  I was hanging out in r\\\\ADHD and no one was talking about the internal feelings the same way I experienced them.  I mean, emotional deregulation is an ADHD symptom and I do have this.. but it seemed like what I had was deeper and more fucked up than what I hear other ADHDers describe.  I mean, I'd have days or even weeks sometimes where I would be under constant, soul-crushing levels of anxiety.  I'd feel like the world is ending... or like I just got a diagnosis with 2 weeks to live.  It was fight or flight on steriods.  I needed to explain that and stop it.  Turns out, it was a CPTSD emotional attack.  All the other CPTSD symptoms fit and I have the past experiences to justify it.  What is so weird though is that consciously I have no emotional connection to the trauma.  I have to dig and dig to get to them in EMDR therapy.  But once I do and get past the wall of anger that hides them they come flooding back.  It made me realize the limitations of CBT therapy for people with traumatic backgrounds.    It sounds to me like you are on the right path and I'm sure you will get it sorted.  Its taking a lot of work to reprogram my brain but I'll never give up on that.

As far as trauma, I haven't found many great youtube material but try Dr  Bessel van der Kolk, who authored The Body Keeps Score - great book btw.  ### Here is a good TED talk  [The Effect of Trauma on the Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Pg4K1ZKws&amp;list=PLB_F-46cTiYw3zqaHGCmcW9MXZyCEegDe)Good luck - it's tough to sort through this mess but if you are taking medication for the ADHD it's easier to sort through it all.

You can find free mindful meditation sessions on youtube.. or phone apps.The goal is not to completely quiet your mind.  It's about calming your body and mind enough to have a normal conversation, if you will, without frantically jumping between subjects or anxiety driven outbursts of thought.  Breathing and posture play a key role.  Breathe deep and slow.  And keep your body straight,  yet not completely rigid.. comfortable.  You'll suck at first but it'll get better with practice.If your self-critic is going crazy saying you suck, listen and observe.  When you are calm, counter it with empathy.  You would be amazed at how much you can find out by listening and observing thoughts in a calm state.  A big issue for me is panic attacks.   They would hit out of nowhere and crush me.  When I started meditating I started to see patterns and identify my triggers.  A lot of the time, its the piled on trauma that causes the panic/emotional attack rather than one specific thing.

I'm avoiding foster homes and a potentially precarious life with birth parents that are at least self-aware enough to know they would be terrible parents.  Except, like you, that was not my experience.  My adopted mother left me and her biological daughter to escape my tyrannical adopted father when I was 3.  I did not see her again for 4 years but she eventually gained visitation rights and, despite her previous abandonment of us, turned out to be a periodical oasis in the tough environment of my life.  For those early years, I was mostly raised by a few different sets of grandparents, shuffled around as they needed.  My adopted father eventually remarried this woman that, I will come to find later on in life, was a narcissistic terror.  My narcissistic step-mother brought her kids into the marriage.  They were 4+ years older than my sister and I.  And they were terrible people.  My adopted father was a work-a-holic and didn't care to even say hello to me when he got home.  About the only interaction I had with him was capital punishment.  In short, I was scared to death of him.  He was loud, constantly angry, and gave out physical punishment for the smallest transgressions.  On the other end, my step-mother was stuck raising us.. if you can call it that.. and she despised us for it.  She would chide, deride, put down, beat, yell.. and her kids would happily join in.  Toss in a lot of peer rejection and incessant bullying every day at school.  I'll stop there.. but the peer bullying is not a small part in this...  I had an extremely lonely and abusive environment.  Have others experienced worse?  Yes, but that doesn't help me defeat the beast inside me.  Growing up feeling alone, unwanted, unloved, rejected, wrong, bad, evil, terrible... takes a toll on a child's mind.  I also found my birth family and they are great people.  They have all expressed deep regret and have accepted me and take every opportunity to have me in their life.  It's helped.  However, my entire childhood was stolen from me.  Even worse, I took my teen and 20s years from myself with intense anxiety and later on, deep depression.  My experiences have beat me down, created this scared child inside me that can be quite stubborn, fearful, and can tear my life apart with anxiety. I say this stuff because I want to convince you to seek emotional therapy.  There is a LOT to unpack.  Layers of abandonment, emotional abuse, negative beliefs and concepts...  I'm currently doing EMDR and I feel that the 20 sessions I've taken so far I have had real progress in improving my quality of life.  But there is still a lot of work to do.  Love yourself and get some help.  Moreover, it really helps to change your habits.. focus on changing your life by introducing better habits a little bit at a time.

I was in a very similar situation (raised by absent/narc parents) and it turned out I had ADHD (I also have CPTSD).  The reason I feel that ADHD is a justified diagnosis is that the medication helps immeasurably.  It's not perfect but it has enabled me to live more like a normal person.  More than any other medication I've taken.I found that a lot of my social anxiety was due to my \"disassociation\" or lack of attention/focus, particularly in public and even moreso when I was in loud situations like a ballgame, concert or bar.  Even a grocery store can get chaotic and cross that threshold when it's busy enough. I describe it as if I fall in on myself.  I get overwhelmed by the stimulus and I become a space cadet that can't connect to a social situation or even think of words to say.  When that happens, my anxiety starts building until I implode so I've learned to just remove myself from that situation ASAP.  This has led to me randomly ghosting family and friends...  With the medication I can focus and perform whatever task is needed without getting spaced out and sidetracked.  I can stay present in most situations which has greatly helped me combat the social anxiety trap.

That by being a westerner they have won the genetic lottery on a better life than 80% of the world at this point in humanity.

Instead, they live in fear and with rejection, their instincts denied, and they just have to learn to deal with it.  As such, their endocrine and nervous systems are trained and honed over years to deal with the abusive environment.  These trained biological systems, at a young age, are what wreak havoc on those with CPTSD.  And it had nothing to do with the relativism you describe because when it happened there wasnt anything to be relative about.

{"e2jwxtz": {"text": "I had a neglectful and traumatic childhood.  I was diagnosed with Generalized Depression and Social Anxiety at 28 after 8 years of hiding from the world.  After years of CBT, during which I found my birth family, I was diagnosed with ADHD.  There are hereditary markers in my biological family that helped the diagnosis - 2 of my sisters have it and I suspect my birth mom as well.  So I embraced the ADHD diagnosis as the answer to my mental anguish.  It did explain **a lot**But it did not explain everything nor did my medication fix everything.  It helped with my spacing out and disconnecting (what I now know as disassociation), my hyperactivity (evened out my energy in general), and my general outlook on life (I felt like a capable human for once).  However, my emotional attacks, my triggers with intimacy and problems processing strong emotions, and my hypervigilance around others were all still there.  I thought for some time that the hypervigilance could be explained by Sensory Processing Disorder which is often co-morbid with ADHD (now I know it as C-PTSD).  For the rest.. I chalked it up to the mental damage I've accrued in my life due to living with undiagnosed ADHD.. damage... hmm.I sought out a new therapist that specialized in trauma therapy, notably EMDR.  I told my life story and explained my symptoms - something I've also done with 3 other CBT therapists - and after some time she diagnosed me with C-PTSD (technically PTSD).I also have interests around this because there is so much symptom overlap between the two disorders.  However, the medication for ADHD is helping and so is the EMDR.  For the first time in my life I feel like I can see the light at the end of this nightmare tunnel I've been lost in.I'll end with this thought - suppose a child does have ADHD.  Imagine that hyperactive or spaced out kid (sometimes a mix of both) trying to fit in with peers and be loved by their parents only to constantly fail at everything and annoy, anger and burden those around them.  Would undiagnosed ADHD and the consequences that come of it open up a child to being traumatized by others more than normal?

{"dzq4tvg": {"text": "Very similar ideas here.  If God was truly all-powerful and we were the ultimate goal in all of his creation, why not start a little bit closer to perfection?  Why require us to take life in order to live?  Why did he not provide nurishment from rocks or inanimate molecular chains?  Why build a universe so vast and stick us on a rare, complex biosphere with no readily available means to leave?  And also no good place to go... So many questions that, when considering logical explanations, do not make sense.Instead, I see an Earth system that operates on complex patterns and spans an almost unimaginable amount of time.  The patterns of Earth's systems; lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere along with the characteristics of our solar system like axial tilt, rotation, location in solar orbit... all of these deep time patterns have allowed more complex patterns to coelesce...  allowed baryonic matter to build patterns within itself, including life.  So is God a gardener, weaving everything together until ultimately conscious beings appear so he could now tend to his creations (The compassionate God)?  Was God the primal cause but who lacks any kind of correlation to conscious beings (the distant god)?  Or is God a genie that simply blinks things into existence (biblical God)?  Or has our our universe always existed as a higher dimensional plane of information smeared across a black hole event horizon, whose mighty forces form the fundamental rules of reality that this information can follow and in a random series of events and an almost infinite amount of time, this information has coelesced into the 4 dimensional universe we find ourselves inside (Trans-dimensional infinity) There are countless more to list.

Second, I know nothing... just speaking from my experience so take it for what it's worth.  I am just beginning my journey to resolve my CPTSD so I am by no means cured or in a spot where I am \"ok\".  Do you practice mindfulness meditation?  It sounds like you would truly benefit from making a daily routine of it.I'm the same deal as you.  I push people away with my anxiety and emotional tirades (or just from trying TOO hard) and then I get more upset when I'm isolated.. and even moreso when I lump the blame on myself.  The downward spiral at it's finest.You need to work on you first.  It's not going to solve every problem for you.. but it's a step in the right direction.  You have to learn to be comfortable in your own skin.  Seek peace and acceptance within.  CPTSD makes this extremely difficult.  However, a majority of people will only want to genuinely interact with you if you have something positive to offer.  I don't mean to paint people in a bad light so consider your current desires and needs.. you want interaction; laughs, love, comfort and acceptance.  Good things, right?  These are the same things that others seek from you and you are no different from other people.  So, to solve your isolation problem you need to be in a space where you can provide some of those things to others.  Some of the needs of the self are fulfilled by others - for all people.  In this way, it's not selfish but selfless. Mindfulness meditation and self-care will carve out some space in your mind for these things to take root.  People don't need much from you so you don't need to be cured.. you just need a little self-acceptance and self-love to be able to provide it.I am also very angry with God.  I look at the world and I think he could have done much, much better.  Why waste your infinite powers on creating such inferior beings?  I see too many paradoxes with Western religion.  My personal answer is that I just don't follow Western religion.  My advice is don't let others define God for you.  Seek what is important to you, spiritually and answer that calling.  For me, it is getting out and being in nature.  I feel so good when I do that.. akin to those religious types who get that type of experience being preached to in church.  For others it may be donating time to a charity they believe in or creating art or other things.  Find your spiritual outlet.For your body - have you looked into body weight exercises?  I have terrible knees.. 30 years past my age probably.  I have to settle for body weight exercises to strengthen them.  Exercise your body - it's important.  Treat your body right.  Also spend some time researching a proper diet.  A modified paleo diet (I can't give up cheese) works for me.

Lots of experience succeeding even when your own brain is trying to convince you of failure will slowly win you over.  This is not an overnight process.  Personally, I meditate.

It's especially hard when I'm the one doing all the movement to change because no matter what I won't cure ADHD.  Eventually the symptoms will show again and it will trigger more fighting.  I'm trying to get my fiance to realize that she also has to change her expectations and work with me.In my situation, I've learned to be very self-sufficient in my single life.  I've lived alone for almost 2 decades and I've developed good habits to get things done.  We both work full time.  I regularly put in 50 hours a week.  She lives with me now but I pay mortgage and all the bills.  I do all the laundry, dishes, dusting, and vacuuming (roughly 85% of all the chores).  I'm constantly doing home improvements or fixing stuff that needs it.  When the day is finally done... I just want to zone.  And that's the problem.  Having her expectations in my life, especially with the drama, is too much... I struggle to meet my own expectations and now I have and I haven't found reliable methods to include her in my daily life.  The things I've tried have failed.  Hey, why don't you work out with me? (No) Let's watch this Netflix Show. (Not interested)  Want to help me stain the deck? (Haha, no)  I'm always in trouble for not giving her enough attention yet she doesn't attempt to meet me halfway.  Somehow it always ends up as a fight, almost daily.  Maybe I was too blunt or insensitive on a remark.  Maybe I was inconsiderate for forgetting to tell her I already had lunch plans.  Maybe I forgot her item request while I was at the store.  Maybe I wasn't listening as hard as I should have been.  Maybe I try to derail an argument on purpose.  Maybe sometimes I won't shut up and listen.  Maybe I got distracted and didn't realize what I was doing.  Maybe I MUST leave this party early because my calm is fraying but its ok if you stay i just have to go before I implode and I'm not doing it to upset you I'm sorry (I'm still in trouble...)I know I'm difficult.  Hell, I'm too difficult for myself most of the times.  I just want her to understand me and my issue.  But mostly I want her to understand that I will always fail to meet her high expectations as they are.  We've talked... and talked and talked.  She feels lied to, she feels tricked.

I'm just a selfish, inconsiderate jackass.  But she's trying now... so there is that.  I'm hoping we've turned a corner.  She used to take all this as evidence that I didn't love her but it couldn't be further from the truth.  Now, though... this is a damaged relationship on all sides.I'm pretty tapped out too and I feel that if this recent \"truce\" fails then we have to be done.

I say that because I had a horrible childhood - neglectful parents, no friends, made fun of by peers... and all of that experience made me even more vulnerable to impulsivity.  But that experience also changed what I was being impulsive towards... like, choosing and following friends that did drugs because.. they are like the only people that were interested in me.  Or getting into several toxic relationships with women and not being able to pull the plug.  And behind it all, my ADHD was churning. My personal belief is ADHD is a disconnect between emotion and thought, subjective and objective, irrational and rational.  Your emotional need is so great (for a multitude of potential reasons) that it just shuts down any rational thought and you go with it.", "link_id": "t3_78j5sa", "time": 1508932173}}
{"dov1xjc": {"text": "As for treating ADHD- Learn about it.  Read Driven to Distraction or other books.  Know Thyself- CBT works but generally only needed if you are struggling internally.  They could also assist you with developing coping skills.- Medication helps but it's not the silver bullet to slay all of ADHD.  - Take time and learn your weaknesses.  Where are you failing?  Brainstorm structure that you can build around that weakness to improve performance.  ExamplesI never get my action items completed from prior meetings.  Action Plan - put them on your calendar.", "link_id": "t3_78hjcc", "time": 1508931218}}

I was in a similar place as you when I discovered I had ADHD at 39.  I felt unable to manage my life.  Medication truly has helped me.  ", "link_id": "t3_78mnrd", "time": 1508930516}}
