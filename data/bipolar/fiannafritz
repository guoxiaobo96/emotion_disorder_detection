{"dqwxx8y": {"text": "How effective are these medications in lowering/eliminating anxiety?There are different kinds of medications and they work differently for different people. For me, after finding the right medication for me, my anxiety is at a low level that's very managable. Much more like me before I developed GAD.How common is it for emotions to become blunted?Again, depends on a lot of things - which medicine you take, how much you take, etc. For me, I sometimes wonder if my emotions are blunted, but it's not enough to make me feel like a different person. I don't know if that makes sense. I still feel happy and sad and stuff, but not at the extremes I was feeling when I had depression and anxiety. If anything, I feel more like me and less like my illness.Describe how dependency on the medication affects your life. What happens when you forget a dose? Again, it depends on the medication. I used to take benzos, and if I would forget those, the anxiety would come back. But I don't take them anymore because I didn't like the side effects and my antidepressant controls my anxiety now. If I forget my antidepressant, I get a little light headed. I've never forgotten it for more than a few hours.Don't you feel worried that you will have to take these drugs until you die in order to function properly? Don't you feel less human because you can't function properly without taking pills?I used to. I talked about this in therapy a lot. It's taken me a long time to get to where I am now (2 years on medication and in therapy). But now I like the way I feel. I remember what it was like before and I've accepted that anxiety and depression are illnesses like any other. Taking medication to treat my illness doesn't diminish me. I heard about tapering off, but how common is it for a person to successfully get off these medications and stay off them? And if you stop using them, will the anxiety simply return?I think people successfully get off antidepressants all the time. People who have a bad experience just tend to be more vocal. I would think benzos are harder to get off of if they're taken daily. But if you stop taking them, yes the anxiety probably will come back. Hopefully at that point you've learned coping techniques in therapy that will help you deal with the anxiety.Please describe any other good effects or bad side effects of these drugs.People have different side effects. There is a long list attached to every drug. But keep in mind that most of the side effects listed are very rare and may not be related at all - for instance, if someone got dizzy and fell off a ladder during the trial, they would list dizziness as a possible side effect because they have no way to know whether the medication caused it or not. It may not have. Some of the more common side effects of antidepressants I've heard mentioned are drowsiness, weight gain, and insomnia. Some cause anxiety, but it tends to be a short term side effect and not all do. If it does, it will kick in pretty quickly and you can talk to your doctor about whether to continue the medication. Also, some can cause sexual side effects, this is something you should talk to your doctor about if it worries you.\tFor anyone who has done therapy, please tell me how effective it is in combatting anxiety. Is it more or less effective than meds?For me, therapy was very helpful. I felt that it was better to have a combination, because I learned coping tools in therapy, but at the same time I couldn't be in therapy every day, so it was helpful to have medication in the meantime.", "link_id": "t3_7i8kal", "time": 1512673949}}

Either it was a bad reaction to the medicine or it just hadn't kicked in and my anxiety got worse naturally, I'll never really know. Anyway, it got bad enough that I checked myself into the hospital. I was really scared to try another medication. But I spent time with other patients, who had some of the same issues that I was having. And I spent time talking to the nurses. The patients told me sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right medications, but that's ok. I was crying, trying to decide whether to take the new medicine they prescribed. And the nurse asked me if a lot of decisions made me cry, and told me I deserved to feel better. That I didn't need to feel like I did. So I tried the medication. It turned out not to work, and I had to try a third. But the third one helped, and after tweaking other medications (I was also severely depressed), I finally feel normal again. My husband told me today that he wants to look for a new job. A year ago, I would have had a panic attack thinking about the what ifs. My reaction today? \"Ok, if that's what will make you happy\". It feels so nice not to be consumed with fear over something like that. I still get annoyed with the phone sometimes though ;) ... you should think about turning your ringer off if you can.

Also, some of these medications have side effects - most go away after a few weeks, but you have to be willing to put up with them and weigh them against your anxiety or depression. For instance, two of my medications make me overheat easily. I used to like it to be 75 or so in my house. Now I keep the thermostat closer to 65. I'm fine if I'm sitting still, but moving around just a little - like say doing laundry - causes me to get hotter than I should. I've seen people say they've tried 6 different medications in a 6 months - but that makes me question things. Either they didn't stay on a medication long because of side effects, or they moved on because it \"didn't work\", but maybe they didn't try a higher dose. Also, sometimes people will say they tried 4-6 medications in the same class. There are several classes of antidepressants, and if 3 SSRIs don't work, it's probably a good idea to try a different class. This is why I think if your first medication doesn't work and you were seeing a GP, it's a good idea to see a psychiatrist. Of course, there are people that these don't work for.

{"dohyhak": {"text": "First, try not to play them over and over - this is very hard, I know. I've had intrusive thoughts, and you can't always do it. But when you can, do something to distract yourself - play a game on your phone, make a list of all the things you see in the room, do a word search, color a picture, etc. Playing them over and over makes them more frequent. It's like driving on the same dirt road over and over, it creates a rut in the road and it makes it that much easier to play it again. Look into books about OCD  - you haven't been having the thoughts long, so I'm guessing it hasn't actually progressed to OCD and you can have intrusive thoughts without it being OCD, but intrusive thoughts are a big part of OCD, so self-help books tend to talk about battling intrusive thoughts.

{"do6g7r9": {"text": "How old is your child? I use Dr. Ludwig at VisionAmerica for my daughter (5). She's an Opthamologist though (specialist copay on medical insurance instead of vision insurance). We've also seen Dr. Peaslee there. Dr. Ludwig has a specialty in Pediatrics, but books out months in advance because she splits her time between here and Birmingham. We needed a prescription sooner this time because my daughter scratched her glasses pretty bad, so we saw Dr. Peaslee, he has some experience with pediatrics. Both are very good. There's also a new pediatric opthamologist at The Eye Center. But I don't have any experience with her (Dr. Calderwood). When my daughter had her first eye exam two years ago, Dr. Ludwig was the only pediatric opthamologist in town.Vision America: http://www.eyehealthpartners.com/doctors-huntsville/The Eye Center: http://www.eyecentersurgeons.com/physicians/", "link_id": "t3_75i9lw", "time": 1507657262}}
