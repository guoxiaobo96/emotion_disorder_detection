{"fi38iyw": {"text": "Ok so there all pretty tuff plants and will do fine in pots. I would get the largest pots you can because they will typically dubble in size each year In ideal conditions. And woody plants like yours don't like getting root bound. For soil I would get any potting soil that has perlite but doesn't have fertilizer in it. and mix 10% mushroom compost to this. Top the pots with 6\" of hardwood mulch after planting them. and maintain that thickness. The mulch will hold moisture, insulate the tree's and feed the European earthworms you should add to the pots. You can get worms either from your yard or you can buy them online pretty cheap. they will add beneficial bacteria to the soil and break down the mulch so the trees can use the nutrients in it.You don't need to fertilized your tree's this will cause them to grow faster than normal and create week branches. When the canopy gets larger than the pot they should be ready for a bigger pot. This should be done when there still dormant in the spring. Place them in full sun and let them partly dry out between watering once established. don't let them dry out completely. If you have any questions at any time I'm happy to answer them.
