{"fuym2ih": {"text": "I like this suggestion. There are several different options out there for temporary tattoos--as a compromise (and an opportunity to test-drive a possible cover up) OP's fiance can get it covered with something temporary for now/for the wedding, and spend some more time figuring out what he really wants to put on top.OP, I completely understand that this tattoo is distressing for you, but whatever your fiance covers it up with is going to be on him for the rest of his life. I don't think he's intentionally dragging his feet, I think he's just trying to put more thought into the cover up than he did the original tattoo, so he doesn't end up regretting it. You're totally within your rights to nudge him about it, but you don't want to push him into getting a tattoo that he doesn't really like just for your sake--it may leave him feeling bitter or even a bit resentful of you if he's constantly faced with a tattoo he only picked to appease you.Maybe you guys could look at some tattoos together to try to find him some inspiration? That might be something he'd rather do on his own, but I think asking him to at least spend some time looking/thinking about it is reasonable. I would just try to avoid pushing too hard for such a short timeline--I get that he's had a year or so prior to this to think about it, but you can't rush something like this. Pressuring him to figure something out so quickly is not going to make it happen faster, it's only going to stress him out.", "link_id": "t3_h9ikjt", "time": 1592267227}}

If she says yes: (this may all be common sense to you, but as someone who was taken advantage of, in several ways, in relationships with older guys when I was 17/18, I'm going to say it explicitly): Just be conscious of the fact that she's in a different stage of her life than you are, and may not be as experienced with relationships as you are as well. Don't push her to do anything she seems at all unsure about. Let her decide how far and how fast she wants to go.

{"ftmg4wp": {"text": "I have actually had the same conversation with my boyfriend. I love him to pieces, but I can't for the life of me fathom how he makes some of the noises he makes while eating. I mentioned it to him at first as something I felt was an issue that he could fix. He took it very personally, even though I felt like I had to downplay how bothered I was so it wouldn't hurt his feelings, but said he would try. Nothing really changed on his end. In later conversations about it, he exclaimed that \"I don't know how else to eat!\" and was clearly very distressed to be causing me distress. At that point I realized that the issue wasn't going away, and I was either going to have to figure out how to put up with the noises, or break up with the most loving and caring partner I've ever had over something that would be completely trivial for your average person but was, for some reason, a big fricken deal for me. The only thing that has brought me peace is learning to manage my own reaction. If I'm in a particularly irritable or anxious mood, I still will find an excuse to leave the room (rather than saying something to him about it, because I've recognized that this is my problem, not his), but I've made some progress in not getting so worked up over his mouth noises. I still hate the mouth noises, but they don't make me as viscerally uncomfortable as they used to. I've not had any issues with eating together recently (part of this, I think, although it sounds pretty silly, is realizing that I also make noise when I eat. It might not be as loud, or as slurpy and lip-smacky, but it's impossible to eat silently. Sometimes I focus my attention on my own mouth noises, since those don't bother me.) It's only when he's eating and I'm not that it still gets to me, and even then it's rare that I'm not able to tolerate it. I'd agree with the other commenters saying that finding a therapist you click with who will help you work through these issues is key. I've had several different therapists over the course of my short life but my most recent one is the first I've really clicked with--and that's not to say I didn't like the others I had before her; in fact, I really liked one of them and was fond of most of the others; but none of their therapeutic approaches felt as effective as my current therapist's do. I've made more progress in the past couple months than I did in the several years of on-and-off therapy before that. It really does make a difference.

{"fthn83t": {"text": "I up voted your answer for the ruling (NTA), but I don't really agree with what you're saying.First: if someone asks if I'm pro-choice, even if it's a romantic interest, I am absolutely not going to interpret it as anything other than a question about my political stance. Being pro-choice has very little to do with what one would choose if they found themselves in that position. If you're concerned about what a partner might do if they get pregnant, ask them what they would do if they get pregnant! Expecting someone to pick up what you're putting down in this scenario is, in my opinion, ridiculous. Secondly, I may be misunderstanding how this all went down for OP, but it sounds to me like she didn't want to go after him initially (she said she would happily co-parent if he wanted, but it was totally fine if he didn't want to be involved), but decided to file for child support after he exploded on her and got his whole family trying to harass her into getting an abortion. Is it kind of petty of her? Maybe. But I don't think it's wrong, and I don't think it makes her an asshole. Ultimately, it's in the best interest of the child.Finally, you're saying he \"did all he could\" by using a condom, but OP says he didn't even want to use the condom; it was at her insistence that he did. OP had not shared with him that she was basically infertile. He clearly was not that worried about getting her pregnant until it happened. It's true that there's not much else he could do on his end to prevent pregnancy, but it's not like this guy was being responsible and having the mature adult conversations necessary to ensure everyone's on the same page in the \"what if?\" scenario, he was happy to \"hit it raw\" with no reservations. Plus... I honestly find it hard to feel bad for a guy whose immediate response to finding out he got someone pregnant is to SCREAM at the woman that she NEEDS to get an abortion. A guy who then, after having some time to process and think it over, calls up his PARENTS to JOIN him in harassing the woman into aborting.", "link_id": "t3_gzmsxe", "time": 1591719931}}

{"fi7kifs": {"text": "For the cat to have been vomiting up adult worms yesterday, it has to have been infected for *weeks*. OP states they have had this cat at home for *SIX DAYS*. It's possible that there were not yet any adult worms to be seen in the stool or vomit when the rescue checked the cat out, and they could have missed eggs in the stool. Heartworm preventative medication was administered on the 8th, prior to the adoption, but not all heartworm meds also treat roundworms, plus generally you need 2-3 rounds of dewormer before the infection will be completely cleared, so even if it does target roundworms, that alone would not have been enough to kill off a prior infection. Most shelters have protocols to ensure the animals in their adoption programs are healthy and parasite-free upon adoption, but these aren't foolproof. I wholeheartedly disagree with the assessment that the roommate is just trying to wheedle her way out of vet bills. She's upset and worried about her pet, and feels OP's new cat is responsible for her dog's illness, and it's not some far-fetched theory; it's a pretty reasonable suspicion. When you adopt a cat from a shelter, there is *always* a risk that you're bringing home a cat who has been exposed to something nasty, whether that was in its life prior to the shelter or in its time spent in close proximity to many other animals. If I were the one who brought home a shelter cat who ended up being sick with a parasite, and my roommate's previously-healthy dog wound up infected with the same parasite, I would absolutely feel responsible, and at the very least offer to split their vet bills. OP, I don't think you're a tremendous asshole here, but I don't think your roommate is one either. I do think that offering to chip in for their vet bill would be the right thing to do.

I have a much easier time talking to people (in general, but especially doctors, since that's WAY hard for me otherwise) when I'm hypomanic. If I'm depressed, or even just level, I'm way more likely to leave out important stuff or just straight up shut down because I'm either overthinking my word choice or I get stuck in an introspective thought spiral or I feel drained from the effort of sharing whatever I've already shared.

If the division of points on your exam was significantly different from the breakdown of the original (for example, original was 50% reading, 20% listening/audio, 30% writing, and yours was 40% reading, 40% audio, 20% writing), then I don't think expressing your concerns would be out of line, especially if the section you had the most trouble with was weighted more heavily for you than it was for everyone else, but she is well within her rights to give you a completely different exam, and you wouldn't be \"calling her out\" for \"screwing you over\", you'd be explaining to her your perspective and asking if she'd be willing to work with you on it, whether that means allowing you another retake (unlikely), adjusting the weights of the sections for your exam to match the original if yours was different, or potentially giving you the opportunity to do some extra credit to make up for the section(s) you did poorly on.", "link_id": "t3_brel2o", "time": 1558467990}}

As some other commenters have mentioned, it doesn't matter if you're the sole breadwinner--decisions you make about your finances will affect her as well, and she should be included in the discussion. I feel like it would have been fine if, rather than just informing her that you're going to be helping pay for it, you had asked her to be a part of the decision-making, perhaps not in *whether* you'll help them, but at least in *how much* (something along the lines of \"They're my parents, they asked me for help, I agreed because I want to help them and I know we can spare some money, but I wanted to talk to you about how much we can realistically offer them and how it might affect us moving forward\"). Helping your parents with these expenses might not necessarily mean anything about you and your wife's current lifestyle has to change, but she deserves to have a say, especially because this could have an impact down the road. I think it's totally fair for her to be mad that you didn't include her here.

I came in as an engineering student, took all science and math and engineering courses my freshman year, then declared cse that spring. Took Data Structures in the fall my sophomore year--nearly failed the class due to physical and mental health problems, managed to salvage some of my grade with the last homework and didn't do too horribly on the final exam. In order to change my major, I retook the class as a junior, and have still been able to meet all of my academic requirements to graduate at the end of this (my 8th) semester, so know that retaking it isn't necessarily the end of the world.Know that struggling with Data Structures doesn't mean you're a bad programmer, or that CS is not the right major for you. There's a steep learning curve involved, and the class demands a lot of your time besides. Especially when you have other factors contributing to the struggle, having a tough time in DS is not indicative of a lack of skill, or being unfit for CS. There's a lot to digest. The more you practice, the easier it gets.In terms of this semester: it is true that if you fail one category, you're set to \"auto-fail\" the class. Students in these categories are reviewed, and the instructor may override the auto-fail. I would recommend that you set up a meeting with Prof Holzbauer to discuss your grade and the difficulties you've been having this semester. If you're having trouble in your other classes too, a meet with your class dean/someone at the counseling center may also be worthwhile. Going to office hours is a great idea. The earlier in the week you go, the more likely the TAs &amp; mentors are to be able to sit down with you and go over stuff (whether it's related to the current homework or not--you can also ask us conceptual questions, or for help with questions from practice problem packets/previous exams to help you prep for the final), since they won't be busy fielding dozens of students looking for urgent homework help.

I totally agree that every effort should be made to be understanding and supportive of the people you care about, particularly when they have a history of mental illness, but I also believe that sometimes relationships deteriorate to the point where continuing to try to support and encourage a person who refuses to make any attempt to help themselves or take you seriously becomes damaging to one's own mental state, which is what this sounds like. When the choice is between continuing to worry about and support someone who refuses to even acknowledge that their behavior has negative effects on you, or letting them push you away like they've already tried to do countless times for the sake of your own mental health, choosing the latter option doesn't make you the bad guy. Wish them well, maybe talk to anyone else who's close to them about their current state &amp; explain your concerns, but it's okay to back away from a situation that has become harmful to you; their suffering is not your burden to bear.

{"ehv8x1s": {"text": "I don't think I have any good recommendations for the sort of \"critical repair\" stage once it's gotten this bad, but CeraVe moisturizing cream is the biggest thing that's kept them from getting this bad the past 2 winters. I'd also recommend that (if you don't already) you avoid washing your hands with super hot water as much as possible, and wear gloves when outside if you can (even if your hands \"don't get that cold\"--I used to have this attitude towards wearing gloves, not a huge fan of em unless it was super cold and seemed absolutely necessary, but I notice a dramatic difference between when I wear gloves and when I don't, even without any products involved). I don't have any recent experience with putting the CeraVe cream on severely dry and cracked knuckles so I can't remember specifically but I'm guessing it'd sting like a bitch (most anything you put on em at that point does), and you prolly want something more than just a moisturizer rn, but would highly recommend for preventing this going forward. Hope your hands feel better soon! ", "link_id": "t3_axpxjg", "time": 1551819343}}

{"eg635bd": {"text": "This may just be a meme, but here's a serious response: the debugging homework was re-introduced by (nearly?) unanimous vote from TAs/mentors last semester. Debugging is an incredibly useful skill to develop, and being able to articulate what the original issue was and why your changes fixed it requires you to actually understand the process, as opposed to blindly messing around with the code and serendipitously getting something right. Getting 1000-2000 words out of the debugging process for this code will not be hard; there are plenty of bugs to write about. We're not looking for a compelling work of art, just enough of a description of your process to demonstrate that you understand what you were doing and you used a debugger to aid you. I'd recommend taking notes as you debug so you have a list of bugs &amp; how you fixed them to more formally write up when you're done. If the writeup part is what you're struggling with, I'm sure office hours staff would be happy to give you some guidance in turning those notes into a writeup (I certainly would!)
