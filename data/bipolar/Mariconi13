I decided that throwing my underwear in my brother's sock up to my neighbor's roof top would solve my problem.(You could clearly see it was a little girl's pooped underwear stuffed halfway in a white sock) I thought it landed there and no one would know about my accident. Sadly after 20 minutes my cousins saw it..they are my neighbors. It didn't land on their roof top but on my roof top. They have a taller house so they saw it.. and told my brother and he told my sisters and they confronted me. They asked me why did I put it in his sock. I was crying it wasn't my underwear and trying to convince them it was my brother's underwear. They laughed at me. I eventually told them I had to get rid of the evidence. They laughed at me and mocked me for years. I wish I would of just thrown it away or told my mom. Anyways I thought all these years my cousins who I just met at that time thought I was disgusting. They actually thought I was hilarious. I still cringe when I look at that bathroom and peek through my cousins rooftop.
