{"fem9jhv": {"text": "It sounds like the real issue here is your parents and even to some extent your limited experiences. It seems like you misunderstand the responsibilities a school psychologist (or any psychologist) has to commit to when a child/student speaks about suicidal.    A psychologist working with a child has to speak to their parents or guardians as soon as the child speaks about harming themselves or others this is to alert the parents/guardians to possible out come of having a child die due to self harm or suicide allow preventative actions to be taken.   If that child dies due to self harm or suicide the psychologist treating said child can be held responsible for the death these psychologists who do not report when they are supposed to report can face legal sanctions.   Your parents should have approached you with care and love, they should have sat you down and tried to understand what is going on with you and how to improve it. They should become actively involved in preventing these behaviours and encouraging self improvement.  Since your parents are not supporting you in the appropriate ways and even if they were psychologists would still be your most favourable option when seeking mental health support and guidance towards creating a stronger more aware human being who can understand and live through life's rough patches.  In my own case I had to trust psychologists, therapists, doctors, teachers, family members and friends from the age of seven to understand my mental health disorders (anxiety and paranoia disorder, manic depression disorders bipolar and ADHD) and how to live with them, it was only at the age of twenty four did I finally feel educated and strong enough to live life on my own.  By that point I had many years of self harm, suicide attempts and emotional break downs and with each one learning new skills to prevent and control them. I still fight my disorders everyday and have learnt that you never stop working on your mental health. I got this far because I received professional help from the psychologists and proper medication from the doctors you are afraid of.  Don't be afraid of the support that is out there a lot of people want you succeed and be happy. What you should fear is how much worse your life will be if you don't seek the help you need.

{"f9m7mh2": {"text": "This battle we have with our mental health issues or disorders can be the hardest longest battle we ever face with the real possibility of it never going away.  In my case I was born with chemical imbalances that vastly effect my mental health and served as the building blocks to my mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, bi polar and adhd.  From the age of seven to twenty four these disorders made my life hell, it took years of trailing different medication, education on psychology and mental health disorders and the support of many different people to find a state of mind where no matter how depressed, no matter how much I want to kill myself I won't.  My fiance as well as many other friends, family, doctors, psychologists, teachers and even strangers were a huge support network that kept with me no matter how bad I was and now I have the strength to teach and support them. I know that one day I will die and no matter how much I want or fear it it will come regardless.  So there is no need to rush, there is no need to be ashamed of wanting to die, as long as you wait it out you at least get a chance to be happy, to feel joy and content.

{"f9f96sb": {"text": "the first question that needs to be asked is: is this situational or chemical?  For example I was born with a chemical imbalance which gives me manic depression, anxiety disorder, adhd, paranoia disorder and bi polar the only way for me to combat this is to find the right medication and learn coping skills and mechanisms. it took from the age of 7-24 to get my life in check with a great deal of support from family, friends, doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, general practitioners and even strangers.  But my situational depression came from things like growing up poor, being gay and trying to fight off confusion and bullying and anxiety about my life choices. This was not fixed by medication but by understanding life and learning to either change what I could and cope with what I couldn't change.  I hope this helps you, I am free to chat and here are some parting quotes that help me.    Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can. \u2015 **The Dalai Lama** \u201cIf a problem is fixable, if a situation is such that you can do something about it, then there is no need to worry.

In the same sense I have lost a brother to cancer and my mother just had hers completely removed and I still make cancer jokes when I feel like it won't push people to a dark place, sometimes the only way to move forward is to disconnect and realise that if you can't see both the dark and the light your not getting the full picture.  It is normal for you to be upset and it is normal for your friends to speak this way, neither is wrong and neither is right but if it really makes you feel uncomfortable you should let your friends know, this way they can restrain from saying things that may trigger you  or on the other end maybe you could learn to not react to something just because it bothers you or you don't agree with it.  It also sounds like people are not respecting you when you confront them on the subject, either you need a better approach or you need better friends but either way it's up to you to do something about it.  I have assisted many people with their thoughts of suicide and I am strong believer that if you can conquer something you should be able to talk about it in any manor with out it affecting you.

The best method to spend more time with some one is to ask straight up with no beating around the bush.

Ask if you could join in on an activity she does with her friends so they get a chance to suss you out because those are the people she will talk about you with and the more they trust you and enjoy your company the more she will feel comfortable around you on her own.  If you just straight up ask her on a date you will mostly likely be rejected, I know I wouldn't spend time with some one I don't trust let alone don't know well.

{"f3zvyll": {"text": "Everything is a chemical reaction it's how you choose to accept these reactions that make you a unique human being. I will explain a little about myself so you know where I am coming from then give you the best advice I got then give you my advice. Please remember I am not a professional I have just received a lot of professional help and I am now on the other side and I urge you to see a doctor and a psychologist.  From seven to twenty four I had struggled with who I was and what to do with myself, I spent every night in a state of panic and depression. In this time I saw many psychologists and doctors I spent eleven years trailing different medication and learning from others who also suffered like I did. My depression, anxiety, bi polar, ADHD are all a chemical imbalance there was no trauma setting it off. After eighteen I got the sleep I needed to make things right. I have a wonderful fiance who never stopped supporting me no matter how many times I kept us up at night crying. Now at twenty five I am on top, I still fight the good fight everyday but with the lessons I learn't and the strength that I built I found that I am now more powerful than ever before because I gained a unique outlook, one that provides me with peace I need.  The best advice I got was:  Never give up- I tried to kill myself a hand full of times and I am so glad I failed, I would not only be the person I am today I would have also passed the pain on to my family and friends.  Get the medication and treatment you need- it's trail and error for both one day you will find the medication(short term or life long) you need and you can find the right psychologist for you one that makes you feel empowered.  Don't fight it alone- you took the first step here but you have to talk to some one- friends, family, strangers and even me  Keep a good mind and body- exercise even if it means going for a long walk every day with someone you can talk to.  Eat well- food is fuel and not just for your body but for your mind as well   get two hobbies- one for you to do on your own and one you do with others  Now for my advice to you:  I had to give up everything to work on my mental health but another part was learning how not to feel, for most people this is not a go to fix all.  But for me meditation taught me how to feel an emotion but not react to it or act on it. You can feel the darkness or the light but sometimes you just don't need to feel anything at all.  Prepare yourself- Life will throw a lot at you, people will die, friends will move on. Sit down on a regular basis and list the things that will upset you and process them let yourself feel the emotions and then take note on how you could prepare for them.  Overthinking can be your ally- you can use it to your advantage, but only if you think objectively. as soon as overthinking becomes emotional go and do something that will clear your mind (a movie-a video game- cooking- read or come onto reddit) I know it's hard but when you practice and put in the hours you will gain a strength and power that some people never find.  I hope you find peace, I hope this helps and I wish I could do more to help :D", "link_id": "t3_diybzw", "time": 1571278293}}

I will list some hobbies and activities below and explain how they might help but please remember I am not a professional just some one who has had a LOT of professional help over many years and is now on the other side, I still fight the good fight everyday, it will never stop but now I am in control and I will not be broken ever again.  Art- painting-dance-music-singing-photography- Art can be a powerful tool that you can use to explain, describe, relieve and project your emotions. With Bi polar you can see your art change based off of how you feel at the time, it is a form of expression that comes from deep within.  Long walks: this one has many advantages, it gets you out of your house into the sun and you can use it to explore your local community the best walks are with some one else, some one who wants to hear you speak and someone you want speaking to you.  Dungeons and dragons- this has so much potential- you play with other people- you create a character you want to be- if you become a dungeon master you can world build- it forces a sense of wonder and makes you use your imagination.  Video games- single player and online- there is a community out there you just have to find the game for you.  Gardening- keeps your mind and hands busy while you put energy into another living being- plants have no social requirements they don't need you to feel happy- you find something and watch it grow( I suggest cacti they are hard to kill and can go weeks without attention which is perfect for people who have extended mood swings)  Cooking- goes with out saying that a well cooked meal has some great benefits Get a dog- while not a hobby they will keep you busy and like plants provide great joy, but plants don't give you companionship like a dog will- Feed them- walk them- play with them- cuddle them-train them  and the best part is they will love you no matter how sad you are.  Go out and help others- volunteer some where meaningful to you, some where you can use your time to help others ( nothing makes me happier and makes me feel more powerful than putting a smile on some ones face.  and finally talk-sometimes it's all you need and it provides feedback - while you should be talking to a professional you should also be talking to friends-family-strangers- or even me :D  Good luck I hope this helps and I wish I could do more :D", "link_id": "t3_diyd93", "time": 1571275784}}
{"f3zp639": {"text": "I am no professional but I have control of my depression so while I beg you to see a doctor and a psychologist I'll also give you my views:  Stop drinking-  It will only make things worse and really should not be used as a band aid solution, your brain is already struggling and adding frequent black out times will make it worse.  Cut off the dead meat and move on- easier said than done but there is no bigger waste of your time then putting energy and love into people who don't give it back. You and your time is worth much more.  It is okay to be depressed and suicidal- as long as you think about it clearly and don't follow through, never give in (it's cheesy to hear but you can get better and will if you try and not just better but stronger and more powerful than ever before)  Find the right medication- short term or life long what ever works best for you ( it took eleven years  of trail and error to find the right medication)  See a psychologist- find one that is right for you and stick with them.  You are enough- you don't have be with someone to be happy- that being said spend time with your friends and go see your family anyone who cares would rather you drive to them than be alone and upset.  Cry as much as you need- but when you finish start to break down the reasons why you are crying and plan out how you should handle those reasons so next time you don't cry or at least cry less.  Get yourself two hobbies -one that you can do on your own and one out in the community.  Get out there and do some good- when I make others feel happy I feel happy and it brings new meaning to my life.  learn about psychology-even a little can help  Talk to people- people who care -family- friends-doctors-psychologists- strangers-even me, don't fight the good fight by yourself :DPlease remember this fight may be a long one- it took me from the age of seven to 24 to gain full mental control and I am now more unbreakable and you can be too, I still fight the good fight every day but it gets easier.  if all else fails eat some chocolate and go for a long walk in the sun, this will provide your body with endorphins.

{"f3wgsky": {"text": "As some one with Bi-polar, depression, anxiety disorder, paranoia and ADHD I can tell you it took me a long time to learn to live with it and become a well rounded human being, don't give in to your negative thoughts you can get better even if you have to do it on your own.  I had to practice thinking in a ways  that didn't support the already negative outlook I had. I didn't have any traumatising events in my past it was all a chemical imbalance that got worse  as I got older. From seven to seventeen I was in a state of living hell triggered by everything. I only stopped seeing a  long list of therapists and doctors when I turned twenty four and now at twenty five I have never felt more in control and empowered. I learnt so many things over the years and now I find I have the experience to encourage others.  The best advice I got I will list below:  \\-You are going to die at some point anyway so why cut it short?   \\-Fake it till you make it- from forcing a smile to forcing thoughts of joy.  \\-Find an outlet- for me it was art and spending time with people who understood my pain.    \\-Help out others- this was hard at first but the more people I made smile the more happy I felt  \\-Don't give up- I tried to kill myself a hand full of times and I am here to say I am glad I failed- there was so many people who I would have hurt if I managed to do it and I would have never reached where I am today.  \\-Focus on the good- all I did was panic and it clouded my judgement I was not able to see the good things in my life for a long time.  \\-Don't fight it alone- friends-family-psychologists-teachers-doctors and strangers all helped me get through it.  I still fight the good fight every day and sometimes it consumes me but I'll won't let anything bring me down ever again.  My advice to you (please remember I am no professional and I advise you to keep looking for the right professional for you) is:  \\- find the right medication (short term or life long) What ever it takes to win this ( it took eleven years of trail and error before I found the medication that helped)  \\-Try the Keto diet you can eat as much as you want as long as you follow the advised food ( you will have to change a few things but there is a substitute to everything you could want to eat and after a while the cravings go away).  \\-get out there meet people ( I know it can be hard) but find someone who cares and stick with them.  \\- talk to someone, preferably a professional but if it comes to it message me- I would gladly chat to anyone who wants to)  \\-Get two hobbies one you can do on your own and one you can do with others.  \\-Read books about mental health  \\-Learn about psychology (even a little bit can help)  \\- get your endorphins (chocolate, exercise, sunlight, doing things that spark joy)  \\-Have fun      My most important rule is to not put anything before your mental health. I gave up on school, my  job, my friends and my family in pursuit of happiness and in the end I was able to get them all back.

Is it okay to to be a hard worker who has a job  and be some one who takes drugs?  What drugs prevent people from being able to work?  If someone spends most of their welfare on their bills and food, applies for every available job and does training (online or in person) and saves money to treat themselves does it matter how they treat themselves?   Does it matter if they don't harm themselves or others with that treat, whether it is alcohol, cigarettes, video games, gifts for their children, a new car or a pizza?  At what point do we look at human rights and at what point to we look at mental health?  We all have needs and for each person there are different ways to meet those needs.

I'll wrap up by saying forcing everyone on the dole to use these cards is not the step forward we need but maybe making people who don't do everything in their power to find a job, people who do buy drugs and constantly avoid attendance and lie to the system should be put on these cards. We make parents who don't spend their welfare money on feeding their children and meeting the needs of the family first use cards like this and we do that to enforce safety and human rights.

People selling to minors.  People driving under the influence or who have little tolerance and take risks.  People with a susceptibility to schizophrenia being exposed to cannabis.
