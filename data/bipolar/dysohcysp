{"euqb39l": {"text": "Alcohol and me had a great and unhealthy relationship since I was a teenager. It got really bad throughout college, I would self medicate with Xanax and go out drinking every night instead of going to class. It made my depression a lot worse but sociality was the most important thing to me when I was manic. I rapid cycle, so I was depressed when I woke up, encouraging my drinking (because I either wanted to forget that I had no idea what had happened to me the night before or the fact that I was failing all of my classes for the third semester in a row) and then when I was out w \u201cfriends\u201d or getting ready to go out w \u201cfriends\u201d I would be manic as all hell, drinking and doing drugs every single night. From Sunday - Sunday I was always day drinking and then partying at night. Drinking to excess brought me to a place I never want to return to. I put myself in situations I\u2019m still too ashamed to admit to myself at times.  As you said, it exacerbated my bipolar tendencies. I\u2019d often get violent, sloppy, and impulsive. I once kicked out a window of my 12th story NYC apartment and the police came. I have no recollection of the incident. I once woke up on the hallway floor of my college apartment building outside my friends apartment with only a t shirt on. No idea how I got home that night. No idea where my clothes had gone. Never found my phone or wallet or anything. I just had to accept it and move on. This is actually the period in my life where I met my boyfriend. He brought me back to earth, but it took 3 years of fighting. I\u2019m still not sure how or why he put up with it all. It\u2019s weird to think that it was only 3 years ago that I was drinking and taking Xanax every single night, blacking out every single night and never knowing what happened to me after 10pm. Since then I stopped drinking entirely for a few months and got help. It wasn\u2019t easy. I went through a solid two years beforehand of trying to be stable without meds (I was undiagnosed until about 3 months ago) and I would crave the alcohol and drugs to continue to escape everything. Now I\u2019m decently stable, won\u2019t call it great or perfect by any means, but I\u2019m working on it. The one thing that I can say my meds helped for sure is my impulsivity and self destructive behavior. I still get hypomanic and feel a little depressed sometimes, but for the first tome I feel like I might not completely ruin my life every day when I wake up in the morning.  Side note: I do have co-morbid BPD so that drove me a lot as well.", "link_id": "t3_ch250q", "time": 1563974716}}
