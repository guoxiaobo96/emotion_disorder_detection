Match made in heaven:) We were high school sweethearts. He was a senior and I was a freshman. He was a jock, i was the emo kid. We took each other's virginity. We were perfect, happy. Until he left for college a state away. We were young and immature and couldn't handle the distance so we broke it off. We both quickly found someone new and just continued on with our lives. He got married, joined the military, had two kids. I was with a guy I met in high school and went to college with, I was working my ass off, making bomb money with two jobs... but I wasn't happy. The guy I was with never talked about marriage or kids which i wanted both. But I partied heavily and ignored my feelings. One day, out of the blue, first love's  wife contacted me. She went on and on about their perfect little life and suggested I talk to first love and try to be friends. So we started talking, and I discovered he wasn't happy. After months of texting (nothing emotional, just chit chat) he admitted that he never stopped loving me and had just given the new girl everything he wished he could have given me. My heart sank. I realized that deep down, I had never let go of him. We agreed to stop talking then. He was married. He had kids. Fast forward a month or so, he called me. His wife had gone off the deep end. He found out that while he was at work she was neglecting the young kids. She had also thrown a beer on his fellow soldier after he made a light hearted joke. They got in a fight and she admitted she hated being a wife and mother, especially in the military which hurt him because he had only joined the army to provide for her. They had decided to end it. He was distressed because not only was she leaving but she decided she just didnt want her kids anymore and was leaving them with him. He loved his kids but had no babysitter or daycare set up. He ended up having to send them to his parents for awhile. At this point I started reflecting on my life as it was, and realized how unhappy I was. I realized I had no real future with my boyfriend. I knew in my heart what I wanted. I ended up moving across two states to be with him. I'll admit I was a bit manic, but my thought at the time was that he needed me and those kids needed a mom. I changed everything and became a stay at home mom and housewife instantly. And I had never felt such purpose. He and I were perfect together again. Still together seven years later and we have a kid of our own too. Our relationship is effortless really. We get along. We both have the deep feeling that we belong together and life just works as long as we're together. We've been through a lot, but our relationship, our love, is consistent. Life is hard but our love is good. Our friendship is good. And we have a great little family.", "link_id": "t3_fjcwea", "time": 1584475404}}

When he graduated his mother made him go to college in a different state to get him away from me under threat of not supporting him in any way. So he went. We lasted for over a year with only a handful of visits, but I was paranoid he was cheating. I decided to break it off and immediately started dating someone else just to have someone. Some one that I could touch. Someone that was there. This is a good time to note that during thr relationship with Jason I was allowed to date girls. I had a relationship with a girl we'll call Kate.Jason came back for one final visit to pick up some things of his. Knowing it would be a difficult experience for both of us I had Kate come over. Well, long story short they ended up falling for each other. They had a spur of the moment wedding with no guests at a courthouse, and moved in together. Fast forward four years, they have two kids and are still married. I'm in my second relationship since Jason, which lasted about four years as well. One day Kate sends me a friend request. We talk, become friends again. Jason still won't talk to me, he still feels betrayed and hurt at how fast I started dating another guy. But Kate suggests we talk. Some awkward convos later we all decide to meet up in my college town as they pass through. Then it happened. Jason and I saw each other and it was love at first sight all over again, for both of us. Kate realized it too. A lot of heartbreak, fights, and tears happened, between all of us. This occurred over months. But they decided to divorce and I ended up dumping my boyfriend, moving in with Jason and now six years later Kate and I are besties, she's getting married and I have my own kid with Jason. Whew.
