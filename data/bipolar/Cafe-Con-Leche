For example,  mania is associated with elevated mood, but it also causes weight loss, increased alcohol intake, restlessness, inability to focus and/or hyperfocusing, insomnia, agitation, tremor (in some cases), etc.  All of those symptoms happen, regardless of how you view yourself, because they're caused by a physical problem in the brain.

The weeks i wasn't trying, i felt on top of the world.I had such a traumatic experience with crisis centers and therapists that i didnt seek help at all until my current girlfriend.  Off of a friend's recommendation, I saw a specialty therapist and a new psych.  Even then, it took me 6 months for my therapist to say I was misdiagnosed and I was bipolar.  My main problem is I legit cannot remember what I did or do when I'm in an episode. My whole brain shuts off and nothing sticks.  Everything I do feels like I was a third-party to all of it, but like, as a passerby on the street.  Plus, lately I'm suspecting I might have schizoaffective.

Sex is a learned skill and everyone likes different things.It will be very awkward and there are SO MANY WEIRD SOUNDS.  Just roll with it, or if you have a partner with a good sense of humor, go ahead and have a little giggle fit.  It might be a bit of a \"mood killer\", but I think it's good to let your partner know your virgin status.  Helps everyone kinda learn and figure it out.If you're a vagina-owner, expect it to be a little painful (but not super painful) and just keep a towel handy in case you bleed a little.  I personally didn't \"have my cherry pop\" until my 3rd partner, so it's really a crapshoot on if that happens or not.  Oh, and lube. Lube is way better for both parties.If you're a penis-owner,  do your best to not put so much pressure on yourself.  It's hard to perform if you're already anxious.  The vagina is WAY lower than you think.  Have your partner guide you if you have trouble finding it.  To find the clit, all you have to do is gently pet from the vulva down to the vagina.  It's the only part that sticks up.  Clits get hard just like dicks do, so petting and playing with the whole package helps the clit get stimulated.  Oh! And if you can, lube your dick just like you would if you're masturbating.  Helps get both parties excited and it'll be much easier to find the right hole.  Wear. A. Condom.  You'll probably blow a lot sooner than you think, so to protect from a one pump baby, wear it. Now!  For the virgin gays!Vagina on vagina sex is great, but PLEASE CLIP YOUR NAILS.  Same thing as above, play with the whole package.  One finger penetration to start, then build up if your partner feels ready.  The Come Here motion is a godsend of a move.  Scissoring is fun for foreplay, but most of the time, it doesn't really get anyone off.  Touch ALL OVER!  Grab dat ass.  Slap them titties (but...not actually slap..)  If you have a dildo, lube that thing up and go slow.  Condoms on the dildo if you plan to both be using it.Dick on dick sex!  For ya'll, penetration probably isnt the best first move.  Anal is very tedious and requires a lot of prep.  Focus instead on handjobs, grinding, blowjobs (stick it in your cheek if you feel yourself gagging) and the like.  If you can get a small vibrator, placing a vibe on the base of the penis while getting a blowjob is damn near heaven.  Don't neglect the nipples!   Biggest tip though (heheheheh), talk it out.  I always have better sex experiences when I talk about what I want and don't want with my partner.  Everyone's different and every partner is a new experience.TL:DRTalking is good.  Expect awkwardness.  Wear a condom.  Clip and file your nails.  So many wet slapping sounds.  Towels are your friend.  Have fun.", "link_id": "t3_eng8y5", "time": 1578832186}}

{"fcuq3gc": {"text": "A good rule of thumb with anything mental health related:If you consider getting therapy or seeing a doctor for how your brain is feeling, there's very likely something wrong and you'd be wise to get it checked out.  Just like if you have a cold vs a chronic cough.  Yeah, you could see a doc for a cold, but you just have that feeling it'll resolve on its own, right?  But a cough out of nowhere that just refuses to go away warrants a visit to the doctor.Treat your mental health similarly.  Or, if you're really not sure, ask a trusted friend what they think.  Like \"hey, have I been acting differently?/Do I seem a bit off?\" That helps me a lot.  I was diagnosed with bipolar a few months ago and asking for my loved ones input on things really helps me figure out what state i'm in and if I need to reach out to my docto  But yeah. Depression feels much less like a sad feeling and more like someone threw a 300lb blanket over your entire personality. Everything is muted and heavy, even your body.  Walking is hard, eating is hard, socializing is hard, thinking is hard...everything is hard.  It's all possible, it's just SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT when you're depressed.  It feels hopeless and exhausting just to make it through an average day.  I believe that whole notion is more what leads to depressed people feeling what most people would label \"sad\".  The \"sadness\" really is just pure exhaustion and losing hope things will ever feel normal again.  Or, that's what it feels like for me.

Just because OP didn't rape his friend doesn't make him an overall good person.  It makes him not a rapist.  So, perhaps what I'm more suggesting is we be more specific in our compliments.  Like in this situation, instead of saying \"you're a good person\", we could say \"hey, you did a great job taking care of your friend in a time of need and respecting her and her boyfriend's sober boundries.  Nice work!\"You catch my drift?  A person isn't automatically going to take a compliment like that and run with it. They feel good about that *specific* situation and how they acted in it.

{"e9ilej2": {"text": "Sure! But I must warn you, I losely follow this recipe.  Always go by feel and your knowledge of your oven and it's temp.I use this modified no-knead recipe.  (I explained the mods :)For the leaven, i started with 2 tablespoons of sourdough starter, 1/2 cup of water, and 1/2 cup of flour.  Mix well and let sit for at least 8 hours.  I usually do 12 hours.Then, mix the leaven with 2 &amp; 1/4 cups of lukewarm water.  Once reasonably mixed, stir (don't knead!!) in 5 to 5 &amp; 3/4 cups of flour.  I usually stick with 5 &amp; 1/2 cups and a sprinkle of extra flour.  However much gets you a good, shaggy dough.  Cover that with a wet paper towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 30-45minutes.Mix one tablespoon of salt into 1/4 cup of lukewarm water and set aside to dissolve.After the dough has sat, pour the dissolved salt into the dough and gently pinch it in to mix it.  Like you're giving the dough a tiny massage.  Next, begin the fold-and-stretch.  Pick up one side of the dough and fold it over itself.  Turn the bowl and repeat 4x.  Re-cover and let sit for 30 minutes.  Do this a total of 6 times over the course of 2 &amp; 1/2 hours.Once you've finished the stretch and fold, let the dough rise undisturbed for 1 hr.Once it's done, flour a flat surface well and gently turn over the dough onto the floured surface.  Use a floured pastry knife and quickly cut the dough in half.  Shape the dough into rounds by quickly turning the dough with your hands.  It's hard to explain, but imagine you're rubbing the sides of the dough and turning it at the same time.  Don't over-handle it though.  If the dough gets warm from you touching it, you've gone too far!Let the rounds rest for 30 minutes.  While they are resting, prepare 2 proofing baskets.  Begin shaping the loaves by GENTLY folding each side over itself and making a ball.  Pinch and twist the ends together and put the seam-side down into the flour in the proofing baskets.  Cover and either transfer it to the fridge overnight to proof or let sit in the oven (with the oven off) for 2 hours.Next, take out your loaves and turn them over into a well-oiled baking pan.Heat the oven to 500 degrees F.Score the loaves in an \"x\" pattern (or however you like) and slide them into the oven when it's heated.  Leave in there for 10-15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 450 F.  DONT OPEN THE OVEN!!  It's tempting, but this is a surefire way to ruin oven spring.Bake at 450 for another 10-15 minutes, then carefully remove the dish of water from the oven.  Bake one last 10-15 minutes at 450 and you're done!  Allow the loaves to cool COMPLETELY before slicing. They might be done oven cooking, but they're not done baking inside yet.I hope that works for you!", "link_id": "t3_9w82e4", "time": 1541976553}}

We adapted and got a good swing of things, but ownership (before making lost money back) decided to do ANOTHER massive impulse buy of a brand new wild goose canner.  We were in the hole deep and cans don't make profit like we need them to.  Now they decided that the reason why they aren't making money back is because we are lazy brewers.

{"e038aag": {"text": "Sure!  I use a slightly modified no-knead technique.For the leaven, i started with 2 tablespoons of sourdough starter, 1/3 cup of water, and 1/2 cup of flour.  Mix well and let sit for at least 8 hours.  I usually do 12 hours.Then, mix the leaven with 2 &amp; 1/4 cups of lukewarm water.  Once reasonably mixed, stir (don't knead!!) in 5 to 5 &amp; 1/2 cups of flour.  I usually stick with 5 cups and a sprinkle of extra flour.  However much gets you a good, shaggy dough.  Cover that with a wet paper towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 30-45minutes.Mix one tablespoon of salt into 1/4 cup of lukewarm water and set aside to dissolve.After the dough has sat, pour the dissolved salt into the dough and gently pinch it in to mix it.  Like you're giving the dough a tiny massage.  Next, begin the fold-and-stretch.  Pick up one side of the dough and fold it over itself.  Turn the bowl and repeat 4x.  Re-cover and let sit for 30 minutes.  Do this a total of 6 times over the course of 2 &amp; 1/2 hours.Once you've finished the stretch and fold, let the dough rise undisturbed for 30 minutes.Once it's done, flour a flat surface well and gently turn over the dough onto the floured surface.  Use a floured pastry knife or a floured pizza cutter and quickly cut the dough in half.  Shape the dough into rounds by quickly turning the dough with your hands.  It's hard to explain, but imagine you're rubbing the sides of the dough and turning it at the same time.  Don't over-handle it though.  If the dough gets warm from you touching it, you've gone too far!Let the rounds rest for 20 minutes.  While they are resting, prepare proofing baskets.  I use a regular bowl coated in flour.Begin shaping the loaves by GENTLY folding each side over itself and making a ball.  Pinch and twist the ends together and put the seam-side down into the flour in the proofing baskets.  Cover with a wet towel and either transfer it to the fridge for 2 hours to proof or let sit in the oven (with the oven off) for an hour and a half.Next, take out your loaves and turn them over into a well-oiled baking pan.Heat the oven to 500 degrees F and put a small oven-proof dish of water in there.  This'll build steam which is great for making a good crust.Score the loaves in an \"x\" pattern and slide them into the oven when it's heated.  Leave in there for 10-15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 450 F.  DONT OPEN THE OVEN!!  It's tempting, but this is a surefire way to ruin oven spring.Bake at 450 for another 10-15 minutes, then carefully remove the dish of water from the oven.  Bake one last 10-15 minutes at 450 and you're done!  Allow the loaves to cool COMPLETELY before slicing. They might be done oven cooking, but they're not done baking inside yet.I hope that works for you!", "link_id": "t3_8ocnvq", "time": 1528117021}}

I know it sounds silly, but try it.  Imagine the most hilarious thing you've ever seen/heard and try laughing in the mirror. It helps you learn what your own natural smile looks like.  Next, when someone is taking your picture, don't look directly at the lens. Look right above it.  It helps align your neck and make your eye gaze more comfortable to the viewer. No one likes someone looking straight into their eyes in a picture.  As for how your smile looks after you get a feel for your natural smile, sometimes people just don't have \"natural-looking\" smiles. It just doesnt always happen. So maybe your look for photos is a more subtle smile. Almost like you saw something mildly funny and just kinda chuckled at it. Again, practice in the mirror!

I had CT scans, ultrasounds, and Pap smears alike. Nothing came up abnormal.I finally saw my current gyno who took my situation very seriously and scheduled a lap for me almost right away.

{"ctj3o7l": {"text": "I thought the same thing until I put a different goal to mind while working out.I used to work out because I wanted to lose weight, but I'd get so disappointed when I didn't see results.  It killed any joy in working out.I came to the conclusion that the reason why most people feel that rush is because they feel like they accomplished something.  Also brain chemicals and such, but those are kind of stifled in those of us with anxiety and depression disorders.Instead of just swimming laps, why not set a goal for each workout?  Your goal could be anything positive.  Maybe set a goal to do a set number of laps, then reward yourself with a positive self talk.  Something along the lines of \"Yeah!  I kicked that workout's ass!  I did a great job!\"Yeah yeah, I know it sounds stupid.  But pretending to be happy about something is *far* better than just not being happy at all.I do yoga and running, but instead of just doing it to do it (like I used to), I set my running goal to being able to run a 5k without stopping.I use yoga differently, though.  I practice yoga with the intention of focusing intently on how my body feels.  It's really helped me to pay attention to where I store my emotions and reminds me to let go of certain things.I hope you can find joy in your workouts and in turn, find some relief.
