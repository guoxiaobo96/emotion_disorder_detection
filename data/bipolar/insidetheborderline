{"fmflhlr": {"text": "To me, this sounds like a mixed episode. I feel similar to the way you're feeling now when I'm in one of those episodes. &amp;#x200B;I can tell what kind of state I'm in most of the time. I can tell when I'm experiencing euthymia because that's obvious, and I can tell when I'm about to get depressed well. It becomes harder than usual to get out of bed, I'm grumpy, and the world feels a bit darker than usual. Typical low-energy and lack of motivation are present as well. When I'm properly depressed, I get irritable and I don't want to do anything. I just want to lay in bed and be on my phone or watching Netflix. I only have the desire to talk to one person if that  (my best friend) and not even other friends I'm really close to, really. I'll smoke a lot of fucking weed (I smoke a lot anyway, but I take it to a higher level when I'm depressed) and/or drink a lot of wine so I feel less of what I'm feeling. So when I'm like that, I know for sure I'm depressed. Being in a mixed episode feels like what a lot of depression feels like, except I'll have manic symptoms thrown in. I'll feel incredibly irritable and I have no motivation do anything, but I want to *do something* sooo badly. I feel like crawling out of my own skin. My thoughts will be racing, and I'm horny as fuck and will fuck away my feelings. It's pretty easy for me to tell when I'm mixed. However, it can be really hard for me to tell that I'm manic sometimes. I talk louder, faster, and have more enthusiasm in my voice, and I tend to miss those things even though they're often pointed out to me. I'm promiscuous and reckless. But I feel great the whole time, so most of the time I just think I'm happy for once. Sometimes it clicks and I'm like, \"fuck yeah, I'm manic as hell,\" but other times I can only realize I was manic in hindsight.", "link_id": "t3_fuyoiw", "time": 1586029745}}

I'm perfectly content with that. I'm okay with the hands I've been dealt. They're far less than stellar - I've got bipolar, OCD, a shitty childhood under my belt, all that other silly bullshit - but the good outweighs the bad. I have the most wonderful best friend who has been supportive through everything that's happened to me or that I've done. I love her too much, and I know she loves me. I couldn't just leave her - and I would never want to. It would devastate her to suddenly lose me, so how could I hurt someone I love so much? I couldn't. She's too much of a precious human being. All of my other closest friends are great as well, and I wouldn't want to abandon me. As a person who experiences extreme highs and extreme lows, I'm decently acclimated to the fact that life is a shit storm sometimes. I'm okay with that. It makes things interesting, I suppose.
