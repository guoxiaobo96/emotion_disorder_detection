However, rape has been extensively researched and there is a lot of evidence out there to support my statement. The topic is very dear to my heart as I myself was raped and I do my best to combat misconceptions on the topic. I'm sorry if I came across as combative or snide, I really just want people to know the truth. I pulled that from my text book \"Serial Murderers and Their Victims\" by Eric Hickey, 6th edition. In the chapter on sexual predators and deviants (and as you will find in any book, scientific research article, etc. that discusses the matter), there are several theories that discuss the causes behind rape. Just for reference, this does mainly apply to men since there is less information on female rapists as until recently people did not believe this was possible. This is also limited to stranger rape and rape in domestic violence situations. Date rape is different since it usually stems from serious miscommunication between the two parties.There are 4 major types of rapists as recognized by the FBI, all U.S. law enforcement, and most other western law enforcement agencies.   Displaced Aggression Rapist: violent with little to no display of sexual  feeling. Rape is a vehicle to injure, humiliate and degrade females.  Compensatory Rapist: aka power reassurance; tend to be shy and see the victim as being willing as he fantasizes that the rape is a 'date'.  Sexually Aggressive Rapist: sadistic; holds fundamental belief that women what to be dominated, controlled, sexually assaulted, and raped. Arousal stems from mixing violence and pain with raping women.   Impulsive Rapist: Secondary crime committed during burglaries, etc. Lacks violence and sexual motives, simply sees rape as an opportunity. These are all based on the Groth Typologies of Serial Rapists which are power reassurance, power assertive, anger retaliatory, and anger excitation. Also, as far as eunics are concerned, I am not familiar with any research on that, however it has been shown that men who are chemically or physically castrated as part of their sentencing for a previous crime still have sexual desires and fantasies. They will often use objects as a surrogate penis to rape their victims. ", "link_id": "t3_1a1auj", "time": 1363035437}}

Because of this view, it is often assumed that women who dress and behave a certain way are 'asking for it' because they are seen as 'whores'.No, not all men are rapists. They don't need to be 'taught not to rape', however everyone needs to learn to blame the rapist, not the victim. The unfortunate truth is that majority of the statistics on rapists show that they tend to be men, hence the sentiment that men need to be taught.
