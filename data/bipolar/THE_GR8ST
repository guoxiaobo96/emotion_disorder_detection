I just finished an associates degree and transferred to a 4 year school to finish an undergraduate degree in IT. I have been taking classes part time, and probably have 3 years until I finish.For me the deciding factor is that I need money. Money to pay for college, health care, and other expenses. I would need to work anyway to cover things like gas, food, and tuition. So, I decided that finishing a degree slowly and paying it all off is better than being very poo debt or not having a degree at all. If I didn't have to worry about these costs, then I would focus on completing the degree and doing internships instead of a FT job.I like working in IT, and I enjoy my job. So, because it's something I like doing anyways, I am willing to spend my time doing it at the cost of taking longer to finish a degree. A degree is mostly just paper on it's own.

I was able to negotiate up to $22/hr, simply by asking, which I asked for because it was a contract to hire offer and there were no benefits.

{"fc2l65s": {"text": "I assume you are talking about A+, Net+, Sec+. These three are entry level certifications.So, you'd possibly be looking at entry level IT positions, which is pretty much help desk and other basic support positions.How much school do you have left? Is this a BS or Associates degree? Are you already working full-time? If so, is it outside of IT, or an IT job? So, from my experience, just working FT and going to school FT is a challenge, there's not much free time for anything else. So, I am not sure how you would effectively study for certifications on top of that. As far as being a dad, I don't have any experience. But, I'd imagine it would take a good amount of time and attention and be nearly impossible to do everything you mentioned effectively with being a father added to it. I'd suggest doing school PT if you find a FT job in IT, or if you find you need more time for your family while working and going to school.So here's what I see practically working for you...- Earn at least one CompTIA certification while going to school (PT if working FT or FT school if not working)- Look fo a job doing IT support while continuing school/earn more certs- Stop studying entry level certs when you find a job and focus on gaining experience while finishing your degree ASAP.- Aim for higher level IT positions while working by researching job market/gaining skills/completing higher level IT certs such as CCNA or MCSA or security certs. You could also try to move up within your company at the support job you find.- By the time you graduate you should be qualified/applying for or already be in a higher paying IT role, other than support using your skills/knowledge/college career resources.Your three entry level certs and degree will not set you up for jobs other than entry level, to move up you will need to show experience/higher level IT skills. You can gain skills/knowledge from job experience, college related activities, and home labs/self-study.So, to sum it up if you accomplish the things you mentioned you can expect an entry level IT role and to move up after gaining skills/experience to other IT roles.These are just my thoughts based on my experience. I am still working on finishing a BS degree, and recently finished an Associates degree. I work FT and take classes PT. My goal is to learn more about IT through school, working and studying on my own. By the time I finish a BS degree for IT I hope to work in networking, as a sysadmin or in IT security.Your post wasn't very detailed, I had to infer some things. Let me know if I misunderstood anything and any other thoughts you have. Good luck with your career goals!", "link_id": "t3_efustl", "time": 1577365620}}

I just recieved a notice from a nearby university that I have been accepted to attend the university for an IT Bachelors degree starting in January.Also, I already work in IT making decent money (56k/yr). So tell your parents they are stupid, and to suck it. Did they even go to college themselves? Where are they getting their information from?Here's my advice. if you have money to pay to go straight to a 4 year school, do it. DO NOT go there and take a bunch of loans to pay for it. If you can't pay for it yourself, or don't get accepted to any 4 year schools then go to community college and transfer to the university you want later.

See if they have a site near you and apply to join them. Otherwise if you want to get into working IT I suggest making your goal to find an internship, it may take you a while. Eventually when you complete one finding another internship or a job will be easy. Keep working on the certifications too. Keep going to college unless you find something better to do.Try to see if there's a technology club or group at your college.

Six weeks is a short time to become good at something, you're not usually expected to be great at their job within this time frame.Additionally, hanging up on a customer and walking out for the day just because your anxious supports you having lack of character. It's either that, or you need to seek mental health professionals for anxiety.Why did you not seek help from a supervisor, was there not a workflow for you at your job to escalate or find someone to help?If the problem was that there wasn't proper procedure, then that is an issue with the company you were at. If there was procedure and you didn't try to follow it, then that's a problem with you.You will have to overcome any problems you have, stop giving up, and follow procedure if that's the root cause.If the issue was managment/bad procedure, then apply for any entry level IT positions and you should succeed, right? Even if it's another call center you should be fine.If you have a problem with call centers, you can look for desktop or field support positions. Though beggars can't be choosers.

They might offer more or less benifits. You wont know until you recieve the offer at which point you can negotiate.As the end of your contract approaches, I suggest you do some job hunting in case you don't like the offer you recieve.
