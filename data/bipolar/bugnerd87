Same here re: abusive relationships (until my husband). Really, what I wanted was to be single and go to a sperm bank. I didn't want a husband and I never wanted to get married. But SSRIs and mood stabilizers, plus my logical brain staying turned on and saying \"you don't really want to do this\" and my husband all together saved my life. And now that my son is 18 months old I still struggle (even more with quarantine and what not going on) but my son is there absolute coolest person I have ever met in my life. He is so smart and funny and thoughtful. He has emotional maturity beyond the years of some of the professionals I work with. So yes, the idea that an internet stranger is telling me I shouldn't have him bc I have mental illness upset me quite a bit. I'm sorry I lashed out - and I'm sorry to hear about your friend. That's awful. This boy really does mean the world to me. And yes, he likely has a somewhat different, if not difficult, road ahead due to the combo of mine and my husband's mental illnesses (both ADHD, me Bipolar I and him OCD) but really I think us having those makes us more in tune to the struggles he may have. We are very much aware of the effect it has on our lives and are very cognizant of what we do and say in front of him to minimize any environmental input to triggering those illnesses. It's always a balancing act. I also ate sushi, had a couple glasses of wine etc while I was pregnant. I hated being viewed as an extension of my baby. And while I love him beyond measure, my happiness and my life matter, too.

Though it is not entirely rare for a student to not do well (although that is also very subjective) and be very bright. I went through my entire education with untreated ADHD. I still did well by most standards but there were a lot of times I missed things or got a lower grade than what was representative of my understanding of the material. In smaller class sizes, I would hope most professors would see that and respond to it. In classes of 100 though it is hard to know on a person by person basis how well the grades reflect the student.

The characteristic that sets then apart is their truncated fore wings (the shell part that we think of in most beetles). That lack of fore wings makes them easily confusable (is that a word?) with a lot of stuff. There are Rove beetles small enough to live on flower heads and then there are some who measure a couple inches long. They're pretty cool! As for springtails, people may think they're pests because they can be associated with sick plants but they are likely only abundant enough to be noticed because the garden in question is too wet.

{"etjn6fx": {"text": "He has definitely started wanting to be held pretty much all the time and crying as soon as you set him down. We do talk to him but it doesn't seem to calm him much. We used to rock him to sleep but then started cuddling instead as he wasn't a big fan of being rocked. We were bed sharing and recently took the side off his crib and brought it up to the bedside so he could start to associate his crib with sleep. We started bed sharing because he wouldn't sleep any other way and, when I went back to work, I couldn't handle the lack of sleep. If my hand is laying on his chest he'll sleep through the night (or was sleeping I guess). We go back and forth on sleep training. We have tried several times to let him wind down on his own and get drowsy but he gets MORE active. He will not stop unless we stop him. And we tried ferber one night and it resulted in me bawling my eyes out in the hallway and my husband and I getting in a fight. Our parenting style lines up with attachment parenting and the theory goes that, when he's ready, he'll want to sleep independently. But then I hear horror stories of parents unable to put their kid to sleep at 6 years old. Ugh. I've definitely learned the lesson that there is no such thing as \"right\". There's only \"what's right at the time\" and inevitably it will lead to something else later on. Thanks for your comment.

She makes everything anyone says into something about her. When I told her we were pregnant she was upset that I hadn't told her we were trying. Some people are just insecure and narcissistic. That doesn't make you an asshole or overly sensitive. And now you're at a point where you see this and have the option to take responsibility for yourself and your feelings. If this is who your dad is, then it sounds like it's time to let go of what you expect or want him to be. It also sounds like you need someone who will give you what you need. I basically quit telling my parents anything about my career because they don't get it. That's not their fault. They're both HS grads and have zero knowledge of college, going through grad school, or what being a prof is like. So I tell them what they ask, I call them out when they say something stupid (like your example) and I updated my list of people to talk to to include people who get my experience.

He needed to do some measurements and asked if he could measure the ones I had collected before I needed them. I said okay but you have to let me know literally the moment you're done because if you leave them too long and they die that ruins my project. I don't hear from him for several days. I go into the lab, open up the sample fridge and there is a box, full of dead adults. I asked him what happened. He said he measured them several days ago. He never told me he had them nor that he was done with them. Over 75% were dead. I was fucking livid. That was the only time I ever yelled in that lab. My lab manager said he was actually scared because he had known me for years and had never seen me that mad before. Somehow this translated to the idiot that I had been mean to him and he then told the rest of the students in my dept that I had screamed at him for no reason. People became very nasty to me for a few months until, one by one, he started doing the same to them. It took close to a year but eventually people were coming to me apologizing because they didn't realize that he was just being a dick.A less juicy story was when our advisor suggested he change subjects because he was seriously too stupid to work on my project (he didn't word it like that of course). So he starts talking to another student about using their lab for some molecular stuff. The project he is talking about is like post doc level complicated and this kid doesn't know the first thing about how to do any of it. So he's asking for help from this other student and I hear and see the other student say that he just doesn't have the time to help in the way that's needed for this level of project and suggest he find another aspect to work on. Later, during a lab meeting, I hear and see the idiot tell our advisor that the other student said it was a great idea and has agreed to help him however was needed. I had to jump in and say \"uhhh that's literally the complete opposite of what he said\".

I have published in journals ran by publishers that are or have been on that list. And having a problem with OA doesn't mean anything regarding traditional publishing. You can be fed up with the likes of Elsevier and also be critical of OA while publishing in both. You're speaking in logical fallacies.I will say that MDPI is one of the ones that bombards me with requests to publish in journals that are not even close to relevant to me. If a publisher is begging me to submit something - that's a red flag. There are plenty of reputable OA journals and publishers that don't do that. In general, publishers do not contact you for a manuscript unless you're a pretty big name in your field or if there's a special issue or something. And, in those cases, you'd likely already be familiar with the journals in question. In the case of being asked to review, others in OPs respective field would have heard of this journal before if it was reputable.", "link_id": "t3_a0v7qm", "time": 1543367411}}

I'm sure I'll get flack for this view but it is not romantic or a sign of love to sacrifice your own health and well being for the sake of someone else.

I thought my FIL was spending time with my husband to have some father son type talks. I know hubby wanted that and not only did he not get it, but what he got instead was complete bs. His own dad trying to buy influence into the healthcare decisions of our baby.I was going to just let it go but that crosses so many lines I can't keep quiet. I haven't drafted my email yet but he will be hearing from me. I cannot believe he thought he could buy our child's health. He took moments that could have been lovely and turned them shitty when explicit, proper boundaries were set in a very healthy manner. Anyway, just wanted to update you since you are all too familiar with this kind of behavior. As a side note, birth SUCKED. He was almost an emergency c section bc he's so big and was turned sideways but my doc is old school so he got him out with forceps (after more than an hour of pushing and two failed vacuum attempts). I'm glad I avoided a c section but holy crap. It feels like my pelvic floor was run over by a tank \ud83d\ude2cThanks again for all your insight and help.", "link_id": "t3_9paitn", "time": 1540428610}}

For me it was a god send because I have endometriosis so the pill literally ruined my life. I was not a person for a week a month. I had dozens of cysts on my ovaries and polyps in my uterus. Sex was painful. I had breakthrough bleeding all the time. I would become so emotionally labile that I would become suicidal on the regular. And my story is not a weird one. It's actually pretty damn common.I think there is a lot more bullshit in the medical community that isn't even being acknowledged that makes birth control a really touchy subject for women. Women are simply not listened to by doctors. They are not given fair treatment. Their pain is not taken seriously. So people are acting like female birth control is practically side effect free and that's just not true. Women put up with a lot of BS from birth control because we know nobody will give a shit if we say anything. It took me almost 2 decades to finally be diagnosed with endometriosis and the only reason anyone finally cared was because I couldn't get pregnant. Only then, in my 30s did a single doctor agree that something was wrong (that wasn't my fault) and did the surgery I needed.Shit we're JUST NOW learning that pain pathways for women are simply different than men. There are no answers for women so when a trial is cut short because of, what we perceive to be pretty standard side effects, yeah a lot of women are gonna get really pissed off because nobody gives two fucks when women can't function and their concerns are blown off by doc after doc for years and years.

My PhD dept had an option to do the traditional 5 tests, one per committee member, or you could write a grant instead. I chose to write a grant because that's a skill I need to be judged on by experts. Most committee members were fine with it but a couple of the old guys had the \"I had to do the 5 hardcore tests so you should, too\" mindset. In that instance, I think it's dumb.

There is something to be said about having standards and sticking to them and whether they're stupid or necessary is a matter of opinion. I, personally, am an avid supporter of the oxford comma. Others are the complete opposite. But if I'm submitting something to a journal that refuses to print the oxford comma - I guess I'm taking out all my oxford commas.

Regardless, a simple google search would show you that there are plenty of studies that put false rape accusations between 2-10%, well within the range of any other false crime reporting. And the people who tend to do these false reports are typically suffering from a mental illness - not Ph.D. carrying, tenured professors, with everything to lose. Just about every woman in your life has at least one story similar to the one being testified today. The ignorance of you, and everyone else in this thread, to that fact that is well known by other women, just means you are not listening. Or you are but you're listening with the defensiveness that you are, in fact, being accused simply because you're also a white guy and so you identify with other white guys and feel the need to protect your own tribe.

The best you can do is pay attention to not leaving food crumbs out and, if you have pets, cleaning up their food (cockroaches LOVE cat food). I have seen cockroaches at the last 4 places I've lived due to neighbors and it's just a thing that happens sometimes. If you want you can send me a pic and I'll tell you what kind they are which may help. A lot of the times people see roaches that're outdoor species who are just accidentally inside. Edit: I've seen some people saying peppermint. Peppermint is not good to use around infants and won't do anything to control the cockroaches. I would NOT recommend using peppermint.

Those women can now have c sections which are typically very successful. I don't, however, think this is any different than coming up with vaccines or antibiotics.

You can't have it both ways. You can't expect me to act like a neurotypical person or a person on meds when I'm not.

{"dxgauv5": {"text": "Yeah not you. Others have been and it's been a shitty way to start my morning. Perennial crops are crops that can be harvested a lot before dying or being rotated. A good example is alfalfa which is mostly used in food animal production. That's in contrast to annual crops like tomatoes that have to be planted every year. Humans don't tend to eat perennial crops, most of that goes to feeding livestock. Perennial crops, based on the fact that they're so long lived, have deeper roots, hold on to soil moisture better, take up nutrients more efficiently etc. Because they're so much better able at utilizing land that doesn't have good drainage or great nutrient load, that land often can't be used for annual crops. Annual crops require a lot more water and nutrients. Vegan diets consist pretty much entirely of annual crops so we can't use a lot of arable land for their production. So that's why it's said that vegan diets waste land because it can't really be used for much else. Hope that helps.

My doc said that symptoms are not necessarily related to the severity or amount of endo found during surgery and that it's probably an immune disorder. So there are a lot of other things working behind the scenes in addition to the endo masses themselves. That said, my doc found a mass on my fallopian tube, a mass in my cul de sac (I think that's the most common place to find it) and many small spots on my uterus. It was actually a relief to hear that he had found it during surgery. And my symptoms cleared up instantly. It's easier said than done but don't feel bad for your feelings. They're valid.

{"dvvn8z0": {"text": "I received three offers before finishing my PhD, a post doc, state government, and faculty at an R1. I was disenchanted with R1 bc of my grad school experiences and decided to take my chances on government. After a year I decided that I really am meant for academia and decided to go back on the market. I have received two TT offers this time around, one at a teaching institution and another at an R1. I'm accepting the R1 this time. I think what made the biggest difference was I treated grad school like a career and not like school. I didn't act like a student. My advisor told me very early on that I was a colleague. So I did things colleagues did. I organized symposia. I submitted to speak not only in student competitions. I taught every chance I could get. I got involved in scientific societies. I treated my whole MS and PhD like I was already in my career. People routinely thought I was a post doc or faculty when I was still a student. Because I had WAY more experience speaking in front of people, teaching, developing grant ideas etc. And faculty want to hire faculty, not a student. I also made sure to have my dissertation published, or in review, before my defense. I know that's not always possible for everyone but I worked my fucking ass off to get those papers out. Ultimately I was simply more prepared to be a faculty member. A lot of that I owe to my advisor and I hope to be a similar type of mentor for my students. He gave me the space and the opportunity to be very independent and form my academic self worth. A lot of advisors do not encourage their students to get those experiences. I'd be lying if I didn't say some of it is my personality. This position I'm accepting, I beat out a guy who has been an associate professor (non TT) at an R1 for years. He has loads more publications than me. Millions of dollars in grant money more than me. But he is A DUD in the personality dept. I did my homework and saw that this dept is young and very diverse. They look like shit stirrers. I'm a shit stirrer myself but I made sure to highlight that. I didn't really talk about my pubs or my grants. I talked about how my research stirs things up and challenges the status quo. Really you have to speak as someone that people want to work with. As a contrasting example, there is a woman who got her PhD in my lab several years ago when I was just starting my master's. She has done multiple post docs. She has been PI or co PI on several large sum grants. She has worked with brilliant people who are well known in our field and she's taught many classes. She's also very unhappy with herself and it shows in many ways. She's caddy. She's soft spoken and cannot project even the slightest bit of confidence. She has gotten a couple interviews but that's it. On paper she's an amazing candidate. But nobody wants to work with her. She's finally settled into a government position and given up on the faculty dream. And, guess what, she plays the victim card all the time. She writes these blog posts about how forgotten she felt as a post doc and how academia has failed her and so many others. Why would anyone want that type of person in a dept for 30 years?

If you don't get an offer but still want them to know them I would identify the person or people on the committee who you felt good about and tell them. And maybe still tell the dean? That kind of behavior should be unacceptable and if it's keeping good candidates from coming there, they'd want to know.

I'm a product of a fairly neglectful childhood with a deeply Catholic mother and an alcoholic father and all the fun dysfunction that comes along with that.

Nothing I did ever got any attention from my parents as they were too wrapped up in their own shit.

I switched majors constantly in undergrad and felt like I liked everything but never was the best at anything.

{"du79ko9": {"text": "Awesome question. Women face a lot of challenges in academia (especially STEM fields) that men don't based on their recent astronomical rise in higher education. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that men apply for jobs and awards when they might not meet all the standards while women tend to apply only when they meet/exceed standards: https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualifiedModern society tends to place higher standards on women than they do on men in terms of succeeding. Women are often expected to do more emotional labor than men (which is almost never compensated or even acknowledged). They're expected to perform as wives and mothers and people often assume that being a wife and mother means you can't do other things well. For example, my predecessor (also a woman) was told during grad school by her advisor that she should break up with her boyfriend because she wouldn't be able to focus on being a \"woman scientist\". He didn't catch on when she asked him if he was married, to which he replied 'yes'. The standards for the way girls and women behave and perform are higher throughout life and we're often told in a lot of ways that we're inherently not good enough. Girls also tend to downplay their abilities in STEM because they're given signals from a very early age that math is for boys. Add up decades of these messages and it makes a lot of sense why women would feel imposter syndrome more than men. Depending on what sources you read, some claim there are no gender differences. So it's possible that the feelings are similar across genders but women may be more likely to act on those feelings vs men.

But not matter what I do there is this one part that never goes away. I still throw tantrums and dissolve into a ball of reaction and emotions. Screaming, stomping, cussing etc. I have associated this with ADHD but not in this way. I thought these outbursts were the type of ADHD rage that comes with something not working the way you want it to. They're always directed towards my husband and typically it's when I have been waiting all day to see him and then he wants to take a nap, or play video games, or do anything that is not hanging out with me. I always thought that was me pushing to get something I want and the frustration of not getting it. But this makes so much more sense. It really is a feeling of rejection and the insta-rage as I call it, is unstoppable. As it's happening I am telling myself \"you're going to regret this later\" but I just can't stop. It's like someone pushed the nuclear button in my torso and I have to get this insane amount of energy out somehow.I also relate to the social phobia part. I go in back doors at work to avoid small talk with people in the morning. If I see people I know in the grocery store I turn and walk away so I don't have to talk to them. Not because I don't like these people. I just hate small talk. I'm not good at it. I never have anything normal to say about weekends or sports or whatever.

{"dtb4uir": {"text": "I hope this doesn't come across as mean but rather as constructive criticism from someone who has been there. A good rule of thumb is that whenever you are pointing fingers at other people who are making your life bad in some way, usually that finger should be pointing back at yourself. Except for some obvious scenarios like abuse, you are the one who creates the environment you exist in. Another good rule of thumb is that when everyone else is an asshole, you're probably the asshole. Unfortunately I have seen this in myself many times. My interpretation of your post and comment is that you have some deep insecurity issues, with what I don't know, but it manifests in some pretty typical ways. You clearly have a very low opinion of these women and I absolutely guarantee you that they see that and respond to you accordingly. Your avoidance of stressful situations probably ends up being total isolation or hanging out only with the men and they see that, too. Your post gives me the impression that you have some pretty deeply internalized misogyny. And anyone who says \"I hate drama\" or any iteration of that is typically the one bringing drama in their own life. I can tell you with certainty that if you didn't play into drama you wouldn't be aware of it. You negatively judge and find fault in others as a way to make yourself feel better and avoid seeing faults in yourself. This is pretty classic projection. At your age I was the type of girl who said things like \"I only have guy friends because girls are too dramatic\". I also worked hard to find faults in others and make myself a victim in any scenario. For me it was zero sense of self and a complete lack of self worth. I can tell you one thing though, since i quit focusing on how terrible others were and started getting really honest with myself, people like me more. I literally never have drama in my life.  It hurt. It sucked. I had to own up to a lot of stuff that left me feeling empty and depressed and angry. You cannot change anyone else and you cannot change how people perceive you.  You can only change yourself and your reaction to others. I highly suggest that you do some serious introspection to work on yourself and what lies beneath. My journey started with the book The Four Agreements and I think everyone on the planet should read it. I also think everyone on the planet should see a therapist at least periodically.  Good luck and I truly hope you can find some peace. Edit: another reason I formed this opinion of you is that it's clear what your post is really about.

Eventually I got mirena which was a god send. Took it out in February and got pregnant instantly. I mean instantly. Then I miscarried at 7 weeks. Finally found a decent OB who suggested endo. I've had crazy long painful periods since my miscarriage. I had the lap last month and holy crap. I've never really experienced a real cycle before. I've literally never felt regular period cramps. My period was about 80% lighter and I had ZERO pain. When I say zero I mean zero. Best decision ever regardless of where we go fertility wise. That said, he was very clear that the surgery only helps some women with fertility. I haven't tested my AMH yet. He said further tests will come in a few months if I'm still not pregnant. I also was lucky in that my endo was a few small spots on my uterus and a large mass in my cul de sac. So the excision was pretty simple according to him. That mass actually came back negative from pathology but he says he's certain it was endo (and my results suggest the same).Anyway, I don't know if I have any real advice. Everyone's journey is different. But I'm in your boat and here for support! PS sonohysterograms effing suck. They're what taught me that male OBs don't understand what \"light cramping\" means.
