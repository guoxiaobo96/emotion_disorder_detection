It\u2019s a very valid symptom of those disorders, but when projected into a child it\u2019s very damaging. And of course, my mom never got help and refused to believe that she needed it. So for example, my mom would always \u201csplit me black\u201d *whenever* I had a negative emotion or expression of that emotion or whenever I did anything at all that she didn\u2019t like for various reasons (because she saw it as a reflection of herself, or maybe even saw me as part of her and therefore couldn\u2019t accept it). This involved her freaking out on me, saying awful stuff, crying, blaming me, among other things. So now, whenever I experience any sadness, anger, jealousy, anything negative... I split myself black. I shut down and become angry at myself for having said emotion. It also doesn\u2019t help that feeling negative emotions gives me emotional flashbacks. It happens really fast. But I don\u2019t ever do this to other people. I\u2019m completely compassionate and accepting of others feelings. I just struggle to apply that to myself. I honestly think this is at least part of why I started self-harming, along with the severe depression I felt from the abuse. It was the only way to keep myself from expressing the negative, painful things outwardly, and thus the only way to keep myself emotionally calm enough to be \u201cacceptable\u201d in her presence. Especially with anger. Anger was absolutely not allowed. I am still struggling to dismantle the belief that my feelings are unacceptable. It\u2019s like... I do what she did to me, very unconsciously. I have to try to be very aware of myself when I get triggered, so that I don\u2019t do this but... It\u2019s super hard, and it\u2019ll be a long road.

I\u2019ve also attempted suicide but again, no one knew about it, and suicidal ideation is common in many disorders other than BPD. I\u2019ve been free of self-harm for 6 years now, and the thing that helped me stop was cutting contact with my mother. I often have to sit down with a therapist or my partner and go through the BPD symptoms and reaffirm that I don\u2019t have it. I\u2019ve had her assess me multiple times. The things that help remind me the most is that I don\u2019t have volatile/unstable relationships, and I don\u2019t make frantic efforts to avoid abandonment. I might be afraid of being left/rejected/and abandoned, I think many abuse victims are, but I talk about those fears and they don\u2019t dictate behavior.

She constantly loads off on me, ignores me, isn't able to be there for me at all or meet me in the middle. She also gets jealous of my accomplishments and was the exact same way when I moved in with my boyfriend, and then admitted she had feelings for me (I never even thought she might even though we're both bisexual, I just never felt that way for her). We have been friends for 8 years, but in 2017 we stopped talking for about a year, because she said some really hurtful stuff and I told her I wasn't able to be her friend at the moment (that's the short version). We became friends again because she came to me, and apologized, and it seemed like she had changed but two years later and she's kinda back to the same old stuff. I often feel like her therapist, too, all the time actually, and recently she provoked an argument with me while she was under the influence and I ended up telling her how I felt. She did everything she could to not really apologize, but she felt bad that I feel like her therapist. Since then we haven't been as close in terms of how much she shares with me and vice versa (although, I haven't been sharing that much with her for awhile because she always invalidates me or changes the subject to her really quickly). At this point, I'm accepting that we're just not meant to be as close as we used to be, and that's a good thing, because it wasn't healthy. I am realizing I can only meet her where she is able to meet me, and no further, because if I do go further, I'm exhausting myself.However verbally putting these boundaries into place is really hard.

{"ftcsgv0": {"text": "My (main) pwBPD is my mom (she also had NPD). According to her parents (my grandparents), her childhood was \"normal\" and \"happy.\" However because I know my family and I'm a lot more self-aware when it comes to our dysfunction than they are, I know this isn't true.My mom is the youngest, with two older brothers. When my mom was born, for the first few years of her life, my Grandpa's drinking was really bad. He'd be out at all hours of the night, wouldn't come home for days, got into some really bad situations... and my Grandma is codependent, so she put all of her energy into waiting for him, arguing with him, and all the of the drama that came along with his drinking. I think because of this, my mom and my Grandma didn't bond super well when she was a small baby. Also, my Grandma spanked all of her kids. She became a mom at 16, fresh out of foster care because her own mother (who I suspect also had BPD) gave all of her kids up to foster care at a young age. Both my grandparents had a LOT of unaddressed trauma, all of which was just swept under the rug.So there's my Grandpa's drinking, my Grandma's authoritarian parenting style/the spanking (she also did a lot of screaming... she had undiagnosed PTSD and would go into rages, and sometimes I wonder if she has NPD as well)... and then the sexual abuse, which happened at the hands of her oldest brother. My grandparents do not, and never have, acknowledged this. Because of all of this, my mom is kinda stuck as a teenager. She's almost 50. There's a lot more to the story, but that's the main stuff I feel contributed to her developing BPD.From what I know about BPD, there's a huge correlation to childhood trauma. There are many people who have it who didn't have a severe level of trauma necessarily, but more often than not, if you have BPD, you've had trauma. There's also a correlation with BPD and being abandoned by one or more parents, whether it's physical abandonment or a different kind (such as the death of a parent, neglect). However, not everyone that has had trauma will develop BPD! I have had significant trauma, thanks to my mother and many other things, but I do not have BPD. Just Complex PTSD, severe depression, and a crap load of anxiety. I have quite a few (ex) friends with BPD who have really similar stories... just a crap ton of trauma. One of my close friends now I suspect has BPD, and she also has a lot of trauma. One similarity with her and my mother... is her family refuses to acknowledge the trauma for what it is. My mom also refuses to acknowledge the trauma she put me through (which is why we no longer have a relationship), but luckily, some of my family members (step-mom, dad to an extent although he has his own issues) acknowledge it, and I think this is part of why I didn't develop BPD. I'm sufficiently messed up in my own way due to my complex PTSD (although doing better than I used to), but in very different ways from someone with BPD, such as someone like my mother.", "link_id": "t3_gyw84e", "time": 1591609594}}

I also grew up with other instances of sexual abuse, that no one ever knew about, and then was assaulted at 22 (sexually), and had other kinds of abuse coming at me from all angles until around age 23 as well. The mistrustful feeling is very, very difficult to cope with. I am in a stable, wonderful relationship with an amazing man, but the way that I sometimes don't trust him for no reason at all really bothers me. Also just feeling like I am not enough. And so much more. I often fear I will ruin the relationship completely.However he knows everything. I've told him everything. And if you ever feel able, it's something I do recommend to survivors.

People want to know exactly where you stand, but sometimes for Gemini, they stand in many places at once!

People become really uncomfortable when they can't pin someone down, when they can't anticipate their next move. As a Sag sun/Mercury/Mars/rising... I freaking love Gemini energy. I've definitely had overwhelmingly negative experiences with Gemini as well, but that's no reason for me to hate the sign as a whole.Another thing is, if someone has a negative experience with a certain sign they tend to start hating or not trusting that sign. But what they fail to realize is there's millions of people in the world with Gemini placements, and there's NO way all of those people are deserving of that hate.

When you go through narcissistic abuse (for me, my abusive mom has untreated NPD and BPD and she literally didn\u2019t see me as a separate entity from herself, I was just a mirro of herself), you don\u2019t always fully form your identity because you have to morph to be what your abuser wants or needs, in order to survive.

I think he needs way more therapy. I think with more therapy he will realize where he was wrong and he will understand with more depth what his therapist was trying to tell him. Sometimes healing can begin with a period of denial. But they both need therapy. And I think what they both said is low. As someone with a sister whom I have felt a similar (not even remotely the same but similar) dynamic with, it\u2019s hard to watch. So hard. What I think is interesting is that they are competing with each other. Kevin feels inferior to Randall, most likely always has. Even as Jack\u2019s birth son, he has never felt he measured up to what he \u201cshould\u2019ve been\u201d. Ever. Even when Jack was still alive! And we see that again and again, and he never forgave himself for not being there. And Randall feels superior (which comes from a place of being inferior), and like he has to compensate because he was adopted, and thus isn\u2019t maybe \u201cas good as\u201d Kevin in his mind for that reason, or feels he has to prove himself. Yet he never forgave himself and he WAS actually there! In reality it\u2019s just all grief, they\u2019re both unable to let go of the fact that they were or weren\u2019t there. I truly feel for both of them. My heart just broke this episode. Oh boy did I cry. In fact, I\u2019m still tearing up here and there reading comments.That being said Madison also made me cry.

We have so much fun together and are both very creative with many interests. It\u2019s quite interesting because he\u2019s an emotional projector and I am splenic. Together he gives me a throat, a solar plexus, and identity center &amp; I give him a spleen, an ajna, and a head.

When we first started dating I was quite afraid of my feelings. We often give each other advice and help each other come up with action plans. I think we both value what the other has to say and the way we think, so our advice is much appreciated. We work on being present and listening and not jumping to try to fix the other. We both have complicated relationship histories and a bit of trauma as well (more so me), so we work very hard on being aware of our triggers and our unhealthy patterns and working to function from a healthy place. We have honesty been having quite a tough one for the past year or so, not in our relationship, but in life in general. We\u2019ve had a death in the family, serious family drama and issues, severe health issues (mine), and money issues, but we always get through it and come out stronger.

It's so thoughtfully created, as is the world it exists in. It's so much more mature and refined. It's so mellow in a lot of ways despite a few intense moments on the album. The entire thing reminds me about how it feels to be in between, which Tyler even references.  That comes through so clearly for me and in my own personal life lately I've been feeling that a lot, stuck and in between and just going through it... and this album so intricately illustrates and performs my current experience, somehow. It's so beautiful. I can't wait to see some of these songs live in 39 days. My favorites so far, in order: 1) Leave The City2) Cut My Lip3) My Blood4) Bandito5) Chlorine 6) Pet CheetahI know that's like half the album. But yeah. Oh crap and Nico, still one of my FAVORITES. Ugh. I am so pleased and happy. I hear a lot of complaints about the sound being so different or more mellow or some of the song content. But it's a concept album for a reason. And I think it really encapsulates a small moment in time for Tyler. He even says he wants to stop time on the album. It's about being in between and slowing down and coming to terms with certain things. I think more screaming or faster sounds wouldn't really match what he was going for. Doesn't mean they won't do that again in the future. Also I had no idea that Paul Meany was so involved with it. Upon my first listen there were some songs that really reminded me of the TOPxMM collaboration, like Cut My Lip. I was spot on I guess! edit: I can't believe Truce and Leave The City end on the same note and they share a specific phrase \"Stay alive, for me\"\"For now, I will stay alive\"", "link_id": "t3_9kuasc", "time": 1538721148}}

Sex is incredibly difficult for me. I was actually able to have really amazing sex with my partner for... over 3 years. I was in therapy. I was healing. But then I hit a wall, mentally, with dissociation &amp; flashbacks. I've also been having some bad health issues. And since then sex has been very infrequent. I get anxious that it will negatively impact my relationship and that my partner will find satisfaction somewhere else. But he's extremely supportive and I know he never would. We often try to have physical closeness I'm comfortable with like massages, snuggles, anything else that I feel safe doing, just so we can have that physical connection in some way. I also recently did a stint with imaginal exposure therapy and it was SUPER helpful, but I was raw afterward emotionally and I'm still reorganizing myself. I could write more but don't want to tell you my life story lol. I'm sorry you're going through this. Unfortunately healing isn't linear, nor is it quick. It's grueling. Truly. It's an extremely painful and isolating thing, but as time goes by,  it begins to pay off in ways unique to each survivor. I've been working through my cPTSD for 4 years now.

However I do still have nightmares and sleep paralysis. Still have nights where I can't sleep. But it's better than before. And I think the farther I get from my trauma, the easier it will be to remind myself that I'm safe. Other helpful things: - coloring pictures on a coloring app until I fall asleep - making your bed as comfy and wonderful as possible, for you, so that you feel like you're on a cloud and it becomes a fun place rather than a scary place - putting on ocean or rain sounds - getting an arm rub from my partner (I realize some people might be triggered by massages, so obvi you don't have to do it if so, but I feel very safe with him and the massage helps relax my body and then my mind follows.

The first one I had fell out (it was pretty painless luckily), so I got another one put in and it stayed until I got it out last week. The reason I had it removed was because my body didn't seem to like it. It not only became embedded, but it caused me to have copper toxicity, which caused my anemia to become much much worse. I feel like all of that combined wreaked havoc on my already fragile immune system. I also have endometriosis and adenomyosis, and I only found out recently that copper IUD's tend to make those conditions worse (it did). I also suffer from ovarian cysts. So now, I'm not sure what to do. I'm considering trying Mirena since I never have before. I don't usually do well on hormones. I was on the pill, the shot, the ring--all horrible. Severe depression, weight gain, suicidal thoughts. And not just at first, but consistently. However I'm considering Mirena just because I've never tried it and my doctor said she'd take it out if I had any issues. But I'm unsure because of mood stuff and weight gain also (I have trouble losing too, and I've already gained a lot from other issues). The only other thing I'm considering is the \"mini pill\", which I have also never tried. I'm just on the fence because it is not as effective (not by much but still), and I am in no place to get pregnant right now :/ have you tried the mini pill before? I'm just curious. I'm so disappointed the copper IUD didn't work for me. I loved it so much. Sorry I'm rambling here. When you got yours in, did they offer you xanax or anything to have prescribed to take beforehand? If not I think you can ask. Taking that + Tylenol + Ibuprofen before my insertion made it a lot less painful. Technically the chances of an IUD becoming misplaced or embedded are *very* low. Something like 1-2% out of all cases? So we are probably quite unlucky. I think that's the same percentage for the paraguard and Mirena. Any IUD has that potential but like I said, it's rare. If you felt the paraguard worked well for you, maybe try it again? I know the insertion SUCKS but will it feel awesome having it back in knowing your protected? Especially because there are no hormones. And just ask your doctor if you can have like, regular ultra sound to check on the cyst AND the IUD's placement. that's what I did for awhile.

I also had many health problems (undiagnosed), and I still do. I also had exercise induced asthma (not anymore!). So all of that held me back a lot. I just felt I was just incapable of doing stuff. And the stuff I did try? It would make me sick. I have endometriosis and POTS, I think I've had them since I was about 12, so the hardcore cardio my mom tried to get me to do was too much for me. I would vomit or pass out. I never really knew there was any other way to exercise so I just thought I was screwed. The only exercise I did was walking. I'm lucky I did it so much because it definitely helped even when I was at my most unhealthy. I would walk miles and miles per day almost every day (I don't drive). But that's all I would do. I also struggled with eating disorders my whole life so my weight would yo yo. Which was obviously hard on my body. I would sometimes walk miles after not eating all day and then stupidly wonder why I felt so weak (DUH, kid... you're not eating!). Also, my mom was abusive... She would belittle me a lot and make fun of me for failing at exercise (and for other things but that's a different story). Also would ridicule my body, so I wanted so badly to be in better shape, but I felt I was incapable. So much so that it severely impacted my self-esteem and I eventually just gave up trying anything else at all and stuck to walking, sometimes swimming. I was never super overweight, maybe only by 30 pounds or so. But I was never, ever happy with my body and even that amount of extra weight has it's issues. When I discovered weight training, I was amazed. I never knew people did this. Especially women. I thought it was just in movies or athletes. I was awful at it at first. But after the first year it was clear how much I'd progressed. The fact that I could become stronger &amp; surpass my own progress weekly was amazing. It also helped me with my eating disorder problems because I had to learn how to eat so that my body had strength and energy to support me while lifting. It completely transformed my relationship with my body. It also helped ground me more. You have to be in your body to do this exercise, you can't be disconnected. I've been doing it for 3 years and I've never had a healthier relationship with food. It also gave me so much more confidence, and it gave me a butt (I was constantly teased as a kid for not having one, by my mom too). I had no idea it would do that. :P I was so clueless about lifting, it totally transformed me. It also helps a LOT with he anxiety issues I deal with. It's a great way to release stress, feelings, and anger. I'm currently on a break though, because of a severe tooth problem I've been having. But once I finally get surgery to get it fixed, I can't wait to get back to it. When I have to take breaks my mood plummets.

I know I've had this sort of realization before, but I always go back to thinking I'm feeling stuff when I'm really not, I'm just trying to resist it's impact. The thing is negative emotions trigger emotional flashbacks in themselves, so it takes me down such a crazy path, but I think it's true. More pain comes from resisting the negative emotions because you're fighting to run from them when really, if you let them run their course, they'll eventually pass. At least that's how I understand it. I can relate to the cycle of being numb &amp; dissociating. I've been so disconnected recently. I've found that things that involve using my body physically help to keep me at least a little more grounded help. Like singing, exercise (even if it's just a yoga video from YouTube in my living room cuz I'm too scared to go anywhere), going for walks, or playing music. Things I know how to do that I don't have to think to hard about but still keep my brain active and help my brain to work itself out of a \"frozen\" state.

My partner has been cheated on to but he's never cheated, especially not on me. We are very happy and in love. I never want to lose him, and I always worry that I might do something that would cause me to lose him somehow. I think maybe I fear losing control in general, too. Like completely losing control, someone or something else taking over. So maybe I'm afraid of losing control and doing something I regret, even if it's not something I think is morally ever do.
