I thought I could predict what people were going to say and I could  manipulate them because I thought I knew what they were thinking. I also, had all of the other symptoms of mania. I usually stayed awake two or three days at a time. The longer I stayed awake the more I got done and the more I thought I accomplished. On the final day of the manic episode, it inevitably all came crashing down. I had frightened and alienated my friends, family and girlfriend. I had about 30 started but unfinished projects and doubled my cc debt and depleted my savings. It all ended with me being committed to the mental hospital for the first time. Admittedly, I am currently hypo manic....but    Now I know when I need to seek help. It usually starts with delusional thoughts. Kinda like the ones you are describing now.  Even the length of your post and my comment should be evidence of mania/hypo mania. I think you might benefit from contacting a helpline or going to the hospital.

If I am being honest with myself; I am always looking forward to mania/hypo mania. I think it\u2019s pretty normal but you are correct. It is not healthy, it is self destructive. It\u2019s the same thought process that leads to not taking your medication and enduring crippling depression so that you can experience mania again. I have found that the only time I crave mania; is when I am manic or depressed. When I am medicated and stable, I realize how delusional it is to want mania. Listen to that part of you that  you  described as rational.  Doing what is good for yourself is difficult when you have bipolar.
