{"ftcxts6": {"text": "I'm also on lamictal, 100 mg. I take lexapro as well, 20 mg. For the ADD, I'm on adderall XR, 10 mg. I'm in college during the school year, so I take my adderall around 30 minutes before class starts on those days. I try not to take it after noon though, as the extended release can last anywhere from 6-10 hours and can mess with your sleep. I definitely feel the meds working the same day. From what I understand, they don't have to build up in your system like other medicines. It takes an hour or so for me to feel an effect. The first time I took the adderall was strange. My restlessness decreased, and I was actually able to accomplish the tasks I had been wanting to do. I had been trying to do the dishes for a few days. I wanted to do the dishes, but I just couldn't? It was like something was preventing me from being able to do them. A few hours after I took the meds, I was actually able to do the dishes. Also, before I was prescribed adderall, I had to kick my caffeine addiction. I would drink anywhere up to 3 cups of coffee worth of caffeine a day. I had to get down to less than a cup of coffee worth of caffeine a day.", "link_id": "t3_gypvws", "time": 1591614909}}

I would definitely say make sure you are on mood stabilizers that work well if you want to take meds for ADHD. In addition, I try to keep a consistent sleep/wake schedule, see a therapist every other week, and stay away from substances like alcohol. Eating meals around the same time of day every day helps too.", "link_id": "t3_gypvws", "time": 1591586389}}

{"fjad449": {"text": "I was on a combination of Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Abilify for what we though was generalized anxiety disorder and severe major depressive disorder. Started on only lexapro, then abilify was added, and then wellbutrin. The wellbutrin ended up making my anxiety much worse and didn't help with my depression. I switched to a new psychiatrist, got off wellbutrin (which helped my anxiety) and switched from abilify to lamictal (slowly). For me, lamictal worked better for my depression than wellbutrin, but I know that the effects of meds aren't the same for everyone. I'm hoping this helps you, though!", "link_id": "t3_fce9x1", "time": 1583171046}}
