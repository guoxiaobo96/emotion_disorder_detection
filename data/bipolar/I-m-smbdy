{"fowvkps": {"text": "The difference between a conventional oven and a convection oven is that the convection oven has a fan in it that circulates the heated air in the oven, leading to more evenly cooked product and lower baking times. A standard oven is built with heating elements on the top and bottom or just the bottom that produce hot spots and zones in the oven where the heat is not as evenly distributed and therefore might be much hotter or colder than the temperature it is set to. While a convection fan doesn't completely solve that issue, it reduces it by a very large amount.That being said, it is not always better to use the convection feature. A lasagna or a casserole would not see as much benefit with a convection fan as a batch of burger buns or cookies because the hot air would only contact and affect a small portion of the product. A convection oven also reduces the cooking times of products by a significant degree. This means that if you're following a recipe written for a conventional oven, your products will probably be overdone or burnt if you cook it at the same temperature for the same time in a convection oven. That is not really a concern for products like loaves of lean dough bread, where you want the highest possible heat in the oven.

{"fospwhg": {"text": "I'd be happy to!1) This recipe is in baker's percentages. Basically, you can use this bread formula to take a given mass of flour and exactly portion every ingredient needed for the formula based on how much flour you want to use. So, if I had 250g of flour on hand, I would multiply 250g by every percentage to get the required amounts of every ingredient needed to make baguettes with 250g of flour. If you want more info on how to use this more effectively, feel free to PM me. You can very easily use this to calculate exact quantities so you don't have leftover dough after a bake.2) These terms are just some that I learned in culinary school and are used very commonly by professional bakers. I got so used to speaking with my chef instructors with the vocabulary that I kinda forgot that not everybody on Reddit knows what they mean, haha.* Straight dough method: A method of dough mixing where all the ingredients are mixed together at the same time instead of using pre-ferments or holding back an ingredient to mix later.* Autolyse: A technique where a dough is mixed just until the flour is mostly mixed in and then rested. This allows the enzymes in the flour to start breaking down the starches and allows the gluten proteins time to start bonding to each other. You can read more about it [here](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2017/09/29/using-the-autolyse-method).* Bulk Ferment: This is the initial fermentation step right after kneading where the entire mass of dough is fermented to start building the air pockets.* Degas: This is the step right after the bulk ferment where the dough is removed from the container and punched down to remove the gas. Hence, de-gas.3) Honestly, it's really not very complicated. You can find many baguette shaping videos on YouTube. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdNRogR10nM) is a slight variation of the method I learned at school, but most of them are the same thing. Right after dividing, you flatten the dough out an preshape it into an even cylinder. After resting it, you flatten the cylinder again and tightly roll the long edge into the dough until you have a slender baguette with a perfectly even thickness.", "link_id": "t3_g99bd3", "time": 1588035607}}

{"f8aiy31": {"text": "I made my starter using King Arthur bread flour. Here's how:1. Equal parts by mass flour and water on day 1. Let it sit in a sealed Mason jar (or any suitably large watertight container)at room temp for 3 days to let the wild yeasts and the cultures develop. By the end of day 3, the jar should have formed a noticeable amount of bubbles and should be foaming with activity. Use your judgement. If the jar is foaming and bubbly and wonderful on day 2, perform step two. Otherwise, let it sit for longer. If you're sitting for a week with no noticeable activity, I'd throw it out and try again.WHY: This step is the initial formation of the culture. You're providing a nutritious, suitable environment for the cultures to grow and plenty of food to consume.2. IF AND ONLY IF the starter culture is active and hungry, discard half. Feed the leftover half with flour and water in the following ratio: 1 part starter eats 1 part flour and 1 part water. If you did this right, your final starter weight will be 3 times the weight of the starter half when you divided it. Store at room temp.WHY: This step takes an active culture and begins the process of stabilizing it. At this moment, there are a lot of various bacterial cultures competing for dominance in the starter. By taking out half and feeding it, you are feeding the desirable cultures what they want to consume while keeping the environment in the jar close to that of step 1, promoting vigorous growth and activity.3. Repeat Step 2 every day or however long it takes the starter to get back up to a foamy, bubbly, active state. Take note of the length of your feeding intervals (be as precise as you wish with your units of measurement). It is essential that the starter doesn't even think about the refrigerator until day 10 or until you feel the starter is stable enough (reached a predictable feeding and discarding routine) to handle being slowed down.WHY: Repeating the feeding process like this promotes the desired yeast and bacterial cultures. When they consume the starches in the flour, they release acids that cause the starter to smell and taste sour! These same acids kill the undesirable cultures in the starter. I recommend tasting a bit of the discarded starter every feeding. As you keep feeding, it should taste closer and closer to sourdough bread. If a starter's temperature is changed too soon, you've changed a crucial variable of the microbes' environment and undesirable cultures start to dominate the starter. After a series of frequent feedings, your starter becomes more and more mature and stable both in taste and smell because the desired cultures have become the predominant microbial population in the starter. They have a large enough population and concentration to have their feeding and reproductive rate changed.4. When the starter has reached a stable, predictable feeding routine, decide how often you want to keep feeding the starter and how often you will use it. Professional bakeries feed their starters every day. You probably won't be making loaves of bread every day so you can keep it in the fridge and adjust the feeding amounts with your starter's feeding frequency to keep it in the fridge for however long you wish to extend the feeding intervals.WHY: This step just enables you to be more sustainable with your flour usage and remove unnecessary feeding without worrying about the starter turning or spoiling. The undesirable cultures aren't completely dead in the starter though. They are still there in very low concentrations. If you miss a couple of feedings, the starter loses its resilience because the new environment favors the undesirable cultures.", "link_id": "t3_dyy83c", "time": 1574398694}}

{"e1ub8nx": {"text": "I'm looking to get a new Chromebook and I'm actually kind of disappointed in what's out there. My ideal Chromebook would have been the Dell Chromebook 13 7310. That device checks literally every single box I could possibly think of and a few more that I love. The display was awesome, the battery was huge, it looked like and was built like a top class device, and didn't skimp on the connectivity either. If not for the lack of USB-C and the presence of the USB 2.0 port, I would buy a brand new Dell Chromebook 13 7310, but unfortunately they don't make those anymore. I was previously looking at the Lenovo Thinkpad Chromebooks, but if you look through my post history, I had a terrible experience with their customer service and I don't want to have to deal with that again if a problem occurs down the road with my future Chromebook.With that in mind, I want to get a Chromebook that is sort of like a modernized version of the Dell 7310. My top priority is the screen, as I like to look at it while I work. I would hate to be distracted by stupid things like large pixels. I would not buy a device with a screen resolution of lower than 1080p. It's 2018, lower than that is unacceptable. Higher resolutions are fine, as long as they don't affect battery life too much. The screen should be between 12.5\" and 13.3\" in size. 14\" is also fine if the bezels are slim, but Chromebooks generally aren't made that way, so...yeah.My second priority would be a tie between battery life and build quality. I am a college student and my classes take up a majority of my day. I need a laptop that can last throughout the day and take a lot of notes, write a lot of papers, watch a lot of videos (The Khanacademy and YouTube kind. Not sure what kind of other videos I would be watching, no sir) and look good doing it. I know Chromebooks are kind of the go to devices for great battery life, but I want it all. As much as I can get.My third priority would be a tie (sorry about the ties, they're all just so important to me!) between performance and connectivity. I am a tab monster, I admit it. I open one tab, and the spiral begins until it's midnight and I have 30 different tabs open with god knows what on each of them and I can't even remember where it started and how it happened. I know Chromebooks are great performers for all this stuff, but I tend to push that quite a bit on all the devices I have used before. I also like varied I/O because I carry flash drives and like to use them often. Weird, I know, but I would rather not purchase a dongle just to plug them in. Or connect to an external display to give a presentation like I had to do recently because the computers at my school are old as hell and boot up like drunk, sleepy tortoises.My budget would be a maximum of $650. I know I'm asking a lot for a Chromebook, but I want one that is as close as possible to that Dell one with some modern features. Running Android apps on it would be a great bonus, but not necessary.I'm also willing to wait (within reason; maybe like two months, max), so if there are some upcoming Chromebooks that might fit the bill, please feel free to let me know.", "link_id": "t3_8tua4l", "time": 1530810765}}

I was able to make 2 pizzas between 12-14 inches in diameter. The dough sat in my fridge for about 12 hours before I took it out and let it warm up by putting it in a lightly floured container in front of a heating vent covered in two blankets. I then split the dough in two pieces and made pizzas with the two of them (my shaping skills are still developing, please excuse it). The first was a simple cheese pizza and the second was my father's request topped with green peppers and onions. The one in the album is the second one, as the first one was so good we finished it before I could take pictures.Oven conditions:* The oven was set to the max temperature of 550 Fahrenheit.* I used a cast iron pizza stone ([this one](https://www.amazon.com/15-inch-TOTALLY-INDESTRUCTIBLE-Perfect-Grill/dp/B01LD3ZHOG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516804411&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=cast+iron+pizza+stone)) which was in the oven from the beginning of the preheat until the launching of the first pizza. I let it sit in the oven for 30 minutes after the oven came up to temp.* The stone was set in the middle of the oven with nothing under or above it.The total bake time for both pizzas was around 5-7 minutes from launching the pizza to pulling it out of the oven.Kenji was right, people. This dough is some pretty great stuff.", "link_id": "t3_7sndch", "time": 1516804676}}

This is partly why I selected a relatively large case.I selected that many case fans because of the whole front panel deal on my case. It's pretty obstructive and fans tend to struggle (from what I read online about the case). I want to have good airflow without building a high-tech hairdryer. If it turns out that I want to install a GPU in the future, I would be able to do so without having to buy more fans to deal with the extra heat. I'm not trying to make this build future-proof, more...future-prepared.Edit: I have more questions. Does the performance of the CPU decrease noticeably if it's hot but below the maximum temperature? Would I need a video card for the work I plan on doing with this build? Does the airflow in the case really affect the temperature of the CPU if the cooler already has a fan on it?

I didn't have many friends there, but I did have another boy my age who I'd known since the first day of first grade. He was my best friend. A few months into the school year, he started to take off days. He showed up to school less and less and he wore long sleeves and pants in August. I don't remember much, but I vaguely remember the assembly a couple months later and my teacher coming up to me and telling me that he died. When I asked how, she told me that he got really sick. Of course, being third grade, rumors started flying around. \"He wasn't looking in a train station and fell in front of a moving train!\" He went into the forest and got bit by a snake!\" \"He's not actually dead; they're only saying that because he ran away and they can't find him! I saw him running, I swear!\" I feel ashamed to say this but as the years went by, I remembered less and less of him. I can barely remember his face now, 9 years later, and he is one of the few memories I have left from my childhood. I've had a great deal of trouble making friends since then. I was like an emotional black hole. I didn't allow anyone to get close to me. I locked up everything that made me who I am and threw away the key. If anyone persisted and tried to get to know me, I overdid it and suffocated them, unable to control myself.

I was too scared to properly tell her how I felt about her and she thought something different and it stopped right there.Very recently, she told me about how she started dating a guy that she met at a summer program. I told her I was very happy for her, but I realized that I had not gotten over my feelings for her like I thought I had before. If anything, I've been feeling for her a lot more after she told me about her boyfriend. I hate myself for feeling this way and I'm making a conscious effort not to be a Nice Guy. But I can't decide if I want to stay as a friend and support her or leave. There are days where there is nothing I want to do except cry into a pillow and run away from everything, but at the same time I don't want to leave because this is her first relationship and I don't want her to be alone when it ends.

I don't know why, I guess I just decided to take a nap in the park in this dream. So it's almost 4:30 - 5:00 ish from the position of the sun. I decide to get up and lo! My dream girl (literally, ha!) is next to me, tying flowers into her hair. I could see her so clearly, her deep green eyes looked at me and she smiled - she looks kind of elvish when she smiles. It's really freaking cute. She asks if I'm ready to go home and I say yes, so we start walking. Her long, black hair has a few grass leaves in it so I start taking them out. We come into the wooded area and we see a tree that looks relatively easy to climb. So I go first, charging into the tree for some reason, and jump up, catch the first branch, throw myself onto the next, and go on until the branches got too thin. I climbed back all the way down and dared her to go higher than me. She immediately started climbing and went so high that I had to start backing up farther, and farther away from the tree to see where she was.Then, a branch under her foot snapped. She started falling. I was a good distance away from the tree so I started running. She was falling faster, though. I couldn't make it in time. She was 15 feet from the ground. 10 feet. 8 feet. 6 feet...and into the arms of another guy. I slowed down and stopped, relieved that she didn't die. I looked at the guy's face and my blood chilled. It was the guy I hated most. Not because he was mean, no. I hated him because I was extremely envious of his wit, his sense of humor, his confidence, his smarts, his easiness, his ego...basically, he was a catch and he fucking knew it. So yeah...he caught my dream girl. Time slowed down. The two people that filled my mind almost every day, albeit with extremely different emotions, were standing in front of me. They smiled to each other. Their faces got closer together. Their lips touched and they kissed. My heart started beating really, reeaaallly slowly. The BA-BUM, BA-BUM grew louder and louder until it was the only sound in my ears, then it sped up - **BA-BUM! BA-BUM! BA-BUM!**, I started breathing faster, I blacked out, I WAS IN ANXIETY HELL!...I jumped awake. Oh no, but it didn't end there! No...my chest started hurting. It hurt so much, especially right above my poor heart, broken into ten thousand pieces by A FUCKING DREAM. It hurt until I thought I would scream...then it was fading away. After a few seconds, it felt like nothing had happened. Like one of my worst nightmares had just given me a psychological bullet wound and some physical torture to finish it off.That was the worst week of my life.

If she still doesn't feel comfortable with you having a sexual relationship, it's too bad for her (don't write that...be more respectful.

I wanted to stay in a relationship with her but I could see her changing and I didn't want her to change for me. I loved her for who she was, not who she was becoming.I don't know if I made the right decision. It lasted only about five months, but we got pretty serious. I can't imagine her pain, but I've thought back (still do) to that moment countless times to see if there was anything I could've done to change my decision. Anything that would've kept us together. I never found it.Didn't mean to hijack your comment here, but it just reminded me of my situation and I wanted to offer my perspective to see if it applies in any way.
