I always thought I was psychic and that all these strange occurrences in my life were some sort of symbol or message I didn't understand. Turns out they were just hallucinations or delusions. My worst delusion was an all incompassing feeling of being persecuted. I thought my family hated me and blamed me for all our dysfunction. I thought my bosses and coworkers hated me because I was too outspoken. (I actually was TOO outspoken because I was manic and out of control but they didn't hate me.) I'd get paranoid that friends were mad at me. I felt broken and unlovable. I also had a lot of delusional romantic relationships. I had a crush on a professor and thought we had this secret understanding, that we'd send each other certain looks to communicate during class. I'd have a casual hookup with someone and feel like it was fate that we were brought together, that we were soul mates from past lives and just meant to find each other again.I'd think I knew more than experts. I think it's fair to say I have an above average IQ and that I am capable of seeing the bigger picture or how things are interconnected but my delusions went a lot further than that. I believed I could write a book debunking stats when really I've only had two intro classes on the topic. I distrusted all of western medicine. Now I don't feel so black and white about topics. My emotions aren't driving my beliefs. I can research a topic and learn about it without jumping to these conspiracy like extremes. This is especially helpful during this time of world pandemic. My life is so much more rational and solid.Another type of delusion is magical thinking. I believed a lot in synchronicities, everything is connected in meaningful ways even though I never really understood what they meant. These often overlapped with my hallucinations. Animal messengers, finding feathers or rocks meant for me, tv shows and music speaking directly to my life at that time, dream like scenes, speaking to the dead, battles with mother nature, etc. Since I've been diagnosed I've changed from believing strongly in shamanism to becoming more of an atheist.

It doesn't really matter if you're labeled with bipolar 1 or 2. Everyone is different anyway. I have rapid cycling so I have a lot of mixed episodes or dysphoric mania.

I also record my hours of sleep. So I can use the graphs in this to see trends. I've been pretty stable for last 6 months or so.

It's working great for me. But it took a long time to get here. I think one of the tricky aspects of bipolar meds is that they don't just stop your cycling. Imagine your mood episodes like a large wave. The meds don't just stop the wave, they decrease it gradually. So you have to stay on the meds long term and give them time to stabilize you. It took me about 2 years until I felt stable. Even then we were still adjusting and fine tuning. I started on lamotrigine which had a lot of negative side effects for me but it was helping my moods. So my docs kept me on it until I got up to a high enough dose of Seroquel. So I recently got off lamotrigine and am very happy with my meds now about 2.5 years after starting. I strongly suggest using a mood tracking app to track your overall mood, symptoms, and side effects. Then you can use that to report back to your doc. If you don't trust her, find a new one.

My friends believed it too and encouraged me. I have experienced many strange and magical synchronicities. But now, after observing the difference on meds, I understand that most of it at least delusional. (I do recognize that psychic phenomenon do exist and it's possible that bipolar can make me more perceptual but overall I do not have psychic abilities.) I think the misunderstanding is that delusions and hallucinations do not have to be severe or serious. Having psychotic symptoms is different than full blown psychosis. Magically thinking, dejavu, seeing signs in everything, special messages or connections in songs, books, shows, etc. are some of the first signs that I'm on the up swing. I also have mild visual, auditory, and olfactory hallucinations like a unidentifiable smell or Calliope music playing in the fan. These are not dangerous or disturbing. At most they are annoying but many are actually pleasurable. These symptoms are a concern only in the sense that they are warning me that things are amping up. I can up my dose of my antipsychotics and avoid a manic episode all together. So from your explanation it sounds very much like delusions which are very common among those if us with bipolar 1. But don't automatically be scared just because you've experienced psychotic symptoms. They aren't always horrible. Yours like mine sound pretty positive.

Maybe if we were raised in a shamanic culture we would be selected and trained how to use our abilities to reach other spiritual realms. Maybe or brains work faster and we do we things others don't. Or maybe it's just an illusion of or broken brains. I don't know how to tell the difference. At first I really mourned my ability to stay up all night and too work obsessively. Taking Seroquel insured that I actually go to bed and sleep. And I just didn't have the obsessive energy anymore at work. I thought it was such a waste. But now I'm really grateful I'm no longer manic. I never knew what it felt like to not have all that buzzing, anxious energy. I love my chill pills.

{"flzl0s4": {"text": "Meds have been an absolute miracle. I lived decades without meds. I know what it's like to suffer unmedicated. My life was an absolute disaster. The worst part was not trusting people, not being able to let anyone in. At 39 I was properly diagnosed and started mood stabilizer which started helping but it wasn't until I started an antipsychotic that my life changed. I started sleeping and my mind calmed down. Seroquel is my chill pill. It doesn't cause me any worse eating habits than I already had. It took me about two years to find this combo. Here are some of my suggestions for how to be successful finding meds:1) Find a doc you trust. Tell them everything, ask anything, and follow their directions. If you don't agree with doc explain why and discuss. They are there to help you, to work with you. 2) Give meds a chance. Almost all meds feel crappy or weird at first but as your body adjusts most side effects do go away. Also your cycling won't just stop abruptly. Picture it as a large wave. The wave doesn't just stop, it has to slowly decrease. So even when you're on the right meds it often takes a long time for them to stabalize you. Give them time to work. 3) Keep accurate records by journaling or using a mood tracking app. My memory is shit. So it helps me a lot to have evidence to talk to the doc about. I love my overall mood, level of anxiety, sleep, side effects, symptoms, etc. Finding the right meds is a great science experiment. You need to collect the data to be analyzed.4) Trust your gut. You don't have to wait for your appointment if you're feeling crappy. You can call your doc. At times I just felt like I wanted more of a drug and so I asked. Then I wanted to get off a med cuz of the side effects. I had to wait a few months until increased other med first but now my doc let me I'm off it.  It took me about 2 years to feel stabalized and now I'm good. Seriously good! Life feels so much easier.5) Be prepared to take meds for the rest of your life. Once you're stabalized doesn't mean you're all set. You will have to keep monitoring your symptoms and moods and adjusting meds. I like the diabetes analogy. A diabetic can't just take the same dose of insulin all the time and be healthy. They have to monitor their blood sugar and adjust meds accordingly. We have to do the same for bipolar. Observe and adjust. 6) Meds can't solve everything. Meds were a miracle change in my life but I had already had over a decade of therapy. You're very young. Being a teenager is a hard time even without mental illness. So recognize that you will need therapy in conjunction with meds. I highly recommend DBT classes. They helped me build better communication skills and self compassion.Ok, that's a lot more than I intended to write. Sorry for the long message. Hope you find some of it helpful.

It took me about 2 years to feel stabilized. Think of your mood episodes as a large wave. Meds don't just shut it off immediately.

I've told doc that but he's kept me in it anyway. I guess it's not hurting.My advice would be to make sure to only change one med at a time so you can observe what they do. Also up doses slowly to let your body adjust to avoid negative side effects. Most side effects do go away with time. Use a mood tracking app to record overall mood, irritability, anxiety, etc. And also track side effects like headache, drowsiness, etc. It's super helpful to have that info to relay to your docs.

{"fbwat2c": {"text": "A diagnosis is the first step to finding proper treatment. I was just diagnosed two years ago at age 39. Here's some advice that's I've posted previously. I'm happy to answer questions.1) Learn about bipolar disorder. These forums are a great place to start but I would suggest some more formal research as well. Learn about the common symptoms that you probably haven't yet realized are part of the disorder like hypersexuality, anger and irritability, shifts in sociability, etc. Then reflect and observe what is true about your bipolar symptoms. Rereading my past journals was really mind blowing. It was easy for me to see how sick I was when I'm years removed from those emotions. We all have a lot of similarities but it really manifests differently in everyone. So you have to figure out what applies to your situation.2) Give meds an honest try. There will be side effects. You'll probably feel ill, stupid, clumsy and/or tired. But don't just give up. A lot of side effects really do go away with time. And don't expect this first dosing to be right. We're still tweeking my doses after 2 years. It takes a lot of patience. For the most part I feel pretty good lately and have almost no side effects anymore. So give meds a chance but on the other hand, don't be afraid to call your doc when you know something is off. You don't have to wait for your appointment when you know you're not right. 3) Use a mood tracking app or journal. The main way your doc knows how your meds are working is your self reporting. If your brain is anything like mine, I can hardly remember yesterday. So tracking my moods over time to see larger tends and taking notes on my side effects and behaviors have made me much better prepared to report to doc. Trying to find the right meds is probably the most important science project ever and you need accurate data to be able to analyze the results.4) Find people who understand. For me this is a mental health support group. Though I do have a couple good friends that I can talk to they don't really get it. It's been so comforting to share and learn from others who have lived it. It's as good if not better than therapy and it's free!5) Go to therapy regularly. Though just recently properly diagnosed with bipolar disorder I've been in therapy about 15 years. There are some things I just didn't have the ability to fix without meds but there were many life skills I did learn through therapy. I found DBT classes to be especially helpful. Currently my therapy is mostly just based around making sense of my bipolar disorder. My therapist is someone I can ask questions to or talk about the difference between delusions and reality. (I've has a lot of psychotic features in my past without really recognizing I was psychotic.) Right now she's helping me make sense of feeling stable and adjusting to new life expectations. Am I apathetic or just calm? These are such foreign feelings to me that it helps to have someone to chat to about it.6) Be kind to yourself. Taking care of yourself is hard work. You can't do it all at once. Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly. It's better to go for a 5 min walk than no walk at all. But for me since my diagnosis, it is getting easier.

They will still be able to see past that if it's not accurate. For example before I was diagnosed I told my therapist that I thought I had borderline personality disorder. She listened and then at the end of our session she said she didn't think i had BPD; she thought it was BP which then became my formal diagnosis after I saw pdoc. If the doc deserves their MD is psychiatry they will be able to diagnosis you if you're are being honest. With that said, I saw a handful of psychiatrists before I was properly diagnosed because they all just assumed ADHD and didn't consider anything else. So I would just make it clear that you want the doc to figure out what's ailing you and to do a proper diagnostic intake assessment. And feel free to ask them questions too.

What gives me hope now is the combination of meds and my ability to observe their effects. We can't just expect to take a pill and our symptoms will be all under control. I like the analogy of comparing bipolar to diabetes. A diabetic cannot just take the same amount of insulin everyday and expect to be well. They have to monitor their blood sugar and adjust the insulin dosage accordingly. We have to do the same. We have to observe our symptoms and when we are sliding into an episode we need to talk to doc and adjust meds so things don't to get worse. You've done the first step--observing that you are not well. Now the second step is to call your doc and get a med adjustment. I started meds a little over two years ago. I may not be consistently good yet but since I've been sticking to my meds I've only had a handful of bad days since Feb! We still adjust meds almost every month that I go in. I'm hopeful that one day I'll actually feel stable but yet I know I'll still have to be vigilant about observing myself to make sure I stay that way. There is hope but it is tied up with the work it takes to get better.

You just have to take them one day at a time and trust that a stable mind is better than a manic mind. Or maybe you have to hit your rock bottom before you'll believe that. The problem with that is 1 in 5 people with bipolar disorder commit suicide. So rock bottom can be deadly. Not taking your meds can literally threaten your life.

{"f4y6an7": {"text": "I was diagnosed two years ago at age 39. It's been life changing to say the least. In many ways it's been extremely helpful to finally understand why I've struggled so much in my life but on the other hand it's been really humbling to realize that my brain really is broken. It takes awhile to make sense of all of it. I never even suspected I had bipolar disorder but after my diagnosis when I look back at my life, it's so obvious. I honestly never recognized many of my symptoms as issues. That's what's so tricky about this disorder. It manifests in so many different ways that it's hard to see it all as one disorder. Anyway, here's some advice that's I've posted previously. I'm happy to chat if you like too. 1) Learn about bipolar disorder. These forums are a great place to start but I would suggest some more formal research as well. Learn about the common symptoms that you probably haven't yet realized are part of the disorder like hypersexuality, anger and irritability, shifts in sociability, etc. Then reflect and observe what is true about your bipolar symptoms. Rereading my past journals was really mind blowing. It was easy for me to see how sick I was when I'm years removed from those emotions. We all have a lot of similarities but it really manifests differently in everyone. So you have to figure out what applies to your situation.2) Give meds an honest try. There will be side effects. You'll probably feel ill, stupid, clumsy and/or tired. But don't just give up. A lot of side effects really do go away with time. We're still tweeking my doses after 2 years. But for the most part I feel pretty good lately and have almost no side effects anymore. So give meds a chance but on the other hand, don't be afraid to call your doc when you know something is off. You don't have to wait for your appointment when you know you're not right.3) Use a mood tracking app or journal. The main way your doc knows how your meds are working is your self reporting. If your brain is anything like mine, I can hardly remember yesterday. So tracking my moods over time to see larger tends and taking notes on my side effects and behaviors had made me much better prepared to report to doc. Trying to find the right meds is probably the most important science project ever and you need accurate data to be able to analyze the results.4) Find people who understand. For me this is a mental health support group. Though I do have a couple good friends that I can talk to they don't really get it. It's been so comforting to share and learn from others who have lived it. It's as good if not better than therapy and it's free!5) Go to therapy regularly. Though just recently properly diagnosed with bipolar disorder I've been in therapy about 15 years. There are some things I just didn't have the ability to fix without meds but there were many life skills I did learn through therapy. I found DBT classes to be especially helpful. Currently my therapy is mostly just based around making sense of my bipolar disorder. My therapist is someone I can ask questions to or talk about the difference between delusions and reality. (I've has a lot of psychotic features in my past without really recognizing I was psychotic.) Right now she's helping me make sense of feeling stable and adjusting to new life expectations. Am I apathetic or just calm? These are such foreign feelings to me that it helps to have someone to chat to about it.6) Be kind to yourself. Taking care of yourself is hard work. You can't do it all at once. Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly. It's better to go for a 5 min walk than no walk at all. But for me since my diagnosis, it is getting easier.

It's just nice that if you're feeling grumpy you don't have to put on a fake face with this crowd. During the meetings we go around the circle and do a quick check in. You can pass it you want. I usually say diagnosis and how my week went. Then you can say if you have a topic, question, it just want more time to talk. Sometimes people just want to vent. I asked s lot of questions when I was first diagnosed and during everything out. It was especially helpful to talk with others that experienced psychotic symptoms. It's hard to sort out reality from my broken brain and it's interesting how others have had very similar experiences. Lately I've been fairly stable so I don't have many questions or concerns. But I still like going to see and connect with others. It feels good to be able to offer some advice. Also I color throughout the meeting so I always feel more relaxed and grounded after. I would highly recommend checking the meeting out and make yourself go a handful of times before you decide if you like it or not. It is scary at first but everyone really wants to help. Be patient and give it a chance.", "link_id": "t3_dl4q5q", "time": 1571704133}}

That might be true psychosis but psychotic symptoms do not have to be horrible. Psychotic symptoms are defined as hallucinations and delusions.

Delusions that I'm psychic or more knowledgeable in fields I've never studied are common for me. It may make me seem a little crazy cuz I'm so giddy and full of ideas but it's not that harmful. What's a million times worse is the anger that follows. Pure and seething rage. The hopelessness of depression is a delusion too, right. When we believe we aren't worth anything.

Ex football players are at serious risk and our society does nothing to protect them, in fact we encourage that violence in the name of sport. Abused children are at risk.

Like you state, I don't have many friends that live near me and my good friends who live elsewhere do listen to me but don't really get the extent of my suffering. It's good to feel understood by others and to help them. In our group we often ask questions or advice from others. You get good strategies from people who have really lived it instead of a counselor just telling you what you should be doing. Also it's a way to get out of the house and see people even when you feel like that's impossible. Fellow bipolar folks understand if you don't shower, if you're still in your PJs, if you don't say a word, etc. One meeting a woman slept the entire time. That's what she needed I guess.

I got in a lot of trouble but most of it was blamed on alcohol. Then I moved all the time and everyone just thought I was crazy adventurous. I would hate my life and think it was my environment and that I had to leave. Moving to a new country would trigger mania and the cycle would repeat. In my late 20's I was diagnosed with ADHD. I saw counselors, therapists, and psychiatrists for over a decade without anyone questioning that diagnosis. My main complaint was my anger issues. I hated everything, a seething rage that would consume me. I found a place and job I loved but my anger got me fired. I moved back to my home state and earned my Master's going completely broke in the process. I was bat shit bonkers then too, full blown mania. But still no one noticed. My professors just thought I was obnoxious and eccentric. My family was used to me being \" a selfish bitch\" and ruining every get-together. I thought I was psychic talking to dead people, seeing signs everywhere, seeking my spiritual destiny. I had delusional relationships with friends and professors while hooking up with strangers on Craiglist. I told my counselor about my suicidal ideation. Sometimes I'm really mad and sad that no one cared enough to get me the help I really needed but my anger pushed everyone away even counselors. It took me a few years after that to get back on my feet. Ironically it wasn't until I was doing pretty well that I realized something was really wrong. At 38 I was staying put for the first time in my adult life. For a record length of 2 years I had a great job and a home I actually liked. I could no longer blame my environment. The problem was me. I was having suicidal thoughts daily on my drive home from work. I thought this was weird, not that I was having suicidal thoughts because that was pretty normal for me, but that I was having them in my way home from work when I should feel relief. I bright this up to my sister and she freaked out. Threatened to call the police on me. I thought she was really overreacting and I stopped talking to hear. But that was around the time Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington committed suicide and something clicked on my head that I was not safe from myself. But I knew it wasn't depression. I needed to find a diagnostic psychiatrist that would look at the whole picture and figure out what was wrong with me. 39 years, a psych major, a decade of counseling and I never once considered bipolar but it fits 100%. It's a shame that anger isn't better understood as a symptom of mental illness. I'm so grateful to have found a care team that figured it out. Meds have been a miracle.

You obviously want something to change if you're seeking help. You don't have to justify if you're\"bad enough\". If you feel you need help then continue to seek it out. 2) If you want a proper diagnosis you need to see a diagnostic psychiatrist. Therapists cannot formally diagnose you. There are a lot of other mental illnesses that have overlapping symptoms.  Don't assume you have bipolar.3) It's possible your memory of your moods is not accurate. Memory is linked to your mood state (state dependent memory). So someone like me with bipolar 1 when I'm depressed I feel like I've always been depressed. I've actually told my counselor, \"I've never been happy in my entire life.\" But looking back at my journal I have had euphoric episodes, I just didn't remember them.4) There is debate whether unipolar mania exists. If it does, it's extremely rare. I've definitely been on the hyper side of the spectrum most of my life but I suffered a lot of dysphoric mania or another term is mixed episodes.

So it's taking me a lot of research and self evaluation to reframe all my symptoms though this new label (though I do still have ADHD label too). Also I never knew what normal was so I hadn't realized that I really hallucinated and had other symptoms because to me it was just normal. Here are some things I've realized:1) Anger or extreme irritation is a symptom of an elevated state. I used to be filled with rage. I would hate everything and everyone including myself. So this could include suicidal ideation which would qualify as a \"mixed episode\" though I identify more with the term \"dysphoric mania\" because I am in a hyper, manic state but not happy.2) Racing thoughts and the inability to focus are symptoms of bipolar not just ADHD. I never knew that my ADHD brain could be turned down until I tried antipsychotics. The lightning behind my eyes is off, the feeling of being high on my thoughts is gone, I can read or even listen to a book without a million other thoughts distracting me. I don't ruminate as much over one little thing that bothered me earlier that day. My mind can be calm.3) Physical hyperness is a symptom of bipolar disorder. I'm always on the go. I talk a million miles a minute, can't sit still, get bored and want to move on. I had a severe restlessness that made me quit jobs and move every 6 months or so. I get impatient with most anyone and anything. I bounce my legs, bite my fingers, pace, talk, etc.  Hard time sitting through a movie, finishing a book, etc. Some of this is still ADHD though it's much improved with antipsychotics.4) Extreme sensitivities to my environment are symptoms of an elevated state. Lights will get too bright, I hear the lights buzzing, everything smells bad. Everything just feels overwhelming.5) I am not psychic. This is one of the first symptoms I get when I'm going up--the world starts feeling a little magical. I see synchronicities everywhere,tv shows seem to have special meaning, I think animals crossing my path are messengers, I see sparkles in the trees, I can talk to the dead, etc. Some people may really be psychic but I only have these experiences when in an elevated state.

The catch 22, however, is that most people with severe mental illness struggle with basic daily tasks making self care almost impossible. I wasn't diagnosed with bipolar 1 until I was 39 years old. I know what's it's like to live unmedicated as I suffered for decades without any real stability despite getting sober and seeking therapy. Meds were the game changer for me and I will never be without them again. Without them I cannot develop the routines necessary for the type of self discipline you discuss. And you're right that my meds come with side effects. Dry mouth had given me many cavities, I have to work harder to lose weight and keep my labs within healthy ranges, my balance is compromised, my evening schedule is affected by sleep meds, etc. But I chose to deal with these adverse effects because the benefits outweigh then in my case. I can imagine that those with intermittent cycles could be ok short term without meds but you never know when a new episode will pop up. I'm glad you recognize that this is a lifelong illness and that you will need to be vigilant to identify a new episode before it gets out of control.With that said I would like to point out that your long rambling, egocentric post does remind me of my manic ramblings. I would believe I had everything figured out, that I had the answers to a happy, healthy life. I always questioned Western medicine,I still do, but the way I'd question it before came from a place of arrogance. I knew they were bullshit and I could see what was right. Now I can see the limitations and question their objectives while at the same time respect their expertise and experience. You also mention pursuing new hobbies. This is a typical symptom of an elevated state. None of these symptoms are necessarily problematic at this point. You feel great, in control, productive. Maybe it won't continue to a more elevated, dangerous state. But I would caution you that based on your writing you seem hypomanic. And in the past when I was feeling like that there was no way in the world someone could convince me that anything was wrong with me because I felt great and had all the answers. Is there someone in your life that you'd trust to tell you if you're acting hypomanic? Do you have a plan for what you will do if you believe your are going manic?

{"ewhfq9j": {"text": "A proper diagnosis is hopeful because now you can work on actually treating the disorder. I was diagnosed 2 years ago at the age of 39. I can understand your shock and fear. Here's some of my advice for what helped me.1) Learn about bipolar disorder. These forums are a great place to start but I would suggest some more formal research as well. Learn about the common symptoms that you probably haven't yet realized are part of the disorder like hypersexuality, anger and irritability, shifts in sociability, etc. Then reflect and observe what is true about your bipolar symptoms. Rereading my past journals was really mind blowing. It was easy for me to see how sick I was when I'm years removed from those emotions. We all have a lot of similarities but it really manifests differently in everyone. So you have to figure out what applies to your situation.2) Give meds an honest try. There will be side effects. You'll probably feel ill, stupid, clumsy and/or tired. But don't just give up. A lot of side effects really do go away with time. We're still tweeking my doses after 2 years. But for the most part I feel pretty good lately and have almost no side effects anymore. So give meds a chance but on the other hand, don't be afraid to call your doc when you know something is off. You don't have to wait for your appointment when you know you're not right.3) Use a mood tracking app or journal. The main way your doc knows how your meds are working is your self reporting. If your brain is anything like mine, I can hardly remember yesterday. So tracking my moods over time to see larger tends and taking notes on my side effects and behaviors had made me much better prepared to report to doc. Trying to find the right meds is probably the most important science project ever and you need accurate data to be able to analyze the results.4) Find people who understand. For me this is a mental health support group. Though I do have a couple good friends that I can talk to they don't really get it. It's been so comforting to share and learn from others who have lived it. It's as good of not better than therapy and it's free!5) Go to therapy regularly. Though just recently properly diagnosed with bipolar disorder I've been in therapy probably about 15 years. There are some things I just didn't have the ability to fix without meds but there were many life skills I did learn through therapy. I found DBT classes to be especially helpful. Currently my therapy is mostly just based around making sense of my bipolar disorder. Someone I can ask questions to or trade it the difference between delusions and reality. (I've has a list of psychotic features in my past without really recognizing I was psychotic.)6. Be kind to yourself. Taking care of yourself is hard work. You can't do it all at once. Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly. It's better to go for a 5 min walk than no walk at all. But for me since my diagnosis, it is getting easier. Hang in there and be patient.

It makes me feel better but hard to tell if helping ADHD symptoms yet.

I honestly had no idea I was so severely mentally ill because I didn't know any different. I think it's a dangerous scale to measure against if you think you have to be hospitalized to be\"bad enough\" to need help. I probably should have been hospitalized numerous times but I was too stubborn to admit myself and I didn't have anyone close enough to me to bother. I also could have easily been arrested on numerous occasions but my friends and the fact that I'm a white woman saved me more than once. When I started telling people about my new diagnosis a common response was, \"well you're not that bad since you've never been in the hospital. You must be coping well.\" NO, just because I didn't go to the hospital doesn't mean I was ever doing well. I was suffering from hallucinations, delusions, rage, suicidal ideation, etc. The act of going to the hospital is not a measure of severity. More so it is probably a measure of your willingness to get help. But now I also agree with the post you're referencing. They are simple saying that people exaggerate an elevated state by incorrectly calling it mania. Mania is severe and even if the person is not seeking hospitalization, their functioning is impaired. So just feeling hyper and cleaning your house is not mania. A simple solution is to use the term elevated state which is anywhere above baseline.", "link_id": "t3_ck00w3", "time": 1564545999}}

{"eu8tjod": {"text": "I've read some articles on this topic. Unipolar mania is not recognized in DSM so bipolar 1 would be most likely label. Some of the reasons unipolar mania is probably not as recognized is:1) Most manic people do not seek help on their own. Most people diagnosed with bipolar seek help when depressed. So unless someone else recognizes your mania and gets you hospitalized, a person with unipolar mania is unlikely to get diagnosed at all.2) unipolar mania may be confused with other disorders like ADHD or schizophrenia. I have a friend diagnosed with ADHD that I am convinced had unipolar mania. He does not have any concentration or focus issues. He is super intelligent and has a million hobbies. He hardly ever sleeps, is overly social often to a fault, and he has irrational bouts of anger. His moods still fluctuate but he is always on the elevated side of things.  I too was first diagnosed with ADHD. I have always been hyper, restless, racing thoughts, etc. The majority of my life has been spent in a state of dysphoric mania. I knew I wasn't depressed but I was miserable. Finally properly diagnosed at 39. I would say I've only had 3 truly depressive episodes in my entire life. Usually I would only fluctuate between hypomania and dysphoric  mania with just short bouts of euphoria mania.So I agree with you that it is probably more common than it is recognized. There really is no point in changing your diagnosis. The label doesn't really matter as long as you're getting proper treatment and it sounds like you are since you haven't had an episode for years. Why did it bother you? Are you feeling like your illness is not being recognized? So you feel like you're not getting the necessary help?

That was two years ago and my meds are just recently stabalizing. My main advice to you would be to be patient and observant. Taking meds is a crapshoot. It is a necessary science experiment and you are the main investigator. Keep a mood journal (app like dalio) to track your moods and symptoms. I also write down notes to report back to doc because my memory is not always accurate. Don't be discouraged if there are side effects. Most do go away as your body gets used to drug. Always take your meds as directed. If you feel like something is off, call your doc for a med adjustment. Yes it is ok to call instead of waiting for appointment. Be patient because it takes a long time to find the right combo for you. But it's totally worth the effort. If you're curious about specific meds in on the following:lamotrigine/lamictal which is an anticonvulsant which works as a mood stabilizer decreasing the extremity if my mood episodes. Started this one right away but a long time adjusting doses. Quetiapine/Seroquel which is an atypical antipsychotic. This is a miracle drug for me because it helps me sleep and calms my mind. It's my chill pill. I loved it instantly but took a while to build up to large doses without passing out.Atomoxetine/Stratera is a nonstimulant ADHD med.

The most convincing aspect for me is if it were real, why wouldn't I always feel it. This magic would come and go throughout my life. I didn't always feel that connection. I would reason that I just wasn't paying attention and when those feelings of grandiosity would resurface it I'd think I needed to dedicate my life towards those pursuits so that I would forget again.

Perhaps full blown psychosis,a total break with reality, is but you can have psychotic symptoms in both depression and mania. I use to have a lot of delusions of persecution. I thought everyone hated me or was out to get me. I had a lot of trouble getting along with bosses and coworkers because I was always holding grudges for things I thought they were doing. Now looking back I can see that there wasn't really any concrete evidence for any of it which makes it a delusion. When in an elevated mood I have a lot of magical thinking and mild hallucinations which is not really a dangerous stage for me because I love the world and feel this great connection to it. When I pass that point I hit a stage of pure rage which can be very dangerous. So I think you have to differentiate between psychotic symptoms and psychosis.

There were subtle little positives here or there but it takes a long, long time to get up to a theraputic dose. So you have to be consistent and patient. Lamictal's side effects are usually mild which is why it's many docs first go to drug. I had a lot of side effects at the beginning. Everytime I'd increase dose I'd get headaches and cold like symptoms (sore throat, swollen glands, fatigue, etc.) for about a week. Allergy pills helped. I also had trouble breathing once I got up to higher dose of 400 and had to go back down to 200 which I take now.

{"etjai2y": {"text": "I am on both. The Seroquel was a real game changer for me because it helps me sleep. I have a fairly regular sleep schedule for the first time in my entire life! I liked it so much that I started taking it during the day too. It's my chill pill. Helps me call down, less anxiety, no racing thoughts, and less sensitive to my surroundings--lights, noises, etc. It makes me feel drunk when I take larger dose before bed. When I started even a low dose would put me straight out so be careful. I take 50 mg four times a day and 150 before bed. I pretty much can't do much of anything after the bedtime dose. But during the day I don't feel negative effects.Lamotrigine on the other hand has caused me some cognitive issues. I had a lot of trouble with word recall and reading or writing numbers correctly. I'm on 200 mg now and it doesn't seem to affect me anymore. So maybe it's just so mild I don't care.  It also gave me horrible anxiety dreams every single night! I could barely stand it and probably would have gotten of it if not for the Seroquel. Pairing the Seroquel with the lamotrigine helped me a lot. I still have very vivid dreams but I have my whole life. So it doesn't bother me like the anxiety dreams before.Happy to answer any other questions you may have. My advice is to just be patient. It takes a long time to get up to theraputic dose and for side effects to disapate. If you're feeling any positive effects it's probably worth it to keep trying. It's taking me to years until finally on adjusting doses. (I'm also on straterra for ADHD.) It's been worth the wait because now I feel like I can actually function in life.

I wasn't hearing the voice of god, I didn't believe I could fly. But I was hearing voices of the dead and receiving psychic signs from the universe.

Also you don't have to have been hospitalized. The fact that you end up in a hospital is not in direct proportion (stats ha) to the seriousness of your illness. I didn't have any close family or friends to make me go. Most cops let me off with a warning (probably because I'm a white woman). Lastly, you probably don't remember your manic states. I honestly believed I had never been manic when I was diagnosed but reading years of my journal told a totally different story. There were times when I felt that I needed to pursue my spiritual calling. I never thought this was part of a mental illness because my friends encouraged me. They believed I was psychic. But I no longer believe that. I used to have deja vu all the time. Saw synchronicities in everything. I also recently realized that I hallucinate. I see animals, highlighted colors, sparkles, smiling cars, etc. None of that was harmful, most were actually pleasant. My worst delusions were that I never for in anywhere. People never wanted me around. I annoyed them. They don't have to be other worldly to be delusions. Delusions are beliefs not rooted in reality meaning I have no external proof for any of my friends hating me. Keep reading and researching, and also reflecting in your own experiences. It was really hard for me to recognize my own symptoms at first because they were so normal for me. I want diagnosed until 39. But now I better understand my past knowing I suffer from bipolar 1.

But now that I'm on atypical antipsychotics and my mind is calm I realize how much it really was racing before. Your writing feels amped up. The fact that you're on ADHD meds can be affecting your mood cycling. While on Adderall I was mostly in the manic side. Still I think it's odd to not feel any mood disturbance. I have two thoughts on that: 1) bipolar spectrum theory. Have you read up on this? The idea that unipolar depression is at once extreme and bipolar 1 at the other extreme. However there are some interesting ideas or there on if unipolar mania exists. Can someone experience mania without depression? I had a friend diagnosed with ADHD that I could easily argue could be unipolar manic. Anyway it's controversial and all hypothetical. 2) State dependent memory. Memories are t tired to your mood state and you really can't remember them when not in that state. For example when I was first diagnosed I said there is no way I'm bipolar cuz I've never been happy in my life. But then I went back and reread journals and there were times I thought I was spiritually enlightened and had all the answers and joy in the world. I couldn't remember this feeling. Also if pick up old relationships or weird manic missions years later like no time passed between episodes. It's kind of like having two separate memories for me. Maybe you're not remembering your mood shifts. Anyway bipolar disorder manifests itself differently in everyone. More important than the label you get is the treatment.

But I think it was psychosomatic. For over a decade after that I continued to take Adderall and see counselors for \"anger issues\". Not one psychiatrist or counselor ever thought to reassess my diagnosis. Finally I was fed up and knew something was wrong that therapy want helping. I sought out a diagnostic psychiatrist who finally diagnosed me with bipolar 1 at the age of 39. Meds have been an absolute miracle. I wish I would have found them earlier. I am so grateful to my current psychiatrist and therapist for their knowledge and help. ", "link_id": "t3_ajiiii", "time": 1548374053}}

{"eesudxc": {"text": "Lamotrigine was originally an anticonvulsant given to those with epilepsy. When people in the study reported an improvement in their moods, docs got the idea to try it for people with bipolar disorder and it helped. So I guess it can help those without the disorder but those without the disorder wouldn't need a med just for that. Like Adderall can be fun but people without ADHD can function without it. It is quite common for those of us with bipolar to doubt our diagnosis. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about a year and a half ago at the age of 39. How is it possible for me to have lived with this serious mental illness for so long without knowing? I actually said to my tdoc, \"There's no way I'm bipolar because I've never been happy in my life!\" But I've learned that there are two major flaws with this thinking: 1) State dependent memory means that memories can be tied to your mood states. I honestly didn't remember ever being happy because those memories were linked to my manic state. I have journals that tell another story. One where I believe I have a spiritual destiny that I need to pursue. Or others where I understand the world so much better than scientists who study it, everyone is blind to the real world, except me. Everyone is fake. I'd even have relationship that would pick up after years because I was again in that mental state where that was my man. My manic brain didn't realize time had passed. My memory cannot be trusted.2) Mania does NOT have to be euphoric. I only had about 4 major depressive episodes in my life and my euphoric mania is even rarer.  My most common state was dysphoric mania which is extreme irritability and rage. I hated everything and everyone including myself. I had all this pent up energy and hate that I felt like I was bursting. I blamed the fucked up world for all my misery. I wasn't the sick one, all these happy people were because they couldn't see the true horror of the world we live in. Because I blamed my environment, I moved and switched jobs constantly. But everywhere I went, there I was to fuck things up again.A proper diagnosis and meds have been an absolute miracle for me. I wish I would have know earlier in my life. I think it's healthy to question your diagnosis. Do your research. Read as much as you can. Reflect back on your own life. (Reading my past journals was really eye opening). Ask many questions of your psychiatrist and therapist. Be an active participate in the search for helpful drugs. Track your moods, take notes, collect data. It's a science experiment where you are the sole benefactor. The better your can report what's going on with you, the better your docs can help you. Good luck.

I definitely had to be at home because clumsy and wouldn't be safe to drive. First time I took 100 I stumbled and fell over my dog which scared me. I didn't feel safe so 50 was the most I'd take. But I liked how it got rid of my racing thoughts and the lightning behind my eyes. I felt calm so I asked to start taking during day. I now take 50 mg three times during day and 150 before bed for total of 300. Still a little tipsy before bed but I don't feel sleepy during day. But I think it's helped a lot to stay with small doses, slowly increase amount and spread it does so smaller doses. To think 100 mg used to scare me and now I take 300. So give it a chance to get used to it.Eventhough I don't notice side effects hindering me, there are some health concerns. It can raise your cholesterol and since mine is already borderline that may be a bigger issue. I have to get blood work done a few times a year to check that it's not getting too bad. Appetite isn't worse for me but I was fat before and need to lose weight. The biggest issue right now is dry mouth. In just a few months I have 8 cavities! I had no idea it could cause such damage. But now I have discovered lozenges, mouth washes, etc so I should be able to keep it under control. So overall it's been a great drug for me. If you have sleep issues it's one of the most sedating antipsychotics. There are side effects but they do lessen as your body adjusts. You need to have a pdoc that you trust and can ask questions. That's what they are there for. Good luck. Hang in there.", "link_id": "t3_aj013f", "time": 1548280186}}

Now I just feel like a boring middle-aged commuter. But being saner is worth it I guess. I'm definitely still struggling to figure out a routine but some things are getting easier. 1) Taking meds. I take meds 5 times throughout the day. So setting reminders and taking my meds on time was the first step for me. 2) Sleep. This is a continuation of #1 for me because I never could go to sleep at a reasonable time before Seroquel. Now thanks to meds I've gone to bed at a reasonable time every night for months! 3) Exercise with others. I'm not good at holding myself accountable for working out so it helps me to have others to meet up with. I make dates with friends to walk dogs. I go to a martial arts class so there is a set day and time to meet. (Side note, martial arts had been great for me because they do the goal setting for you. This is what you have to learn for your next belt. I highly recommend.) 4) Tracking apps. I used a mood tracker, food tracker, habits checklist, and a wearable fitness tracker that also tracks my sleep. It's also great for reminders of when to take meds. With that said, my routine at home is the hardest. I often don't know what to do with myself. It's a snow day today and I should be ecstatic but instead I'm kind of bored.

{"eeqslk1": {"text": "The way my tdoc explains it is that hopefully I'll find a cocktail that keeps me stable for the most part though there will need to be adjustments here and there. I'll have my base set of meds that I take and then perhaps some I can take as needed. For example when I started taking Seroquel I was able to adjust the dose depending on how much I felt I needed to fall asleep in any particular night. Sometimes when I was just feeling bad, I couldn't really explain what exactly but I just knew something was off, I called my doc and he adjusted meds right away. So I think the point is to start recognizing your own early signs so that you can adjust meds before really slip into an episode. Some compare it to diabetics because they can't just take the same dose for their whole life and expect it to work.

These are different biological issues in the brain. Some people can remain stable on the right meds. I think the point is that you just have to be vigilant about observing your symptoms and adjusting meds as needed. I'm starting to worry cuz we keep adding more meds which don't have any immediate side effects but that over time will effect my health. So in that sense my life may be shorter than my siblings. But I think those length of life stats are based on overall averages and the major contributing factor to why those with bipolar have a shorter life span is that many commit suicide which skews the mean.

They did help in some interpersonal ways but never solved the real problem that was my brain is broken. No matter how hard I tried to control it, it wasn't possible. Meds are necessary and a miracle in that regard. I understand that you're hesitant and that you're still trying to find yourself. That is typical of your age and from what you've shared you seen much more mature and self reflective than most. But that's all the more reason to try the meds. Do a ton of research on bipolar, use a mood tracking app, journal, and reflect on the changes you observe while starting meds. Keep in regular contact with your pdoc and tdoc to answer questions and adjust meds as needed. The analogy of comparing bipolar to diabetes helps me understand. A diabetic can't just take the same dose of insulin all the time and expect it to be right. They have to constantly monitor their blood sugar and adjust accordingly. That's our job as bipolar patients. We have to constantly observe ourselves and adjust accordingly. I believe you will find your true self and reach your true potential faster if medicated. Also bipolar definitely affects cognition. I have had trouble reading my whole life. I was diagnosed with ADHD for years but I'm not convinced that is accurate. I have found that my focus and ability to prioritize had improved greatly with mood stabilizer. Though I still struggle to read I can now listen to audiobook which I never could before. So maybe reading will soon improve too. I think your doc has a good point when trying mood stabilizer before looking into learning disabilities.

No, I only feel it when manic. My newest tattoo I've titled \"psychic vs. psychosis\" because the first part is the first psychic sign I saw before I was diagnosed with bipolar and then I added to it once I realized I actually hallucinate. Anyway in my recent episode feeling the magic in the world again was my first sign. Before I even feel bad, I was telling my tdoc about the magic. It was very subtle. Nothing major at all. Just felt connected to the energy of the world. Pulled out my animal signs book for first time in a year just to see what possum might say. Feeling more personally connected to TV shows, etc. Then a week or two later I was not good, not horrible. But I'm glad I noticed and reported it while I could so that my meds were adjusted and I feel better soon without any major issue. So I think you should definitely consider it a symptom. I'd contact doc and all for med adjustment. I upped lamotrigine and took for Seroquel than normal. Now feeling good, back to old dose of Seroquel.

{"e87tkck": {"text": "It sounds to me like you are getting most of your impressions about bipolar from media. Don't believe all the scare tactics and stereotypes. Not to say there aren't things to be scarred of. Bipolar is a dangerous disorder and treatment is important. Do you have a regular therapist and psychiatrist? If not I strongly suggest finding some. They will be able to answer questions and help you recognize your own symptoms. There are also a lot of sources online where you can learn about the disorder. I'm not expert but I can answer based on what I've read.Lamotrigine doesn't have any severe long term effects. Some meds do. Some like lithium you need regular blood tests to make sure your levels are okay so you don't take too much. Benzos are really addictive. There is some research that suggests that severe episodes cause brain damage. So theoretically if you are unmedicated your whole life, things would get worse. But if you have meds that help avoid major episodes then that damage isn't done. Also your brain does heal like when a heavy drinker stops drinking. The brain damage will heal over time. Though I guess memory loss is permanent. My memory is really bad and I can hardly piece together a lot of my past without photos, journals, and others retelling me.i have not heard of the dementia connection. Though different drugs have different side effects. I'd ask your doc. And it's great you don't drink or do drugs. Those will cause more damage than some bipolar meds.Schizophrenia is not a mood disorder. Bipolar 1 can include psychotic symptoms that make it seem similar but they are related to mood episodes. Schizoaffective is more of an overlap but I don't really know much about it. So it may be something you want to read more about. But I'm pretty sure having bipolar doesn't put you at risk for schizophrenia. I think the confusion is more for docs misdiagnosing at first. One doesn't develop into another.I think it's important to understand the disorder so that you can start recognizing your own symptoms to avoid more severe episodes. I would suggest reading some books or online sources. It's great to connect with people on here and share experiences too. Good luck in your learning. Sounds like your meds keep you pretty stable.

{"e6tuhsv": {"text": "The way I understand it from my favorite book by mondimore, bipolar disorder for patients and families, is that mania develops in stages and hypomania was coined to describe patients who only experience the first stage of mania without it developing further. But hypomania can still be damaging to their life with excessive spending, hypersexuality, etc. I feel like I'm in that state right now. My mood is not great, not elated, but not bad either. Overall I feel ok but something is just not right. I feel antsy, like I should be doing something productive but I don't, instead I post more on Reddit, watch TV in 10 min bursts, surf the internet intermittently, obsessively reread my own writing, make spreadsheets at work to mathematically justify any decision I have to make, watch romance movies which I normally hate, seek out new dates, binge eat or forgetting to eat, sleep less, much more social, etc. But as I move more into mania I hardly sleep and avoid people because I get super irritable, irrationally so. Then comes the hatred and rage. Seething, overwhelming angst at how terrible humankind and the world are. Thoughts get really disorganized, like ADHD at first but then really messed up. Mild delusions of persecution or psychic abilities start and then build and build until I either believe the whole world is out to get me or that I have a spiritual destiny that I need to pursue. It's a spectrum where hypomania is the first stage. To me the tipping point is usually the rage and my starting to avoid people. Or the opposite of needing to find people immediately, especially for sex or parties or drugs. It feels uncontrollable and absolutely true. Hypomania I feel like I can still reason with myself a bit, like telling myself I shouldn't fuck a stranger off cl even though I might still make that bad choice. But during mania I think it's a perfectly valid choice and see absolutely nothing wrong with it. Though I don't want to belittle hypomania. It still uncontrollable in many ways but I still feel like myself. Manic me is a raging monster that even I don't understand.", "link_id": "t3_9jp2cl", "time": 1538180441}}

Feeling an intense connection to TV shows or books like it's the perfect time in life to read it and the exact message you need at that moment. Some were also annoying like bad smells that I could never identify. Buzzing.  Dejavu, jamaivu, and strange perceptual distortions like feeling taller or my dogs looking really short one day. Or a building looking like a flat movie set. Also brief hallucinations that I can reason away and so I never believed they were actually hallucinations. For example, holy cow there's a turkey in my yard, no that's just a branch. Or omg there is a huge drop off on the side of the road, no just a strip of tar. The worst was the delusion of always being persecuted, like no one in my family loved me, that everyone at work was annoyed by me, cops and bosses had it out for me, and that no one ever listened and understood what I was saying.

{"e3kh5cc": {"text": "I'm diagnosed with unusual rapid cycling (more later). First off rapid cycling can also be confused with or used interchangably with mixed states depending on who you ask or what resource you read. I really like Mondimore's \"bipolar disorder: a guide for patients and families\". One thing he stated that I also found interesting is that child onset bipolar tends to be more rapid cycling than those who have later onset. Since I feel like I've always been like this, that makes sense to me. My cycles are faster and not as obvious as more typical bipolar 1 which I think makes it harder to be diagnosed. So I think it's good that you're questioning things. I definitely encourage you to see a psychiatrist. So what is it like for me? The main difference is that I've never had a stable episode in my entire life until meds this year. I'm 40, btw. I tended to cycle about every two years between more manic symptoms or more depressed but they always overlap. There are smaller cycles within those general trends. When I started using a mood tracker it would be up and down every couple of days. I also have a horrible daily energy cycle where mornings are torturous and then I'm hyper and overactive in the evenings which makes sleep really difficult. I have only had a couple instances of dramatic mood shifts during a single day. I guess in my experience it makes sense to think of it more as mixed states than rapid cycling because the symptoms do overlap so much. My most common mood state is dysphoric mania which means I hate the entire world. Pure rage and extreme irritability at everything which can also mean I'm suicidal since I hate my life. I'm usually physically agitated and seeking something but I can't ever figure out what, which is why I moved about 30 times. Depressed is different, feeling worthless and can barely move to get off couch.

Most every disorder is on a spectrum. For example Asperger's and autism are now often referred to as autism spectrum disorder. Many people can demonstrate symptoms if ADHD but what is that critical point that it becomes a disorder? The main idea of the bipolar spectrum is that not everyone will demonstrate full blown mania. Some may not even demonstrate hypomania and be in the unipolar depressive side of the spectrum. There isn't a clear cut line of this is depression this is cyclothymia, this is bipolar two, and then this is bipolar 1. There are gradients and doctors just give them these names for insurances purposes more than anything probably. But all these disorders do share similar issues and treatments. They are different manifestations of a spectrum of disorders. For example if you ever read Prozac nation the author is more in the depressive end of the spectrum. She was severely depressed most of her life with only one bout of mania. I'd be more in the mania side because I'm chronically angry, hyper, impulsive, etc and I've only had a few major depressive episodes.

Of course they are comforting to snuggle with when too depressed to see people. I don't think I could live alone without dogs.I wouldn't count on a dog motivating you. The first dog I had was amazing and I took her everywhere with me. So she did help me get out by going to the dogs park or for a hike. But my current dogs are not dog friendly and so they actually hinder my socializing because I can't take them. And they definitely add to my anxiety when I want to go for a walk or a hike because I have to worry about running into other dogs. And it doesn't help that one of them gets car sick too. Honestly I just tend not to take them out of the neighborhood. They are just house dogs and I feel guilty about that a lot. Though they are very happy and healthy, they do not lead a very stimulating life compared to my first dog that traveled the world with me. And when I am out without them I have to constantly be counting the hours to let them out again. But I think this depends on how much you work. When I was unemployed or just working a little here or there it was great having a dog around and plenty of free time without them too. But I work a lot now. So after they have been home alone all day I can't justify leaving them alone in the evenings too. So my current dogs hinder me a lot.Another issue is cleanliness. I am really bad at adulting and keeping my house clean. Dogs make this a million times worse. There is hair everywhere and I wouldn't have a chance of keeping up without my Roomba. My floors are filthy, keep your shoes on! My yard is only about 30% grass now and getting worse every year. And make sure your vitamins and plastic spatulas are put away. Trips to the emergency vet are expensive! That brings up cost. Regular costs aren't much, a few toys, food, etc. But vet bills will kill you. Just routine care for my 2 big dogs is too much. But then you throw in an accident here or there. And once they get old it's really hard. Since I'm not good with finances it just adds to my credit card debt. Oh well.Honestly if I knew how much work my current dogs would be compared to my first one, I would not have gotten them. And as horrible as it sounds, I often wish I were dog free to have more options in life. But then again I don't know that I would survive in my own without dogs.

When I hate my job, hate all of mankind, hate all the traffic, hate that buzzing noise the light makes, that I'm up, but not in a good way. When I'm feeling worthless, hopeless, insignificant, that's depression. Externally both these horrible states manifest themselves in similar way--I'm paralyzed on couch unable to take care of myself.

In my opinion this was not overstepping as I was anxious about seeking out sex without a relationship and they helped reassure me that it is okay. So maybe your therapist was just trying to explain that there are other options for losing your virginity. Sometimes you just have to jump in and then that horrible anxiety will dissipate a bit. I have a friend that was still a virgin in his 30s. He was so scared of women he couldn't even talk to them let alone find a date. I asked him if he wanted to fool around and we had a very satisfying sexual relationship for over a year. He was curious and wanted to please so he learned quickly. He is now married and startng a family! I say just jump in. Whether it's asking a girl out, asking a friend to teach you, or hiring an escort if that suits you.

{"dyao3hc": {"text": "My memory is pure shit and I'm trying to better accept that. I allow my friends and family to tell me who people are, what happened, when things happened, etc. There are a few things that I think factor into this memory issue.First is mood dependent memory.  Memory is linked to mood so when you are not it that mood it is harder or impossible to recall that memory. This affects everyone. For example if you study for an exam amped up on coffee, you will remember better if you are in that same amped up state when you take the test. But now this concept becomes a real issue for those of us with bipolar because we have such dramatic mood states. For example, when I first sought out help I told my counselor, I have never been happy in my entire life. But that's not true. When I reread years of my journals there were entries where I was on top if the world. But when I was down and depressed I seriously had no recollection of these highs. My journals actually read like to totally separate timelines. I would be obsessed with an ex while manic. Then forget about him for years until I was in that manic state again. Then I would continue writing him letters right where I left off like no time had passed. So at least in my case I think mood dependent memory is a major issue.Another point is no one's memory is that reliable which is why eye witness testimony is usually not that worthy. But those of us with bipolar have to be even less reliable since bipolar can cause hallucinations, delusions, and distorted thinking. I now the way I perceived events was way off how others viewed them. So it only makes sense that or memories are messed up when it view of reality is.Thirdly, stress affects concentration and executive functioning in anyone. Dealing with bipolar is stressful. Thus or executive functioning is often frazzled.I haven't been medicated very long but I do believe that forming new memories will be easier since I won't have such drastic mood swings, I won't have as many hallucinations, delusions, etc., and hopefully I won't have as much drama and stress in my life either.

{"dyamx3e": {"text": "Thanks for the compliment. My understanding is that the weird thoughts are delusions while hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling or feeling things with your senses are hallucinations. My most common one's were smells actually. I'd always smell weird scents and they would drive me nuts. I would ask others, what's that smell and they wouldn't smell anything. Sometimes I would hear foreign voices having a conversation in my fan. I'd try to identify the language and thought they might be voices from the other side but could never understand them. There was a fly that buzzed right in my ear quite often. I'd see sparkles a lot or certain colors would stand out like they were highlighted for me to see some clue. I'd see tons of shoes on the side of the road. One or two okay but they kept showing up everywhere I went. I'd just think it's some weird sign that I was supposed to figure out. So you see, nothing too harmful. All just curious, strange occurrences. But then after I was diagnosed i hallucinated a bat in my house. It was chasing me and I hid for 3 days. That made me contemplate if I have had more serious hallucinations. I think I have but since my memory is so messed up it's hard to tell. For example I've had two similar strange run ins with people on buses which easily could be explained as hallucinations but maybe they were just strange incidents and my memory is distorting them. I once thought I called a cat to it's death as it ran out in front of my vehicle and sat down. Why would it sit down? I now question all these weird things as perhaps just being in my head which actually seems more plausible really.

My tdoc is actually very open to the possibility that I may have some psychic abilities as she has a psychic friend that works for the police. She told me one way to tell the difference between psychic and psychosis may be the importance we put on these experiences. Do you just observe and think oh that interesting? Or like me do you think there has to be some hidden meaning and the signs are pointing you to act on something in your own life? Psychics who help others usually don't change their lives based on visions, others come to them for help. When I reviewed my journals from many past years I realized that all my \"psychic\" experiences usually coincide with other obvious manic symptoms, like hypersexuality, grandiosity, scattered ramblings,etc. So if I am psychic why don't I have these experiences at other times? Maybe we are more open or able to sense them in different states. That could be. Different cultures view that as a gift and would think it's a calling to be trained in spiritual ways. Maybe if we had teachers like this it would different. I still believe in synchronicities, that there is some energetic connection between things in the world, but right now I no longer think I'm any more psychic than the average person. I think those where psychotic episodes and I'm ok with that. They weren't scary or harmful. They are probably the least troublesome of all my symptoms. Even from a psychological stand point they could still be signs of something from my own unconscious.

{"dt3laib": {"text": "I was just diagnosed this summer  39! I think the way bipolar is portrayed as just extreme lows and highs in mood is a real disservice. Even in most books on bipolar they always explain mania so extreme like you're running around like a maniac preaching of the apocalypse. So I never thought my delusions were that extreme; just thought I was psychic. I never realized I'd hallucinated until after diagnosed. I never thought my insane rage could be mania. I never thought my fluctuations in socializing were part of an illness. I just thought I was equal parts introvert and extrovert. I thought my tendencies towards reckless behavior was due to ADD impulsiveness, substance abuse, or natural horniness. But extreme fluctuations in sleep, energy level, sexual activity, even body temperature, can all be related to bipolar. I'm really finding the book Bipolar Disorder A Guide for Patients and Families by Mondimore to be really helpful but it might be a little heavier of a read than some want.

Different mood states have different memories that are not necessarily accessible when in different mood (state dependent memory).  I honestly don't remember my manic times when I'm down. I thought I've never been happy. But looking back through years of journals was really mind blowing. I don't think there is any doubt and it baffles me how it took so long to figure it out.

When I say that it does sound totally crazy but it isn't really that extreme. Many of my friends honestly reinforced the idea that I was psychic and they were interested in the synchronicities I was observing. It's a subtle feeling at the time and didn't affect my life except that I actually meditated more. My psychotic symptoms never caused me any harm. What's more dangerous is the impulsive risk taking: a young woman hitchhiking alone at night in Mexico, sleeping on the dirty floor of a meth house surrounded by unknown men, riding around with drugs in a stolen truck, unprotected sex with a wanted criminal, picking fights with large men, spending the last dime you have, maxing out credit cards for a road trip, etc. Again most people never saw this. Many people actually admired my sense of adventure and saw a strong independent woman. The main symptom that bothered others and made me seek out counseling most my life was my anger--a horrible raging anger against the whole world. I never thought any of this was mania. I just thought I was impulsive, nomadic, craved novelty and adventure. But as I reflect and read my journals it has become quite obvious that the diagnosis of bipolar 1 fits. I think it's a real disservice that mania is always explained by the most extreme cases. You don't have to be thinking you can fly, or running around town naked preaching of the apocalypse.

I think genuinely psychic people's skills don't come and go with their moods like that. I think it is more likely a trick of our brains which is why it is common and typical of people with bipolar. Grandiose thought and inflated confidence are pretty much the ingredients to mix up a batch of spiritual importance. My tdoc told me that it's ok to recognize and appreciate the connection but if you start acting on it, like when I thought I should go meet an astrologer across the country just because I had a vision of his name, that is probably manic. A reasonable person would just make a phone call not plan an 800 mile trip. So in my opinion, as long as it is a positive thing for you and it doesn't affect your life than it can be whatever you believe it to be. But if you're diagnosed with bipolar or other disorders with psychotic features and knowing that this is a common symptom, be careful because it could quickly get out of control.", "link_id": "t3_7o2ywt", "time": 1515129237}}

I wasn't diagnosed with bipolar until 39. I wish I would have found out early and been working towards better treatment. One more thing--a tricky aspect of bipolar is that your memory is often dependent on your mood state. When I was first diagnosed with  bipolar I, I didn't believe it either. So I went back and read through years my journals and asked people who knew me well. Turns out I'm a pretty textbook case after all. I just didn't remember a lot of my actions or interpret my emotions as unusual because they were normal to me.

My point was that it seems this article excludes those of us who are diagnosed with another disorder and treats hypersexuality merely as a symptom of bipolar not a psychological disorder of its own. What if hypersexuality was a mood disorder? There is unipolar depression. What about unipolar mania? I know some self-proclaimed sex addicts who are not diagnosed with any disorder. One in particular definitely acts like manic me. He is a fast talker, impulsive, and constantly seeking out more and more interesting sexual encounters. He is married, attends swingers parties with his wife, and regularly attends gang bang parties on his own. He admits that he is obsessed, constantly thinking of sex. So what if hypersexuality wasn't a disorder of its own after all but a symptom of a mood disorder that falls along manic side of the bipolar spectrum? The way they tend to define hypersexuality as a symptom of bipolar is to say that your actions are out of the norm for you. So, you're right that some people can exhibit the same behaviors and it's not a problem for them. But it's pretty obvious when someone with bipolar fluctuates between depression and not being able to interact with people at all let alone foster a sexual relationship to the other extreme of soliciting men off cl for one night stands. So, it makes sense that it is harder to quantify and qualify a diagnosis for those who present with a norm of hypersexuality. But wait a minute, you're one  of the authors of this?

Still they didn't really differentiate why a struggle with regulating your sexual behavior is different than the reward seeking of addiction. Wouldn't you say that drug addicts have a problem regulating their consumption? Perhaps their point is that unlike drug or alcohol addiction where the solution is complete avoidance, the hypersexual person's sex drive or urges may not be a problem in and of themselves so avoidance is not the issue but rather sorting out the underlying psychological issue. Makes sense to me but just kind of seems like it's merely semantics to avoid the social stigma. I found the discussion around the sexhavior cycle more interesting. That the issues may arise more from either a rapid cycling though these stages or getting stuck in a loop of just the first two stages (urge and behavior). I relate a lot to the latter and it helps explain my frustration even when I am having sufficient quantities of sex. I just never feel satisfied; I'm right back to the urge.  Impulsivity and lack of control definitely. Yet, that feels like the same issues I had with partying though. I could never get enough. I was always seeking some grand adventure, some crazy high that rarely came. So, to me it feels similar to my issues with substance abuse. Perhaps I was never a true addict. But then again this article states that this change in designation in DSM would not include hypersexuality due to other conditions; thus since I've been diagnosed with bipolar none of this really relates to me which seems a little off too.

Go the spiritual route instead. Or a friend said, everyone with bipolar ends up hospitalized. You're not that sick. Well in fact the cops took me to the hospital once. But even so, maybe I was just too stubborn to go to the hospital. This friend does not live near me and sees me only once every year or so. How would she know my struggles? Maybe some of it is our own fault because we do work so hard to hide our struggles from everyone. I doubt people at work know. I doubt people at the gym know. I honestly don't have anyone in my life that knows the full extent of my misery because I don't tell anyone and I dont' want to have a total breakdown for people to believe me.  So, as I start to consider telling a few people in my life, I wonder if it isn't more about how I tell them. If I continue to brush over it nonchalantly and not discuss it seriously, then can I blame them for not taking it seriously? But with that being said I still think some will just not understand and perhaps that will affect my relationship with them. If people don't understand that I own two dogs and that that affects my guests and my schedule, well then we tend to not be very compatible friends.

First one I ran a red light and totaled both my car and a brand new truck that still had dealer plates.

Eventually, I paid off that loan and bought a new vehicle. In less than a year from my first accident, I rear ended a parked car. What an idiot right? At least I didn't get a ticket, but still my insurance was sky high and  I had horrible driving anxiety for years after that. ADHD meds helped me be able to drive again and now I won't drive without them. Doesn't sound like your accidents were necessarily your fault though. Do you feel like your illness is precipitating these incidents or were they really freak accidents? Perhaps you should talk to your doctor about your attention and/or anxiety. Or maybe it would alleviate some stress to just not drive for awhile. I ended up with a great lifelong friend out of that first accident because I ended up hitching rides with her to the Y on a regular basis. Maybe if I hadn't crashed my car and had to depend on her generosity to pick me up all the time we wouldn't have gotten to know each other. There is a solution and you'll get through it.

So, I guess that's where my hope leads. It is a serious, chronic illness. I keep hearing the comparison to diabetes, and I thought at first that was just a way to debunk the stigma of bipolar. But now I think it is a better analogy than just that. Like diabetics have to watch their blood sugar and adjust their insulin levels as needed, I think that is the secret to managing bipolar.

I am just recently diagnosed at 39 and now in looking back over my life it seems so obvious that I can't believe it took this long to figure it out. My first major bout of instability was in college when I was a raging party girl that rarely slept. But I know I had these tendencies before. Children are extremely egocentric, struggle to control their emotions, and are naturally hyperactive. Thus, I think it's hard to tell when one has issues with this. Still I was the trouble maker in the family because I was sassy. I always talked back and fought with my siblings. I never got in trouble at school, but I did have violent tendencies and took it out on others on the playground. I once punched a kid on the bus. When we had sleep overs or lock-ins I never slept. I could go the whole next day no problem. I was impulsive and intense. The first major shift in confidence and mood was when I was about 15. I was a strong athlete and super cocky and talented in the spring. But then that fall I was insecure, my sports ability actually decreased, and I was less social. I just assumed puberty was the culprit of my newfound depression. But, I didn't tumble too far down then. I think the strict structure of life with my parents, going to school, and working out about 4-5 hours a day kept me pretty damn stable despite these personal struggles. Once I was left to my own devices at 18 everything went to shit. I've pretty much been a disaster ever since despite appearing quite successful. My friends would actually get pissed at me unbelieving how I could earn straight A's and party nonstop. I also worked to support myself while most my friends didn't. I graduated magna cum laude at the age of 21. I always did well at my jobs. I went back and finished my masters in my late 20's. But I have never been stable. My sense of responsibility and hard work kept me going when I felt like dying. Traveling, moving, crazy adventures, drugs, and sex kept me entertained while manic. My anger got me fired and ruined most friendships. I'm looking forward to figuring out what life could be like stable, and what I'll be like then.

The man was standing right in front of me but wouldn't let anyone else get close to him. He kept waving his arms and shooing others away.

They have the virus.\" When I got on the bus, there were not many seats available and everyone had their shit on all the seats trying to save them.

{"dozxmo2": {"text": "No, you have to take this shit in context and consider the person's usual personality and drive. Want some examples? 1) I just had a month or so of insane hypersexuality. I was spending every free minute searching, chatting, making arrangements to have sex with strangers. When I couldn't find someone I was masturbating excessively. All of this is not something I do regularly and I was absolutely obsessed, I couldn't stop. But now that drive it's gone. I'm still sexual. Now I have one regular partner but I'm not completely hyperfocused on that as my main goal in life. 2) I once thought I could become a famous author by debunking the massive use of statistics as scientific evidence. But I have had only two general statistics class in my life. I admit I know very little about the actual math behind it all. Though even now I do think it's kind of ridiculous that a student's \"proficiency\" on a standardized test is set as the 40%ile. First off why are we using percentile as a benchmark at all? Don't we want to do better than our nation is currently doing? Then even if we are using percentile, the 40%ile is below the norm. Why would that be something to strive for? Anyway, my point is I still have these questions, but I don't believe I have any expertise to argue the solution. So, thinking it was my calling to write about this was ridiculous and that feeling quickly passed with a shift in mood so I'd never actually have the motivation to research and learn the methods to pursue this type of project. That is very different feeling and belief than me deciding to earn my masters and working towards becoming an expert in my field. Believing you can accomplish something by putting in the work and gaining the knowledge is different than feeling like you can do it right now because you are a super genius with the insight to recognize things that others just don't see. 3) I once had a vision of a star and a man's name. I googled this name and found out he was an astronomer that lived across the country from me. So, then I got it in my head that this was a sign that I was meant to go met this man. That he must have a message for me. I couldn't just call him on the phone. I would have to plan a trip to find him. I would research him and find the location. Then my mood would shift and plans would be abandoned until my next manic episode where I would feel this compulsion to go again. I would start planning to take off work and plan my trip but I never got very far because mood would shift again. My tdoc is cool because she doesn't dismiss the possibility of psychic phenomenon. But she helped me to notice that when you're making plans to act on weird shit, that's probably a sign that you're manic not psychic. Most people who make a living off their psychic abilities do not change their lives based on their visions. Others seek them out and they work to help them. With any mental illness the individual symptoms may manifest in anyone. What makes it a symptom more than just a personality trait is its maladaptive aspect. Hope this helps a little.

But in a way I think this extreme sense of responsibility bordering on workaholism has actually saved me. Work is the one thing I do accomplish in my life. I still think some of these issues are due to intelligence too. Gifted people tend to have overexciteabilities, analyze things too much, have different interests than the norm. Think how differently a person who is two standard deviations below the norm acts. You can recognize them in a crowd, you can tell by the way they talk, what they are interested in. Well the same goes for people two standard deviations above the norm yet that is not so socially acceptable: rapid speech, holistic thinking, seemingly off topic connections, different interests, etc. Research shows that gifted people are more prone to social emotional issues not because of any biological connection but because of misalignment to their environment. They don't fit in and so they suffer for it. So, like you I continue to question. Have you tried the meds and not had luck or just hesitant to try?

I mean the pain and danger of child birth seems pretty maladaptive. I sure as hell don't want that risk. But many people find it worth it to endure that in order to have children. Maybe suicidal ideation is like a trial. Shamans often go through a strange illness before being called. I still think if the disease was viewed differently and supported differently then those thoughts wouldn't persist. I don't think it's purely biological. Maybe if the first time we ever had suicidal thoughts we got proper support, treatment, encouragement, and a positive way to use our strengths to help society then they wouldn't reoccur. If it is so maladaptive why do so many people say they wouldn't get rid of their bipolar disorder if they had a chance. There is something beautifully raw about the extremes we experience compared to others. It fuels creativity and genius in many cases. So, idk. I get your argument and I don't believe there is anything morally wrong with suicide. Here's what someone shared in my DBT group after a member committed suicide this year: \"If you jump out of a burning building, no one can fault you for your choice. Suicide gives a hopeless person just enough hope to make it home, back to god. But we're here to learn how to put out the fire, not to just jump out the window.\"  So, maybe the horrible pain of depression could fuel our fight to learn more than we would have without it. There are a lot of other negative emotions too: anger, guilt, annoyance, etc. They have a purpose. To help us avoid things. When I realized how depressed I felt after drinking, I quit drinking.

My memory and perception is so fucked up that I honestly just think I'm always angry and depressed. But tracking my moods proves differently. Reading back through years and years of journals as an observer of my behavior was mind blowing. I didn't think I was ever happy, but there were lots of manic entries where I thought I was destined to be a super hero with my special powers. Or that I understood the world and everyone better than others. There were also these weird delusional relationships with men I was crushing on.

I was extreme even amongst our group of friends who all prided ourselves on drinking more than others. I think that's why I clung to them. My insane behavior was more often seen as amusing rather than disturbing to a room full of binge drinkers. I agree with others above that if 3 different doctors suggest it, it's most likely pretty obvious. I don't think there's anything to gain by denying the diagnosis. My life only got harder, not easier. I waited way too long to believe I really needed help, until I was at my breaking point and desperate. So, I think a diagnosis is powerful. Knowledge can help you better understand and manage the disorder. I've learned so much about myself in this last month. I regret not slowing down to figure this shit out 20 years ago. Live and learn I suppose. Good luck on your journey of discovery.", "link_id": "t3_700cs1", "time": 1505441509}}

Recently I reconnected with an old friend who lives in another state but it's still been nice to talk to someone about what's been going on.

{"dmz5tlb": {"text": "I completely understand your argument. Still I think the argument lies in societal maladaptions not biological ones. I do not think that suicidal ideation is evolutionarily based any more than the Holocaust was. That's called eugenics not evolution. I guess I would agree that we are not well adapted to current society but does that really suggest a need to weed us out of the herd? Let's see. Chihuahua's are not well adapted to live in cold climates but given the right supports by living with humans in warm buildings they can survive and thrive there. I think mentally ill people are just not given the right supports much of the time. 1/4 of dalmatians are born without normal hearing. As a result responsible breeders try to breed out the issue, but they don't kill the deaf ones. So, I challenge you that even if you think suicidal ideation means that you are not evolutionarily worthy, then go ahead and don't procreate. But it doesn't mean you have to off yourself. Perhaps, just like the chihuahua that lives in MN has to be cared for by humans in order to survive, you're in the hospital being cared for by humans in order to survive your societal maladaption.", "link_id": "t3_6zq8t0", "time": 1505353304}}

{"dmxp1xz": {"text": "Hitchhiking alone at night in Mexico in search of parties. 1st night I ended up sleeping on the dirt floor of a meth house surrounded by unknown men. 2nd time I ended up smoking meth (first and only time) and having sex (most likely without a condom) with an unknown man in an unknown empty house in an unknown area of town. 3rd time I ended up partying with same unknown man I had had sex with, now thinking we're friends or something. He had stolen a truck to drive me out to an empty beach to smoke weed, but I wasn't into smoking. When we ran out of gas, he stole my camera and abandoned me. So, I went back to the meth house with the dirt floor. I don't necessarily regret the experience as luckily I came out of it unharmed except for the lost camera.

There are scenes where you can physically see the difference when the person is manic vs. another scene when they are depressed and slowed down.

Now I have to keep working to pay off my debt. That was dumb. But a lot of people have debt and it doesn't bother them. My vet, chiropractor, doctor friends are all still in debt well over 100K. They say they will be in debt their whole lives but yet they own their own homes, drive reliable cars, have toys, go on vacation, etc. They are living the dream. The debt doesn't hinder them. Not that I'm encouraging you to never worry about your debt but I'm just saying from a state of mind they are a lot happier than I am. So, my thought is maybe it really has nothing to do with my debt but the fact that I feel trapped and hindered. The fact that I can't seem to get my shit together period. My debt is my excuse but it probably isn't the real cause. The real problem is that I have bipolar disorder and it's hard to deal with life in general.

I hope my new one is more present. 4) A well structured DBT class was really helpful for me, probably the most helpful thing! I like the explicit lessons, homework, and follow up discussion. Really focuses on building practical life skills in emotion regulation, mindfulness, self-soothing, communication, and relationships which are all things I wasn't really taught growing up.5) I would encourage you to be completely honest with your tdoc and pdoc about everything even how you are feeling about them.
