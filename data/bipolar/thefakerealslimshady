However, I've only been on it for 2 or so months. I also seem to be handling work and school quite a bit better.

The disorder is also degenerative and progressive so certain structural abnormalities only develop as the disorder progresses and wouldn't allow early intervention.

Some are also misdiagnosed. But true bipolar is very debilitating and you are very under educated on this. Mania and hypomania are not just waking up happy and confident like the average person- they are extreme and cause decisions that can destroy a person's life. The depressions are very bad. And I have almost killed myself before in a low only to enter an up and completely love my life.... so it's not just unsuccessful people with an awful life.... That's your own opinion you're applying to everyone else. Also it is estimated 1-4% of the world population has a bipolar diagnosis so it's not everyone on Earth has the disorder.  It doesn't have the broadest range of symptoms of any disorder at all. It has very specific symptomatology  and you must show significant impairment and significant cycling to be diagnosed. I almost killed myself 2x and it took 7 years before I was diagnosed. According to research this is typical- 7 to 10 years and 2 misdiagnoses before a patient is diagnosed so they don't give these diagnoses lightly.

{"fmc8yzp": {"text": "For lamictal, it took any hypomania away completely. If anything I was slightly depressed all the time.  When I started taking the first antidepressant (zoloft), a lot was going on and I was severely depressed. After taking it, I remember it fairly quickly turning my depressed, low energy state into an angry, irritable, hyperactive, impulsive state where I had lots of energy but also was suicidal etc. I didn't think much of it at the time because so much was going on but, having learned about mixed episodes this year after getting diagnosed, it kind of fits. However, I wasn't on zoloft for long because as soon as I was hospitalized about 2 weeks later, they took me off it.  The other 6 or 7 weeks on venlafaxine was more recent. In hindsight, my perception of the main problem was that the hypomanic periods were longer than usual although they were also slightly worse. Problem was I didn't recognize that I was hypomanic- I just thought the antidepressant was working as normal.  My usual pattern that I seem to have when unmediated, which I know from mood tracking, is 3 or 4 weeks of lower mood followed by 5 days of elevated mood maybe 1 or 2 or 3 days of which are hypomanic. The more depressed I am, the higher the high moods. Usually this just means I'm much more productive when hypo. Sometimes it means I'm all over the place and focusing on weird nonsensical goals. But it only lasts a 1-3 days so I don't get into much trouble before going down again. On the venlafaxine, it seemed like it switched so that I was in a hypomanic state for 3 or 4 weeks and then depressed for 5 days. It's hard for me to say because I don't fully recollect and because I thought I was just better while I was going through it. Unfortunately, as a result, my behavior and choices were really not good.

My tips for what I do: 1) pick the easiest workout you think you can probably accomplish. If it is run for 1 minute, do that. Or look up a 5 minute core workout routine. Do it while watching tv. Start small and slowly increase. 2) Find a sport that is fun for you so it feels less like work. I climb with someone who gets my depression, sometimes I cry a bit at gym. But I love climbing so it feels exhilarating and fun and not like work. I usually leave with more confidence. 3) Do rhythmic activities and focus on the rhythm. I use running and ski touring. Get some music in and run to the beat until you're tired. Focus on slow rhythms while running at first so you dont burn out but listen to pump up music. I also like to tell myself I'm hardcore and awesome while I do this to further counteract my depression. I view the exercise as taking time for self care. Sorry if this doesnt work for you. Keep looking for answers. Know you arent weak, its very hard to deal with depression let alone also push yourself to exhaustion working out. If you havent already, it may be good to mood track. If you have any non depressed periods, try to exercise during those too. Good luck.", "link_id": "t3_f6ih0q", "time": 1582209508}}

{"fhijfe7": {"text": "I have a family history and my parents were mainly the ones going \"I think something is wrong here.\" That and every person I've ever dated also thought something was wrong. In hindsight, I've been in denial for a while thinking some ridiculous behavior (not wanting to get out of bed at all for days, getting 1 hour of sleep every night for 3 days in a row because you can't stop doing things) is normal but I guess my brain's reality is the only reality I know so I, rightly or wrongly, assumed I was normal/the same as everyone but just couldn't handle my shit as well. I also have this side worry about being a hypochondriac/self diagnosing. I tried to jump off a building in 2013 and the doctor at hospitalization said I think you might have bipolar disorder. He prescribed me lithium and it really helped. I then went to an outpatient program, lithium was discontinued for physical side effects (almost daily nausea for the first 2 months and vomiting, excessive thirst and urination), and eventually (\\~1 year later) my bipolar diagnosis was rescinded. I was put on an antidepressant a few years later, and became very erratic, reckless, and hypersexual. I also stopped sleeping and had tons of energy. I stopped taking the antidepressant suddenly and cold turkey because I couldn't orgasm (bad when you're hypersexual) and crashed. I didn't understand what happened to me or why I acted like I had because, for some reason, it didn't occur to me I was hypomanic at the time so I blamed myself for losing control, stopped going to treatment because I was \"scared of the medicated me,\" and tried to \"get my act together\" on my own. Obviously, that really didn't work. I then started seeing a therapist who was concerned about how suicidal I was originally so she started to see me 2 or 3 times a week for a three month period until I stabilized. She then saw first hand my mood changes and went with me to see a psychiatrist. Since I trust her and the psychiatrists expertise, that helped me accept things. In hindsight, I admit my behavior has been kind of off for many years and this diagnosis kind of fits pretty well.

I am probably more understanding and sympathetic of people being late, making mistakes, or struggling because I get that piece and I'm less black and white about situations than many people I know. There are virtually no absolutes in my world.2. Being suicidal a bunch of times means that I have a different perspective on life and death so I approach my life differently than most. Sometimes I feel it's somewhat a unique gift that I've chosen to live again and again. I think for many people, life is just a given  after their birth, but it's somehow interesting to know I had a potential way out and instead I made the conscious choice again and again to continue to persist.3. I am a lot more ambitious and a lot more intense because of it. In my hypomania, I am able to manage a lot academically. Unfortunately that didn't pan out in university, with fixed deadlines getting missed due to depressions (which I have a lot more of), but in a flex deadline high school program I was top in my high school. I wouldn't have felt inspired to achieve that or been capable of achieving that without the hypomania to make up for my depressive episodes. In hypomania, I can do these amazing exercise feats and my overconfidence helps me to push myself way out of my comfort zone, applying for things, and going for things I wouldn't usually feel confident enough to go for. I then feel more confident and capable when I'm stable because of the successes. When I am hypomanic, I dream big- like I believe I can be a top doctor or a famous author etc... And it pushes me to want more than just a \"normal\" life for myself when I am stable. Depression, on the other hand, I think has helped me clarify what I want out of life and focus on introspection. It gives me the time and self awareness to develop as a person and clarify the things I really care about which I then attack with intensity when I'm stable. I therefore think I'm much more high achieving and I expect more from my life but I'm also more introspective and intense because of the highs and lows.4. Lastly, before I was diagnosed, I use to exercise to try and self manage my moods. I wasn't aware of the big picture at the time because I didn't even know I was different than other people. I thought I was just bad at managing life and needed a rest and so I could go hard in short spurts. I knew exercise helped me manage life better and so I felt I needed to do it. Now I am physically much healthier today than I would have been without constantly exercising and eating healthy, which I had been doing for years in an effort to self-treat my un-diagnosed bipolar.5. Exercising while trying to escape the pain of depression and trying to burn off energy during hypomania also led me into my current passions of skiing, hiking, mountaineering etc. which I would be lost without today.Edit: spelling and wording!", "link_id": "t3_f33vy0", "time": 1581616668}}

{"fdfxq5q": {"text": "I feel like so much went into the decision, it's hard to explain. I got diagnosed originally in hospital after suicide consideration (almost jumped off a building but didn't) combined with my symptoms and my family history. After I left hospitalization, the after care program seemed kind of reluctant to diagnose me officially with BP2 I think partially because I am younger, the lows are severe but my highs are not very pronounced (similar to other members of my family who have diagnosed bipolar 2), and I was having significant trouble with college and they felt that depression/suicidality was because I wasn't suited for college verses mental health issues. Despite the reluctance to diagnose me, I was put on mood stabilizers and anti-psychotics. I found every mood stabilize I tried didnt really get rid of the down feelings I was having completely. Instead of really really bad lows with some minor short highs mixed in (highs which I admittedly really enjoy), I just felt blah and uninspired and kind of sad/low energy all the time. I also was seeing a proscriber that didn't really listen to me. For example, she put me on seroquel and I didn't like it all at. I could only see her once every 3 or 4 weeks and after 2 appointments of her dismissing my concerns and upping the dosage, I decided I would stop taking the seroquel on my own. This also happened shortly after with a bunch of other medications, including latuda, as well earning me the moniker of \"med non compliant patient\". She also wouldn't justify any medications she wanted to put me on to me or explain what she was thinking so I felt kind of in the dark. I researched meds for a month and made a list and asked to try vyvanse or abilify because I was having trouble focusing on school and they were second line ADD treatments plus I found some testimonials where people said they felt semi depressed all the time on mood stabilizers and vyvanse helped.  I was then put on abilify, which I liked because it helped my thoughts be focused when I was depressed instead of constant rumination on unhelpful things and also helped stop some minor paranoia I was having, but it still left me feeling emotionally depressed. She then left for a new part of the country and was replaced by a new psychiatrist, who I liked but who was thinking I had depression instead. I was taken off the mood stabilizer and switched to wellbutrin for awhile which I felt didn't really do anything. I was then put on effexor instead and no mood stabilizer and was not followed up with at all for weeks. I think I became what everyone around me would describe as hypomanic- speeding excessively in my car to the point I would have gotten arrested if caught, excessively confident/sexual/outgoing, speaking without a filter, ended a 7 year relationship on somewhat of a whim, started 3 new sexual relationships (and one that was somewhat high risk) immediately after though I am a fairly conservative individual, threw away an entire university semester by not going to school and deciding not to do assignments suddenly when I previously had 80 to 90% in every class. I stopped taking effexor 1 month in because I couldn't orgasm which was frustrating at the time because I could not stop thinking about sex and being sexual and I assumed abandoning school and my former monogamous, low risk self had led me to now become a happy and free individual cured of my former depressing life. After I stopped taking effexor, I had a day or two of sweating and then became devastated over my relationship ending, my school semester, and the life I had lived for a month to the point that I had a breakdown culminating in drinking a bottle of 35% proof alcohol and calling my best friend while vomiting and blacking out and apparently crying on the phone while saying I wanted to die though I have zero recollection of this because of said alcohol. She lives a full days drive away so she sent her mum to my house and my dad also came home concerned. Everyone said \"you need help\" to me.... I felt really dysfunctional and out of control and this lead me to conclude maybe I was worse off on meds because I couldnt control myself. I straightened up shortly after that with sheer willpower and with the help of my profs and some lucky extensions. I finished my semester and worked full time over the summer with moderate success though I was late for work a few times because I was having a hard time leaving bed in the mornings. The depression definitely made it hard some days but my work was also outdoors and very physically active which I think helped. I went to see the psychiatrist and psychologist a few months later and they both said that my behavior on effexor was normal i.e. that people outgrow old relationships and then rebound all the time. I let them talk me into it. The psychiatrist then said \"what do you want from me?\" I said, \"I don't know. I'm kind of scared to take meds.\" And he was like \"well okay. I agree you might not need meds. Lets see how not taking meds goes. Come in if you need help.\" Then I met with my psychologist another time in an appointment where I said I was still sometimes suicidal. Psychologist asked if I had a plan and I detailed my ideal way to die (which was somewhat impractical to be fair because the supplies would have been difficult to source) and he said he was relived and to come in in 3 weeks again. 3 weeks later, another appointment and no suicide was mentioned and we talked about sleep. I said sometimes I sleep 15 hours and I find it hard to stay awake- even if I get out of bed on time I then nap or fall asleep. He essentially said I needed more willpower to keep a sleep routine. I said I didn't think it was willpower because some days I only needed 1 or 2 hours of sleep and I didnt feel tired at all. He again said if I got a regular sleep routine it wouldnt happen. That was my last appointment- I felt I was wasting my time, these people didnt really understand my issues, and my issues probably aren\u2019t that severe or else they'd act more concerned. Fast forward, Sept 2019 I entered part time work and a really hard uni semester unmedicated and start getting severe mood swings from the stress and slowly started to self-neglect (more fast food, lack of sunlight and exercise, lack of sleep due to school work and work work). School and work both got overly stressful suddenly  and it spiraled out of control. At my peak, I slept 2.5 hrs one weekend in total and didn't feel tired allowing me to finish an entire neuro presentation in 20 hours that I presented the following Monday morning on only 2.5hrs of sleep for 2 days for an entire class. I also worked my job for 6 hours and cleaned my entire house all in that 2 day time span. At my worst, I bought all the supplies to kill myself and came close to going through with it multiple times with each time getting a little bit closer. I decided if I didn't get help, I was probably going to try to end my life fairly soon as I was slowly working up the courage and becoming increasingly convinced it was an option worth trying. I e-chatted the distress center in my area and asked them for a counseling recommendation. They recommended a place where master's students do their practicum and I was paired up with one such student. I filled out an intake form and, by the grace of God, I got in the next day and started seeing this counselor who I think is incredible. Bit by bit she helped me open up and also saw me 3 times a week for a few weeks and noticed mood swings as well. Now she's helping me to go see a different psychiatrist again because she thinks I need medication. I trust her and I think she's right but it's a big step and I'm scared. I'm trying to come to accept medication is what I for sure want before my psychiatry appointment in 2 weeks.

Eventually I was at the point of sobbing in the first appointment because I wanted to tell her everything but felt I couldn't because I did not want to be hospitalized. I told her this and she said she was willing to make me an agreement if I could promise I was not an immediate threat (14 days) to myself. I decided I could stay alive for 14 more days and so we decided to make an agreement that by me reaching out and committing to regular counseling, I would demonstrate I was not an imminent risk. I also signed an agreement/treatment plan with my counselor to commit to not touching my supplies or harming myself for the next 14 days (My counselor has also been seeing me biweekly for appointments which I know I'm very, very lucky to have). This is the first time I've had this arrangement. I almost jumped off a building a few years ago and was hospitalized for two weeks as soon as I was talked down. My experience was very unpleasant and I found it almost impossible to get let out which really frightened me. I felt like I had lost all of my rights. After that it was the opposite. Every counselo I saw told me they were relieved I told them I was suicidal or brushed off any thoughts of suicide. I then decided not to take my thoughts seriously and stopped counseling for the last year, until last month when I got the supplies, arranged them, and was trying to work up the courage to go through with it. I decided I needed to get help or I was probably going to do it.  My new counselor's approach is really helping me with the agreement that allows me to talk completely openly without fear of hospitalization. Idk if perhaps this suggestion might work for you?

{"fag55ec": {"text": "Some more details: \\*TRIGGER WARNING MENTIONS OF SELF HARM BELOW\\*I was able to be mostly stable this summer unmedicated by taking time off work and university and by spending 60%-80% of my week living and sleeping outside in the mountains. I also hiked 70km/week and took up trail running on top of that. I also ate very healthy. My suicidal thoughts went away for an extended period of time for the first time in years as well this summer. I went back to uni in september and started losing sleep. I stopped exercising completely mid October. I'm really really stressed out. I spend all of my time indoors trying to study and where I live, it is very dark at this time of year. I bought supplies and almost killed myself in October but was too scared. I repeated this in November and then was fortunate enough to get into counseling. A bipolar 2 diagnosis was considered a few years ago but I was really depressed on just mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. I also had problems with med compliance on the antipsychotics and both my psychiatrists ended up rescinding my bipolar diagnosis and telling me it was just university and that I wasnt into school (possible true for sure). Last med I took was an antidepressant (effexor) about 2 years ago. I think I got hypomanic- (sped fast enough I would have gotten arrested if caught, ended 7 year relationship mid uni semester, started 2 sexting and 1 casual sex relationship 5 days after ending 7 year, stopped going to school for 1 month and stopped handing assignments in because I felt smart on the antidepressant.). I stopped taking it because I couldnt orgasm and crashed really hard feeling sad about school, relationship and uninterested in any of the flings. I also tried to drink a whole bottle of 35% proof alcohol. Psychiatrist at the time told me this was normal and counselor agreed. I'm currently still seeing the wonderful counselor and she has started urging me to find a new psychiatrist because she thinks I might have bipolar 2. She has seen me for the last 4 weeks bi weekly.

{"f8d9bnf": {"text": "How are you doing? If mood is still a struggle and drugs are still a struggle I might know why. Potentially... Serotonin is an important brain chemical involved in mood regulation and MDMA causes a lot of this chemical to be released all of a sudden which is why it makes people feel good. However, when enough serotonin release happens, you also deplete your serotonin stores in your brain. This may be why you are no longer getting high and this may be why your moods feel all over the place lately. Also I don't want to scare you but regular use of MDMA (I.e. using for 4 days in a row) can damage the nerve cells in your brain. Some may come back but it will take years. It also messes up gene expression and affects the expression of serotonin transporters that allow serotonin molecules to basically be recycled in your brain.  If the drugs are still a struggle I think you should talk to someone about getting off them as soon as you can. I get that you need them to feel less bad but I'm also worried you're making your bad feelings worse long term because of it. I think you should go see a counselor that understands drugs and the brain (psychiatrist perhaps? someone with a med school degree?). I know it's going to be tough but I think it will help. I also would urge you to ask your parents for help.  Great job on your message to the suicide hotline awhile ago. Keep trying to get help. Don't give up.

{"f44t69x": {"text": "Commonly suicidal person here. Suicide hotlines notoriously have sucked for me so don't get discouraged by that. I would say it's pretty fair to say you have severe depression. It is what it is. Don't question whether you are faking- you are suffering, you do deserve help and support. I dealt with minor depression on and off since I was 13. I'm 25 now and it's been a long awful road, however, I'm better off now than I was at 13 in terms of managing my life. No question. And I haven't killed myself yet and I don't regret that. I just keep trying to do a bit better everyday. I fail all the time but the point is to keep trying different things till you find what works.  Here is what has helped me so far:  1) Exercise- specifically running outside. There are good youtube vids and apps with workouts in them using body weights that you can just do at home on your own if you are self conscious about starting out in public. Also don't be afraid to walk on your runs or be slow. I've seen lots of people running really really slowly around the block and they just keep at it and get better so just do what you can and be like those people and don't give a damn. My depression is not as bad as yours but I've been suicidal and I have self harmed (much less than you and much more minor though) and hiking/running/exercise helps me. If you stick with it for 5 months you can see improvement and you'll feel good. 3x/week or less even is enough- just do as much as you can. 2) Stop the drugs. Molly especially will mess with your brain and deplete your neurotransmitters making it harder and harder to become un-depressed. See someone to help you if you can't get off the drugs on your own but get off the drugs. I have one alcoholic drink maybe once every two months now and maybe take a tiny hit of weed but I try to avoid all drugs as much as possible. I was never on hard drugs but I was a borderline alcoholic for a few months.  3) Talk to people- talk to a doctor about your depression, join a hobby club or team or do something fun while sober to connect with people. Take a fun class or something in something you are interested in. It sucks pretending to be happy and forcing yourself to interact but you'll feel good connecting to people in the long run. My parents have been a great resource even though it took them a bit to get there. If you think your parents will be helpful, I encourage you to reach out to them too. 4) Exercise a bit, sleep, eat healthy, and do something you enjoy (for me it's hiking or skiing) and every time you do it say to yourself something similar to \"I love my body and deserve to treat my body well. I deserve to take care of my well-being and wellness and love myself.\" Like self harm, exercise is painful and so is eating healthy sometimes, but the pain of exercise is designed to make you stronger and to care for You. I self harmed to ground myself, to distract myself from my emotional pain with tangible physical pain but I stopped after one day when I realized self harm was literally me hurting myself even more to manage my pain. I was just adding more pain to my already unmanageable pain. Reframing it as I'm just hurting myself more to try to get better when what I really want is for my overall hurt to decrease not increase. That somehow helped me to stop.   5) Take Vit D, Vit B complex especially B12. I hope this may help. I'm still learning and I'm still a work in progress but this is what I've learned since I was 17 right here. It wont be easy. I've learned it's gonna suck a lot for a long time, but if you hang on and keep trying, by the time you're 25 it wont be perfect but it will be way better and you will be coping way better.", "link_id": "t3_dj64ph", "time": 1571358370}}

{"emdko76": {"text": "As someone who has broken a leg and an arm very badly and who has also suffered from depression for years, I'd re-break both limbs 100x over to never be depressed again. I ski and I'm fairly active so it's not that those injuries didn't suck for me or didn't impair me but they are absolutely nothing like depression. It's not something people can truly appreciate I think until it happens to them. It sucks more than anything I've ever experienced and is extremely debilitating to the point I've fought with it for years and it has made me want to end my own life more than once.I agree succumbing to depression is maybe intentionally self destructive but that also isn't anywhere near comparable to a broken limb. For my limb I went to get an x-ray, I got a cast and then I worked out and did physiotherapy to heal- obvious solution and obvious diagnosis and cure. Depression is nowhere near that simple. I've been on a broad range of awful and ineffective drugs. They have broad mechanisms of action on the brain and none of them really helped. Therapy is mediocre. It takes a while to inact, isn't super effective, and zero diagnostic tools other than observation and self report make it frustrating to no end. Also no one reaches out to help when you're depressed. Everyone runs away and there is zero sympathy if it impacts your work or school or life in my experience, which is substantially opposite to a broken leg where people extend sympathy to the point you have to tell them you don't need it.  I have a very hard time getting extensions on assignments for my brain disease that effects my thinking but with a broken arm it was never a problem.**TLDR** Depression is way way harder to push through and this is coming from someone who has actually skied and walked on a fully broken leg.Edit: I should say \"tried\" to walk on. I used ski poles to hobble on it but even trying to walk on a fully broken leg doesn't work- I was in tears and got stretchered away eventually. In fact pretending my leg was not broken and I deserved no sympathy would have been counter productive in the same way pretending mine and other people's depression isn't debilitating for them. It invalidates them and is completely counter productive in the long run cause you're wasting time pretending a problem that is clearly there is not actually there when you could just start helping them address the issue instead by giving them encouragement and sympathy for support.", "link_id": "t3_bjhgd4", "time": 1556851706}}
