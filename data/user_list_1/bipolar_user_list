WillMakeItWork [info] I'm part of the Feb2019 bumpers on my other account and I love that we are all progressing together. I dont think I've ever posted anything there though, so maybe I should!This week made me realize that there is something definitely wrong and that I should be working on fixing it. I was diagnosed with bipolarism when I was in high school, but my mom is very anti-big-pharma, pro-essential-oils and the bible and she denied me meds. I have had to deal with everything on my own and it's been a struggle, but maybe it shouldn't be. I'll start looking into doctors here soon that can help. My supervisor recommended one a while back so I'll have to ask him again.Thank you! [info] None [info] 1540592373 [info] test

thegreenlentil [info] It's not good for her to just decide to stop taking her meds. In general I'd say that's never a good move for psych meds. She should talk to her doctor and see if she can get on different ones or change the dosage. I was diagnosed with bipolar II a year ago and I only found the right meds a couple months ago. I would suggest gently asking her about her meds and why exactly she decided to stop taking them. Emphasize your concern when talking to her, above all. See if you can convince her that it's a good idea to check with her doctor. Try not to get angry or accusatory, that will do more harm than good. You seem like a good person and I wish you and her the best of luck. [info] Bipolar II [info] 1367203747 [info] test
bennyearl [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar a few months ago.  I am still coping with the diagnosis but am coming to the conclusion that I need to move on with my life as a bipolar person and not let life pass me by.  During my depressive states I just want to sleep and fast forward the clock but during my manic states (like now) I wish time would stop.  I guess I will let time just keep moving and try to enjoy the ride. [info] Bipolar Type 2 [info] 1303165126 [info] test
stellaeilatan [info] Seconded. I went through the exact same (I was the irrationally angry one) with an old boyfriend and he broke up with me because of my irrational mood swings. This was my wake up call and immediately sought counseling; I was diagnosed with bipolar (mixed) disorder and major depressive disorder in 2006 and have been on medication ever since. I am now in a happy, healthy long-term relationship.I must warn you that telling her outright to seek counseling may seem like an attack, so OP you may need to get creative. Your situation breaks my heart, best of luck to you. [info] None [info] 1339402414 [info] test
JessierysTargaryen [info] Battling Bipolar II &amp; Genetic Disease Hi guys,A few years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, a year or two after that, after years of misdiagnosis, I was diagnosed with Hydradenitis Supprativa. For bipolar disorder: I tried medication, talking to a psychologist and coping mechanisms. Nothing worked for me, except exercise. I love playing sports or working out, it feels great ... there's only one downside... My HS.Hydradenitis Supprativa is a genetic autoimmune disorder that's currently incurable despite it being around for centuries. I tried medication, laser hair removal, oral antibiotics, no shaving, eventually figuring out that my disease has flare ups when I have dairy. It's harder to avoid than most people think. Eating out and foods that aren't raw always have some sort of dairy I need to watch out for. Powders, whey, cream, milk, yogurt, kefir, cheese, etc. Anyway, sometimes some miniscule dairy slips into my body and I end up with a lump(s) on my groin. This makes exercise impossible because of the pain; usually takes 6 weeks for the swelling to go down or I end up with surgery without anesthesia (30 mins is not long enough to put me under according to the anesthesiologist). Not being able to exercise is worsening my bipolar II, because it's the only coping mechanism that works for me. Those surgeries also have a strong impact on my mental sanity, it's like I lose a little piece of myself and my hopes and dreams seem insignificant and I wonder why continue on. I don't know where I'm going with this post honestly... I'm just hoping that I'm not alone... Hoping there will be a cure in my lifetime. Maybe I'm not the only one out there fighting a battle on two fronts. I know I could have it worse, but it's hard to be grateful when I'm suffering. Is anyone else in a similar situation?

JE_Jack [info] too redpilled to care anymore. how do I get motivation back? I think I've swallowed too many redpills and now have no motivation to chase girls in any way. The ladies here (NZ) are also not attractive at all - it's a fat and slutty nation. Add in STD's, pregnancy risk/child support, hypergamy, AWALT, false rape accusations.... Why the fuck bother with all that risk, as well as all the emotional drama and shit testing bullshit? For what... some sex and company with someone who will probably just leave me for someone with higher SMV, and never loved me for who I am in the first place? I guess I've been infected with a MGTOW mindset far too young (22) before experiencing the world for myself. Sex has been basically handed to me in the past, too easy, and disappointing honestly. But now I'm on a long dry streak because I burned bridges and never bothered to try and get laid again.I don't feel like doing anything at all. It feels like I have to force myself even to do basic shit. All I have been doing this year is lifting and fapping, gaming and sleeping. I keep trying to quit the porn, masturbation and gaming but keep relapsing... I know I should also be studying and developing skills for a career but I just don't seem to care enough. I also have no idea how to make and keep proper friends.Just bored of life. I do nothing yet it's exhausting. I hate feeling like this. I'm diagnosed with bipolar I and now that I look back I've actually always been like this since i started PMO and video game addiction. The opposite of addiction is connection, right? Well I can't seem to connect to anyone or anything, I have no friends, close family, or passions. If I didn't exist nothing would change, it's like nothing matters to me and I don't matter at all.I really want to live a better life because I'm sick of this. But it's just so frustrating not having any energy to start taking action and seriously making improvements. If it matters, I think I have a solid baseline to work with, being white, tall (6"2), handsome (girls have ALWAYS crushed on me), fit (with a bit lower bf% I'd have the brad pitt in fight club body), and smart (\~130 IQ). Apart from all that it's like I'm starting from scratch in every other area - shitty social skills, no game, no job experience etc. [info] None [info] 1557578135 [info] test
JeffRulesYou [info] Well, unfortunately before I got diagnosed when I was going through my "episodes" I did a lot of uncharacteristic things and hurt a lot of people (not intentionally) I was just very unstable at the time and not myself, but my family and friends didn't know I was ill and blamed a lot of my faults on bad behavior and personality.  This was before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  As I've gotten older people have used my disorder against me for either (a) things I can't remember doing in the past or (b) any sort of emotion/decision I make in the present.  My disorder is always mentioned in those regards.  I try not to get upset, because I know they mean well, but it is very frustrating and upsetting to be reminded of it.  It's hard to find a balance of the two without either party getting upset with one another.  Also, not everyone is truly going to understand.  So, you have to be as honest as possible with your loved ones on how you feel when they try and do that to you.  Also, I forgot to mention if you're doing well and are stable than they have absolutely no right using it against you.   [info] None [info] 1470331671 [info] test
Seouldier12 [info] I need to get out of my PhD program as quickly as possible. I am starting my fifth and final year as a PhD student in engineering. I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder about 9 months and am fairly certain that I cannot complete what remains for me to be able to graduate. Things have gotten to the point where every single email from my advisor or another labmate sends me into a panic attack. I don't know that it's really worth going into all the detail to explain why exactly, just that he keeps giving me more and more to do in less and less time with almost no feedback other than vague things like "this needs work".Again, I feel very strongly that I cannot continue. I have mentioned this to him several times, and the changes he enacts to keep my workload at a reasonable level only last days to at most three weeks, and then it's back to the intense stress and expectations.I have been anticipating graduating in December, but honestly I don't think I can make it through January, let alone another 10-11 months. I intend to speak with a department graduate advisor to determine if and how quickly I can leave with a Master's, but I'm not sure if that's possible or if I could even last out this whole upcoming semester. What advice can you give me for negotiating with him and the department to be able to leave as quickly and beneficially as possible? [info] None [info] 1514835761 [info] test
Moonbaby313 [info] Well I was diagnosed with bipolar after a break down. I pushed everyone out of my life and then mentally I just...snapped. When I reached out for help and I was diagnosed it kinda mind-screwed me. I went from this sense of superiority and feeling like I wasn't getting what I deserved to feeling like something was wrong with me. Now I guess Im scared to deal with people because I don't know which part is actually me. So it's easier to just keep my distance I guess. I am in therapy and I do have 2 people in my life who know my diagnosis. They are very supportive so I've learned not to take them for granted. because the self inflated ego was part of the mania, it's easier to identify and not get caught up in. In some ways I'm more relatable...but now I don't feel comfortable letting people get close to me. Such is life. [info] None [info] 1516921615 [info] test

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD in February and it’s been really rough trying to get through this. I really want to be with someone that will support me, like me for who I am, and push me to be the best version of me. I want to start with just chatting and see where things go.

Mgerbz [info] I (22F) have realized that I am the toxic one in my relationship &amp; don’t know how to control my emotions. How do I stop being a crazy girlfriend? My boyfriend (25M) &amp;amp; I have been together for over a year now. We got off to a bit of a rocky start because he still talked to his ex the first 6 months of our relationship. He hid it from me, lied to me about multiple things involving their relationship, &amp;amp; refused to tell her he had a girlfriend. This hurt me very deep &amp;amp; caused a lot of problems in our relationship. Finally back in September &amp;amp; told him that if he didn’t at least tell her he had a girlfriend, I would break up with him. After a lot of arguing, he finally agreed &amp;amp; to my knowledge, that is the last time they spoke. Since then, we don’t fight hardly at all, &amp;amp; we have a very loving relationship.I never got over the pain I felt from the situation with his ex. Its a soft spot for me &amp;amp; we don’t talk about it anymore bc I always get very angry &amp;amp; emotional towards him. He has apologized many times &amp;amp; tries his hardest to make sure I know he loves only me. But I can’t get over it.This all came to a tipping point last night, which is the reason i’m writing this post. We were out at a bar with my brother, sister-in-law &amp;amp; some of their friends. One of their friends came over to my boyfriend &amp;amp; told him that he recognized him from being friends with his ex. Something about hearing her name &amp;amp; hearing them talk about her flipped a switch in my brain &amp;amp; I became a completely different person. I got so angry &amp;amp; full of rage. I was already kinda drunk at this point but I immediately just started knocking back drinks to try to calm myself down. Bad idea.I remember bits &amp;amp; pieces of it but it felt like it wasn’t me, like I was watching it happen &amp;amp; I couldn’t control myself. I refused to talk to my bf, kept leaving the bar &amp;amp; running away. At one point I punched a telephone pole &amp;amp; fractured a bone in my hand. I called my mom &amp;amp; screamed at her, saying if she didn’t come pick me up from the city we were in (2 hours from her house) that I would never talk to her again. I was swearing at her &amp;amp; saying very mean things bc she didn’t wanna drive 2 hours in the middle of the night to get me. At one point I went off on the dude who knows my bf’s ex &amp;amp; tried to make him give me her phone number so I could call her. I yelled at my brother for staying with my bf &amp;amp; not being mad at him too. But the worst part, &amp;amp; the part I am most ashamed for, was at one point my bf was trying to talk to me &amp;amp; calm me down &amp;amp; I shoved him. I then took his phone &amp;amp; tried to smash it on the ground (luckily he has an otterbox case). I can’t believe I reacted so harshly &amp;amp; physically. Though i didn’t physically hurt him, I believe that if you don’t want a man to put his hands on you, you shouldn’t put ur hands on them. I would never thought myself able to be so angry for something so small.Last night scared the living shit out of me. Luckily my bf is a saint &amp;amp; didn’t break up with me, but I feel like I don’t deserve for him to stay. I’m so embarrassed &amp;amp; I feel so guilty for the way I treated him. This isn’t me &amp;amp; I don’t know why I lost myself so bad. I’ve apologized to him multiple times, I didn’t justify any of my actions, &amp;amp; I let him be angry with me bc he has every right to be. But I know I fucked up really bad &amp;amp; hurt him &amp;amp; I don’t know what to do. I wanna be the best girlfriend he’s ever had &amp;amp; make him happy, but I can’t let go of the pain he caused me when we first started dating, &amp;amp; i’m taking it out on him in a very unhealthy way.I know very well this is toxic behavior &amp;amp; feel like the biggest piece of shit. This is a very new feeling for me. I was diagnosed with bipolar about a year ago &amp; it has been something i’ve worked very hard on trying to control, I take medication, go to therapy, etc., but I feel like I’m further back then where I started with my mental health. If anyone could give me some advice on dealing with anger towards ur SO or how to stop being the toxic one in my relationship, i would greatly appreciate it.TLDR: My boyfriend’s relationship with his ex caused a lot of problems in the beginning of our relationship &amp; i’m taking it out on him in an unhealthy way.

This was before I was diagnosed with bipolar.It was a while ago, so I don't remember exactly how I felt. I was pretty depressed, but had no manic/hypomanic episodes. I ended up going off them cold turkey as I left them in the southern hemisphere by accident. There was a honeymoon period after that, but then I went "full bipolar", and started different meds. I'm back on abilify now, at a higher dose. The only side effect I've had with abilify is weight gain (in particular, it makes me hungry all the time).I hope this combo goes well for you!

yankowitch [info] I don't have bipolar as part of my identity. As a woman, I identify most strongly with my identity in relation to others. I am a wife and mother. I am Canadian. I work with computers and I'm pretty smart. These are the things that are me, help draw a picture of what I'm like. I identify myself as disabled in diversity questionnaires but that's just so I can get accommodation and treatment,  a label only in relation to the medicolegal complex.Having bipolar is interesting but so was my accident and bursitis. Both give cognitive effects, the hip condition counterintuitively can affect the brain more due to the damaged proprioception and cognitive effects of pain. Although the experience of both "builds character" I choose to frame the experience just through the lens of suffering, recovery, chronic disease management,  etc. My feelings and behaviors are part of the experience, not part of my identity. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 10 years, it never made it into my identity. I guess I just look at identity politics differently. [info] None [info] 1420393344 [info] test

Trillibub [info] I'm not attacking you, but you sure went all-out defensive.  Many bipolar people experience exactly what you listed, and those things are not generally considered functional. If you meant to say that they're functional with medication, you should realize how different that is and possibly correct it. Since you want to puff chests and bring it up, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for almost three years. I've been hospitalized and gone to support groups where I've met many like me. It's been hell, and I'm often only functional *with the right cocktail of meds.* As are many who are diagnosed.

frangipani_c [info] I'm 02/08/1981 (2nd August 1981).Completing my specialisation as an anaesthetist in Australia.  I love my job and feel blessed to be able to make a living doing something I love.Undergraduate Medical Science (Honours) degree and then my MBBS.Have had my first dog (as an adult) for nearly a year now.  He is a 2yr old staffy kelpie cross who I rescued from a shelter.  I'm so happy to have him in my life :) .I live on the opposite side of the country to my family.  I moved here with my ex and I haven't left.  Been here for 10yrs now.  I miss my family very much but we also have our issues, so sometimes the distance is good.  I speak to my mum nearly every day.  I have a strained relationship with my older sister that improved somewhat when she had my niece.  I adore my niece and am sad that I am not a part of her day-to-day life.  I have a younger brother who I speak to maybe once a week or fortnight, but when we talk, we really talk.  We understand each other very well.I am in a fairly new relationship (less than a year) with a lovely guy who really loves me and I think I am falling for him.  My main hang up is that I am still in love with my first love.  We were together from the age of 18 to 29.  We were each other's first relationship.  We were engaged to be married and inseparable.  Then I had a depressive mental breakdown in my final year of med school and became extremely self destructive.  Excessive drinking lead to black out drunk episodes which lead to an infidelity at a med school party whilst my partner was away with work.  Whilst drunk, someone I thought was my friend (who was 'looking after me whilst drunk') kissed me and I initially kissed him back.  I ended up pushing the 'friend' away once I realised what was happening and drove home drunk.  I confessed to my partner and after a time, he forgave me.  However, my self destruction just got worse as I then started to doubt that I truly loved my partner if I had put myself in a position where I was unfaithful.  Yet, I did love him, but I couldn't resolve the internal conflict of what I had done ... so I somehow convinced myself that I didn't do anything wrong.  This then led to a spiral of deceit and further infidelity, and eventually to the loss of my partner, loss of my reputation, and loss of many friends.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my manic episodes coincided with my infidelities.  I truly had no insight at the time that what I was doing was wrong.  I had days where I would barely sleep or eat but I felt incredibly energetic and daring.  I drank excessively during those episodes and didn't care what I did or who I did it with - I honestly thought I could do no wrong.  Those few months altered the course of my life catastrophically.  I managed to complete med school and have since created a new life for myself, but I now have very few friends and I'm scared to get close to people for fear of losing them.  The loss of my ex and of so many mutual friends devastated me and I just don't have the strength to go through anything like that again. I have travelled all around Australia quite a few times and have travelled overseas to New Zealand, Indonesia, Thailand, Eastern Europe, Switzerland, Spain and London.  I'm hoping to travel much more.I don't have any kids and due to the demands of my career, my creeping age, and my history of mental health disorder, I'm not sure whether I will and/or want to have children.  Being a doctor just makes me even more aware of the risks of my advancing age and of the risks of a relapse of my bipolar.  Overall I have a pretty great life.  Yet losing myself and therefore my ex will always be my life's biggest regret.  I am now a strong advocate of seeking help for mental health problems early and not buying into fear and stigma that stopping me reaching for help when I first needed it.

wannabeomniglot [info] Between my first read and my first reread, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.My entire perspective has really changed - Cersei, whom I hated, I now feel an odd kinship with. I see her arc as less ruthless and more tragic; in her I see a woman helpless against her own delusions, at the whim of her uncontrollable lust for vengeance and power and love.Arya, whom I loved unconditionally (and still do), I now see as much more pathological. I feel like in order to deal with the trauma she has endured, she has decided to be perpetually in motion, and I'm very concerned about what will happen when she stops moving forward.Depression, which is half of what I struggle with, is occasionally described as a grieving disorder. With that in mind, I have come to connect with Robert Baratheon, whom I saw as a philandering asshole completely out of touch with the reality of governance and an entirely self-centered worldview. I now see him as somewhat powerless in the only ways that matter. I am much more sympathetic to his perpetual grief now than I was before.This was probably quite influenced by the show, but I went from loving Petyr Baelish as a crafty mastermind, to being really disgusted as I watch him take advantage of the weak and the principled.

curly_hair_dont_care [info] How do you know when it’s time to go back into treatment? I was hospitalized the first time three years ago, that’s when I was diagnosed with bipolar II. Ive been in school since then in a very rigorous college program. I’m very close to finishing my third year, but I recently experienced my first mixed episode and it took a big toll on my schoolwork and my overall health. At this point, I don’t know if I should grit my teeth and try to finish out the semester or if I should withdraw from school and go back into residential treatment. I’ve relapsed with self harm and I’m very behind in my classes. There’s a possibility I could get back on track but I don’t know how to do it alone. Please help if you can.

JamestheNomad [info] Why? My now ex wife cheated on me and lied to me and ran off with my daughter. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I lost my job because i was arrested driving my drunk girlfriend home and the tire on her car blew out in the freeway. I wasn't drunk but was arrested for a dui because the cop lied and said i refused a blood test. Dealing with all the stress has kept me in a pretty depressed state lately and my gf decided she was done with dealing with me and my court stuff and broke up with me. I have no money, no job, my student loans are in default so i can't go back to school. The only reason me and my now ex gf survived was because her dad pretty much paid our rent.

DeviPotato [info] Setting the Record Straight - An Open Letter Dear Reddit Brony community,There have been rumors going around about me. That I'm some kind of psychopath, or rapist, or a murderer, or I've done something illegal, or something. I don't know the specifics, because I don't care to. All I want to say about this is that these rumors hurt, especially coming from a community I personally associate with "love" and "tolerance" and all of those elements of harmony. It especially hurts because the source of the rumors has been someone I once called a friend. Someone who I went out of my way to be there for in times of need. It hurts.I'm here to set the record straight, nothing more. So here's the story.During the first week of April, I experienced my first Manic Episode. For anyone who is unfamiliar, read up on Bipolar Disorder. Manic episodes do weird things, but ultimately it causes the person who's bipolar to act purely on urges, and be completely unfiltered, thought and reason falling to the wayside. During this week I behaved oddly, and started going by "Heavy Pie". I wasn't myself, but I thought my strange change in thought process was due to me maturing, not because of any mental issue going on. I was unaware I was bipolar, so the episode occurred in full force.On April 6th, I peaked. I hadn't been getting much sleep due to being manic (I was awake for about 48 hours) and started to hallucinate and have delusions. I hallucinated that my roommate proposed to me during a TF2 match (with Gabe Newell, "Yahtzee" of Zero Punctuation fame, and other famous people in the gaming community). As funny as that sounds, I honestly believed it to be true. I started to pursue my roommate in person, which scared him. He locked his door, and I pounded on it to get in, which scared him further. He called the police. Apparently, I wasn't "crazy enough" for them to do anything about me (I probably seemed drunk), but everyone else at the apartment left me for a while. I went into my roommate's room, drew a picture on his whiteboard, started going through his stuff--innocent wandering, though at one point I blacked out. The next thing I knew, I had stripped and was in his bed. I don't remember stripping, I just remember him coming into the room. He kicked me out of his room, I told him I loved him (remember, I hallucinated a proposal), and he kicked me out of the apartment.Again, I was acting purely on impulse with no thought in these matters. I was fully Manic for the first time in my life. I had no idea anything was wrong in my head. Now that I'm lucid, I understand these things now, and it terrifies me that I did these things. It's so unlike me, it feels like a different person did it. "Heavy Pie" is not me. I'm Devi. Not the person I became during the first week of April. And I'm definitely not the person I became from April 6.I don't really remember the next week. I have bits and pieces of it, but I was still under delusions. I ended up being picked up by my uncle, who took me somewhere to eat, where they threw me out because I wouldn't leave at closing time. Later on, I was taken to the emergency room, and later to a federal psychiatric facility for observation. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but it took me three weeks to come down from the delusions, and when I did, I was in a psychiatric facility, with practically no freedom save 30-minute breaks outside during the day. It was terrifying. I never want to go back there. However, I'm now medicated for my bipolar disorder and feeling like myself again.Near the end of my stay, I earned the right to use a computer, and the first thing I did was try to apologize to my roommate on Reddit. I wasn't completely lucid at the time, and as I came down from the delusions I continued to try to apologize with further messages. He didn't respond.When I was finally released, I discovered that my roommate had cut off all contact with me. He blocked me on Steam and Skype and presumably Reddit, and I've been afraid to contact him since then. Clearly I scared him. I was going to leave him be, hoping he'd come around.Then I found out he had made posts about what happened. Saying things that, to my knowledge, just aren't true. I repeat, I never thought to hurt my roommate. I was under the delusion of love, not violence, and any claim otherwise is simply wrong. I want to set the record straight now that I'm lucid. These rumors have caused a few other people to block me, and I'm not happy about being blocked for things that aren't true. So I'm giving my side of the story.If you have any questions, feel free to comment and ask them, or send me a message.[EDIT] Here's the other post for reference. I didn't read through the comments. I skimmed them and it hurt. But the title is false. I never tried to kill anypony. I remember April 6 the clearest out of all of my manic days--and I NEVER made a move of hostility.http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/rw86d/so_this_morning_rdj_and_his_roommates_were/[EDIT 2] I just wanted to note--I'm not trying to cause any drama here or antagonize anyone. I don't blame *anyone*--it's so easy to jump to conclusions when you can't hear all sides of the story. And my intent is to offer up mine in addition to the sides already presented, so you can draw your own conclusions. [info]  [info] 1335754344 [info] test

theskittlestubesock [info] Mixed episodes I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 17 (21 now) and I feel like I’ve never exactly been educated on what a mixed episode is. I’ve had hypomanic episode where I can’t sleep, have racing thoughts, act impulsively but in a negative way. The racing thoughts are negative and the impulsivity is things like getting into a fight with a friend. Basically I feel hypomanic but I’m sad. I’ve tried looking it up but it lists the symptoms of manic and depressive episodes and just says you have to have some of both. If you have had a mixed episode what was it like?

HavartiParty [info] I just woke up so this probably wont be quite as coherent as I would like, but whatever.  I encourage my clients to use "person first language"-instead of saying "I'm bipolar" use "I've been diagnosed with bipolar."  Your diagnosis does not define you, unless you let it.  You're a thousand things that are NOT related to your diagnosis, try defining yourself that way rather than by an illness.  When people are diagnosed with cancer they don't say "I'm cancer" so why is it that we tend to use a mental health diagnosis as a defining characteristic when describing ourselves?

asocialwarrior [info] Hi there! I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15, but my symptoms had been visible a year earlier. Uni wasn't difficult until my very last year (this academic year), and my downward spiral started last semester when I was dealing with a sad break up. Towards the end of last semester, I was very bad and decided to stop taking my meds because I felt like they weren't "curing" me after all these years (which was a huge lie that my illness persuaded me into swallowing because I had been stabilised since being on meds). I was well-surrounded and always have been, but gosh I was a pain in the arse to deal with. I was hurt and had a hard time trusting people, even my closest friends and my family. I refused to be fished out of the abyss. I started drinking just so I could pass out instead of sobbing myself to sleep. I started smoking so that I could just feel something. I stopped booking and going to my psychiatric appointments. And guess what? It was the dumbest decision my whole life! I realised how much it was affecting me and my trust circle. Everything was shit. My depressive episode was way longer than my hypomanic phase and I couldn't bear it. I wanted so badly to feel joy again, even if it was just two seconds. This semester has been shitty and my marks have suffered because of my stubbornness. I ended up being transported to Montreal Gen for suicidal ideationat some point. I have however recently resumed my meds (switched from Seroquel XR to IR) and seeing my psychiatrist, in addition to seeing a therapist for the first time my entire life. I have never been better honestly, but I have just realised that I started recovering at the very last moment of my BA. Somehow I have stopped caring about my grades and academic performance. I don't know why. Grades used to matter a lot to me and I would just fight until my last breath to get the grade I wanted/thought I deserved. But somewhere in my struggle, I lost my interest in everything and got on my way to recovery land at the very end. I don't regret the late realisation/recovery though. I know right now I'm standing in a war zone, but I'm happy to finish my degree and I'm happy with myself. I'm happy to have learnt to take care of myself, even though it's just very simple things. Just remember that you have the agency to choose to get out of the mess. It's okay to make baby steps and it's okay to fall the first few times. I know McGill can be ruthless and unhelpful and sometimes you have to seek outside help (Suicide Action saved my life, but you can also call crisis centres like Le Transit or Tracom - Le Transit has been particularly great in my experience). Free group therapies at Revivre or Maison St Jacques are also great resources if you speak French, or if you're on Blue Cross insurance, you could use Empower Me which is a free 24/7 counselling resource (http://studentcare.ca/rte/en/McGillUniversityundergraduatestudentsSSMU_EmpowerMe_EmpowerMe).

ellivia [info] &gt;She stated that I was suffering from a mental disorder such as bipolar or some other thing she mentioned I can't recall.The only mental disorder that I could even remotely see causing anyone to have gender identity issues would be schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  These cause delusional thoughts and hallucinations and could probably fuck with you on occasion.  I've been diagnosed with bipolar type I although I'm pretty sure I actually have schizoaffective disorder (long story, don't tell my psychiatrist everything, should prolly fix that, etc) and I often have to reassure myself that it isn't my mental disorders causing my identity issues, it is entirely separate.As far as I know, no mental disorder has ever caused a person to believe that they are a different gender from their assigned sex, at least not for prolonged periods of time where they actually felt they needed to transition.  I think that mental disorders may be common among trans* folk, but I don't think it is a cause.Either way, there's no sufficient evidence that would show any type of correlation.  Your mother is making shit up to make her feel better instead of just accepting the truth.Edit: Just to throw it out there, my mom did the same thing.

herbistheword [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at age 22! In my experience, life has been a total 180 since my diagnosis... So many of the things that, up until that moment, felt to me like personal failures and flaws were explained by my disorder. I learned to spot signs of the onset of an episode (for me, I develop bouts of insomnia before any behavior effects kick in. If I can can get myself to sleep during these pre-episodic symptoms, I can abort the swing completely!) and my therapist and medication have helped me develop into a more grounded person that I'm proud to be.Basically- it sounds scary because there's such a stigma associated with it. It implies that your life and emotional state is out of your control... but in reality, a correct diagnosis is the moment you get to reclaim your control.Don't let yourself be defined by a disorder you have. Define yourself by the person you become and the actions you take. If you wanna talk ever, or have any questions, please shoot me a PM. You aren't alone! [info] None [info] 1444937925 [info] test

It's hard to separate what's 'you' and what's you reacting to things a certain way because of a disorder. Now that I've been on meds a long time, it's a lot easier to narrow down types.At least NFP and STJ share all the same functions?

egglentine [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 I had the hardest time remembering to take my birth control. I was put on psych meds after a complete breakdown that landed me in a hospital. It magically became easier to remember to take my meds after that. I had such a strong desire to feel better. Sounds like you also have that desire!Now I take my meds right when I wake up. I keep them next to my bed with a glass of water. I also have a pouch with "e-z dose" bags so I can carry my meds with me at all times. I sing a little song to myself as I'm walking out the door. "Phone Keys Wallet Meds!" Carrying the pouch around means I can take my meds as soon as I remember instead of waiting until I'm home again. It's also more discrete than any other method I've tried.The meds won't make your symptoms disappear completely. They WILL take the edge off. They reduce severity and frequency of my episodes and that alone gives me enough clarity to keep my meds (and myself) in check. It took me a long time to find the right doses of the right meds but I'm so glad I stuck with it. I feel more stable now than ever before.  This may be an extreme statement but I truly believe that my meds saved my life.  [info] None [info] 1476673440 [info] test

gotstonoe [info] i say take the risk but ultimately it comes down to what your mental illness is like. If you think you can manage it or will be able to see a therapist while in uni then by all means go for it. Also uni is where a lot of people get mental illnesses since it is at about the age where they show up and the stress of uni can push the stress-diathesis. I would suggest if you do go don't overwork yourself, eat healthy, exercise, and create a solid support system while there. Don't be afraid of seeking help from profs, friends, and in some cases family. I was diagnosed with bipolar II this past year and i'm still in uni and working my ass off. I've learned as much as i can about it and seek therapy. It can get in the way at times tbh. It's hard but i've grown and learned so much these past couple of years that i don't regret coming.

DelMaximum [info] I'm not suggesting a compete rehaul of the educational system. But more of a consideration for an individuals capacity for knowledge or activity would be beneficial I think. I could use myself as an example of where this point is coming from.As a very intelligent child, I was often bored in class. In both public and private schools I quickly learned how to skate through my classes, barely passing on the tests alone, rarely turning in homework. Rather than having a system that could rise to my needs, I began to backslide, not seeing the value in an education that could not sate my thirst. It was only when I could not get into college that I realized what I had done to my chances. There are countless variables that led to all of this. One of them is that at the age of seven or eight I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD. Medication for these 'ailments' began immediately. Before I had even got well into my development I was undergoing a regiment of chemical all for the sake of helping me fit in. Today I am perfectly healthy and functional without the use of those pills. Had I been undrugged through my childhood, and placed in an environment where my mind was accepted and nurtured instead of drugged and forced to behave against it's inclination, I probably would be in a much more successful position in life.

milkiebuttle [info] This year, I will stop letting my mother control who I want to be and how I feel about myself. Let me preface this story by starting from the beginning. When I was 5, my older brother died in a car crash. This tore my family apart as you can imagine. Growing up was tough for me. My mum was forever on edge and anything will trigger her. It was especially hard when my dad worked nights and eventually moved overseas for work. In the worst of times she stripped me naked and threw me out of the house or she told me she would rather I have died rather than my brother. I was no more than 10 on both occasions.Having grown up in this environment, I was depressed and anxious from a young age. When I was 18, I was diagnosed with bipolar and an eating disorder. My mum ridiculed me and said that I was weak.I always tried to give my mum the benefit of the doubt. She lost her son; she herself was hurting that’s why she hurt me. We’re Asian so it’s culturally okay for her to call me fat and make fun of me although I know I am NOT fat and she knew about my E.D. We have good times together too so that makes up for the bad times.Eight years ago, I met the love of my life who helped me through dark times. He helped heal me. Last year, he asked me to marry him and I said yes.It’s been a few months now and my mum has not expressed any happiness for me. She is acting as if my engagement is something to be ashamed of. She’s telling me not to wear the ring or post on social media. She has told me multiple times that my fiancé is not good enough for me and that she hated him. This really hurts me because apart from my dad, he is the person I love the most. He is the one who protected me and it makes me sad that I can’t even protect him from her.But I am so tired of her behaviour. I have lived like this for 20 years. I have let her choose how I should live my life. Even subconsciously I do everything I know will keep her happy or keep my safe from her.But from 2019, I am making a pact with myself to stand up for myself. I will no longer let her change the way I feel about myself or let her tear down everything I have built for myself. I will no longer put up with it and say that it’s ok. She may be hurting but I am too. I have not had a suicidal thought in a long time but today I felt that creeping back again and that is not ok. I swear to myself that I will not let her hurt me anymore. [info] None [info] 1546519992 [info] test

BoojiBoy [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and her behavior definitely reminds me of some of my more unhinged moments before I started taking medication.

That said, there's a definite layer of "total bitch" in her attitude that seems to be independent of the other thing.Maybe with all of the negative attention, she'll realize that she needs to get help and she may come out of the experience a better person.

es_unpan [info] I feel like I’m finally becoming who I want to be I can’t tell this to anyone I know in real life without overwhelming them. But I finally feel like I can accept my past mistakes, learn from them and move on. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder very late in my life after I had grown through series of toxic and abusive relationships and friendships. Anything, you name it. It got a bit worse right after my diagnosis. I don’t even think I could mention it here. But now, it’s been a few years since it happened.I look back and I cringe so hard at my choices. More than 90% of them were made due to fear of abandonment. I would do anything to keep anyone in my life, even if they wanted me to die or kill myself because I had loved them so much.  Now I could care less if I were put in those situations again. I feel stronger now. I feel less submissive and more in control of my life and my emotions. It felt awful being myself but after being properly diagnosed, it made it easier for me to be aware of my actions, emotions and surroundings.I feel bad I can never go back and fix my mistakes. It ruined career opportunities for me, college opportunities, opportunities to make good friends. But, now, all I can do is move on. I think about what I could’ve done better in the past but now I feel like I know who I am. Always changing every day, nothing is the same anymore but I am growing to become a better person. Or at least, I’m really trying. I hope someday I can stop the bad memories from flooding my mind every single day altogether. I just wanted to share, I finally feel a change coming. I hope good changes, love, and good fortune come to you too, to whoever is reading this. [info] None [info] 1586684753 [info] test
rseymour [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 11 years ago.  I think doctors have made it better.  There is something wrong with me.  This is a mental illness, so it is in my entire nervous system.  In 100 years people will look back and think bipolar people were linked by genetic factors, possibly [mitochondrial defects](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=mitochondrial+defect+bipolar+disorder&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=1).  We don't know the long term side effects of all drugs now, but we know that the long term side effect of bipolar ([suicide](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=suicide+in+bipolar&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=1)/accidental death) is far more likely.  The first time I ever experienced mania was beyond incredible.  I knew the answer to everything, everything clicked, I saw past the boundaries of society and into the essence of everyone and everything.  So treated I finished my masters in December and I'm on track to finish my PhD this summer.tl;dr: does anyone else think bipolar disorder is a treatable illness and accepting of treatment in lieu of something better????.....because I wish I could live without psychiatric drugs but I realize that I'd rather be safe than hospitalized (and on drugs regardless)bipolar and relatively cool with it.**so...**It's an important thing when your disease makes you 60 times more likely to kill yourself.  That's scary!  If you know someone who has died by their own hand... It's devastating.  Please do what it takes to come to terms with bpd, with what you can do to protect yourself.  It took me a decade to find the right pills to take, and I'm sure that will keep changing in time.  Stay vigilant.  Don't lose your skeptical attitude, but recognize that it is a dangerous disorder.

AlabamaMercy [info] How do you feel if you skip your meds for a day ? I am diagnosed with bipolar type 1. I’ve been using quentiapine Fumarate (seroquel) for a couple months now and if I have a lot of school work to do and haven’t gotten it done I skip my meds and then don’t need to sleep for a day or two. I usually feel great, although I feel a lot more impulsive and energetic. I also feel like I can see more colours ? Or maybe colours are just a lot brighter. I also find my attention jumps around, hyper focuses on something then jumps around again. Does anyone else experience something like this ? how do you feel if you forget/skip your pills ?

Mel0logy [info] Not sure if this counts, but I was diagnosed with bipolar II a little over a year ago, and my search queries can get a little grim on my low days. I mostly use Google to see how others cope and to assure myself that my symptoms are a result of my illness and not worth dwelling on. Anyways, I've recently noticed that Facebook advertises amateur therapy or group therapy sites (7 cups of tea comes to mind) to me all the time. Ads for various sites in a similar vein show up on my feed fairly often, so maybe what OP described is already happening to a certain extent. It's still mostly capitalism, I'm sure, but it's a start.  [info] None [info] 1470799813 [info] test
Halloysite [info] Are you sure he is actually bipolar? Many people see "bipolar" and think it means "I have an angry side and a good side" and see their self-diagnosis as a reason to not do anything about being an asshole, or even play up the cruel asshole factor and whip out the "bipolar" excuse when people call them on it as if it clears them from any responsibility. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and I've never lashed out at anyone, ever. [info] ♀ [info] 1460578830 [info] test
360volts [info] One day I will realize the emptiness? You mean the day I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder? That was years ago. That emptiness almost killed me. my entire survival depended on knowing how to fill it, and what to fill it with. I have not only survived, but thrived while dealing with this emptiness, and you want to tell me that you know how to fill it? Fuck off.I don't really discard advice from others without the disorder, I just thought that rant would show the other person how silly their statement is. [info] None [info] 1400721627 [info] test
LaurenxKate68 [info] Thank you for asking for advice on this matter. I am diagnosed with bipolar as well. (23F)Bipolar disorder is a tough disorder that affects their entire life. Yes, lack of sleep, sugar, alcohol and even caffeine can worsen symptoms and increase manic episodes. One of the easiest ways to help with mood frequencies is to cut out alcohol in general. Bipolar persons can feel alcohol related symptoms of mania for even up to two weeks and can actually cause someone on lorazepam to go to sleep and never wake up if they take multiple alcoholic drinks while on the medication. I think the most important part of dating someone with bipolar disorder is patience and communication. I can tell that you are proactive in making your relationship work with her disorder and that you are passionate about making this work. When you get into a manic state, extreme irritability is a common symptom and it’s due to lack of sleep..when you’re manic, you feel like you’re floating almost and it’s hard for you to make educated rational decisions because you feel emotions full throttle and it’s extremely hard to control them as you assess risk differently. Most bipolar persons in manic episodes do not realize the effect they are truly having on others while in that state because I like to refer to it as their perception of reality is skewed in that time frame, so it would make sense that she could potentially be borderline abusive to you in that state but not fully comprehend the true effect of what she is saying and how it affects you. It may seem like you are dealing with two separate people (manic vs non manic) and that because you honestly are. You are very understanding of her and her disability and that is so important. The main key is communication and patience. Listening to what she needs, helping keep her perspective of reality on when she’s in those states. If you are aggressive or argumentative back she may match it with even more aggression, best thing to try is to agree with her concerns in that state, be calm and give her her space if she needs it. I hate to say this, but you will probably need to be the bigger person in arguments.  It is unfortunately a chemical imbalance that many people suffer from but with the property medicine and treatment they are able to live relatively normal lives. Everyone I have told that I am bipolar have told me they would’ve never known if I didn’t tell them and that’s because I’ve been able to master my emotions and even maintain healthy long term relationships as well as full time jobs.  If you have any questions about bipolar disorder I would love to answer them. I hope this helps you understand what may cause symptoms of bipolar and how to counteract it.
