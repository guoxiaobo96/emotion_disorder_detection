blue_box_disciple [info] Dear AskReddit, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder today.  Long story, short: it sucks and I'm scared. [info] None [info] 1238129568
LocolBiped [info] I'm not suicidal, but I'm starting to feel trapped and desperate.I'm not quite sure how to formulate my thoughts, so I guess I'll just ramble through.I'm 29, I haven't had a real job in 6 years, I've survived off of the good graces of a string of women.  I have 2 friends, neither of which could be considered social creatures, so I don't see them very often.When I was 18, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  After a few years the shrink decided that wasn't it.  I was re diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, that didn't stick either.  I display some of the symptoms, but don't fit into the profile of either of these illnesses.At that time, I was a true asshole, I lied and cheated to get what I needed. I alienated all of my friends. A number of them, now 10 years later, can't even bring themselves to talk to me, and I completely understand.A bad LSD trip completely changed my world, I developed severe panic disorder, locked myself in my room for hours at a time, terrified that someone would see me like this.  I got very, very desperate.  I went to any church I could find, looking for a solution to an overwhelming problem.  After some time I joined AA of all places.  Now, I had never been an alcoholic, but the kindness of the people in those rooms helped me considerably. I worked the steps, had a sponsor, and was surrounded by caring friends, even though I didn't have the requisite disease, those steps helped me, I began to see what a nightmare my life had been.  I began telling the truth, being gentle with people I loved, and standing on my own two feet, I got an IT job and began paying my bills (a first)As a result of working with that program, I eventually came to the point that I had to be honest with myself.  I had never had a drinking problem, rarely drank more than one drink at a time.  Leaving AA was a very difficult decision, but I couldn't continue living a lie.Things went well for a while, after a few years, I fell in love with a woman.  This turned out to be an incredible unfortunate event.I'll not go into details, as this post is getting to long as it is.  Suffice to say that the day I left, she got really drunk, smashed all the furniture in the house, called the police while I was sleeping to tell them that I did it, made a bath for herself and fell asleep in it.I woke up holding my 6 month old daughter with police flashlights shining in my eyes.  They were very, very kind to me.  And belived that she had been the one to do the damage. (Probably abetted by the fact that the police found her so drunk that she couldn't get out of the bathtub.)I left that night.Which brings us to today.  I have half time custody of my now 2 and a half year old daughter.  She is the light of my life.  I have an amazing partner who believes in my ability to pull myself together, and is wonderful with my child.But I think I need some help.I have no motivation, I've gained 60 lbs.  I am wracked with fear. No panic attacks anymore, just general dread.  I've developed in to a full blown hypochondriac.  Believing at any moment that I have cancer, or heart disease, or a million other things.  I can't seem to stick to any of my goals.  My day consists of reading reddit on the weeks that my daughter isn't here, and watching her on the weeks that she is.My world seems to be shrinking.  Bad decisions made when I was young (I have an arrest record, no convictions) keep me from taking any job that requires a background check. And any IT jobs seem to do that now.  I'm afraid things are getting worse. I'm terrified of going to sleep, knowing that more than half the time I'll just lay there and tremble in fear of a non existent malady, or shit on myself for not being where I thought I would be.I have everything I could possibly want, a new car, a warm house, money in the bank, a daughter who takes my breath away, an understanding and beautiful partner who has seen me go though it all (we've been friends for 10 years) and believes in me.  I just want to learn how to stand up again.  How to realize my goals again.    I've lost my faith in shrinks, having a string of several bad ones who seemed to just want to test their pill prescribing abilities.Thanks for listening, I really needed to get that out there.

craider [info] I have a few ones I guess.I was married with a kid and I met up with several guys on craigslist.. (Me and my wife were going through a very difficult time and weren't living with each other at the time; we are no longer together.) She is the only one in the world that knows this. When I am around my friends I put on a front like I hate "fags" just as much as them when I'm 99% sure im bi. I'm also pretty sure that if even my best friends found this out they would disown me.When I was a teenager I used to constantly watch child porn. I'm 20 now and still watch it on occasionThis one my family and friends know about but I tried to commit suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder but I felt the diagnosis was bullshit so I stopped taking my prescribed meds and starting smoking weed instead.My biggest fantasy is to see my wife (ex) have sex with another guy (and trust me, my wife is fucking gorgeous, and two years younger then me.) I have brought this up several times with her but while not totally freaking out and calling me a pervert she has very firmly informed me that this will not be happening.

ngngboone [info] I'm a musician, and I was actually kind of excited when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (after an acute psychotic episode). I thought "Oh cool, now I could be some kind of crazy genius", and it was good at the time to have a nice thought like that and have a "bright side" to think of. But since time has gone by, and I've gotten a little perspective on it, I don't think it helps me, and I definitely wouldn't keep it if I had the choice. [info] None [info] 1255992562
pipyopi [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 13. I went on various medications, some made it worse, some did nothing, some made me emotionless, and some worked, but not enough. Eventually, I began self medicating, attempted suicide more than a few times, and was eventually hospitalized. I was only there for a week when they found the perfect prescription for me.It was a combo of lithium and lamictal (lamotrogine). It worked for awhile, until the lithium started giving me problems (i was on it once before and it made me incredibly depressed).Now I take 100mg of Lamictal once a day, combined with the only therapy that has ever been effective for me (writing). If I miss a single dose, I turn into a manic monster. I still go through phases (I am currently in a depressive phase), but they are no longer as intense.Its not completely figured out, I still struggle with it nearly every day, but it is not seriously impairing my life anymore. I have been clean for 4 years, am no longer self-destructive, and I haven't lashed out at anyone in a very long time.It seems that medication, some form of therapy, a proper diet, and exercise is the proven method. (Although I'm still working on the whole exercise thing).What are you doing/taking for it?Also, what are the main problems it causes for you? [info] None [info] 1256238352

Hotbutteredhtml [info] Glad to hear that all is well. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder several years ago. The one piece of advice I can give you is to stand by her side. The will come a day when she will think that she no longer needs to be on medication and will want to quit. I went through just that and did. I ended up leaving my family. Luckily my wife loved me enough to take me back and I've been on my meds since and never been happier. [info] None [info] 1262221877
Neoncow [info] I didn't say homosexuality was a mental disorder. I said it's something in your head that you cannot change. The metaphor connecting the two sentences is "cannot change".From the original comment I replied to:&gt; I know that, but honestly that doesn't make it right. There are plenty of guys out there. Plus she had a guy at the time.&gt; edit: I do know about the mood swings and increased libido when you slip into a manic phase. ( I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2...so I have an idea). But I think some doors should stay shut.I'm actually pointing out that the justification she used to not forgive her mother is the same justification people make against homosexuality. Pointing out implicit bigotry in the discrimination and hatred against people with mental disorders. Obviously, I shouldn't have used homosexuality since it's a charged topic, but it was so apt."I know that [it's part of her genetic disposition], but honestly that doesn't make it right""There's plenty of females to have sex with, plus he had a girlfriend at the time""Sometimes, I get a little attracted to guys, but she went too far" (It's like, me but worse! This one sounds like closet gay republicans.)My point that everyone seemed to miss is that mental disorders and homosexuality all have genetic predispositions that fundamentally change the way a person's mind operates. Anyway, my point was better received [over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/b4o80/my_mom_slept_with_my_boyfriendhow_do_i_get_over_it/c0kxzzu?context=1). [info] None [info] 1266860671
lakid626 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after my brother was murdered.  Blah blah blah, 5 years later, I don't take any medication, but I am able to control it a lot more.  I realized my episodes occur during extreme moments, of me getting excited, or sad.  I've conditioned myself to be uncaring and mellow through almost anything now. [info] None [info] 1269283289
luluchr [info] Everything AmbitionOfPhilipJFry said really hits a homerun. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years back and I had a boyfriend at the time who did everything in his power to try and support me. At times, when I wasn't having an episode I would appreciate it and be really loving, but because I was so overmedicated I had a hard time feeling any honest feelings. This left me confused and frustrated and it was something that made me feel increadibly alone and isolated. Trust me when I say this, you are not the cause or to blame for any of it. Neither is she really, but her disorder seems to be 'causing you just as much pain if not more. It is and will always be an unequal relationship so long you take on so much responsibility as you seem to be doing. The best support for any bipolar is to have a partner who he himself is stable and not sad or reactionary. Otherwise you are being codependent and that only harms her more. I really commend you for trying and reaching out though. It takes strength and you don't get the support or recognition that you should be getting. At least that was what my ex has said later. It's like because he wasn't sick then it wasn't too bad for him.  [info] None [info] 1271771912

cjhard [info] This is how I finally passed Algebra in Highschool.I was diagnosed with bipolar (which turned out to be bullshit). With that doctors note, I went from top of the class, straight into Algebra (1 and 2) in the 7th grade, to mulling around with the troubled kids at the back of the school. Once I earned my way out of the troubled kids class, I was sent to pre-algebra and couldn't pick up on the craptastic style of teaching I was forced to endure. I passed that with a low C and then endured Algebra 1 with a slightly better, but still craptastic teaching style.I then went into high school and had to take Algebra 1 all over again because somehow middle school and high school algebra isn't the same algebra. So I sat around for an hour every day listening to some dill drone on and on about something I'm pretty sure he didn't really understand anyway. I never did figure out what he needed a comb for, because he was completely bald.I finally got a break from Algebra my Sophomore year and got to glide through Geometry. The teacher gave us an assignment in the book. We wrote definitions and proofs and each week we'd have a notebook check to make sure we did that, then we would spend about 10 minutes working a few pages out of the book. For the rest of the class we sat around talking or got hall passes to roam around with. We would gather in a large group and hive mind for the midterm and final exams because the teacher didn't care.Then I finally got to Algebra 2 my Junior year. At this point, I was fed up with math and would be very happy if I never saw it again. I toiled the days away programing my calculator to do the majority of the work for me, even spitting out whatever I needed to show my work on paper. The rest of the time I slept. About a quarter of the way through I realized the teacher didn't even look to see what was on the paper when she went around to give credit. She never even noticed the doodles on the side never changed.My junior year consisted of sleep, walk to next bedroom, repeat. I used to love math. When I got to Calculus my senior year I quit. I transfered out of the class because it was considered an elective, and became a TA for the CAD/Pre-engineering teacher. He never knew I was his TA, so I just roamed the halls or found a classroom to sleep in.Middle School and High School destroyed my love of math. [info] None [info] 1276292619

Ryveks [info] I never was officially diagnosed with PTSD, but I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I probably do have it, it's been thrown around by my psychologists. I watched my mom die of a cerebral hemorrhage when I was 17 and had to deal with a lot of family drama (taking care of my father and older brother). I really didn't exhibit any serious signs of being bipolar before that (though looking back, there were a few times here and there you could say I mildly was). When I was 20, I spent almost a year psychotically depressed. This, too, contributed to me being severely traumatized (including very vivid/lucid dreams of my mom trying to kill me). I'm on medications now, and I phase in and out sometimes of having milder versions of the feelings of being traumatized by losing my mom. Sometimes I can have those nice hypomanic phases, where I feel like I have so much still ahead of me, and I can take on the world. If you can't afford therapy and medications for now, and you do the diet, exercise thing, try finding someone, anyone you can open up to. Maybe your closest friend, maybe us on here. I found that it helps a lot when you remember there are people out there who care about you. I know I have a huge, huge problem opening up to my friends. I always feel like I'm a huge burden to them, raining on their parade, making them feel bad for me and helpless because there's nothing they can do for me. One of my biggest issues has been feeling like I have nothing to fall back on, no safety net. I was super close to my mom, a total homebody, and now I don't even have a place to call home. I think one of the biggest steps for me has been finding a place I feel safe. When I find those places, yeah I'll still have my depressed moments and even some hypo-manic ones, but I can handle everything better. I realized that with the added stresses, I feel more like I'm losing control of everything, making everything worse. I can control myself a lot better when I'm depressed (or so some part of me thinks) so I almost feel like I shut myself down. When there's some thing that grounds me, somewhere I can go and feel safe, my brain kind of rides the bipolar waves much more easily. I can handle the depressed bits because I know eventually I'll feel grand again and I have the energy to take what comes. [info] None [info] 1278273894
icaaryal [info] It may sound kind of silly, but I have an anecdotal insight to consciousness that many do not and some that have shared similar experiences do.During a medication withdrawal (Lamictal, prescribed for mood stabilization as I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder), I entered a psychotic state which put me in the hospital for 5 days.You brain is, perhaps, at any given time, constantly evaluating the sensory input and analyzing it with internal "dialogue" systems which are the basis for understanding the overall "experience" of the present moment and moments passed.  A lot of the bulk analysis goes under the radar of our conscious thought processes because there's simply too much information and our conscious thought process, while powerful in it's ability to analyze "concepts" and solve problems, is a little slow for handling/processing each sensory input while handling it's typical workload of problem-solving.  This isn't to say that sub-conscious brain activity doesn't handle problem-solving per se, but it tends to do most of it's problem-solving through logical organization of externally-sourced sensory input on the biological level.  (Here is the input, where does it go/how does it fit within my understanding of the current situation).  I'd hypothesize that our conscious thought process is more tailored to analysis of past events (which generally aren't time sensitive) while the sub-conscious is tailored more for real-time, time-sensitive analysis and decision making (i.e. fight or flight scenarios).Anyway...Under the right conditions, it can seem as if the filter that keeps sub-conscious thought processes at the sub-conscious level can be disabled.  That is to say that low-level sensory analysis can leak through to our higher-level conscious thought process (this has been reported [according to my interpretation] by people with autism) and potentially "overwhelm" the conscious thought process.To illustrate my point, when I experienced my psychotic episode, it was as if my conscious thought process gained the ability to perceive the subconscious analysis.  The conscious "me" was sort of holed up in the back of my mind observing all these thoughts that were, effectively, uncontrollable.  Any little thought or idea generated by that "me" in the corner turned into a flurry of thoughts that I could do nothing but sit back and observe.  What I'm saying is that it seemed that there were two trains of thought going simultaneously; the watcher's thought process and the low-level subconcious thought process.  And you would be surprised at what that uncontrollable runaway train of thought can do to what you perceive as "you".  It was the most terrifying thing I've experienced thus far.So besides being fucking scary, during and after the experience I kept trying to rationalize what was going on even though it did nothing to stop the runaway train  There was a link between the me in the corner of my mind and the horror show going on at the same time.  It was at that point that I reasoned that there is a conscious "me" that can do it's own thing, and it has an affect on the subconscious, but one doesn't have complete control of the other.**TL;DR Pyschosis that was bad enough to hospitalize me provided an experience that led me to perceive that there is a conscious "me" and a sub-conscious "me" that can function independently, have an affect on each other, but not necessarily control each other directly.  And when you experience that, it's scary shit.** [info] None [info] 1281461868
aidrocsid [info] Well, for one, I developed a lot of irrational fears and would completely freak out when forced to confront them. Much of the time it felt more like I was watching myself act than actually participating in my life, which was frustrating. My memory, which, for events (though not information) had already been pretty bad, became far worse. I started having difficulty in school (which I'd always excelled at) and having emotional problems. I was frequently in what I now recognize as a mixed state, though whether that was caused by ritalin or just an early symptom of my bipolar (I), I couldn't tell you. I sometimes, because of the timing, suspect that ritalin may have initiated my bipolar to begin with or (though less so now) that the ADHD was just misdiagnosed bipolar. Once I stopped taking ritalin my emotional problems became more acute but it actually felt like *I* was the one experiencing them. Within a couple of years of stopping ritalin I was diagnosed with bipolar I with symptoms of psychosis in mania, they also said I might have borderline personality disorder but I didn't meet as many of the criteria as they like for diagnosis. I went through a number of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics, none of which did anything other than make my life more difficult by putting me to sleep. Eventually I'd discover that I could mitigate my symptoms with marijuana and meditation.Recently, actually, I quit smoking tobacco and have seen an increase in bipolar symptoms, though the coping methods I've developed make it easier to function than it was when they were previously at these levels. Mind you, I also haven't really been meditating actively. [info] None [info] 1283865691

hlkolaya [info] haha- well I'll tell you some of my own experiences. if you're not a believer in the supernatural, read to the end before downvoting. I could hear and see ghosts from the time I was a child. Because of this I left Christianity when I was 12 and became Pagan. I often heard people speaking to me at night or when I was alone- I could hear footsteps. Once, at a friend's, I woke up in the middle of the night to see a little girl sitting at the end of my bed. The next night I heard someone walking outside of my friend's bedroom door in the middle of the night- I couldn't sleep and waited for them to fade. My friend confirmed there was a little girl ghost in her house.When I was a little older and in my first apartment I began having dreams of falling into darkness and not being able to wake up. Dreams of a strange, shadowy man who would grab me and pull me into some black pit. Once a white hand grabbed my ankle while I was laying in bed and a few days later, while reading, I felt something in the room.. so i put my book down and right in front of me was a man- dripping wet, bloated, and pale. I ran out of there as quickly as I could! All of these incidences involved the same entity. These are only a few of the things that I experienced in my Pagan days- that doesn't count ceremonies, rituals, spells, psychic visions, past lives, etc. When I was 22 I was diagnosed with bipolar. Turns out they were all just hallucinations and medication took care of it. TL;DR I became pagan because I could hear and see ghosts. Turns out I was just hallucinating because I was bipolar. Meds=no more "ghosts". The supernatural can be explained with science. [info] None [info] 1284076078
swimgurl [info] I would lose the amount that YOU are comfortable with.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and they put me on Seroquel for about 3 years.  I gained about 40 pounds.   I was up to 165 at one point (5'5" tall).  When they changed my medication, I was able to lose 20 pounds just because I didn't feel like eating all the time.  Some of these medications just mess with your mind and make you do things that aren't normal to you.  I had a very bad reaction to a drug they put me on recently (I had acute liver failure and was hospitalized for 8 days) and now I'm drug free and have better moods than ever.  I am also only 10 pounds away from my target weight of 125.  tl;dr: get another opinion and try to get off the drugs if you can. [info] None [info] 1285215762
applextrent [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar-nos 3 doctors switched me from Paxil to Effexor which caused a severe mixed episode followed by serotonin syndrome and I had to be hospitalized.

haywire44 [info] Disclosure: I was diagnosed with bipolar II, so please take this with a grain of salt. If you've had full blown manic episodes chances are you will need more help and besides, when it comes to your mental health, seek professional health. You won't find that here. This is just a personal story. Bipolar isn't black and white. It's in shades. I was diagnosed at 21 and thought medication would solve everything. It did not. As a matter of fact, the medication made me hate everything about who I was. I hated feeling skull fucked every minute of my life and the fact that I needed pills to feel normal was the worst part of it.After doing some research and heavily consulting with my psychiatrist and psychologist, I decided to begin my journey to go off meds. A few factors played into this role. The medication was having a negative effect on my life. It killed my sex drive, my appetite, my creativity, and as I work at an art restoration gallery the effect of lithium on my motor skills was absolutely horrendous.  I had to get off meds. It wasn't the answer for me. Everyone I consulted were amazing about supporting my decision and even helped to make sure I'd do it safely. Although a few advised against dropping medication they were supportive of my decision. I made sure to have a positive support network. I made sure my then girlfriend kept a close watch on me to make sure I wouldn't go off the deep end. I also began keeping a mood journal and would go over it with my psychologist and my gf, figuring out my triggers. Instead of my daily regimen of a visit to the medicine cabinet, I began eating better. I began jogging. Whenever I'd feel depressed or manic, I'd just go jogging. I began sleeping regularly. I began feeling alive. Through cognitive behavior therapy I began to learn how to recognize and manage my emotions. I did a lot of reading on the subject. Two years later and I am still working at the art restoration gallery, my life is wonderful, my wife loves me,  and I haven't had a depressive or manic episode since I made the conscious decision to go off medication. Sure, I feel down sometimes, and I get energetic, but it is no longer disrupting to my lifestyle as it had once been. As I've said, please do not think my story applies to you. Consult your healthcare professional first. TL;DR Instead of letting the medication control my emotions for me I learned to take control through1. Support from people I loved. 2. Good diet and exercise3. Therapy.  Medication is the means to an end, not the other way around. That was probably the biggest lesson for me. Unless you make a conscious decision to turn things around you might as well dump the medication down the garbage chute.  [info] None [info] 1287766535

guy26 [info] I FEEL your pain. There is some known problem that started for me 8 years ago. I was sick with what seemed like mono, but also pain in the liver area. it last about 1.25 years! They ran a lot of tests but never could figure out what was wrong. During that time I couldn't tolerate ANY medication what so ever. If I took an aspirin I would get even worse and it would take 4 or 5 days to recover. My tolerance to medication has improved and I got over whatever was going wrong, but I'm left still intolerant to medication. I get pain in the liver area and get worse and worse fatigue. I'm diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and honestly I just have to deal with it. Sometimes it seems completely unbearable and sometimes I go for long stretches without any problems what-so-ever. I have recently started seeing a therapist and he swears that he hasn't seen anyone deal with bipolar symptoms as well as I have. I have a lot of means to cope with them. That doesn't mean it is easy though. And sometimes it gets very close to crossing the breaking point.I am trying once again to get doctors to figure out what is wrong with me and why I don't tolerate medication. I need to be able to take an anti-biotic to completely get over a UTI I have had for three months. I have tried two antibiotics and had to stop them because of what was going on.My biggest advice is to become as self aware as possible. Feel free to ask me any questions.I might mention that lithium doesn't go through the liver. I have tried it and ever since I had what seemed to be a seizure no one is willing to prescribe that one either... so I take nothing. [info] None [info] 1291415799
guy26 [info] OMG. That scares the crap out of me! I'm diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and I hope that NEVER happens to me. I don't take medication so I suppose it is theoretically possible. I have experienced extreme mania... even to the point that I have had memory blackouts and have hallucinated. But they were very very very brief.. on the order of 20 minutes to 6 hours. On the other hand I have had hypomania once that went on for 9 months straight!Having bipolar is like living in the world of extremes. Sometimes I feel that it is comparable to living several life times worth of emotional content over a few years. Nothing surprises me too much when it comes to bipolar. Several of my friends are bipolar and I have seen mania in other people first hand. Oddly it both simultaneously excites and scares the hell out of me. The euphoric high of mania is probably unlike any other drug on earth and much more intoxicatingly pleasant. Was this your first psychotic experience with mania? Despite get extremely high because of mania, I have never lost touch with reality. If it went on for days or weeks, I would probably succumb to it too.How long ago were you diagnosed with bipolar? Were you taking your medication regularly and as prescribed when it happened? What are you now taking? Just the Abilify?  [info] None [info] 1291998756

I was diagnosed with bipolar at 15. I was told since I was 12 that it was just hormones and that I would grow out of it. So I tried vitamin therapy and birth control pills to try to come to a solution, and when none of those worked, I knew it was time to try something else. I had been severely suicidal and was just waiting for an oppurtunity or off myself.. and I started getting manic, having delusions, ect. It snowballed into me blacking out and causing physical harm to a few people around me, and I wouldn't know what happened except for what I have been told, and "coming out of it" being held down by a few people.Again, I agree with your hormone suggestion, as that is the case for people too, but the patient knows their body the best and knows when something just isnt right. I WISH it was hormones in my situation, maybe it could have prevented some damage.To the OP:Maybe you can try to get a friend to drive, or another trusted family member. Where I live, there is medical transportation services that can take people to and from appointments and I believe its covered by health insurance (depends of course).  If these symptoms are interfering with your life, or you feel suicidal, you should get help as soon as possible.  I would just hate to see you suffer any more than you have to. I also think that you should give your parents more credit. Its hard. Maybe when you talk to them about it, print out those quizzes and maybe some information on Bipolar disorder so they can get a better understanding. It took my mom years to understand.  Its possible that they might be a little freaked out at first, because a lot of people don't know what the illness actually entails, but inform them with as much information on the subject that you can. I'm not a parent, but I think that its hard for any parent to come to terms with the fact that their child isn't 100% "healthy" because they don't want any harm to come to their children. But its not the end of the world if that is your diagnosis. I'm sure your parents would rather know than not know, parents want to be involved in your life, and they will prolly appreciate you coming to them and give you love and support in the long run.  Good Luck! [info] None [info] 1294013698
guy26 [info] I don't think I had any symptoms of bipolar until I was 16yo or so. I was not diagnosed until I was 27. I am diagnosed with bipolar type 2.edit: The one interesting similarity between us is that I was also considered very bright and above average even at a young age. I learned how to manipulate BASIC programs before even being able to read. I also didn't have too many friends, was considered significantly more mature for my age through my teenage years, and identified with adults much better than other kids as a teenager.

RollerDoll [info] I too am bipolar II and am on lamictal as a monotherapy.  I'm thinking about adding an antidepressant to the mix because the lamictal makes the episodes less frequent, but about every other month I dive for three or four days and am absolutely convinced that the only way to cure the pain is to kill myself.  That's followed by three or four days where I practice piano and guitar for hours and hours a day.  Urgh.But I digress.  I'm glad you've decided to go back on the prozac.  Before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was taking celexa and was having sexual side effects, so I quit taking it one day.  A couple of weeks later, I was in a psych ward.  Taking your meds is serious shit - if you're having unwanted side effects from the prozac, definitely definitely try something else - but you gotta wean yourself off slowly while the other drug takes effect.Good luck.

DelMaximum [info] I'm not suggesting a compete rehaul of the educational system. But more of a consideration for an individuals capacity for knowledge or activity would be beneficial I think. I could use myself as an example of where this point is coming from.As a very intelligent child, I was often bored in class. In both public and private schools I quickly learned how to skate through my classes, barely passing on the tests alone, rarely turning in homework. Rather than having a system that could rise to my needs, I began to backslide, not seeing the value in an education that could not sate my thirst. It was only when I could not get into college that I realized what I had done to my chances. There are countless variables that led to all of this. One of them is that at the age of seven or eight I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD. Medication for these 'ailments' began immediately. Before I had even got well into my development I was undergoing a regiment of chemical all for the sake of helping me fit in. Today I am perfectly healthy and functional without the use of those pills. Had I been undrugged through my childhood, and placed in an environment where my mind was accepted and nurtured instead of drugged and forced to behave against it's inclination, I probably would be in a much more successful position in life. But now I'm just a very intelligent barista.  [info] None [info] 1301957493
Mollysaurus [info] I went to an eating disorders unit first, which is where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I. My episodes were mostly manic; I suffered only a few depressive episodes in my life. The ECT was an unusual choice by my doctor at Abbott NW Hospital (which is the third mental ward I was in, fall 2007) because it is usually used to break depressive episodes, not manic. But she was right, and it worked. [info] None [info] 1302882712
bennyearl [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar a few months ago.  I am still coping with the diagnosis but am coming to the conclusion that I need to move on with my life as a bipolar person and not let life pass me by.

I guess I will let time just keep moving and try to enjoy the ride. [info] Bipolar Type 2 [info] 1303165126
AbeLouDog [info] When I was a young teenager, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder... Along with my emotional difficulties, I had delusions, began to self medicate, etc. My folks were strict in some ways, and my warped teenaged mind had convinced me on a few occasions to run away and stay with friends out of fear that my folks would hate me (even more than I thought they already did)for things I had done. I really believed that I was alone and that no one loved me. I fell in with a bad crowd and was eventually suspended from school for drinking. My parents didn't know what to do... so they gave up.My folks arranged for an escort service to come wake me at 4 am one morning, handcuff me, and fly me to a facility 2,000 mi away from my home, where I spent the remainder of my childhood. I had no idea what was going on and noone would answer my questions. You can't understand how horrifying it is to be dragged out of your home in the middle of the night by a complete stranger while you scream for your parents to help you and they just turn away crying. Once at the facility... I asked for a phone call. I needed to talk to my parents. Ask them what happened... For this I was mocked: "Your parents don't want to talk to you! They don't want to see you! What on Earth would make you think that!? They sent you here on Christmas!"Over the next couple years... I was alone. Berated daily. Told that I was a junkie (despite the fact I had never touched heroin), and that I had to lie to my parents about this if I ever wanted to have a chance of leaving. I saw kids fall ill and not receive medical attention until they were on their death beds, staff members would watch kids undress, shower, use the restroom, and touch girls breasts, genitals, etc., I fell into poor health due to poor diet. Began having chronic kidney stones, fainting spells, hypoglycemia. Was told I could not see a doctor or have pain medication. They would withhold my psychological meds as punishment for not following rules, as well as sleep deprivation, or keep me from using the restroom.When I finally got out, I had no idea how to live like a functional adult. I cried a lot, had nightmares, panic attacks, and social phobias. To this day, I have difficulty trusting people.My father has apologized profusely, after reading some news about the facility and talking to other kids and parents who were conned into it. I have forgiven him. My mother, on the other hand, remains distant. We do not talk. I have never forgiven her.I never went to graduation, never went to prom... Didn't have a single close friend until I was 23... There is so much more, but I am too upset right now to discuss... These people (the program) ruined my life for a greasy buck! I feel utterly betrayed by my family, my country, and people as a whole for letting this happen to anyone.Edit: Sorry. I don't care if you downvote this to shit. I needed to get it off my chest.

alsobipolar229 [info] throwaway here.. I was diagnosed with bipolar /paranoid schizophrenia &amp; manic depressive disorder.I thought I was a prophet, jesus, god, the devil you name it.I went into a mental hospital and was put on a crushing host of meds. None of which had any positive effect on me. They destroyed the person I was beneath my delusion. I had a brief moment of clarity &amp; basically snapped out of it one day. I eventually recognized that my mind wanted to go off the rails &amp; believe insane shit 24/7. At that point I just began to regain control on my own.I was on lithium &amp; wellbutrin &amp; risprodal? when I was released from the hospital. I was there 6 months &amp; had to be strapped down to bed at one point (scariest &amp; worst experience ever) and shot up with something.The whole experience was super traumatic obviously. Once I got back home, I quit taking meds after 3 or 4 days. I was so socially awkward I &amp; anxious that I could NOT be around people (on the meds).After getting off of them for a few weeks, I began to feel better &amp; felt really dumb for believing this shit I did. But I did learn a lot about my brain &amp; mental disorder.Today I am successful and have no ill flare ups of manic behavior. I began studding zen buddhism &amp; meditate and stop my mind daily (this being the biggest help/change in my life).A few years ago, I saw this &amp; it helped me get some of the final pieces into perspective I think &amp; see someone else who is bipolar discuss what happened to me in a different way..tl;dr: Medicine should only be used as a last resort. The human mind is capable of repairing itself if given a chance.edit** this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Az9SCgaeKdc [info] None [info] 1304413250
icaaryal [info] I had a medical bill for my 5 day admission to a hospital that went unpaid by the insurance company because they didn't consider it a medical emergency (I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and admitted myself during a psychotic manic episode).  The bill was for $15,000.  When the hospital pursued payment from me, they asked for $9,000.  I basically did nothing about it.  It went to collections.  I told them there was no way I was going to be able to give them that money in any sort of lump sum but I've been making payments for the past few months for about $300.  I have no concern for my credit as it was already hosed by my mania-fueled spending and subsequent credit card debt.I've been thinking of just disabling the debit card they charge to, closing my bank account, and ceasing payment.  Since it's a medical debt, what could I expect if I were to do this? [info] None [info] 1305233521

rseymour [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 11 years ago.  I think doctors have made it better.  There is something wrong with me.  This is a mental illness, so it is in my entire nervous system.  In 100 years people will look back and think bipolar people were linked by genetic factors, possibly [mitochondrial defects](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=mitochondrial+defect+bipolar+disorder&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=1).  We don't know the long term side effects of all drugs now, but we know that the long term side effect of bipolar ([suicide](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=suicide+in+bipolar&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=1)/accidental death) is far more likely.  The first time I ever experienced mania was beyond incredible.  I knew the answer to everything, everything clicked, I saw past the boundaries of society and into the essence of everyone and everything.  So treated I finished my masters in December and I'm on track to finish my PhD this summer.tl;dr: does anyone else think bipolar disorder is a treatable illness and accepting of treatment in lieu of something better????.....because I wish I could live without psychiatric drugs but I realize that I'd rather be safe than hospitalized (and on drugs regardless)bipolar and relatively cool with it.**so...**It's an important thing when your disease makes you 60 times more likely to kill yourself.  That's scary!  If you know someone who has died by their own hand... It's devastating.  Please do what it takes to come to terms with bpd, with what you can do to protect yourself.  It took me a decade to find the right pills to take, and I'm sure that will keep changing in time.  Stay vigilant.  Don't lose your skeptical attitude, but recognize that it is a dangerous disorder.

chotheamazing [info] I spent 2 years at Heritage RTC in provo, utah from 2004 - 2006. Now this is one of the better of the schools, but still has some flaws. Originally my mom was going to place me at Provo Canyon but after hearing horror stories about it through friends parents as well as local support group families she decided against it and canceled the bed they had on hold for me.A little back history, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 11. Didn't really dabble too much into drugs, but started to closer towards the few months before I was sent there. I mainly had a lot of lows from the bipolar, and dealt with self harm and several suicide attempts. Now Heritage had the double standard.. boys were allowed to have CD players, girls couldn't. Boys were allowed to listen to radio stations the girls were allowed to listen to. Just random small stuff like this is what I experienced from Heritage.The only thing that made my 2 year experience slightly uncomfortable while being boarded up there was the fact that we would frequently visit the church to hold meetings with our unit/dorm. I'm Christian, so I didn't really have too big of a problem about being in there, but out of common courtesy they are supposed to put the blinds down over all the paintings and crosses. This actually caused a lot of drama with the other girls who were atheist. I stand by them, it may be something most individuals can overlook, but its just something that should be done anyway. I developed a great friendship with 2 of my counselors and we would always sit and talk about life and my issues and just general stuff.. sometimes they would bring up the whole religious thing off topic. I personally have things against the ideas and beliefs of mormonism, and the fact that sometimes they would try to bring it up in a therapuetic matter just didn't work out.My experience overall was very beneficial. I had been in and out of psych wards since I was 11, and medicated heavily for 7 years. I feel that my personal experience actually benefited me. I don't use coping skills, or any of the cliche terms and activities they used. But the general ideas gave me a great insight behind basic techniques and survival skills to being a "norm" in society.I left Heritage graduating a year early from high school, and went off my meds the minute I got home. It was a bit rocky at first of course, especially being on Serequol for almost 7 years at that point, and being on the trileptol for a little over 1 year. I have been off my medication now for 6 years and have been doing great. I saw a therapist for the first few months out of heritage, and just started up again because I had been feeling a bit off for quite sometime now.It is very unfortunate that you had to deal with this, and I feel that the word should get out there that some schools do stuff like this. But just to put it out there, not all of them are like this. I feel that being placed at Heritage made me very fortunate. A lot of girls at Heritage came there as a step down program from other schools (provo canyon, wilderness, cross creek, island view, etc.). Provo was the worst I heard about, where staff were blatantly having "relationships" with the clients. Dating them, giving them special privileges for sexual acts, and more. **TL;DR** I spent 2 years at Heritage with little to no issues. Not every school is like what the OP is saying, but a majority of them are and need to be closed.**EDIT** Was also going to add about the restraints. I had been sent to ISU (intensive support unit) several times for the smallest of things. Even for having a disagreement with a staff member because I felt that what they were saying was wrong. I had one experience where I was crying really hard and they wanted to send me down there for the night. And they had the staff guys come to get me and they just kind of dragged me, didn't even give me the oppurtunity to walk myself or ask me if I was going to cooperate. I was crying so hard I told them that I had to throw up, and they still kept walking and I ended up throwing up all over them and myself because they wouldn't stop. That was pretty much the worst I had ever experienced at Heritage. [info] None [info] 1306517287
tonybaldwin [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 23 years ago.  I used medication for all of about 6 months.I deal with it now with meditation, not medication (and I'm atheist, so it's not a religious matter, just objective observation of the the emotional state from a detached perspective keeps said emotional state from having a deep impact, sort of takes away its power).I don't code for a living (but do for a hobby), but can relate to the difficulties in focusing on work (I am professionally a translator, so also get paid to think, essentially), and, yeah, sometimes I just take that objective look, say to myself,"well, kid still has to eat, rent's gotta get paid" and do my best until it passes.  It passes a lot faster after23 years of separating myself from it, as opposed to prior wallowing in it (crying in my beer and listening to the Smiths and shite). [info] None [info] 1306715176
cjhard [info] When I was a kid, I don't think it was ever so obvious. I was never into sports, or any of the boys shows like Dragonball Z.I played with the toys my parents bought me, and never really ventured into the girls isle at the store, mostly because my dad would immediately go to the toy cars section for himself and I was brought up to follow my parents closely everywhere.I hated clothes shopping, especially trying stuff on. Eventually my parents just bought whatever they thought looked good to them on me. For a while I wore jeans, denim jacket, and a black t-shirt. Before then it was beige school uniform pants and a maroon polo. Or whatever else they picked out for me. As soon as I was old enough to pick out my own clothes I went all black all the time because it just felt like it kept me always in the background.I remember when I was a kid the teacher read a story and in it was a kid that was always scowling because he thought that's what older boys were supposed to be like.I hated getting my haircut, I always wanted to have it long but nobody taught me how to take care of it until I started feeling ok to experiment and learned to make better use of the internet.So for the longest time I was that creepy kid in the corner, never socializing with anyone, wearing all black, sunglasses and looking always angry, with a retarded looking jewfro.I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was a kid too because I was always angry. It was the only way I knew how to express myself and how I felt. I remember a few times being extremely depressed and never wanting to get out of bed because I just had this overwhelming feeling that I really should have been born a girl. I couldn't tell anybody about that though, ever. Certainly I was crazy. The sleep deprivation and the fact that I wasn't eating right anymore made my emotions even less stable.When I  was really little I played with LEGO bricks and hotwheels and other boys toys, but only because that's all I had. I had two brothers that are both male, whenever commercials for gendered toys came on it became a competition to want the cool boys things and make fun of the weaker one by saying he wanted the girls toys because everything we saw in advertising painted girls as weaker and less capable, and all their toys weren't nearly as feature-complete.Being called a girl was an insult to us, because we were born boys, we were given inherent privilege and to deny us that equated to calling us inferior. I tried so damn hard to be a regular boy because I didn't know anything different.Whenever my parents weren't hogging the computer I was on there doing anything and everything that was interesting at the time. I learned HTML and CSS when I was 8, became a pirate by 10.I never even "crossdressed", or felt any need to. When I played pretend, I almost always made up a character that had all the coolest traits that I could think up. A lot of transformation, but never anything transgender. Vampire bat, or some liquid metal mutant that could mimic the shape of anything, or werewolves.To anyone outside my head, I was a normal little boy. Even when I was suffering gender identity conflicts the hardest, my mom just thought my brain was messed up and had me doped up. There certainly were plenty of signs, but not any of them really obvious. I never straight up told my parents I should be a girl until I was 16. Everybody's experience is different, even with all our similarities we still lived differently. Be thankful your child is telling you so bluntly, you can save him or her so much pain later if you listen and accept your child as your child regardless of gender.When I came out to my mom at 16 she said a lot of things that still make me cry if I remember them today. I went back into the closet for many years and now I've basically cut her out of my life. For as much as I wish she could just acknowledge me as her daughter, I feel as if it would be better if I just left one day and never talk to her again.I wouldn't wish my situation on any family. Let your children know you love them, and your love is not conditional. Let them know that you don't disapprove of any sexual or gender identities, that you'll love them just the same no matter how their life unfolds for them.If I weren't crying now I'd go on. I know this reply is very disjointed, and I hope my point didn't get lost somewhere. [info] Claudia [info] 1308450142

brunswick [info] (note: this doesn't deal with this specific situation at all)Since I've seen quite a few negative anecdotes about psychiatry. I was diagnosed with bipolar I back when I was 18. Hallucinations and various delusions during manic epsiode and a previous (barely) failed suicide attempt. After some incompetence on behalf of my college's psychiatrist, I moved back home. The psychiatrist I managed to find was this md ph.d at a local hospital, and the initial consult was over two hours long. After this, he prescribed me some meds and gave me his personal cell phone number and told me to text/call him if I ever had a problem.A week or two later, I started having some unfortunate side effects, so I ended up testing him on a Saturday. He replied back in under 5 minutes saying he could meet with me in a couple hours. Eventually, we managed to figure out a good med combination. Fastforward a long time later, I'm actually (nearly) completely functioning with a couple small side effects. It's been ages since I've had an episode and have actually been able to handle a very demanding and stressful career.**tldr** not all psychiatrists are horrible people. Some are actually very good doctors and are incredibly caring about their patients. Like with all medical specialties (and humanity in general), there's a spectrum. [info] None [info] 1309842530

bipolarSamanth0r [info] Okay Lets do this:First: The penis issue.It has definitely gotten smaller (atrophied?) However...I uh...yeah...was uh quite large before so this wasn't a huge issue. I find I don't really get random erections but I'm 'good to go' when I need to be, if that makes sense. I find when I get horny I tend to 'leak' a little bit and get kinda wet and my start deep breathing and stuff, get a bit flushed.On the mental stability:I've been on premarin sprio for a long time, I've been diagnosed with bipolar type II and aspergers. I've been in pysch ward a bunch of times, most recently last april.My mental instability has gotten worse since estrogen, I can't deny that. While I function better in terms of sense of self and personality and feel amazingly comfortable in my skin, I am well and truly a complete and utter nutcase. I've never been mentally stable both before and after, and I make no claims to it. I would say the first year of HRT was a wild ride for me in terms of emotions and it made my mood swings worse, bipolar is pretty specific so, it made my manic episodes 'higher' and my depressive episodes 'lower'.I'm on a lot of medication for psychiatric reasons, oh and a lot of psych meds can have an effect on libido particularly SSRI's so don't go attributing sexual side effects to e if you're on SSRI's or benzo's because they often cause the problems in my experience.And to get an idea of HRT results, here is me looking super cool and nerdy at a recent D&amp;D session http://i.imgur.com/x9Bf8.jpg [info] None [info] 1311922293
rthrtylr [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, best mate had a lot to say about how it didn't change anything and all that sticking together and being supportive and crap, turned out he'd gone behind my back, told everyone I was mental and untrustworthy (with exaggerated "examples" of my behaviour), ended up with me not being able to trust myself and going into recluse-mode for two years. Which wasn't hard since I didn't have but two friends left who'd still speak to me. And all the while he kept on giving me the "best mate" front, (which frankly I found a bit gay anyway) till I called him out. And of course, my calling him out got turned into me-going-completely-sociopath at him.And what sucks is that as I type this I still wonder if what I'm saying is true, or if in some way he was right, I mean after all, I had an undiagnosed manic disorder all that time. Only...everything was cool till I got diagnosed and treated. Still doubt myself though.But hey ho. Fuck 'im.

Ee1izzie [info] Hey, another 64-year-old here. I want to contradict what peebagger said. I've also been unmotivated/lazy/procrastinating all my life.

Although I don't feel comfortable with a lot of the politics that go into psychology and the diagnosing process, this is one of the disorders that I'm more willing to accept (out of the others I have been given.)  I know because of the manic episodes.  When your mind is racing and you can't sleep and you are thinking grand thoughts, well, that's often only one thing-- mania.  [info] None [info] 1315280945
Leemur89 [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar I and have been hospitalized three times in the past year for psychotic manic episodes. I believe my rampant drug use - marijuana, lsd, ecstasy - greatly accelerated my manic episodes. That being said i have been fine for a year with just a biweekly shot of risperidol an antipsychotic. Medication can garuntee the ceasing of relapsing manic epiodes but ultimately it comes down to how severe your episodes are. Are the sideeffects of the medicine worse than the outbreak of a manic episode? For me they are not so i take my meds. If they are worse than i would say ask for a change of meds rather than stop taking them. [info] None [info] 1315614939
balletboot [info] Were you immediately diagnosed with it? Or were you given another diagnosis first? How old were you?Has DBT actually helped? Any other therapies, medications?What stigma have you faced?Long story short, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 16 and told that I may have BPD but that they didn't want to diagnose me with it until I was older because of the stigma. I'm 18 now and terrified to go to a therapist because I know the symptoms I have are characteristic of BPD far more than bipolar, and I'm scared that it won't help and then I'll have that on record.

lankira [info] I, too was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. However, I don't have the psychosis nor symptoms as severe as the ones you listed (mania for me is mostly just the rage, self-destructive behavior, and mild insomnia). I am also rapid-cycling (my cycle is weekly to biweekly instead of the yearly "standard").Before I was diagnosed with bipolar, a doc had assumed it was PMDD, and prescribed a birth control to help with that. The pill only made my periods worse and didn't help with the psych problems. Conclusion: Sometimes, even MDs don't know the difference. [info] None [info] 1316800636

Hcox [info] Hi. I was diagnosed with bipolar a number of years ago and have struggled with it. After moving back in with my parents, I was having lots of trouble keeping work. This lasted years. Eventually, my parents kicked me out. I found a job as a delivery driver and supported myself, though not completely, for the next two years before returning to school.  By that time, my parents let me move back in. Throw yourself into whatever work you get. Once you're on your own, there are fewer distractions.   [info] None [info] 1317574954
RollerDoll [info] Sadly, I don't think you can know for sure until you're completely on the other side of Armageddon.  I know that when my husband and I were in the thick of it, if getting a divorce were easy and clear-cut, we probably would have.When I was in grad school, my bipolar disorder got way out of control and I ended up in a psych ward for a weekend.  The year leading up to it was cold and pretty loveless in my marriage; my husband and I were much more like roommates than a married couple.  Absolutely anyone outside of the situation looking in would have recommended divorce, especially since things didn't improve after my hospital stay.  I was very depressed and physically (literally) could not get out of bed or eat without some assistance for two months.  During this time, I gave absolutely no indication to my husband that I appreciated anything he did -- he worked crazy overtime to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table, then came home to take care of, basically, an invalid.  The double whammy for him is that he works with psych patients all day, and got to come home to one.  I have no idea why he stayed.  It was a pretty hurtful situation on my end, too, because he was in survival mode and could not show love or compassion, merely clinical practicality.  It took a very long time for both of us to break down our walls and heal from it.When I finally hit on medication that worked, it was like that scene in Wizard of Oz where the world goes from black and white to color.  The both of us worked like hell to repair our relationship and forgive past hurts.  The past 4 years have been happier than either of us could ever have predicted... I think part of that is the utter confidence that we can get through absolutely anything together, because we've already been to hell and back.On a side note, this is why I really fucking hate the "don't stick your dick in crazy" posts all over Reddit.  I'm really glad my husband didn't write me off when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. [info] None [info] 1318363244
Le7 [info] You can't bother others with it. That makes you selfish. I have been diagnosed with bipolar, but nobody knows it unless I tell them.

AniseSeed [info] I'm in a very similar boat. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for 14 years. Death only became scary once I got stable. I look at it this way: fearing death means I now realize that my life is worth living. When I'm at the very bottom, life seems like an annoyance more than anything, but stable... I'm in love with it and can't imagine it ending. It's interesting perspective.  [info] None [info] 1319000164

fugly2 [info] Hey I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well haha. Funny that I discover r/meditation and your post here after having posted some stuff about it in another subreddit.Well, for me meditation really is a grounding exercise ("ground" as opposed to the more "spiritual" side of having thoughts and being in "other worlds" than the here and now). When I'm depressed it is mainly because I'm not staying with my own feelings (in the chest mainly, for me) but ignore them and have my attention somewhere far away (a girl that is not here, something I did in the past, worries about me-feeling-sad, et cetera). Meditation helps me a lot to get the attention inwards and stay with myself. I do this also in everyday life by looking at things around me and name them, noticing what I'm feeling (not why), and trying not to judge myself (also not judging for judging ;) ). I think I'm a lot happier because of the 2x15 minutes and the mindfulness I do.I also meditated when I'm "manic". The manic state feels really good, but I tend to have a lot of ideas about all the great stuff I'm going to do. So in the same sense as above it helps me to ground and realize that everything I'm looking for and want to do, and everything I'm feeling, is in the present moment. So keep it up, sleep well, and don't be stupid (fly from the ground :) ).PS: Have you heard about Sean Blackwell? His YouTube channel [BipolarOrWakingUp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_458663&amp;src_vid=Db8AYSrs2kk&amp;v=BnsTNEXMRL8) has a lot of videos with an interpretation of his own experience. He links the bipolar manic crisis (or (happy) psychosis - which I have experienced a few times), with satori in Zen, kundalini in yoga, samadhi in Hinduism and the visions of Christian saints. It really helped me to have a better story to integrate my ego in, so to say, and stop with meds (after the first "psychosis" - which actually was really fun except for the period of meds and hospitalization afterwards - I have never "relapsed" in anything I couldn't handle afterwards (with friends who know how I think about it to support me, but still)). Check it out! :)PPS Also: [The Stormy Search for the Self: A Guide to Personal Growth Through Transformational Crisis](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stormy-Search-Self-Personal-Transformational/dp/087477649X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323120366&amp;sr=1-1).

misterPhyrePhox [info] I started experiencing mood swings in college. I would get depressed in summer and autumn, and become very happy and active in winter and spring. I didn't understand what was happening to me or pick up on the trend until junior year when, following my worst depressive episode ever, I had a full on manic episode. After I began experiencing delusions of grandeur, I had a breakdown where I started screaming "I'm not crazy" over and aver again. A security guard found me (I was in an academic building late at night) and called the police, who called an ambulance. I spent a week in the psych ward where I was diagnosed with bipolar I.

ketasetcake [info] I'm a 19 year old guy from Sweden and have been depressed for about 2 years now. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder (II) just like my mother. Lately I've been feeling quite okay... I'm not as sad as I used to be but my mood is still shifting between anxious and 'OK', and at a horrible rate too. Before when I was really depressed (sadness, suicidal ideation, apathy) in addition to just very anxious I used to cut up my arms very badly. My both forearms are covered in pretty severe scars. This I am ashamed of! And I regret it very very much, although, when I did slash my arms I couldn't care less. [info] None [info] 1323844446
fragilebroken [info] ECT is not some magic solution to feeling horrible.  It doesn't even always work.  It has horrid cognitive side effects that don't always wear off.  Are you saying you've been trying various medications for a total of eight+ months or that you've given each of several medications eight+ months to work?  If it is the first, keep trying medication because it can take several months for any given psych med to balance you out significantly.  In the grand scheme of things allowing less than a year of conventional treatment attempts before resorting to something like ECT is overzealous.  I am diagnosed with bipolar I and have been in treatment since the beginning of 2003.  My doctor - who I've been seeing for the majority of that time - did not consider ECT an option until this summer.  Having been through that experience, aside from being able to say "yeah, tried that too" I regret having done it.  It didn't help at all; it cost a ridiculous amount, which was mostly covered by my insurance luckily; and I basically lost four+ months of my life due to the cognitive side effects.  I'm finally beginning to regain my short term memory, having had my last treatment in October. [info] None [info] 1324324728
TheGMan323 [info] Be as understanding and forgiving as possible. If she snaps at you when she's angry, don't yell at her. Realize that she is not in control of her emotions most of the time and did not really mean to yell at you. If she is crying at some restaurant and making a scene, don't let your parents (or someone else) pester her to stop crying. Comfort her, but give her her space. Even if she's acting out in front of people and possibly aggravating you in the process, try to remain calm and treat the situations as delicately as possible. Don't ever make her feel like she's not normal--because she is normal. Also, **THIS IS A BIG ONE**: Do not go around telling every person you know that she is bipolar unless your sister specifically tells you it is okay to do that (or asks you to, for some reason). I love my mother, but when I was diagnosed with bipolar she had a tendency to tell almost anyone she talked to that I had bipolar disorder and this led to most people treating me like I was some specimen at a museum who shouldn't be touched or breathed on the wrong way. "Oh, hiiii. How are yooooou doing?" They were talking to me like I was mentally challenged or something. (Not to insult the mentally challgenged.) Make her feel like she's normal and just as cool as everyone else--because she is! Edit: And yes, being available for her to talk to you is important. I have a very, very loving family, but a lot of times when I talk to them about something that is very important to me, they quickly tune out of the conversation and just try to pretend like they're listening. There is nothing more hurtful than this. Either give her 100% of your attention or don't give her any. She will know the difference. Also, I just have to say it is very encouraging to see a post like this. Please let your sister know that the teen years are the worst emotionally (especially for bipolar people), but it gets better after that.  [info] None [info] 1324402041

guuurl [info] When I was in high school I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and they prescribed me lamictal. I was only on it for two months but those were the worst two months of my life. But at the end of those two months I also felt like I had more clarity on my situation in life than I have ever had. I was in a verbally abusive relationship that had just become physically abusive. I didn't tell my parents what happened, but I was crying (literally) for help. It was after a bout of screaming in the middle of the night and me repeatedly saying "I don't want to live anymore", that they decided I needed to see a doctor (the almost had me committed right then, instead they locked up all the knives and pills). The pain I felt was real and felt physical. The analogy of treading water most accurately describes it, because I literally felt like I was drowning. I would never actually kill myself, but I used to wish something would happen, like I'd get hit by a semi while driving, and it would all just end. At the end of my rounds with lamictal, I realized that I needed to end things with my abusive boyfriend, cut ties, and do things for me instead. That was 4 years ago and I can honestly say even when things are bad, they aren't nearly as bad as they were.  [info] None [info] 1325220830

baronessofbipoles [info] I don't think being literate, decently educated, or having an above average IQ has anything to do with it.When I was diagnosed 6 years ago, I was 17 and at the mercy of my doctors.  I'm above average intelligence, but I didn't know anything about psychology or the DSM, let alone that there would be books and articles online that I could look at.  And 6 years ago, there wasn't much online about it because I *did* look into it a bit right after I was diagnosed.  I just remember not understanding it very well and writing a blog entry saying "I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder... whatever that means."I was essentially the only bipolar person in my high school too (maybe even my town, we're small and despite my efforts to reach out and find someone else in the community to connect to, I found no else with this strange illness).  While I wanted help, I didn't want this label slapped on my forehead to further ostracize me from my fellow high schoolers.  My mom didn't believe that I was bipolar so I had no support from her.  I was distraught, suicidal, couldn't find a good pdoc or therapist, and I was completely on my own with it.Someone that young needs guidance.  Hell, even some of us that are older when we're diagnosed need guidance.  I didn't even know until last fall just how many people had bipolar disorder, what was normal for us, or how horrible untreated bipolar can get.So yeah, I'm going to go out on a limb and say it has nothing to do with intelligence.

ForTheLongestTime [info] I cannot even express how frustrating that is. I was diagnosed with bipolar-II in April, after dropping out of school because I could neither think, sleep, remember peoples names, or go to class. I had these problems since last December, which makes this the fourteenth month of symptoms. I've gone to neurologists, sleep labs, psychiatrists, psychologists, had extensive blood panels, and more. From what I've read, and in my opinion, I may be on the bipolar spectrum, but I'm not at all full-blown Bi-polar II. I simply have never had a manic, hypomanic, or even excited episode. Even my psychologists agree that I don't present, nor have I ever presented, with manic or hypomanic symptoms. So, in short, while I have a very sharp and dedicated psychiatrist, she simply has not addressed the problem in any way. I dropped out of my tier-1 research university, turned down the biggest research opportunity of my life, and haven't been able to read well for fourteen months. Obviously I'm very frustrated. I think that I, like everyone else in my small town, walks into the office, says they're having a hard time, and is instantly diagnosed with bipolar-II. As a not-so-funny-anecdote, I think the best part about going to see her is doing the backwards numbers test. Prior to this, I could do 9 - 10 with 75% consistency. Doctors will say that this is pretty good, but all of my friends seem to be able to do about 8 - 9, so I highly doubt it is. Well, currently I can do about 7 - 8 at 75% consistency, and 9 at 25%. My mother can do better. My psychiatrist constantly reminds me, when I say that I am far, far away from what I used to do, that I do better than everyone in her office. Then I remind her that almost everyone else she sees is a geriatric. tldr: I don't think I'm bipolar, and I've lost 10 months of my life to a woman who thinks I am. That felt good.

To pull a knife on your own father? There's got to be some issues there. From personal experience, I definitely would advise you to get a professional's opinion.In the past, although my anger was by no means as severe, I was a really short-tempered, irritable person that could be set off by the tiniest things. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and one of the symptoms of this illness is irritability. Now I'm medicated and it helps a lot.

chotheamazing [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when i was 11 years old. to top that off, being a pubescent female.. hormones + mental issues are not your friend.i wasn't afraid of anything. didn't understand anything leading to consequences because i lived so far in the moment. i wasn't afraid of dying. in fact, at that moment in time it might have been welcoming, to say the least.there was one incident i remember, where i was having a 'sun-down'.. basically around 6-7 every night id have almost a black out episode where i would yell, scream, fight, etc. whoever was near me or in my way. then, when i would come to, i would just cry because i had no idea what had happened. this night, there was episode after episode until when i came to, i was in the parking lot at a psych ward i had been kept at multiple times at this point. i remember finding scissors in the back seat &amp; tried to cut myself in front of my parents.. my step-dad saw this &amp; tried to take them away from me so i swung the scissors at him &amp; gave him a couple minor scratches.From age 11 - 17 i was in &amp; out of 13 psychiatric facilities, had 3 suicide attempts, was on a hefty amount of medication that was always changing, went to a school in los angeles that is catered towards behavioural issues (paid for by the school district), then I was sent out of state to a residential boarding school in utah. I'm not gonna lie, being institutionalized like that at what should be one of many milestones for a lifetime, sucked. But I don't regret a minute of it. If it wasn't for my parents never giving up on me, I would be dead. There is no way around that fact. I was out of control, using drugs, drinking, hurting myself, &amp; hurting others who tried to stop me.It may be hard, but therapy is always a good answer. I've dealt with law enforcement who have tried to intervene, or have me use a police escort to a psychiatric facility &amp; it's not pretty. As someone who rebelled against everything the government stood for at that age, keeping the police out of it for as long as possible is a best bet.Right now I am 22 years old, have been off my meds &amp; stable for a little over 5 years, &amp; have been able to finally keep a job longer than 9 months without wanting to hate everyone or quit because I'm too depressed. Therapy was probably the best thing that ever happened to me.If you have any questions, or would like to talk, feel free to PM me.EDIT: reading some of the other posts now, i felt like i should share a little more information. when my mom found out i was cutting, she basically hid everything sharp in the house. all knives were in a locked closet in the kitchen. when I overdosed for the first time, she decided it was time to take control of all the medication in the house.. and would assist in giving the doses to me at the proper times.**my mom always told me this one line, and I never really understood it until i was able to truly see how i was.. "if you don't take control of your life, someone else will have to control it for you."**regarding the step-dad issue.. my biological father was abusive &amp; a drug addict. he would hit my mom, throw tv's at her, have wild party's &amp; leave drugs in my reach when I was a toddler. he left when I was 5 years old &amp; told my mom if she ever asked for child support, he would fucking kill her. my step-dad came into the picture when I was 6. I think there's always been some resentment from both sides. Me having the abandonment issue, where he wasn't my dad, and was trying to replace my dad (since when you're young.. you don't comprehend the danger of an environment too well when a parent is abusive).. and my mom &amp; step-dad tried to have kids at some point, but never managed to conceive. So I think at times he resents me too because of that. [info] None [info] 1329950923
ShittyPUAadvice [info] &gt;From the age of 25-29 I felt very lonely and grew extremely depressed. I was diagnosed with bipolar by a number of doctors and psychiatrists, though I was in denial for at least a year until I saw how much medication and therapy helped me. Though I'm making a MASSIVE oversimplification, it's funny how most mental issues go away once a person starts getting laid regularly.Check out /r/seduction with an open mind. Your case is not rare or uncommon. You have a desire for women, and no "coping" method will erase this desire. Go out and get yours (women), because unless you truly do not want companionship and what not, other hobbies will just be a mask for this deeper problem. Even if you took up extreme rock climbing or backyard skydiving, there will still be that nagging thought, "I want to have sex with awesome women". [info] None [info] 1331745793

onemoredrink [info] Mothers who are aware of mental health issues are one of the greatest blessings. My mom married my dad who ended up being bipolar (his family has a strong history of mental health) and she educated herself. I was diagnosed with bipolar at a very young age (like 12 or 13) and if it wasn't for her watching for signs and making sure I take all my medicine I highly doubt that I would be as well adjusted and able to cope on my own as I am today. So on behalf of kids, thanks :) [info] None [info] 1332694995
potatoesmcgee [info] I finally went to the counselors at my university last semester over a few issues, catalyzed by a terrible breakup.  I am not seeing a counselor at the moment because the ones at the school didn't click with me, but taking the time to go in helped on its own and got me set up with a psychiatrist and on medications that are helping.  I've been diagnosed with bipolar, which is a bit different than what you are dealing with, but the first step is the hardest and the most important. [info] None [info] 1332977910
bpbitch [info] But people who have diabetes say "I am diabetic". It's just like how people say "I am homosexual", "I am a man/woman", "I am an athelete", "I am an artist", "I am blonde", "I am European", etc. It's a concise and easy way to relay pertinent information.It's when you unwillingly define yourself by the words you use to explain yourself to others that a problem arises.And then why would I necessarily want to think like a Buddhist? Maybe I like being emotionally invested in things and overly attached to this world and all the joy and pain it carries. Perhaps for me, that is the meaning of life - to embrace the extremes in all their gut-wrenching glory.We are all entitled to opinions, and I respect yours; however, it's not objectively silly to attach yourself to a word, nor is it objectively silly to feed your ego. It is a different way of living. Bipolar is not part of my identity, but I say "I am bipolar" because when I used to say "I have been diagnosed with bipolar" it was because I didn't accept the diagnosis as being correct or valid, and was waiting for the clarification that it was all a horrible mistake. As a result, I didn't accept that there were things I needed to change since my mind/body was/is divergent and that I couldn't expect to be remotely stable unless I took certain precautions. Even saying "I have bipolar" is something I'm reluctant to do, because it sounds like I picked it up one day from the guy beside me and it's just like the flu, or like it's something I could one day stop having - but I still say that because I still try and distance myself from it out of part denial and part shame. "I AM bipolar" says it is part of me, that I can't remove it without destroying part of who I am, that I did not choose one day to have it or that I accidentally caught it when someone sneezed.

AtxAxLoss [info] I'm going to write a second comment trying to make out your thoughts, but I want to get out of the way what I think is really important first.r/Philosophy is not the place to come to for assessing your sanity according to your ideas. I don't say this as someone who particularly cares about managing the content of r/Philosophy but as someone who is in a situation like what you describe. A year ago I experienced unusual thoughts/thinking patterns in conjunction with a manic episode that put me in a psych ward for two weeks, where I was diagnosed with bipolar. It was a really disruptive experience and when I notice thoughts or behaviors that even just bear appearance to the ones I had at that time I get a little anxious.Putting aside that we aren't typically educated to make these assessments, in my experience mere ideas aren't enough to go by to make a judgment about your mental state. Like I said, I have thoughts like the ones I had while manic reasonably often since then. It's not the thoughts or ideas per se that matter, it's your reasoning and thinking, and your behaviors in light of them that stand out. Sleeping patterns, spoken language, irritability. We have no access to anything diagnostic about your situation.Ask yourself these questions: Are you taking meds? If so, have you missed any doses? Are you seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist? If so, ave you spoken to them about any warning signs you might have noticed? They are really the people you should be talking to, and if you aren't seeing anyone, I really think you should. If things have gotten out of hand before, you owe it to yourself to make sure it doesn't happen again. Be careful.tl;dr: I believe you have serious business going on. This is not the place for anything like serious business. [info] None [info] 1333511503
shesmadeline [info] I say "I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder." I feel like saying "I am bipolar" would make people more likely to judge you and define you as that rather than understanding it is an illness.

getinthetardis [info] My best friend is slowing starting to stop talking to me. It is really hard to go through. We used to talk for hours every day the past few years now she claims to be too busy to even say text a hi. A few things have led to it. She got a new girlfriend and has pushed me away since. I don't know if there is a lesbian version of "chicks before dicks/bros before hoes" but she is definitely not following it. I've tried talking to her about it but it goes no where. I can't make plans with for even a week in advance because she has to know what her girlfriend wants to do first. Then if she does make plans for me they usually get put on hold aalllll day then it's "Oh, i'm going out to dinner last minute chance. i'll text you when i'm done." then nothing. Don't hear from her at all. The cherry on top is I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few weeks ago and have been having a hard time dealing with it. all I really want is my best friend back so I have someone to talk to.

cynicallybipolar [info] No no, not at all. I am not saying mental illness doesn't exist. I am diagnosed with bipolar and it is debilitating. I understand that. I am not saying that these things don't exist. I am not saying that they are trivial.What I AM saying is that "normal" is relative. Sanity is relative. While there are very clear cases of mental illness and also insanity, sanity itself is up for debate. Some may say that one perspective is "normal." Others would disagree.Normal or sane is relative. Its definition changes from perspective to perspective. It is debatable.Wounds or broken bones are not healthy. Eating nothing or eating just sugar is not healthy. Never leaving a bed with no physical activity is unhealthy. However, the definition of a healthy diet and lifestyle is up for debate.We can see what is clearly unhealthy, ill or insane. However, a true definition of healthy and sane is relative. That is my point.Edit: Yes, I have been diagnosed with bipolar. It has literally brought my life to a halt. I have since then been put on medication and am seeing help so I can go back to school and finish my degree. When I made this account, my bipolar, my meds, and what I was experiencing was all that was on my mind. I couldn't help putting it in my username because it was the only thing I could think about. If someone tried to make light of what I was going through or say that it was in my head, they would not stay in my reach if they knew what was good for them.  I have definitely not have had the worst condition by far. However, this has paralyzed me and has had a terrible effect on my life for the past 6-7 years. I would never make light of someone's condition.PROTIP: Don't make assumptions or wild accusations about those assumptions. Also, saying one thing doesn't exist doesn't make the opposite as equally nonexistent. Cold doesn't exist, heat does. This is a logical fallacy. Please learn logic as well as the whole story before accusing someone else with venom. [info] None [info] 1335793391

trueXrose [info] *Did you hide your drinking from friends and family and if so how?I was aways drunk BEFORE a drinking event. So they SAW me nursing a drink an hour, when in fact I'd had a pint of liquir before I left the house.  I lived alone, but hid my alcohol, you'd come into my apartment and there wouldn't be a bottle in sight. (OF course, there's no way I acted as sober as I thought I did, and I probably reeked of whiskey.)*How often would you say you drank per day? Never drank at work. I'd roll out of bed at 7:30, work 8-5, have a drink in the car on the way home and drink my night away, almost every night. Weekends were a shit-show.*Realistically how much did it take to get you drunk?At 5'3 and 130lbs (female) I could put away a pint of whiskey and walk a straight line by the end of things. There was only one night that the bar doubted my ability to drive home, and that was that last night I ever drank.*Did you believe you accomplished more when drunk than sober?I accomplished nothing drunk, because I didn't care, and only slightly more sober because I needed to get to my next drink. At work, I did enough to get by without any one questioning my ability to do the job. I kept my house clean enough get by without any doubting my abililty to keep house.*How long could you go before you got the shakes?It took years to get to the point of the shakes - But just before my final attempt to get sober, I'd be shaking by the end of the work day. That's why I'd drink on the way home.*When did you start drinking?My junior year od high school, when my older friends went to college and started taking me to college parties.*What triggered your drinking the most?I started with partying and it spiralled out of control. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and learned, through long talks with doctors and therapists, that much of my drinking was self-medicating. But at the very, very end I was drinking because I felt sick when I WASN'T drinking. [info] None [info] 1337106255
engineeringandstuff [info] Long time reader, first time post.Your story moved me and I'm glad to hear stuff is going better for you two! I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (my doctors never told me 1 or 2, I'd guess 2) 4 years ago when I was 23. I underwent a manic episode of an 8 day period with 10-20 hours of sleep. I'm hoping my two weeks spent after that in the mental hospital are the hardest thing I will ever have to overcome. The worst was when I realized I had voluntarily entered the ward, but they wouldn't let me leave until I was healthy. I jumped over the counter and ran for the door. It was locked. Then, on the other side I saw my two best friends had come to visit. Nobody had told me they were coming to visit. I was pretty far along the continuum of manic behavior into what is called grandiose thinking. So by then it was really fucking with my head to see my friends there. Anyways, I didn't get to see them for about a month later. I really wanted to send my best wishes to you and your friend and offer my small experience living with bipolar disorder. After going through your post a second time I see that this all happened about a month ago, and it sounds like you two are figuring things out steadily. The best advice I got from people was *take things one day at a time*. For me living with bipolar disorder is like handling dynamite. If I do stuff correctly, nobody notices an explosion...but if I get sloppy, that shit will mess you up fast. As for the relationship stuff, I think it's super important that your friend learns himself well and how to handle his illness. The best you can do is support him when he needs it, which it sounds like you're doing a lot of now :) As far as saying "it won't affect the relationship," I can never be that naive :( I think you're awesome for supporting him, so fucking awesome. I just think there are some serious questions you two should to discuss about concerning your future, being as it is a genetic disorder. Stuff for me has gotten pretty much better with ups and downs. I finished college (the manic episode basically set me a year back) and now I'm living in a foreign country with a dream job. I really wish people understood mental illness better, like it should be taught in school. Nobody told me, "hey, one day you might end up in the hospital with a mental illness!" I often describe the feeling as winning the lottery, without realizing had been playing the game. Thanks for taking the time to read my reply, you rock. [info] None [info] 1337362819

TheGMan323 [info] 1. I also went through years of experimenting with drugs until I found the right combination that worked for me. It can be frustrating, but you just have to realize that different medications work for different people. There is a medication out there that works for you--you just haven't found it yet. 2. I'm not quite sure how to answer this one. Luckily, my family and friends have been very supporting since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My parents are psychologists so they come from a very informed perspective rather than the perspective of ingorance/fear that many parents or families display when faced with this. I think a non-aggressive approach would be the best way to deal with this. It might be very tempting to argue with the person and say, "You have no idea what I'm going through!" or "You're stupid if you can't understand this!", but when you take a step back, acting like that will only further this person's belief that you are unstable and unable to fit into the normal fabric of society. I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but although we are afflicted with bipolar disorder, we need to blend into a society that has certain expectations of behavior. Rebelling against those expectations might be satisfying in the short term, but could be devastating in the long term.  [info] None [info] 1337718941

theawesomepart [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by several different doctors over the years, but my issues ended up being significantly more complex (not that bipolar disorder isn't complex as it stands). My diagnoses and meds ebbed and flowed as I aged, quit jobs and moved to different states on a whim, racked up debt, destroyed friendships, went in and out of therapy (group and individual), broke bones and wrecked cars, checked myself into detox for alcohol addiction, and did my time in out-patient rehab. I am now stabilized in recovery sans meds. I'm still self-obsessed and prone to addiction, but am also more self-aware, much more considerate, and less impulsive. Ultimately therapy and honesty (rather than a tidy diagnosis) have pulled the real issues out of me and have taught me to manage my chemistry better than medications ever did. I'm not saying medication isn't necessary/beneficial for some people, but pills don't truly help everyone. They made me dopey and certainly didn't motivate me to identify my issues or learn to cope/thrive with them. I AM thriving now btw--life is good.It's shocking how quickly doctors were willing to hand out shot-gun diagnoses and medication to me. I wager you'll find someone willing to issue you a bi-polar diagnosis and medication right quick but that may not help you stop the destructive behaviors. Rather than asking for a diagnosis I think it's healthier to take your time examining your symptoms--i.e. these behaviors--and talk them through extensively with a good therapist. Be extremely honest--denial and shame are the enemies of a true diagnosis and effective treatment. I needed doctors interested and clever enough to distrust me to get to this point (3.5 years sober and counting). Keep searching until you find creative medical practitioners who aren't in a rush to gather a co-pay and with whom you can really be honest. It was a difficult road to stability for me and a bunch of fast diagnoses got in the way from time to time. Best of luck. Be gentle and patient with yourself.**tl;dr I'm a patient, not a doctor so I'm speaking from my experience only: Find a doctor/therapist who listens and digs. Fast diagnosis may delay actual healing. Pursue alternatives to quicky prescription interventions.** [info] None [info] 1338351219

urbanexotic [info] I concur. I voluntarily checked myself into a lockdown unit for 3 days when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Funny story that. I didn't belong there, but having medical insurance while lacking a primary care physician put me in a weird limbo. I could not get regular treatment without a referral from my nonexistent primary care physician, but did not qualify for any other psych care facilities because I wasn't low income. So I wound up in this lockdown facility on a floor in one of my local hospitals because they were the only place that would take me. It was a horrible place. Everyone there was loaded up with drugs, had no access to books, physical activity, or even sunshine. All there was for entertainment was a shitty t.v. tuned to soaps and reality television. Probably one of the worse places for a mentally ill person to try to get their shit together. Also, there's a good chance I was misdiagnosed. If I have bipolar, it's probably the weakest form of it in existence. [info] None [info] 1339878061

cyanwolfy [info] I think I might be able to offer a different perspective. I know a lot of people who are fans are Harry Potter that have only recently read the books I am one of those people. It may seem that it be a fan of something you would need every component but that isn't always true. Almost three years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It was such a confusing time in my life. I had to start home schooling. I was going to doctors almost everyday. I basically had a breakdown and was trying to pick up the pieces. Getting up was hard for me to do and one of the only ways I could was if I was watching a movie. I would actually get out of bed, get ready, eat and watch a movie. Then I felt more like I was part of the world for awhile. I starting going through our movie collection and ending up watching Harry Potter. I can't truly describe to you what watching that first movie did to me. It gave me a brief glimpse of happiness that I had forgotten. Immediately after having this amazing experience I watched all of the Potter movies that were out at that point which was The Half Blood Prince. For the first time since I had been diagnosed I had a good day. The idea that the most powerful magic in a magical world is a magic that I have was so powerful to me. Love, friendship, compassion. I was so lost in my life and for some reason the world of Harry Potter felt like my home. It was a place where things made sense. I fell in love with Harry Potter that day. I had read the chamber of secrets before for a reading group in elementary school and I really did not like it but I decided to give number 3 a try but for some reason I just still didn't like it. So you could say that I was a fan of the movies and not the books at this point but the thing is I was still a fan of Harry Potter. As my recovery continued I watched the movies through many many times. I learned of all of the actors, directors, and general going ons with the filming. My friends and family were constantly hearing of my love for Harry Potter and I made everyone I knew watch it. I think the point I am trying to make is that a lot of people are fans of something because of a deep personal connection they feel with it. I think it is a bit unfair to say someone isn't a true fan just because they haven't read/seen/disliked some part of the Harry Potter world. I have now read the books several times, been to the Wizarding world of Harry Potter and even attended Leakycon. I considered my self a fan before all that and I do now. [info] None [info] 1340779348

shnebb [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was younger. They put me on lexapro and lithium. After years of "help" that went nowhere, I finally gave up on the world. And it turned into something positive. I realized no drugs or person could help me but myself. Anyway, I saved up a bunch of money and moved to California and started surfing every day. I slowly learned how to control my emotions by basically telling myself that "Yes, you can kill yourself (or write the greatest novel, or start a revolution, etc.) but wait a few weeks first." After a while, I kind of just learned to let my emotions do their own thing while I began functioning as your average joe.Anyway, I don't know if I was previously misdiagnosed or whatever, but I haven't taken any meds in more than five years, and I'm as happy as can be with only occasional issues.Two more things: If you're a heavy drinker, you gotta cut back.

mersh_perderder [info] Sorry, I didn't I mean to say that your highs should be destructive as such, high moods can definitely be the opposite to destructive -I know when I get manic (in a happy way) I feel quite in tune with universe, and feel like I could literally do anything, and get loads done, which from what you've said sounds true for you too. Although I was diagnosed with bipolar, I rarely get the happy manic moods, I normally get the highly irritable manic moods.Once you've found a doc, you should tell him about your highs as much as your lows, cos going on regular antidepressants could make things worse if you do have bipolar.I hope this helps a bit, and I hope you manage to get yourself a doc to give you the correct diagnosis :) [info] None [info] 1343978241

I remember as a kid and animal-lover, I thought being a vet would be the greatest, but soon came to the realisation that I could never take the bad with the good - it would be far too depressing (especially since I was diagnosed with bipolar not too long after ha). In any case, I have so much respect for what you do, and I'm glad you do it because I know I couldn't. [info] None [info] 1344554604
samuelh73 [info] I've gone through that same situation, so I'll describe what happened to me (and you can decide whether it will work for you or not).I met a girl when I was about 19-20, and I had already known I was not straight (I had messed around with guys before, but no girls). Well, she paid a lot of attention to me and, to be honest, it was quite flattering (why wouldn't it be?). I thought perhaps I was bisexual because I developed a considerable feeling for her, and we decided to get married (this was before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II). I went ahead and told her immediately that I was bisexual and she had no issue with it (and as far as I could tell, she was sincere in that statement).The problem came up later when I realized I liked men more and, what's more, I preferred men over women. *That* was where her understanding broke down, and for good reason. It suddenly became an issue for both of us, and needless to say, it did not end well for either party.My ex-wife was a little conservative in some ways, but I couldn't tell you what girls today like/dislike, so that is something you would have to answer for yourself. But the important thing is to first find out which direction you lean sexually so if/when you decide to have the conversation with her you will have some foundation to work on. If you're just having mental sexual escapades (e.g., fantasies), mentioning it to her may not be the best idea (or she may go for that...I don't know her at all to say either way).TL;DR...You really need to find out for yourself whether you are gay, bi, or something inbetween, because it *may* cause problems down the road, but honesty is the best policy in situations like this.Just my two cents. :) [info] None [info] 1344917851
Shabhira [info] When I was diagnosed with bipolar a year ago I was put on Depakote and Risperdal. The risperdal caused me to gain all that weight and once I was taken off it I stopped gaining weight. So far the only other bipolar medication I have been on was Abilify for around 3-4 months although that didn't cause me to gain weight. Since then I've just been on depakote, and quite happily so.

TheGMan323 [info] Can't say I've had a bad experience. I've only seen one psychiatrist since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I don't see her anymore, but I don't have any complaints.

Menelly [info] And, once in a while it's both lifestyle choice *and* biology/medical condition type stuff.  ;)Once upon a time, I was 5'9 (OK, still am that) and 150 lbs or so (nowhere near that now...)  Then, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, went psychotic manic several times, and ended up on the med go round of a billion different psych meds, all of which tend to add pounds to the frame.  (Heard of Zyprexa?  The "joke" on that med is you'll gain 10 lbs filling the prescription.)  Now, I'm much larger than I used to be, and no, I don't eat as healthy as I should.  But that weight isn't shifting as long as I'm on a battery of psych meds, and I value sanity more than vanity.So yes, I may tuck into my Whopper (no mayo!) and apple fries (I'm not fond of the regular ones anyways) and someone is probably judging me cause I'm not tiny, and I don't care.  It's my life, and I'm more comfortable being me than I've been before.  :) [info] None [info] 1346727564
AsteroidShark [info] Oooh, borderline is rough. Even though I was diagnosed with bipolar at 13, a different psychiatrist told me I more resembled borderline than anything, though I was too young for an official diagnosis at the time (I was 16 and you must be 18 for a personality disorder diagnosis). I'm still not completely sure what to believe, though I deal with what seems to be like symptoms of both. It's also tough trying to figure out what I might actually have considering that as I've aged more, I've learned to deal with or at least hide a lot of these symptoms. But you're so right... those highs are great but I have to be careful because I'm far more likely to engage in risky behavior, specifically promiscuous sex. That part was fun for a while, it's really not anymore. Still, I wish I could induce this, as I am also currently in the low. And so sorry about your brother. Be safe and good luck.

KorgRue [info] That I am happy. I hide the fact that I have been dead inside for 5 years now. They all consider me to be a happy go lucky person, when in reality it is all a big act I put on for them.  I was diagnosed with bipolar I and suffer from ptsd (from active duty in a war zone) about 4 years ago. Nobody knows, including my girlfriend. When I am manic, faking happiness is easy. When I am depressed, it is excruciating for me to do much of anything, let alone feigning happiness and positivity. I hide my medications from everyone. I fear that she will leave me if I tell her now that I have hidden it from her for going on 4 years now. I fear that people will think I am crazy and/or pity me and I don't want either.

Aden_Sickle [info] A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, "strong anti social tendancies" and a schizoid affect. I have atypicsl reactions to most drugs, especially psychotropic drugs so taking any kind of medication comes with serious risks.

In reality I smiling cause I'm envisioning all the terrible things that could happen to you.On the outside: "his Josh.

danaofdoom [info] That sucks man, I'm sorry. I think you should confront her directly. Tell her that it was really not any of her business (in fact, its almost never appropriate to discuss someone else's medical history without their permission), and very embarrassing, and that you're disappointed that your own mother would humiliate and degrade you like that. Do this calmly. If you can't do it calmly, then write her a note. I guess you could have her retract the story but I'm not sure it would do much good. At the very least she owes you an apology.As for similar experiences, well, when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in high school (turned out to be a bullshit diagnoses, btw), my mother pretty much told her entire family and friends (I think it was some sort of "Oh look at how tough my life is! My daughter is bipolar!" thing). I had relatives that I hadn't spoken to in years coming out of the woodwork with unsolicited advice. Very humiliating for me. I eventually told her to knock it off, which lead to a huge fight, but she eventually did. [info] None [info] 1348012698

easyiris [info] I can almost empathise, especially with the Facebook thing.I haven't seen my biological father since I was three (also an alcoholic and bipolar but I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was in my late teens so I obviously don't judge). He wrote to me out of the blue when I was eighteen. We started emailing because I was too busy then to write back by post. Anyway, we've spoken on and off now for six years. I still haven't met him because I just don't feel ready to.One day, I had a friend request on Facebook from someone with no picture, no information, generic name. Accepted as I thought perhaps their profile was just very private. Seconds later, I get a message - it's my biological father, under a fake name. Promptly deleted him.I felt like it was a complete invasion of my privacy. He pretty much duped me, really. I kind of get how you might be feeling, there. Having your Mum add you to Facebook, which is probably a large part of your life - all your friends are on there, photos of you, statuses on what you've been up to and where you've been... I just think it's very invasive.Now, your Mum hasn't been in your life for a long time. She's missed out on a lot of key moments and she probably doesn't want to miss any more. She probably is very sorry and she probably did have her reasons. That's all great but it's not important right now.What's important right now is you. You are priority - she knows that. You're like a magical, super rare commodity that she needs a little piece of. YOU decide how much you give her an YOU decide when and how. Letters, emails, phone call, whatever.What's important is whether or not you feel comfortable with your estranged mother contacting you via Facebook. If I were you, I would (this is what I did with my father) make my profile incredibly private - nothing is visible to anyone, unless they are a friend all ready. I'd then give your Mother your email address and ask her to contact you via that from now on. You should make a new email address, don't give your normal email out.  I say this because my father also found my Twitter and started bringing up things I was talking about in a very creepy way. It made me feel incredibly uneasy. Also, sometimes, I would have had a shit day, would need to check my email for something and an email from him would be in my inbox. Sometimes I wouldn't want to read it straight away, you know? Sometimes, it would bring up more bad feeling and fuck up my day a bit more.Anyway. This is your life. It's up to you whether you're happy to email her, accept her on Facebook (I strongly advise you don't) or write each other letters. If you want to meet up with her, do so when you feel completely ready to. Don't let her guilt you into it. As I said, I've been talking to my father on and off for six years but I'm just not comfortable enough to meet him yet. And he nags all the time. It's pretty unbearable. Just keep the ball in your court and remember that there is no right or wrong way to go about things. Also, don't get your hopes up too much. I always imagined my biological father would be this amazing person (he went to the royal academy of music and RADA, was in the royal Shakespeare company) but he just wasn't. Unfortunately, he was an addict and he destroyed his life, throwing all of that away. I mean, the guy would have had everything. When we started speaking, he ended up being a manipulative, invasive, whiny man, via email and letters etc. It was pity story after pity story.There's a lot I could go into, emotionally, but it's not worth pounding out in one comment that will probably get buried. However, if you do read this, and you want some more personal advice, just ask. I understand how confused you probably are right now but I hope you realise that the ball is in your court. Don't allow yourself to be manipulated. Talk to her on your terms, if that's what you want to do, when you're ready, via a medium that you're most comfortable with.Sorry for the long post. I wish you lots of luck.Just wanted to add, after seeing a couple of comments - do not feel bad or sorry for your Mum because of the shit she did when she was unwell. As I said, I suffer from bipolar disorder and have done some crazy, completely horrible things. However, just because I can sometimes be unwell, doesn't mean it's an excuse for my behaviour. Sure, shit is hard but you forgive her and speak to her because YOU want to and not because she's bipolar and "didn't mean it". Doesn't matter what she did or didn't do - or what she may or may not do in the future - nor do the reasons for her behaviour matter. The damage has still been done. You do not forgive her because you feel sorry for her, you forgive her because you can genuinely make peace with her. Do it for you, not for her.I hope that makes sense. [info] None [info] 1348794179

shockadin [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about 8 years ago. I wont argue the merits of medication vs holistic treatment because I agree with both approaches. I was able to quit drinking with traditional meds. Its as simple as that. I  will say that Geodone gave me tardive dyskinesthia and that shit is bad. The newer meds Im on are far superior to the traditional stuff. With medication I dont drink, I dont lay out of work,I do housework,I spend time with my son, and I dont escape into WoW. When not medicated I do all of these things. The main thing is to someone who says I dont needs meds I say fuck you after 120 hours of no sleep. [info] Bipolar 1 [info] 1349044019
russlo [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder II. I'm medicated all the time. It's not been an easy life to get me to this point, but I try to be grateful for what I have. I've met a lot of people, and probably not "the most ungrateful person I know", but definitely deserving of mention, is a little son of a bitch 13 year old brother of an ex-girlfriend, named Mikey. Mikey got every single thing he ever wanted via tantrums, threats, and destruction of property and relationships. I'm not kidding. For instance, I would casually chat with him about video games, and he had every console I had ever wanted and some I didn't. His nephew, my ex's boy Vinnie, was just starting to play video games. I gave Vinnie my Gameboy (can't remember what version, I never played it that much, but I had a couple of the Pokemon games for it, and some other pretty sweet stuff that Vinnie enjoyed playing) and he started playing video games too. Happy, great kid. However, Vinnie also idolized his uncle, and would take many, many of his bad attitudes and behaviors and copy them and they would come out at the absolute worst times. He once threatened to stab us both (his mom and I) one morning. That wakes you up fast.At around this point, I had been dating her for a period of about 6+ months, and she was just starting to work me into her family life as she didn't know how I would react or fit. I had met her diabetic, do-nothing, abusive father, whom she had taken into her home for about a month in the beginning of the relationship in an attempt to help him out. I met her neurotic, sweet, yet ultimately incredibly distrusting mother, as well as both of her mother's boyfriends that she had during the time period when I was dating this ex. I met Mikey one night when it was us, Vinnie, Mikey's spoiled-ass friend who we'll call Josh, and mother's boyfriend #2 (who got her name tattooed on his arm - classy!). This sets the stage.I'm standing in the kitchen, literally asking the mom if I could help with anything, and Mikey starts whining about something, and I just had enough just from seeing and hearing him that evening. I turned and looked at him and told him off, something to the effect of "Seriously kid, when I was younger, I would've gotten a beating for saying half the stuff you do." So Mikey looks at me and says "What are you sayin', you want to beat me up?" And playing and stuff like he's punching me... then he starts actually punching me... so I start deflecting that. Then his friend Josh comes up behind me and tries to trip me. I kept my feet, and pushed this kid to the floor hard enough that he didn't mess with me for a while - he was basically laying there stunned on the linoleum. Mikey sees this and tries to run past the dining room table, but I grab him in a bear hug, lift him up to shoulder height, and start swinging him around like a god damned rag doll back into the kitchen. Then I put him on my shoulder, and just jumped up and down a few times with his chest hitting off mine and his stomach getting banged by my shoulder, again, just treating him like a rag doll. Then I took him off my shoulder, held him by his scrawny legs, and pretended several times like I was going to drop him right on his face onto the kitchen floor.Mind you, his entire family watched this and laughed their asses off, from start to finish. Which all tells you something about Mikey, his family, and the incredible bullet dodging that occurred that night on both her part and mine.So then, I did drop him, but only from about calf height, and he crumpled into the fake tiles. I turned around and went back to his friend Josh, and literally just FAT BOY'ed his ass - I laid right on top of him. I was tired and I don't normally lift a 13 year old football player up and down a few times then smash him (softly) into a floor. It was the most dominating thing I could think to do to him without physically exerting myself too much in case there was a round 2 with Mikey. So I laid there on Josh and asked him if he wanted anymore. I said if he wanted anymore, I was right there. He could just take a swing (all his limbs were pinned by my massive bulk). I saw shortly after getting up that Mikey had crawled behind the couch and was weeping like a little girl. We all laughed at him and his friend the rest of the evening, and dinner continued as if nothing had happened besides the occasional glances from Mikey and his friend at me. Very well mannered that night.Thus, I bullied the bullies. His mom used to threaten them when they were misbehaving that she was going to have me come over and kick their asses again. I heard that worked for a while, even after the ex and I broke up. **TL/DR:** I lived the dream, and got to "beat up" the most spoiled little shithead I knew at the time, *with* his family's approval.

murasakiboshi [info] First reddit post. I’m sorry if this gets long... I’m new here and don’t really know the ropes yet. I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder in my sophomore year of high school. I really don’t remember much of high school since I had my manic episode, and honestly, that’s probably ok. For me, college was an escape. My manic episode unfolded in front of the entire student body, and it was a relief to leave and go to a place where people did not know that about me. Fast forward 6 years. I am now a senior at a small university, getting a BS in psychology. On track to graduate in 4 years, which I am very grateful for. I hope to do an alternate-entry program for nursing or perhaps pursue a PhD in clinical psychology or behavioral neuroscience. I will tell you that college will not be easy. I messed up quite a bit, partly due to struggling with this condition and partly due to my own immaturity and stubbornness. I did rather poorly my first 2 years. I was on several different medications, and the side effects left me struggling to stay awake and I felt like a zombie much of the day. The past year, this changed. My grades improved dramatically and even made dean’s list, something I couldn’t have ever imagined doing since my episode. My GPA is not great, but has gone up to a level I am satisfied with. Most of the people here do not know I have bipolar disorder, but the ones that do are very supportive. This has helped me greatly. Every day I try to keep it this way.It’s not easy. I feel ya bro. I’m not going to say it gets better forever, cause it certainly does, but then it goes back to being bad. But it will get better again, eventually. That’s just how it is. Some things that have helped me along the way:-Sleep. College is really not the greatest place to get a lot of it, but do your best to get enough. -Exercise. I used to hate exercising. Last year, I made a resolution to try running and exercise in general. It has helped my sleep patterns, my stress level, and also has helped curb those rather unfortunate side effects that tend to come with certain medications. -Friends. You may be reluctant to share that you have bipolar disorder to many people. I certainly was, and 99% of the people I know from college don’t know I have it. But I would disclose it to some close friends if you think they will be supportive. Surround yourself with happy, healthy people and it will be great for you. I’m kind of an awkward penguin too, but I promise you there is a niche for everyone.  [info] None [info] 1349291896
russlo [info] Thank you for that link! I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder II and one of the medications I take regularly is lithium (much cheaper than alternatives and I am not a rich man) and as it turns out, stevia can cause lithium to be retained longer than intended in the body. I didn't even think of stevia as a "supplement", so I never checked it out with my doctors. I have been singing it's praises for a long time, but only in the past 6 months started using it, and then sparingly. I hadn't started using it more regularly, but I was going to before I read this.

RogueVenus [info] I'm really tired, but, I'm going to try to tell this story in a way that makes sense :)I used to hate being single. HATE IT. From the time I had my first boyfriend, I wanted male companionship. So... I partied. I drank too much, and ended up in relationships with men who drank too much, and all we did was drink and fight. Fast forward - I'm 26, slowly killing myself. Eventually it got to be too much. I ended up in rehab, where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.**Now, I am in no way implying that your emotional situation is so severe, but this is the part of the story that I want you to pay attention to:**I realized, while in therapy, that no one could make me feel better but myself. AND - This is important, too - I couldn't give myself everything I needed if I was looking after someone else. So I took some time off.For 3 years, it was just me. At first, the lonliness hurt so bad I thought I was going to die. It hurt to sleep alone, it hurt to wake up alone. So... I started to distract myself. I went to the movies, but since I was going by myself, I had to choose for myself. I watched TV and chose my own shows. I read books, and no one was looking over my shoulder, judging my choices. Slowly, I started devloping tastes and interests that I never knew I had.Then, one day, I realized... I wasn't loney any more. My own company was enough. And that was when I decided that it would be OK to try and share myself again. 2 weeks ago, I went on my first date in 3 years. And it was fun!! I didn't stress out over whether or not he'd call, because I already knew that I was OK on my own if he didn't. I WANTED to see him, but I didn't NEED him. What a cool concept.Now, I'm not saying that you need to be chaste for 3 years. But, in my experience, learning to be comfortable in your own skin is SO FREEING. Understanding yourself makes you easier for other people to understand you. Developing your own taste makes you more intersting. Sorry for the wall of text... Again, I'm really tired and super reflective right now... But... That's my two cents :) You need to settle into a good relationship with yourself before you let anyone else in.

Sporie [info] When I first was diagnosed, I thought of this. I have obsessive compulsive disorder. I was diagnosed with bipolar II......and when I told some of my friends, they'd say, "So you're bipolar?".. I thought "Does this illness define who I am more than having OCD?". They'd never said "So you're OCD?". I thought about the differences between the two. OCD feels more like a glitch in my mind, however I thought about my bipolar diagnosis. It feels as though it's coloured more of my perception of reality than OCD did. I'd prefer to say "I have bipolar disorder", though... but I'm really not sure why exactly.. It's definately a part of my life. I'm not sure if I'd take it back though, it's made me who I am. [info] hypomanic hugger [info] 1353474390
tatvamasi_throwaway [info] I might be rambling and getting nowhere, but here goes nothing. Also, I am a Hindu, and that explains the cultural context I am coming from.I had two episodes. During episode 1, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. During episode 2, with schizophrenia.Episode 1:1. I went through an intense period of rumination over Hindu concepts and how they can be understood in naturalistic terms. This lasted for about 15 days. I had been thinking about these issues on and off for the past 8 or 9 years though.2. This period of 15 days culminated in my stopping going to work to think about such matters in seclusion. I sank deeper into psychosis and mania during the following 3 days. I didn't eat or sleep during this period.3. I was seeing patterns everywhere and understanding everything. I saw (or thought I saw) what the seers of ancient times had seen. Gita - easy peasy. Shankara's Soundaryalahari and Vivekachudamani - as clear as the back of my hand. The concept of Krishna - how *brilliantly* engineered indeed! Avatars - artifacts desgined to cause humans to stretch themselves towards a higher perfection. Atman and Brahman - how could they be NOT identical?! EVERYTHING made sense.4. I was also paranoid that "psychic" forces were out to "get" me during this period of gestation, but confident that I could ward them off. I was seeing omens everywhere. I was also intensely ecstatic.5. I thought that I experienced an obliteration of self. Just as a mother's notion of self includes in a sense her children (her children's pain is her pain, their joy her joy), I felt that my notion of self engulfed the entire humanity. I thought I understood Jesus's pain: he didn't feel the physical pain of the nails being driven into him; he felt pain because of how the humans who drove these nails into him had degraded into something non-human, especially given his love for them. Just the same sort of pain a mother would feel if her son in a moment of insanity drove nails into her. Hence, forgive them for their sins for they know not what they are doing. I really cried when I understood this!You don't feel a sense of peace and equanimity when you're in this state. What you feel is a sense of deep pain and urgency towards a mission.6. I realized that if I communicated my visions the right way to the different antagonistic factions in the world, I could bring everlasting peace to mankind. I merely had to descend into the rhetorics that resonated with each of these factions. I would engineer the right language to convey the truths I had seen over the coming years, I thought. The new truths of science that were "revealed" to me would be my "miracles" that would compel belief in others. I merely had to spend the time gaining the scholastic muscle to systematically distill these truths into professionally respectable forms.I was later hospitalized by my friends who fortunately felt that something was off when they called me over the phone. I went back to work after a medical leave of 1 month, but the tantalizing ideas that I thought I had discovered remained in my mind. Episode 2:After 8 months in my job, and after overcoming my fears that I might indeed have flirted with insanity during Episode 1, I thought I would devote more time to giving my experience a rational foundation; to bring to maturity the germs of ideas that I had during the first episode. But, I would do this properly this time. I took up a less demanding (and less well paying) job to give myself the time to do this, and also started furthering my education in Mathematics, Physics, Biology and Philosophy (I am a Comp. Sc. guy by training). My knowledge in these areas remain fairly rudimentary still, BTW.Specifics during the second episode:1. I went off meds right away to fuel the internal psychological "fire" I felt I needed. I also stopped working, giving myself a time of 3 months to think deeply about Hindu philosophical concepts and giving a common-sense, naturalistic explanation of them, based on ideas gleaned from my first experience.2. Finally decided that I had to become an ascetic and devote myself fully to these studies. Went to the nearest Rama Krishna Mission outpost for guidance.3. The swamis there must surely have recognized that something was not right with me. They asked me to stay grounded; not to seclude myself thinking about spiritual-philosophical topics, but to remain active in society. The other way is surefire way towards self-destruction, they said.4. I returned home, and taking what morsel of self-control I had left in me, called my mother and told her that I needed help. I can recall that I couched it in very weird form (I was burning up, my conscious mind was separating from my  subconscious mind, etc.). She somehow managed to get me to hospital by calling up folks she knew. I spent 15 days in the hospital and returned to India for recuperation.5. Now I am again gainfully employed in a job that I am not at all passionate about. I pull in north of $170K per annum though. That's a consolation.**IN MY OPINION**: there is no distinct line between madness and a form of other worldy creative inspiration that allows you to glean into truths you otherwise wouldn't have access to. The proper way to go is, however, not to descend into madness, but to stay firmly grounded in reason. DEDICATE YOURSELF ENTIRELY TO TRUTH; if anything you discover or experience cannot be explained or expressed in naturalistic terms, then by all means, acknowledge them, but work on giving them a rational body that can pass the examining of the most fervent skeptic. If you can't do this, then you are merely fooling yourself and anyone else who may be foolish enough to follow your half-baked ideas and thoughts.TLDR: We had very similar experiences. I am trying to take a more analytical approach, but you seem to be taking a more touchy feely one. [info] None [info] 1354026816
needsmorecoffee [info] If you're having trouble with specific medications, that doesn't mean you should give up on medications in general. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 when I was 17, more than 20 years ago. I was on lithium for a few months, which didn't work out. Tegretol for a large handful of years, until I needed the dosage upped and started getting toxicity effects. Depakote and effexor for a long time; went off the effexor when it caused debilitating insomnia. Went off of the depakote after about 9 years because I started losing my hair. Next was trileptal, which lasted all of a month before my sodium dropped. Now I'm on lamictal, which so far is working out really well.Anyway. This is not meant to make you think that all meds are crap. If you look at the fact that I went through that many meds in 22 years, it really isn't that bad. Most of the time that I was medicated I was doing fine. It's normal, however, for your medication needs to change over time, and it's also normal for it to be difficult to pinpoint exactly what combination of meds will work best for you.If need be, you find a new psychiatrist. When I had the debilitating insomnia, my psychiatrist at that time told me I'd be fine if I just walked for 10 minutes a day and completely ignored me when I told him I was already working out and had been for some time (most doctors automatically assume bad food and exercise habits if you're overweight---and the effexor had also caused me to gain 70 pounds). It took a sleep specialist to immediately pinpoint the effexor as the problem.So, off I went in search of yet another psychiatrist. My city is lousy with them, but there's a distinct paucity of GOOD psychiatrists. I finally got someone to recommend a clinic they thought was good. The psychiatrist there didn't take my insurance, but it was worth it. (The extra medications I was taking to treat the problems caused by the effexor cost well more than what I'm paying out-of-pocket for the psychiatrist. That's how bad it can be to have a crappy psychiatrist.)Anyway. I got off of the effexor, was able to sleep again, immediately lost 12 pounds (35 total at this point). Since I went on the lamictal I'm starting to feel motivation and energy I haven't felt in years, so I'm cautiously optimistic about that.The sodium level drop from the trileptal was serious enough that I had to drop off of it over just two days, and the lamictal takes 5 weeks to get up to dosage on. I had several weeks of being essentially unmedicated. It had been 22 years since I'd last been in that position, and as horrid as the experience was, in some ways it's done me good to have the reminder that no, really, it can get that bad, and despite the troubles, the medication is VERY worthwhile. My amazing husband saw me through those really tough weeks, and I hate how difficult it was on him. I think most people probably wouldn't have been able to be nearly so supportive. Bipolar is hell on us, but it's also hell on the people around us, which is important to remember.I don't know anyone with bipolar who has successfully gone off their meds long-term. Everything I've always seen and heard indicates that it's a life-long treatment thing. Medication problems can be bad, but they can also be temporary if you work at continuing to try to find the right ones. The results of not taking your medication, however, can be far more devastating and potentially long-lasting. See if your current psychiatrist can help you find the right mix; it can, after all, take time and experimentation. If you get the feeling long-term that your psychiatrist can't help you, find a new one. Try to get recommendations from other patients or your primary care doctor for someone they think does a good job. [info] BP2/ADD/PTSD/GAD/kitchen sink [info] 1354058569
ReddyLee [info] I met my husband at 19 and thought I wanted children at the time.  Though, I was confused and conflicted about a lot of my beliefs.  I was Catholic, but didn't feel that fit me right.  I was struggling to come out publicly to my family and friends (I'm bisexual.)  there were a lot of fundamental beliefs to contend with at the time.  I solved the bisexual outing first...kind of the low hanging fruit.  Next I danced with childfree and my husband was supportive.  Then I put that idea back in a box and continued wanting children.  Meanwhile, i came out as an atheist and I went back to college.  I got a degree in psychology.  During this process, I finally solidified my childfree decision.My husband and I decided our life should be a childfree one.  I was about 27 at this point.  I finished college at 29.  And I succumbed to my uterus' desperate plea for me to grow a baby in it.  My husband was reserved, but on board.  Then three months later, I decided that my major medical issues (gut stuff) made me unfit to carry a child and I had always thought of myself as someone who would adopt, not conceive.  So we adjusted the plan and started looking into adoption.Then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  This didn't automatically stop the adoption process for us, but we did have to pause and take stock of our lives and the practicality of parent a child or children with one of us having mental illness.  We decided that without our support network in place and our access to resources, that we could totally proceed with adoption safely.Then we thought about it a little more and realized that it wouldn't be fair to depend on a support network and it wouldn't be fair to a child.  We also recognized that living childfree is something that we loved for 10 years already, so why consider changing that?  We decided to commit all our love and devotion to each other instead of having children.  My hormones calmed down enough for my heart to have a chance to be heard.  And it said it didn't want to be a parent.  I think I wanted to be childfree all along, but I really knew after truly considering and investigating the process.  The hormones were overwhelming me.  It was all I could think about for a while there.  My body's biological needs were really trying to be met! But once they calmed down a bit, my heart and my head were able to finally figure it all out.  It was about 11 years total with the up and down.  Mostly knowing I wanted to be CF, but occasionally getting confused.Tl;dr I want 29 when the CF lifestyle and I fully clicked, despite my ladyparts' best efforts.

aerikson [info] This is probably going to be buried but whatever.I was a fit and active kid growing. I played organized baseball and soccer, plus football, cops and robbers, etc etc with my friends in the neighborhood as often as I could. My mother stayed at home and made sure I ate healthy for the majority of my meals. I didn't drink much soda and the only junk food I got was when my friends and I got some extra money and bought some at the grocery store after school. Then, when I turned 11, my mother left, leaving me with my father. I don't remember much of that summer, but it was not the typically fun and active summer I usually had. Because of the various things that happened, I quit many of the things that I used to love, including soccer, baseball, and piano. Because my dad worked long hours and commuted at least two hours a day, he often was unable to feed me properly, and even if he could, he was not a good cook. So, if we did eat at home, it was something awful like Hamburger Helper, but more often, it was pizza or McDonalds. That same year, my father and I moved to a different neighborhood. While I stayed in the area somewhat near my friends, I was far enough away that I didn't really want to go for the long walk and meet up with them. So, that lack of any social activity not only took away the last bit of common physical exercise it got, it also depressed the hell out of me.Over the next 6 years or so, my life was mostly video games, junk food, and mental health problems. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (probably from my mother who I rarely saw then nor do I see now) and put on drug after drug after drug. The most significant being Lithium, which I think had a major effect on my weight. I don't really hold anyone responsible for the drugs though as I was an awful child, often skipping school and reacting aggressively towards others. I got expelled from three schools from the ages of 11-15.As I got older, my diet and physical activity level still remained unhealthy. I did start getting more active once I dropped out of school and started to work full time. Most of the work was very physically demanding which was wonderful, but with my own income and now a car, I usually made up for the increase in exercise with even worse food. Mentally and socially, I got better as well though, as I met new friends through work and have been able to stay sane without drugs since the age of 17.It was this year that I actually decided to change my lifestyle and become a physically active adult who eats healthy. Last year, two of my best friends got married and went to Disney World during their honeymoon. They wanted to go again and bring their friends along. Knowing I would be wary of going since my size not only made air travel uncomfortable but made some rides impossible for me to go on, they said they would pay the whole way if I lost weight. They never said how much or how I should, they just said lose weight. It took a few months for that offer to kick in, but I realized, why the fuck not?So, starting in April of this year, I picked up a low carb and low calorie diet, started working a very physically active job, and found myself at the gym once a day. On April 20th, 2012, when I started this whole mess, I weighed myself at 389 lbs. As of yesterday, I weigh 255 lbs. No lies, no bullshit. Most of the time, I don't believe myself, but I did it. I'm not going to say it was easy, because that isn't fair to other people who are doing the best they can to lose weight, but it is possible to lose weight. [Here is a picture of me from my aforementioned friends' wedding and a picture of me last month](http://i.imgur.com/QUw9e.jpg).

It's like getting a massage. Sometimes it's painful but I'm going to go through the shit anyway, so why not use the help that's available? I would be ok if I was in therapy the rest of my life.

It worked to keep my nose clean, but not to undo my change of heart.* Would have lost my health insurance. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in my late teens and required expensive and intensive treatment.  I would have been uninsurable if my parents kicked me off their health plan, which is what they threatened to do when I quit cold turkey.

keasbey15 [info] I'm providing a tl;dr at the top for those not ready for this. So **tl;dr: I was diagnosed with bipolar NOS, went to a treatment center, got diagnosed with Asperger's upon discharge.**My diagnoses wasn't really a realization of me being different. I mean, I knew I was different than everyone else. But that didn't make me think I had Asperger's, considering I'm still a kid and didn't learn about it until I met a fellow Aspergian in my Networking class. So as a child my parents noticed mood swings and things commonly associated with Bipolar disorder. They took me to a therapist when I was about 8 and from there I got diagnosed. They didn't consider Asperger's, I'm not sure why, but I got slapped with a bipolar NOS diagnoses. So 8 years later and about 16,000 medications ago, I was in a really bad place (Manic every day, outbursts at school and home, a couple episodes of psychosis. The usual bipolar shindig.) My parents, at the recommendation of my psychiatrist, sent me to a Youth Mental Health Treatment Center. There I became fairly stable, found the right balance of medication and therapy and made my way back into the world. After discharging from an in-patient treatment center, I did weekly therapy at an out-patient treatment center and had the best therapist of my life. He started noticing things like my Obsessive-compulsive tendencies, my aversion of eye contact, unnatural fear of trivial things, etc. etc. He told my parents that I have Asperger's. He didn't want to tell me considering all I went through in that time so I didn't know until early last year. It changed my view on everything and I took it surprisingly well. I sought out information on Asperger's and became knowledgeable on the subject. I think it made me feel better because it gave me an answer to why I am the way I am, and I've accepted it as a blessing rather than a curse. It's been an uphill struggle trying to be seemingly neurotypical but I learned skills without knowing, I figure I can survive while being diagnosed.  [info] None [info] 1358325044

boo_urns82 [info] I was bulimic in college (pre-diagnosis), and when my bipolar got really bad after graduation I was spending all my money on alcohol and eating a bowl of rice a day, so I lost a ton of weight. When I was diagnosed with bipolar II NOS and medicated at age 23, I tried to eat better, like three good meals each day and lots of water. After a while, though, I segued from bulimia to binge eating, followed by starvation. It's not a conscious behavior pattern now, but I do notice that when I'm depressed I have almost no appetite, so I have to force myself to eat at least one meal, and then I'm so desperate that I don't care if it's "good" food or not; when I'm manic, though, I want to EAT ALL THE THINGS!!! and this usually means fast food or splurging at the supermarket. In short, because I've been so focused on the rest of my bipolar regimen (medication adjustments, workplace accommodations, creating a stable daily routine, etc.) I have dealt very little, if at all, with my disordered eating, even though I see a therapist weekly who knows about my history and current concerns. It always seems to fall to the end of the queue on issues to work on. Still, baby steps each day, trying to make good choices but not berating myself for coming up short.

HonorRose [info] This is such a popularized disorder in the modern era. I was diagnosed with bipolar at 8, was heavily medicated, developed a slew of problems with the medications so secretly stopped taking them. For years I lied to my psychiatrists and parents, and they kept telling me how great I was doing. "Let's stick with this medicine regime we have now!" They said. "It seems to be working great!" They said. Finally at 15 I came out that I'd been off meds for four years, and my psychiatrist actually threw her head back and laughed! She says, "You have no idea how often this happens."Not to say there aren't genuine cases of bipolar, but there's a popular tendency to diagnose quickly and at the slightest of symptoms.

i_am_robotted [info] Over the last 4 years I have been getting increasingly strong mood disorders and have become increasingly disaffected. I have been with my SO for 4 years and was initially addicted to her (I have very strong addictive tendencies). However within 1 year I was having trouble feeling any major emotions and no longer really feel anything towards her. As far as I can manage, being with her is comfortable, but I am unsure I could ever express more to her let alone anyone else.  I would like good things for her, but cannot feel passionately for her or anyone. I have learned to fake most of my emotions for everything. Furthermore this complicates our sex life as I have unintentionally increasingly approached celibacy. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder however any medication has not elucidated any positive results in my life nor with my SO. Furthermore as a guy I have had to lie about orgasms which is bloody impossible (she believes I've had developmental issues with the vas deferens).  TL:DR due to issues mentally I've been putting on a front at the table and in the bed.  [info] None [info] 1359864158
the_bell_jar [info] I basically internally refused to 'get over' my ex for at least 8 months after we broke up. Around that time I rang him up saying I wanted to make peace, etc etc, then cut him out f my life (the usual crazy ex stuff). He had a new girlfriend and they were set to go overseas together 2 days after ex and i met up. I basically emotionally manipulated him, many kisses were had, and he was all "If I didn't live with my new girlfriend, I'd take you home". She found out what happened and they went overseas anyway but according to the emails he sent me, the first part of their trip was less than happy. I felt very pleased with myself and then sent him an email calling his new girlfriend all manner of nasty things, and saying that I'd break her legs if I ever saw her on the street.     Aaaand then I was diagnosed with bipolar. Go figure.     EDIT: I'm not psycho ex anymore but I am writing a cathartic novel about my emotional problems that basically blames this guy for a lot of stuff. I toyed with the idea of dedicating it to him and sending him a copy. So maybe I am a bit psycho still. :( [info] None [info] 1360043030

sniffpetrol [info] Congrats on speaking out and trying to reduce the stigma. I did the same thing after I got out of hospital, just after I was diagnosed with bipolar.

forthelandfill [info] Using my throwaway, as I'm a frequent poster here.EDIT: (Screw throwaways, if you guys are being brave I can be brave too.  I'm u/porlabasura.)I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder two years ago after a manic episode/mental break that ended up being the most profoundly inspiring but also scary experience of my life.  It completely changed how I relate to life and to other people (I feel for the better) and gave me a renewed appreciation for all of life's beauty and mystery.  At the time, it felt like something akin to a spiritual experience.  I went pretty crazy for about three or four months.  I take care of myself by seeing doctors and taking my medication regularly, and I have been symptom-free for nearly a year, but the lessons I have taken from the experience will be with me (I hope) for the rest of my life.  Right now I hope to preserve my stability for decades to come, but of course with mental illness there are no guarantees.I believe the entire experience has made me more compassionate and empathetic, which are qualities I hugely value in myself and others.  The full story is one that is by turns deeply surprising, exhilarating, concerning, humbling, and uplifting, and one that is best told a few dates in.  I make it a point to be as straightforward as possible with the people I date and don't lie about this, and when I do end up telling the story I make sure they know that it's quite a lot to take in all at once.  Thanks for letting me share. [info] None [info] 1360783870
nottoobatty [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar (probably bipolar II, though perhaps bipolar NOS) and ADHD. My current doctor proposed that bipolar accounts for longer-term mood issues (on the scale of weeks or months) while ADHD might help account for unreasonable-seeming swings in mood during a single day or couple of days.I have not yet tried ADHD medication (on top of Lamictal for bipolar), but I think I will try it soon -- though I am not especially reassured by your and other people's reports here that ADHD meds can *increase* swings in mood/energy/motivation over the course of a day. Also my previous doctor was concerned that stimulant meds might cause a bipolar person to go manic/hypomanic, which is an interesting possibility. Being hypomanic is kind of fun, though, so maybe it'd be ok. :) [info] None [info] 1361139034
bassguitarking [info] When I was younger (age7-12) I would do things like this all the time. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 and put on antipsychotics and it went away :(. Now that my disorder is controlled I use this kind of thing to my advantage. I'm a biochemistry student and in Organic Chemistry I can easily visualize complex 3D structures and interact with them as if I'm working a computer program. I also have lucid/vivid dreams almost every night.

penisknuckles [info] I dropped out of college in October of 2011 after attempting to commit suicide. Thankfully my roommate at the time found me and called 911.

chelsea5000 [info] I'm concerned about this too... I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder last year and have found my thought patterns to have changed. Once i got a grip on it, i used my highs and lows to my benefit. feeling super low? i could describe those feelings in a song or painting. I felt strong sympathy and empathy for people. I can relate to animals better. When I'm feeling manic, I feel inspired! Since I have so much energy I can bring good into the world. I I have the power to really change things, and see humanity in a new light.This disorder obviously has its cons; but i try to look at myself with 'Megafeelings'. Feelings that mentally stable people may not reach. We are all just beings, some with little glitches and whatnot. Just have to learn to embrace it! [info] None [info] 1362142325

buddhawriter [info] &gt;The stigma I hate the most is that we are "dangeous".This one always hits me hard because I have had a few aggressive incidents before I was diagnosed with bipolar. The thing is, I'm not an angry person in the slightest. Yet, because I had a few incidents I get treated as though I am a violent criminal in hospital even if I do nothing but sit down on my bed for an hour. I'm not kidding. Not only do normal people treat you like a violent criminal but also supposedly trained medical professionals. That's another thing, you may have noticed how some nurses will talk to patients with mental illness like they are slow children and it's very degrading. The stigma it burns. I'll leave it at that.

bigbigbigmoney [info] It's interesting because I'm not a self-harmer. I've obsessed over suicide a bunch, but I think even my emotional brain automatically acquiesces to my logical brain when it comes to actually doing it. I'm not sure how it woks. But before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was friends with a self-harmer, and dealing with her was such a fucking headache. Eventually, she moved back home with her parents, which was good, because I was sick of bringing her to and from the hospital. I had my own shit to deal with!! So my boyfriend was telling me the truth. Self harm is super unattractive. I don't blame him for saying it. quite happy he was blunt about it.  [info] None [info] 1363534211

Irvingthrowaway [info] It did take me a while to figure out what to do for fun when I wasn't drinking.  Basically I figured out that my friends still enjoy going out to dinner, playing board games at home, etc.  I still enjoy the hobbies I had before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  It depends on where you live and what you enjoy, but there are lots of outdoor things that you can enjoy without drinking.  Hiking, biking, skiing, (or whatever things you're interested in).  Another cool thing about not going out drinking is that I'm able to stick to a regular sleep schedule and that's better for my moods too.  Regular sleep is a HUGE part of maintaining my stability.Also, when I have fun now, I remember all of it and I don't regret doing dumb things that I don't remember doing.  (I was a blackout drinker and it was worse once I started taking meds.)  [info] None [info] 1364141946
PayingForMania [info] When I was 22, I was panicked that I hadn't found my future spouse yet.  That sounds silly, but everyone in my family gets married by 24, so it was a big deal.  A year later, through a weird series of connections involving a funeral, a few manic episodes, and half a dozen road trips, I met a young girl and fell promptly in love.  We had a long distance off-and-on relationship while I served a few years in the Navy.  When I got back from deployment (and was awaiting my discharge) I proposed and we got engaged.That lasted about a year from there, and in the end she borrowed a few hundred dollars from me to buy an anniversary present, then cheated on me and ended it in a not-so-tearful confession.  That episode shattered my trust in women.  Two years later, my mother died suddenly of pancreatic cancer, which officially ended the urgency of my need to catch up to my siblings.  Incidentally, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder somewhere along the way, and spent a few years trying to figure out how to manage my life in spite of it- which I had to admit I hadn't accomplished for the first decade of adulthood.  Now I am 32.  I haven't had a lasting sexual relationship since my engagement ended almost six years ago. I've started to get over my lingering trust issues, and I think I've sorted out a good deal of my life.  I've got a house, a dog, and a nice car; I'm physically active and have exciting hobbies; I'm well-educated, about to finish a law degree, and have already secured (and started) a lucrative job in my industry that flexibly accommodates my lifestyle.  So I think I'm about ready to start getting serious about dating.Unfortunately, I'm 32 years old and know about as much about dating as the typical 19 year old.  I'm too old and too far along in life to be dating kids that age, so while I'm generally pretty mature, I'm not yet skilled at dating like a grown-up.  But I'm getting better at it, and I expect that either I won't be single for long, or I'll learn to have a lot of fun with casual dating until that longed-for relationship actually happens.

Melbees [info] So I'm assuming that you're in the US, so I will speak to that with my experience. I have been in college for almost 8 years (undergrad + grad) and I have been off my parents insurance for about 5 years, which put me on school insurance. I was diagnosed with bipolar 4 years ago, and have been to two schools on opposite sides of the country, and talked about similar things with friends at other schools and it seems to be almost the same everywhere.Usually your school offers counseling services for "free" (i.e. you've already paid a fee for them), and along with that comes either a nurse practitioner who can prescribe medication or a psychiatrist who you might have to pay a small fee to see (I pay 10 dollars per half hour to talk to mine). Since you have a history of taking the meds they'll immediately prescribe you on the same meds. They are happy to do this long term, I've only ever gone to nurse practioners and the school psychiatrist for the entire 4 years since my diagnoses. Now for the coverage in medication: does your medication come in generic? That would help bring down the cost immensely. Also your school insurance (which may be pricey compared relative to the fact there's not much in it) will most likely cover at least some of your medication. Is it possible for you to switch to a medication that comes in a generic? Honestly for me, I told them to not even bother with medications I can't afford so they put me on lamictal which has a 10-15 dollar generic. If nothing else, my first NP recommended to shop around at pharmacies (the school pharm usually gives a discount if you are a student/ have student insurance) and she even recommended to look at canadian pharmacies which she was willing to send a prescription to. Most medical care providors (especially with mental health) just want to see you be well, and understand that costs are very much a factor when you are in college. Hope that helps, and PM me if you have any questions... I've been doing this for some time. [info] None [info] 1364579047

sdraz [info] I don't have an answer for you but I'm just sharing some of my history. At age 5 I was diagnosed with epilepsy after several absence (petit mal) seizures, one of which almost cost me my life after swallowing my tongue. I was put on Tegretol until age 10 after which I had outgrown my epilepsy (confirmed by extensive brain scans at age 18). After experiencing psychosis due to mania at age 26, I was diagnosed with bipolar I. Among other medications, I was placed on Lamictal. Also, I was put on Wellbutrin at age 24 to help treat my OCD but I discontinued that.Anyway, all I can really say is stay on the proper medications once you doctor has found the right combination and doses for both your bipolar and epilepsy. For some people, therapy is an excellent addition to a medication regiment for bipolar. For epilepsy/seizures your best bet would be to see a neurologist who can read brain activity among other things.  [info] None [info] 1364665581

sillohollis [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar type II my sophomore year of college. They gave me, what I presume, is a normal dosage. I have never felt so numb.

Vormav [info] It's an interesting question. I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I usually feel too depressed and apathetic to *want* to exist.

shillyshally [info] I was always more awake at night than during the day but now that I don't work my sleeping has become utterly without structure. Anyway, the reason I asked about meds is because I was diagnosed with bipolar II long before it became 'popular' and thus was kind of a guinea pig for numerous drug treatments. Some of those drugs had very bizarre side effects. This is pure speculation but I wonder if the melatonin is putting you into a neverland between sleep and wakefulness so that you did the drawing when you were somewhat asleep. Such things do happen.

Several years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a failed hanging attempt (knot came undone once I jumped).I transferred out of the college I was attending to a top 20 one, but it was super stressful and I had no friends and I was worried that I'd break, again, so I went back home to a state university.  I've tried OD'ing a few times since then, but each time I wasn't taking my medicine.

IrisKV [info] My answer is probably really "me-centered", but I don't care.My grandfather was an amazing man. He used to be a wealthy doctor, but then sold almost all of his belongings to create a movement/association in Switzerland that helped asylum seeker during the 1980s-1990s I think. He let them stay in his home, and provided them with fake passports. He helped more than 20'000 people ( I think, if I remember correctly) by giving them those passports and helping them find shelter. He fought so much and in such desperate (:illegal) ways, he was supposed to be sent to jail, but could avoid it because he was really sick (bone cancer, I believe). He died when I was only 9 or 8, but we had always had a privileged relation. I don't feel close to many people in my family, but with him I really had a connexion. We used to spend hours just the two of us, making up stories to entertain the other one. After I offered him a small duck made of argile I had made, for Christmas, he wrote me a letter that I only realized years after how touching it was. In it, he said to me that "this duck has saved the holiday for him, in a way nobody really understood". This brings tears to my eyes to this day.Four years ago I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, type I, and only this year after two manic episodes, I finally accepted to take medication. When I did so, my mother told me that my grandfather was also sick. She told me that when my grandmother met him, he was standing up on a table in a bar, reciting Goethe in German, and that my grandmother originally called him Pierrot le Fou, in reference to a French movie. They thought he was schizophrenic, but from the information I gathered, he might have been bipolar, just like me. He's the only one in the family to also have had it.So all of this make that if only I could go back in time, I would chose to go back at the time where he was still alive - not the latter days where he suffered through hell, but after he started his organization to help people, and spend some time with him, as an "adult". We would talk of us,  of the amazing things he was doing, I would tell him that as a child and even now, he was one of the person who built who I am, who gave birth to my love of storytelling. I would also ask about his illness, talk about mine. And more importantly, I would have the chance to tell him that even in future, he's the one person I found the most inspiring.

thegreenlentil [info] It's not good for her to just decide to stop taking her meds. In general I'd say that's never a good move for psych meds. She should talk to her doctor and see if she can get on different ones or change the dosage. I was diagnosed with bipolar II a year ago and I only found the right meds a couple months ago. I would suggest gently asking her about her meds and why exactly she decided to stop taking them. Emphasize your concern when talking to her, above all. See if you can convince her that it's a good idea to check with her doctor. Try not to get angry or accusatory, that will do more harm than good.

noello [info] I'm bipolar, and so is my dad.  It was really tough growing up with him, he was emotionally abusive and very unstable, I spent most of my childhood constantly on edge around him as he was known to completely fly off the handle at the smallest thing.  Once I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and began to try to understand it, a lot of his actions and behaviors began to make a lot of sense.  It doesn't completely make up for the pain I went through but it does make it a lot easier to understand and forgive.  I would recommend talking with others who have been in similar situations (like you are now!) and others who are bipolar themselves, as they can give you insights to some of the things that go on in our heads.

LeRichard [info] Dude, you're depressed, and I don't mean that in the obvious sense; I mean that in the clinical sense. I too spent some hard years in the closet, and it ended up scarring me also. I finally admitted to myself that I needed to seek help and in the end I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After some treatment, I started feeling much better. I would really recommend it.To address some of the actual things you've talked about, I can't give you advice, because only you know what's best for yourself ultimately, but I can tell you about my own thoughts and experiences. I am a hopeless romantic, but I have never rushed into a relationship and I still have casual sex. In fact, I hold the unorthodox opinion that it's better to make sure you are sexually compatible with someone before trying to connect too deeply on a romantic level. To use an extreme example: Imagine two guys who date for a long time and fall completely in love with each other and then finally they decide to have sex and they find out that they're both total-bottoms. Then everything is complicated--a whole wrench has been thrown in the picture, which could have been avoided. I myself think the societal message that says a lot should be invested in the relationship before having sex is somewhat flawed. Also you very well might be right that losing your top virginity might bring you more confidence. But topping for the first time also requires a good deal of confidence and depressed people have a hard time building up confidence, especially if they have been feeling down for some time. If you're completing PhD studies, I'm sure you're a smart guy, so you may have heard of the "correlation does not equal causation" analysis tool. Don't assume that you're down because you've been having trouble romantically/sexually. Maybe you've (at least partially) been having trouble romantically/sexually because you're so down. Do you really know which one is causing the other? Maybe they're both causing each other. To really sum up what I'm trying to say, first, I really think you need to take care of your mood problems separately from everything else. They are serious and need to be addressed. Second, have you considered just looking for some gay friends, instead of romantic partners? Forget about sex. Forget about love. Forget about top virginity. Just start looking for one or two gay guys that you enjoy talking to, or playing tennis with or something. Join a gay sports league or book club or something. It's win-win: You'll *hopefully* end up losing your top virginity in a locker room with the best sex you've ever had, but if not, then you'll end up with a few new friends, a better sense of self, and higher self-esteem.

ehjhockey [info] Or instead of getting to go to history classes, what if I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and sent to a dumping ground for the kids who don't quite fit elsewhere. Perhaps I had testing to assess my cognitive and intellectual development that showed me in the upper percentiles before I went in there. And no change in any direction after I spent three years there. What if I wasn't *allowed* to pay attention in history class? What if when I tried I was on drugs that made me so lethargic I couldn't keep my head up in class? What if when I finally got off those drugs at 18 I realized I was remembering what it felt like to be sober after 8 years of haze? [info] None [info] 1367818563
RaptorGoRawr [info] My first semester in college I was you. I slept all the time, had no friends, and was failing EVERY class. I would leave my room, go get food to go from the cafeteria and come back to my room. I wanted zero interaction. I had no motivation to do anything, even showering was a chore. I told my parents.... the parents that had slaved away for years to give me everything they could, the ones who put themselves in debt for my private school tuition. You know what they did? They were confused and hurt at first but they helped me get help. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and insomnia. I went back the next semester, medicated, in therapy, and determined.   I discussed it with my RA who became an ear and an accountability partner.  She made sure I stayed med compliant, got to my appointments and connected me with some really great girls in my dorm who became great friends. Your RA is there to help you, let them!No matter what you chose to do about school, having your parents in your corner makes all the difference.  [info] None [info] 1368184048

BoojiBoy [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and her behavior definitely reminds me of some of my more unhinged moments before I started taking medication.  When that kind of thing used to happen to me, it would feel literally impossible to understand my thoughts and emotions.. much less control them.  When you add a couple of high pressure situations into the mix like running a kitchen by yourself and doing it in front of cameras for a prime-time television audience, it's inevitable that it all snowballs into a meltdown.  It's happened to me quite a few times, unfortunately.  That said, there's a definite layer of "total bitch" in her attitude that seems to be independent of the other thing.Maybe with all of the negative attention, she'll realize that she needs to get help and she may come out of the experience a better person.  I hope so, anyway.  I don't like seeing people suffer in that way.  It hits way too close to home.As far as the husband is concerned, I have no clue what his problem is.

operakitty [info] Stigma might have something to do with it. I was diagnosed with bipolar type I a few years ago and my parents absolutely did not believe it was a serious thing. (In fact, I got the exact same "you must have a mild case" line from them.) We had a neighbor living across the street growing up who was bipolar, and he was a nice guy but his mania got really bad when he didn't take his meds. There were a couple of times my dad had to call the police because he got violent with his mom, and he'd disappear to the state hospital in Terrell for a few weeks, come back, things would be quiet for a while, then the whole cycle would eventually start over.The thing is that this was literally the only person my parents knew who had bipolar disorder, so I think it was a combination of that and denial ("well she's never done anything like that so obviously it can't be that bad").

shinygreenbean [info] No, severe endometriosis + adenomyosis + chronic salpingitis, also I had a problem with scar tissue and adhesions from previous surgeries. Yes I can still have sex, it's no different at all apart from the absence of awful pain now. Life without a uterus is difficult- you go through a kind of grieving process for your fertility and I admit I found that really hard, I hadn't had children yet and I would love to make it unhappen but I can't. You find yourself missing having periods too and crying at tampax adverts. It was difficult too because of my age, I was 31 when I had the op and pretty much all my peers are getting pregnant and posting scan and baby pics on Facebook and talking about their babies, which I had to go and see when they had them and that was really hard. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a while back and my psychiatrist said the trauma of my hysterectomy, including how it happened which was basically an emergency because I was in so much pain every day and also my uterus and right fallopian tube were really distended with blood which had nowhere to go because my cervix was completely closed by a load of scar tissue, was probably a trigger for that. I certainly feel I went mentally downhill after it. As far as BRCA goes I have no idea whether I have that or not. I wouldn't discourage someone from undergoing a hyst for this reason but I would certainly advise them to seek counselling before and after. It would have made so much difference to me if I'd had time to get used to the idea beforehand, I tried but I only had a few days and I wouldn't have had them if I hadn't begged my gynecologist to delay the surgery date to allow me time to get my head round it, which turned out to be pointless because all that happened was a few more days of excrutiating pain and I couldn't think clearly because of it, because I couldn't sleep through it despite the morphine patch I was using by that point which also made it difficult to think clearly. It's got to be one of the most emotionally challenging surgeries there is because your identity and life plans are so caught up with having a functioning uterus. I was going to finish my degree and then we were going to try for children but that never happened, obviously, and 3 years on from the procedure I still don't know what I'm going to do with my life. So yeah, I wouldn't dissuade someone but I would ask them to make sure they're aware of how difficult it really is. [info] None [info] 1370081460

throwaway99041 [info] I had a similar problem.  I never raised a hand to my girlfriend/wife, but I did all the other abusive things, and for the same reason - I went from zero to angry in about 0.3 seconds and once I got that angry I couldn't think or behave rationally.Unlike anonymouse, I was not unhappy with my life, and 3 years of psychotherapy were completely useless.Eventually I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder and put on a mood stabilizer.  Within 3 days the unpredictable, uncontrollabe rages stopped and 2 years later, they have yet to come back - not even once, except for times I've forgotten to take my pill.  It was too late for my marriage; but it is much easier for me to relate to people, including my current GF, now.  If I miss a dose my GF can tell, often before I realize.Here's the kicker: for 40 years I had no idea that my brain essentially had a deficiency of mood stabilizers.  Sad story, isn't it?

Clownsheuz [info] I was also diagnosed with schizophrenic tendencies so a lot of my theories stemmed from having a feeling like I wasn't alone when I was.I am an atheist but I think if I wasn't most of them would have been religious. The most dangerous theory I had was that I wasn't alone. I believed that there was an invisible alien in some sort of invisible gas or energy form that was constantly with me. Twice I spent time standing outside waiting to be abducted in my shorts in cold weather. The other main theory I had was that bipolar people are all psychic, because I was diagnosed with bipolarity. I met a few people online and tried to have long distance psychic conversations with them. Assuming I could talk just using my inner monologue. At one point when I was outside I thought I was transmitting too many thoughts and I was driving people who weren't psychic into a crazy rage and that they would hunt me down. I ran into my house and locked the door. I had another theory where I thought that I was the next evolution of man into an immortal godlike state. I remember I had this when my family took me to the hospital for the first time. I remember I met a really nice nurse there and I thought he was my charge or something and I had to bring him into the next evolutionary state with me and my family. My biggest theory started before I was actually in a state of psychosis. It was something to do with the left and right hemispheres of the brain. I think the idea was that we don't use the right hemisphere and that society conditions it out of children by raising them wrong. I thought that I had somehow reactivated that part of my brain through intense philosophy. I remember bringing this theory up to several doctors and having it dismissed quickly. It was the last one I let go of too because it was the most based in science. [info] None [info] 1372282532

mostfavorite [info] As far as how you can help - please make a point to understand the medications and their side-effects. Almost all of us are going to end up on medication for LIFE. Figuring out early what meds work for your patient and your patient's lifestyle. Figuring out the lowest dose necessary. No unnecessary changes in medication. For therapy, it's important for me to feel heard and to feel like my doctors see me for who I am. I want my doctor to recognize when I'm high-functioning. I prefer having a doctor who is friendly to me. I don't want my doctor to assume they know more about my condition than I do. I want my doctor to believe that I'm doing the best that I can with the tools available to me. I want therapy to be a collaborative effort.I was diagnosed with bipolar nearly 20 years ago, when I was 13. I haven't had a significant episode in a long time, thanks to meds and devoting a lot of time and energy to my mental and physical well-being. Now, my manic episodes show up as overplanning vacations and online shopping sprees (though I only shop places with great return policies!). When I'm manic I'm incredible at orchestrating amazingly detailed large-scale projects. My depressive episodes used to be the worst - staying in bed with the curtains pulled for weeks at a time. I still feel occasionally hopeless without real reason, but now I can manage to get out of bed and go about my business, albeit with a weight on my heart.  [info] None [info] 1372907038

Oneeyedbitch [info] Actually... i have the same things as your boyfriend has (at least, what I can read from your post ;))I've been diagnosed with bipolar, although lightly. When I am "manic", I start rambling, walking around, no sleep for a clouple of days at all and thinking I know and can do everything. I never took risks though, financially or otherwise. When I'm depressed, it's the opposite and I start wondering why I'm even alive.But I'm not on medicine though. That's because the medicine (I've tried a few) had worse side effects than my bipolar would do to me. I wasn't going to harm me or others around me, and if I am (especially when I am depressed), my family or my fiancé will take care of me. If I am getting manic and they notice, we'll just joke about it, like: "there she goes again"I don't think medicine will always be the answer. If it is necessary, yes.

something_stoopid [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar when I had a nervous breakdown when my sons father and I split up. He relapsed with his drug use, created an extremely unsafe situation for our son one morning, and that was it. Our 18mth old son had access to a used needle box, and I'd gotten up just as he was about to put an alcohol swab that had been left on the floor in his mouth. My ex STILL tried to say he wasn't shooting up. This would NEVER have happened if I was around. That and the other stresses I had going on, sent me over the edge for a bit there. I got diagnosed, was medicated for a while. Moved interstate to be with my family while the ex was off on his binge. He agreed to us leaving. The he got a girlfriend who decided she wanted a kid. In fact, she wanted the kid he already had because she couldn't have kids. So I get a call from his lawyer, saying he's requesting mediation, looking at going to court for full custody. We're in Australia, not sure how it works in other countries but you have to go to court mediation before you even step foot in a courtroom. He pulled the 'she has bipolar! She's crazy!' Line. Both of our lawyers shot him down. Bipolar is not something you can help having. As long as you manage it correctly. If you're manic, and showing behaviours that are dangerous, then you get help. I am off medication now, see a therapist monthly to keep him updated Ido it for the benefit of myself and the court. My therapist is a neutral reference for me, saying the facts of my condition, if it were to be brought up. They can't make decisions based on the fact I have the condition, but if he lies about it, which is extremely likely, I have a record there. Here, you're mental condition does not affect your parenting unless you get committed. It's against the law to judge based on anything else. Anyway our mediation worked out fine. He's still not around, and broken up with the girl he was with so is over the whole full time dad idea again. It didn't end up in court because the only 'ammo' so to speak, that he had was my bipolar diagnosis. He thought the point was to go in there and insult me, not try and work something out for our son. Ask your lawyer. But from what I can tell it should be fairly similar in the us/uk. See a doctor, keep it managed, and even if its not like it is here, you will have a reference saying you've got it under control. [info] None [info] 1373323793

[Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/tuak1/its_been_6_months_of_steady_progress_and/)Basically, I had been messing around with weed and magic mushrooms for too long, about 2 to 3 years, and had become really introverted and a bit of a social outcast. If you do any drugs as well, STOP AT ONCE. Paranoia and loneliness often manifest themselves in auditory hallucinations!The important thing to remember, which I wish I had, is that you were completely fine in this regard at an earlier point in your life, and it's very much possible to pick yourself back up.For what it's worth, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type II) WITH psychotic tendencies.Lastly, I myself became convinced that the thought broadcasting was real, because the voices in my head would always go "It's real!". Fuck that, IT'S NOT REAL.After being completely sober for almost 2 years, I don't have auditory hallucinations anymore, due to a mix of going back to school, getting steady work, and building up a close circle of friends who didn't want to throw their lives in favour of getting high/fucked up.

floydini13 [info] Well, I know I can't control anyone else's feelings, that's up to them.  As far as relating to other people, the hard part for me is to control my reactions to what they are doing or saying.  I think that is something everyone has to work on, whether they are bipolar or not.I don't think I have ever been able to truly control my personality/behavior or decide when I'm going to be happy, sad, etc...  Instead, what I used to do was control what I showed to everyone else when inside it was a completely different story.  When my facade fell apart enough that I could not lie to myself or anyone else, I was diagnosed with bipolar and started medication that has helped me gain real control  instead of covering up.  It doesn't work perfectly, i still have wild rides up and down but at least I have help now and that frees up some time to enjoy life more instead of using all my energy hiding and being afraid that other people will notice that I'm not "normal"I have had a rough time for a while now and started to see a different dr and therapist and started a new med and things are actually getting better.  Just this week, my therapist said he wants me to become more aware of the signs of different cycles because I have been kind of just riding along with it.So, here is another new thing to work on and I guess it will help me become even more in charge of my own actions.I know what you mean about having different feelings toward people depending on what day it is!

I am in the process of getting insurance and have no idea what to even tell the doctor. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year or two ago. I don't even know what that means other than what pop culture says. Ha. My son refuses to be around anyone that isn't me and screams the whole time my mom watches him. I may PM you sometime because my family is terrible at advice and none of my friends know what it's like to even have children. Thanks for the advice! [info] None [info] 1375037822
DuelNature [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar type I around two years ago, and my experiences during my first manic phase were similar to your friend's.I agree with some in this thread that she should get checked out by a professional, but if she's not wandering the streets at night breaking into cars, like I was, that's a good sign. Maybe she is very spiritually gifted. If she does seek outside help from a doctor, she might want to be careful if they prescribe meds right off the bat. Some of the anti-psychotics out there can have nasty side-effects. Honestly, I still hear Christ. It's a hard situation to describe, because I end up analyzing every single thought that enters my mind. Which then leads me down the rabbit hole of questioning the origin of thoughts and a bunch of nonsense like that, which in end is just unanswerable. No one knows for sure, hence faith. I've never heard anything like a revelation, or a prophecy. Some will argue it's all in my mind, which is fundamentally true. You might think that it's because I'm "crazy" (I'm assuming you mean people like me with mental illness when you use that word). I choose to believe that God has the power to speak to people through their subconscious minds. I believe He does this constantly, to everyone, and it's all according to a divine plan. I'm leaving the rest up to Him.  [info] None [info] 1375039653
Herxheim [info] &gt; I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder and that night I hadn't taken all my meds so I was freakin out badly. nailed it. pre-emptive edit for the uninitiated: skipping bipolar medication doesn't take you "back to normal bipolar," it boomerangs you way the hell off in the other direction.

virnovus [info] Both my brother and I tried to join a few years ago and were rejected.  I'm not sure why.

ChocolateMeoww [info] I know what you're feeling. You're the crazy one, and you can't believe it. It's hard being the one who's crazy. I, myself, have finally accepted that I'm the crazy one. I get anxious and panicky if I have the *slightest* feeling that the girl *might* be feeling negative towards the relationship. Yeah, that's a mouthful, but it's harder to explain than it really is. What I've learned now after I just got out of a relationship where I was the crazy one (yet again), is that **you just need to be upfront and honest with whoever you intend to date.** What I mean by that, is be honest about what you are. Accepting who you are, and letting others know that is crucial. I'm diagnosed with bipolar type II, predominantly depressive. I'm not technically diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, but I have an appointment with my psych about it next week. Now, as you can see, I've got some *major* issues. Those issues *never* will be accepted by an SO if you tell them that after you have a fight. I learned it the hard way. If you're upfront with an SO about it before a fight ever happens, than they will more than likely be understanding about it. It'll lower their expectations of you, but in the end, it's needed.

gattofila [info] Another reason why diagnoses can change as we age is because many disorders present in the late teens and mid-twenties (such as personality disorders). I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 in my late teens and then developed other disorders as I aged. As time went on other mental health issues became apparent because I was presenting new symptoms. I wasn't the same person at 18 that I was at 28. [info] None [info] 1375642696
bluedolphin4 [info] I guess I didn't consider this, I do often find myself swinging between two different phases.  There are times when I am full of unbounded confidence and feel I am capable of accomplishing whatever I set my mind to.  It almost like I feel invincible.  When I feel this way, I generally have the urge to party alot.  Then there are other times when I consider myself worthless; just another piece of flesh on this planet who falsely thinks he has everything figured out.  During this phase, I tend to not want to go out much and prefer to stay in my room.  Guess it makes sense that I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  Aside from this, I also was physically abused when I was younger, so that might've had some sort of long-term impact on me.  However, I do believe I am good at hiding this part of me, it's only in more serious relationships that these traits tend to reveal themselves.

NeuralAgent [info] Because a lot of people - police or anyone else - don't understand or don't want to comprehend mental illness. I've been told too many times before I was diagnosed with bipolar that I need God or I just need to get my shit together. I knew something was wrong for years, couldn't fix myself and no one seemed to give a shit. Took going to 5 mental health professionals before one actually took the time to help me figure things out and get the medication I needed. The 1st therapist was a cognitive therapist, he basically told me I wasn't trying hard enough. So if mental health professionals can't wrap their heads around someone's issues, how are we going to get an apathetic populous to care about mental health issues and get police to act restrained when dealing with a person with mental issues?

outonthetown [info] I have been where you are. First, if you aren't happy with your therapist and psychiatrist -- who should NOT push meds on them if you have stated you are not interested -- you can always look into seeing someone else, and make it clear you are not interested in medication. You voluntarily went for therapy, YOU are in charge of what happens there. They cannot make you take your medication, unless you become institutionalized. If you feel talk therapy can help you, I suggest looking for another therapist before quitting that. But, if you don't feel that meds are right for you -- and it looks like they might not be, don't take them. I don't, and I have a much easier time (I have been diagnosed with bipolar and BPD, the later of which I am not sure about. Always remember that psychiatry is an extremely subjective study, and many doctors will diagnose you with different things.) However, I still actively take care of myself. I eat healthy, try to exercise, take supplements, journal, and do other things for self-care. I have always believed that when possible, this is the best route of health. Today, doctors jump tot he idea that problems are caused by neurochemistry; not all are; and they jump to the fact that only pills can solve that; that's not true at all. Take care of yourself in theway that feels right for you. [info] None [info] 1376266668
isaaaaaaaaaa [info] My parents used to tell me to just stop being depressed. But after a few years, they got it. I think it helped when I was diagnosed with bipolar.

trainercase [info] It depends 100% on context - who I'm talking to, why I'm telling them, etc. Also a quick grammar note - saying "I am bipolar" is like saying "I am diabetic" not "I am diabetes". It's not grammatically wrong, but the connotations can be subtly different than "I have bipolar disorder" or "I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder." "Am" and "have" both describe it as one of your traits, but "am" is usually used for more fundamental aspects of yourself than "have" is. "Am/was diagnosed with" makes it sound more like a label that was imposed upon you by doctors, which can impart some external authority but also places a weaker claim about it as a part of your basic identity - which may or may not be what you wish to accomplish!

MoppyFlinge [info] I have never encountered this.I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I was diagnosed with bipolar 4 years ago. My mum is bipolar with quite possibly psychotic episodes (she is seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow). Last night she attacked her partner, and was arrested for his and her own safety. How is that something that people would want. It's not glamorous because some famous person has it. It's fucking crippling, and debilitating, and it makes you feel like a fucking freak for not wanting to face the world and feeling like you want to break everything any time someone walks near you. It's bullshit. Anyone who wants a mental illness can have my mums, because she really really could do with a break from hers. [info] None [info] 1376992214

doct_quinn [info] I agree with this so much.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and PTSD, and it took years for me to accept it.  I went to so many different doctors hoping that everyone was wrong, but all of them kept saying the same thing.  When you actually have a mental illness, chances are when you're first diagnosed you aren't going to immediately accept it and start labeling yourself as that.  I was first diagnosed with PTSD 4 years ago, and only recently told someone other than my mother.  (And that was because I had a minor freakout, and felt the need to kind of explain it.  No one was surprised to find out at all.)  I feel like one of the biggest ways to tell if someone is a self diagnoser is by how quickly they make that label their entire existence.  For me at least, mental illness is only a small facet of who I am. [info] dovah-kin [info] 1377235285
Ididnotresurface [info] I do know that I'm dependent on it, but at the same time, I know I'm dependent on it because I'm self-medicating. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 18 (along with a plethora of other comorbid mental illnesses) and received treatment up until I graduated college. After that, I could no longer afford much more than food and shelter, let alone doctor and medication costs. Especially since virtually no health insurance would take me as a client because I'm so high risk. So, in my mind, if I had to stop medication, I could at least lessen the torment of bipolar by drinking.Yes, I know this is just slowing down the process of me killing myself, but I'd rather slow it down than give up completely. All the same, I do truly thank you for your concern. I have plans to get back on my feet, but unfortunately that's going to take some time. For now, just wish me luck.Tl;dr- I would love to get help, but it's not always that simple. [info]  [info] 1377442822
OneFatPsycho [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar one in 2011 and my mood seems to be quite similar. I was also really extrovert until I was about 14, I then became introvert and would not really talk to many people outside my select group of friends, it wasn't that I was stuck up, I was just kind of shy and no longer very outgoing. Still to this day I get some days show up out of the blue where I just wake up full of energy and enthusiasm for no particular reason. My psychologist calls this state hyper mania. Not full blown mania where I think I'm the fucking messiah, but just enough manic-ness to be like "fuck yeah I can accomplish anything today!" [info] None [info] 1377517033
Qwiverlips [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in my mid teens. The worst auditory hallucination Ive ever had was when I was about eighteen years old. One night while I was lying in bed trying to fall asleep I began to hear a cacophony of loud moaning. It was as if I was listening to the sounds of one hundred people slowly dying. It was terrible. All I could hear was the loud moans of agony. It was at this point that I decided to listen more carefully, as if I could hear a voice faintly coming through in the distance. That's when  I heard it. At first it was quiet and then it grew louder. The most horrifying voice I've ever heard in my entire life. It was as if all the agonizing moans began to resonate together to create one harmonious tone of evil. The noise then grew so loud that I could literally feel the sound waves traveling through my ear canal right down to the core of my being. I couldn't understand what the voice was saying and it definitely wasn't speaking in english but I could feel it and it wasn't pleasant. Nothing like this has ever happened  to me since but it was such a powerful experience that I will remember it vividly for the rest of my life. [info] None [info] 1377574800
retconneds [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14 - dropped out of school, severely depressed, hospitalized several times and on a lot of medication - and my mum basically put her entire life on hold for me. Single mother and only child - we were incredibly, incredibly close. I can barely process how awful my illness must have been for her and I know I was absolutely horrible to her for during that time and caused her so much pain and suffering. She died unexpectedly when I was 16, and in the 4 and half years since then I've had a lot of guilt over those last few years of her life and believing that if I had somehow been a better daughter to her that she would still be here, as well as guilt over that in the years since she's died I've become a very healthy happy person that she should have been able to see grow up.

Kiwi150 [info] ~5 years ago I was making a left onto Ehrlich from Dale Mabry and got hit head on by a lady on her cell phone who ran the red light she had. Because of this I have 3 major injuries in my back that leave me in pretty much constant pain (it only stops hurting *on occasion* when I shower or sleep). The doctors I saw got me loaded up on prescription pain killers, I was addicted in no time flat and it led to me committing some crimes. In addition to this, around the same time, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, for which I have to take a medicine that is basically destroying my liver slowly over time. 5 years ago a doctor told me I would need to start using a device to assist my walking (a cane). I have since left that doctor. After realizing what prescriptions like Opana, Nucynta, Vicodin, Percocet, Oxycontin or Ultram were doing to me, I stopped taking medicine for my back other than some "extra-strength" naproxen that does nothing for me. The medication for my Bipolar disorder also has a few unpleasant side-effects along with the liver damage like appetite loss (I only actually *feel* like eating maybe once a day, so I drink meal replacement shakes to remain nourished), stomach/abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting.So what do you think I do to take care of that intolerable pain, nausea, and appetite loss?I support the legalization of medical marijuana because it makes my life quite a bit more bearable.If it is legalized here in FL, all I can hope to forsee is that others' lives will be made more bearable by it.

I nearly did just that, and some part of me wishes I did.I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to take a knife to my throat, or the times I've ODed on pills, or the violent side of me that wants to come out and harm others, and, in one case, I was literally held back from harming someone at my last job.Mental illness isn't a joke, and I really wish people would understand it more.

christinefer [info] If you read the bible more. You'll see that God probably wants you to lean on him more than you want to, and that's ok. We are humans, our love for God can never be as perfect as his love for us.  I'm not saying don't try, but dont beat yourself up for it. Think about it this way, do you love animals? Do you love your gf? God loves his son, Jesus, but in order to save us from sin, jesus was sent to the cross for us. That's just how much he loves you. Would you give your gf up for your neighbor? Doubt it. My suggestion to you is to read more of the bible, and ask God for wisdom when you read it. See his love in every verse. Old or new testament. Starr to trust Him more. In everything. Let him be like a father to you. Talk to him. God wants you to prosper in every part of your life, not just in your emotions, but every part. Know you are righteous in his eyes because of Jesus blood. I know a pastor that was recommended to me by a friend,  his name is pastor joseph prince. He really explains a lot on God's love for us and his insights on the bible will really open your eyes to how loving and generous god is. You should also go on websites like godandscience . Org since you were an atheist and believe in logic. Believe it or not, God is pretty logical.  He created science.  It's unfortunate that Christians get a bad rep for being illogical and high on fairy dust when in fact a lot of science tallies with the bible.  Do listen to pastor joseph prince, you can find his preaching on his church's site newcreation.org.sg or some of his preachings on youtube. His church is in singapore, I attended his sermons when he was in the US last year. He has preached all over the world, I believe God has prospered his mission because it has helped many turn to Jesus. I'm just eager to share because I learned more about the bible and God's love from him than I ever did anywhere else, but ultimately,  it's up to you. God has saved me from a lot, and I'm happy you are happy now too. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but thanks to God, I WAS discharged and have had no relapses for YEARS thanks to God and am now prosperous in many areas of my life.

I didn't want to die, but I felt like I was being pushed to. I couldn't stop thinking about it, intrusive thoughts definitely. I told my counselor and they had me involuntary committed.

sparkingthefire [info] I guess is feels like months. It's probably much shorter as I did start having issues when 1.55 came out. When I try to install my disc, first it wouldn't handle the updates. Now if I install it then go to run it it crashes. It's taken so long because it's frustrating and I'm also in college and work part time, plus I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and one of the medications made it known after a few tests that I have a very TINY brain tumor thing. So lot's of doctor's appointments. My discs won't do anything now, but now that I'm downloading them, base game will run, and it has downloaded every expansion with no previous issues.

I felt terrible and almost thought that it would be permanent and that I would have to choose between being mentally stable and being physically fit.  But I got angry and decided that there's no fucking way I'm going to stay like this, and bought a gym membership at my local rec center.

wtu [info] I just recently finished my undergrad in social work, so I am by no means an expert but I do know the overview of most disorders. When him and I were still talking and getting to know each other he had used the word manic to describe past moods which caught my attention because that is a very clinical word. I didn't think too much of it or dwell on it though. Fast forward to the first night something happened. We were blissfully having a fantastic night. Made dinner, talked and laughed and kissed. All of a sudden his mannerisms shifted. His body language tensed up and he no longer wanted to talk. We went to bed and turned on the TV. He would move my hand away from him and made sure nothing about us was touching. As I was falling asleep he told me I needed to leave. I asked him why and he told me I just needed to. I asked if I could give him a kiss and he said no. Later on that night I was thinking things through and that's when I remembered him using the word manic and I was more or less convinced. The next day a work I printed out the Wikipedia article on bipolar and the more I read the more it confirmed it. He asked me to come over that night to talk about things. He was still very stiff body language and made sure we wouldn't touch at all. About an hour into the conversation I said, "You once said that sometimes you get manic.." and he goes, "Yes. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 18. But you already knew that didn't you." I told him I had come to that conclusion within those 24 hours [info] None [info] 1379708840

Meaning, I got married first and got my life somewhat together before our little one surprised us. So there's a LOT of pressure riding on me on how to raise my baby. I understand everyone's concern, but they're making me feel like I'm gonna fail miserably just because I'm younger (I'm 21, SO 25). But I think they're all freaking out because they think I'm MENTALLY unable to care for my own child.

hell_kat [info] Oh, my mom has borderline personality disorder (refuses meds/thinks shrinks do more harm than good), agoraphobia, food issues (former bulimic) and more!  She was a treat to grow up with.  My dad was better but enabled her and had different issues. Some gems:- "We thought your brother was going to be the screw up."  This was when I chose to be a stay at home mom.  The other women in the family were stay at home moms but not by choice.  I went to university and stayed home.  That pissed her off.  My brother had learning issues.- "If you ever try that fucking shit again, I'm going to have you locked in a mental institute."  At 13 I attempted suicide.  Apparently it was too much to worry about your kid when you have a lot going on.- Less of a specific comment and more of an incident.  My mother took me around to multiple diet clinics getting quotes for programs.  I was weighed, examined, etc.  Apparently I was getting 'fat'.  We didn't have money to join any of them and later than night she bought us pie.  The reason is resonates with me is that years later I saw a pic of me at that age.  I was perfect.  Truly.  I was taller than my mom, had bigger boobs and built very athletically.  Because I was 'bigger' than her, I was fat.  And that was the beginning of her obsession with my weight and issues.- 'Stop being so fucking high and mighty.  He is disabled and you need to fucking deal with it and stop being such a bitch.  You never liked him since the accident."  My disabled (with head trauma too) uncle started making sexual remarks to me and began asking me to sit on his lap.  I told the folks he freaked me out.  So many more but those are some of the best.  Thankfully I was diagnosed with bipolar and got to have YEARS of awesome therapy.  Also married an amazing guy and cut the crazies out 10 years ago.

ellivia [info] &gt;She stated that I was suffering from a mental disorder such as bipolar or some other thing she mentioned I can't recall.The only mental disorder that I could even remotely see causing anyone to have gender identity issues would be schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  These cause delusional thoughts and hallucinations and could probably fuck with you on occasion.  I've been diagnosed with bipolar type I although I'm pretty sure I actually have schizoaffective disorder (long story, don't tell my psychiatrist everything, should prolly fix that, etc) and I often have to reassure myself that it isn't my mental disorders causing my identity issues, it is entirely separate.As far as I know, no mental disorder has ever caused a person to believe that they are a different gender from their assigned sex, at least not for prolonged periods of time where they actually felt they needed to transition.  I think that mental disorders may be common among trans* folk, but I don't think it is a cause.Either way, there's no sufficient evidence that would show any type of correlation.  Your mother is making shit up to make her feel better instead of just accepting the truth.Edit: Just to throw it out there, my mom did the same thing.

nerdy_birdie10 [info] I'm 21, so not too far from the cut off age. I always loved my parents, but we butted heads a lot when I was in high school. They were always very communicative with me and so I knew about our financial troubles and all my mom's problems (deeply depressed and semi-addicted to prescription meds.) There were never any really serious problems between us or anything, but I was definitely ready to get out of there when I went to college.Then when I was 20 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my life was thrown into a tailspin. It took me a while to get my meds stright and feel balanced so for about a year and a half I was struggling in school, engaging in high risk behavior and was occasionally a suicide risk. My life was a shitshow, basically. And they took care of me in a way only parents can. They took the verbal abuse I hurled at them when they tried to stop me from doing dangerous things. They stayed up late with me when I couldn't stop crying. They were amazing. Looking back at that time and my life in general I could not be more thankful to have them.I always went to my dad for boy problems and he was so patient with me listening to the stupid teenage stuff we all go through. He and my mom both worked multiple jobs that were below them (they are both incredibly smart) just so they could provide for us and make sure we had what we wanted. I am overwhelmed by how much they love me, and I am so glad they took the time to make sure I became a kind a well rounded person. Now thankfully things have turned around for me and I'm back in school and doing well. I talk to them often and let them know I appreciate them. I know a lot of people suffer with awful parents and I  am glad I realized just how lucky I am to have them.....I'm going to go call them now. [info] None [info] 1381169790

awkwardaster [info] I have Bipolar 1 and also respond well to medication. I haven't gone to therapy much, but lately because of a recent episode I will be attending therapy. I have psychotic manic episodes and rarely get depressed. When I am exposed to extreme stress and have a hard time sleeping, I will have racing thoughts and then get into a manic episode. When I'm having a manic episode I typically get extremely philosophical (I'm normally not) and sometimes paranoid about the government, my family, etc. I will think that other people are living with a blindfold on and I'm the only one who can "see the light". Sometimes I become "promiscuous" or want to buy things I don't need, but I typically do not harm myself or others. If the episode is really bad I will have outbursts and panic attacks as well as paranoia.   I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 17 (I am currently 22), in the spring of my senior year of high school. I have been hospitalized because of it. Fortunately I have an extremely supportive family who always help me recover after an episode. Since my diagnosis I have only had 4 bad episodes. I know that I need to live a life where I have a good self care routine and am exposed to low levels of stress. I can get by on just one mood stabilizer when my stress levels are low, but when they increase I need to take an antipsychotic. I would prefer to not take medication, but it is something I need because of my condition.  [info] None [info] 1381423922

MedievalPenguin [info] How ya doing? I was diagnosed with bipolar II when I was 20. Started to hallucinate during my first time in grad school (I must have been about 24 or 25). Was rejected from the priesthood because of it, but it's all good because I met my wonderful fiancee, and there's a chance in a few years time I could become a deacon. I'm also a lay Dominican. Enough about me.&gt;I struggle to rationalize why a loving God would make me suffer so very much. Why He would make my day to day existence such a struggle. Why I would be drawn to what is clearly a mortal sin with seemingly no outside influence. I'm going to clear this up now. First of all, when you're drawn to suicidal thoughts, that in itself isn't a mortal sin. Having those thoughts is a combination of broken brain chemistry and a reaction to stress. You don't want those thoughts. They just happen. If you start to indulge in them, maybe fantasize about what death is like, then that's a different issue. Even though given your illness, I'd be reluctant to call them straight-up mortal. That's really something your therapist and your priest can talk to you about.As to why you suffer... there's no easy answer. A priest told me once I was a casualty in the war between Heaven and hell. Maybe that imagery works for you, but I don't like it. Part of me always says, "God could have protected you, but He didn't." So why would God do that? Does my suffering have a purpose? It seems that it can. Do I know it? Not necessarily. I do have a pet theory though. I believe any suffering, but mental illness especially, can be an invitation to more greatly participate in the suffering of Christ. We "offer up" our physical maladies, so it only makes sense that our psychological pain is fair game, too. Personally I like to think that my bipolar particularly participates in the passion and death of Jesus and (if von Balthasar is right) even his total self-emptying descent into Sheol. Sheol's big for me, and I'll explain why in a bit. With this understanding, I find that it doesn't take away my suffering, but that I am at peace with it, that God is using my patient enduring to do good, perhaps to someone suffering worse than I who doesn't have Christ or to someone I'll never meet.Devotions. I mentioned Sheol. One of the scenes of Jesus' mission I like to meditate on is the descent into Sheol. I often imagine myself in there, in the darkness, confused, alone, suffering. Then gradually the triumphant Christ comes on to the scene to take my hand gently and lead me to Paradise. Sometimes He says something, sometimes He doesn't. Sometimes I take time to meditate on the touch of His hand or the glow of His face. When you take your time with it, it can be a very moving, beautiful, and healing experience. The Easterners have a beautiful icon of this call the [anastasis](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Anastasis_Dodekaorton.jpg). I have a copy that I use for this reflection.Another scene I meditate on is the Pieta, Mary holding the body of Christ before He is buried. I imagine myself as the dead body of Christ (because when we're depressed, isn't that how we feel?) and picture me being placed in Mary's loving arms. She cradles me, rocks me back and forth, weeps for me. I let her love fill me as much as I can. At the end I allow myself to be taken from her (again) and entombed. When you focus on Mary's love for Jesus, this can be another very powerful and healing prayer experience.I'm also going to advocate you go to mass every week. Daily if you can. Even if you can't lift yourself up to receive the Eucharist, just sitting there will do much for your soul. The same goes for Adoration.Books. I know there are a number of books out there that deal with various mental disorders and the faith. I don't know anything about them, though. Scripture has always helped me. I find Ecclesiastes strangely comforting when I'm depressed, probably because I can't tolerate an upbeat, happy story then. The Prophets tend to be good, too.Finally, I'd recommend working on your relationship with Mary. Mary will comfort you in your pain. And she will lead you to a closer relationship with Jesus.Just remember you're not alone. Jesus is beside you when you're in Sheol. Mary embraces you when you feel dead. And there are more people like you than you realize. God bless. I'll keep you in my prayers. [info] None [info] 1381517215
Jewcipher [info] I feel as though I am completely out of control if I drink or smoke weed ( ive never done drugs). You have to cut that out. You have a tamed monster inside of you. The monster comes out if you drink, do drugs or arent on the proper meds. Also I have found that journaling helps so much. Especially when youre in a manic mood. I would sometimes get really high (that makes me most depressed and self aware) and I would write down everything I hated about myself and what I was doing wrong with my life and on later dates I would go back over it as a sort of check list and decide not to do some of the things or change situations (relationships) I was in that was making me unhealthy and moody. I was diagnosed with bipolar since like 14 and 5 years ago diagnosed with bpd(im 25). I understand myself soooo much better now. I read a memior that really helped me out a lot called 'loud in the house of myself". Its about a girl so idk how much you could realte but it rwally opened my eyes on my whole self worth issue.

lovemybug38 [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I'm only on adhd meds and antidepressants.  I have a daughter and I feel much better when I take them so I do but, I think the hardest thing  I had to overcome was the fact that I had to use a synthetic substance to be the kind of person my family wants to be around.  My mom especially.  For example,  She and I went out to eat and shopping one day and she treated me fine.  We got home and my mamaw (whom I live with and am very close to)  noticed that I didn't take my meds.  My mom heard and treated me like I was 2 and the biggest annoyance on earth to her.

FizzyPops [info] I don't feel bad for trying to kill myself. I hurt my family and, for that, I feel bad. But, my suicide attempt was the wake up call I needed to get healthy. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple of years ago and it's been a rough road. I've seen a number of doctors, tried countless medications, and stayed in the mental hospital a bunch of times. Life seemed hopeless. So hopeless that I tried to end it.   Now I go to therapy twice a week. One of those is a DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) group. My medications are worked out. I'm no longer codependent. I've lost weight. My future looks good. [info] None [info] 1381848505
RAGE-RAGE-RAGE [info] For some people it does seem to be a 180 flip, completely unexpected. That's what people said about me until I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder recently. "But you seemed so happy!" I guess I should take that as a compliment to my acting.Honestly, we can never know every individuals reason for suicide, but I can try and shed a little light on things.Sometimes people just get tired of fighting. Life seems like an upward struggle, but they keep going until one day they ask themselves why. Why are they doing this if it hurts so much? Some people have an answer. Because of my kids, my dog, my wife, my husband etc. But sometimes there is no answer. They are unable to find a reason to live, and they think there must be one, at least one thing to keep going for, and yet they still find nothing. Sometimes this is a slow realization, but often it can be sudden, but equally as devastating in either case. Sorry if this doesn't answer your questions. [info] None [info] 1382177536
MedievalPenguin [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II. Your story strikes similar chords with my own manic paranoid delusions. I, too, would believe that some large, very well-connected, well-organized organization was threatening me and my family because I had inadvertently stumbled on to their plan. I believed that they were able to use mind-control via hypnotic suggestion to control those close to me. I was so convinced that I was a target that I would not eat anything I didn't prepare nor drink water from the tap for fear it might be drugged or poisoned. A friend (the one person I still trusted) suggested that what I was saying didn't make sense and I should see my psychiatrist about adjusting my medication. He convinced me, and I went and started a new treatment plan. I haven't had those thoughts since.I don't know about you, but I also had a lot of trouble sleeping during those times. If you're having the same problem, tell your psychiatrist. S/he may be able to put you on something that's not habit-forming like trazadone. [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1382480477

Therapy is always good, but when used in conjunction with meds, I think it's even better.I'm on a different combination now (to help stabilize my moods now, too, since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder) and it feels like my brain has finally chilled out instead leaping around but mostly staying down, which is what it had been doing.

kirolm [info] I started when I was 13.I cut my arms and wore long sleeves all the time (I live in Texas, if that tells you anything about how much this stood out). It was an outlet to get some release from issues I was having that I couldn't even put into words. It not only was a cry for help I didn't quite understand, when my family found out my mother couldn't stop blaming herself, my sisters were scared and angry on the off chance I was doing it for attention (it sounds fucked up but is not uncommon and it is an understandable reaction due to the high emotions flying everywhere), and it fucked up a lot of relationships, both romantic and platonic.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15 after a 3-week "voluntary" psych ward stint (My mother called the ambulance. They told me they either took me in or foot me with the $1000ish dollar ambulance bill) and set on anti-depressants and therapy. I relapsed and went back into psych wards at ages 17 and 19 (Probably tied to my inability to provide for my newborn at the time due to all my issues). I stopped cutting around then and have been doing my best to keep up with child support, take care of myself, work and have a good life.I had two relapses at ages 23 after a really bad breakup and during a cruise last year when things came to a head resulting in my current divorce. How's that for TMI :DAnywho, I am stable and I know that cutting is a symptom, albeit one that is more easy to avoid and manage with good habits than others. Having things that get my mind off things (my guitar, writing, gaming) help put me in a better state of mind before making any big decisions.Hope that gives you a bit of insight? :D I am now 27.

I_wanted_truth [info] Most definitely. I think folks like us experiencing this relief/freedom have to watch out for when the "natural high" of quitting wears off. And I should have mentioned earlier that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 10 years ago in my early 20s after being arrested after a very manic period. I tend toward the mania and don't really seem to have deep depressive periods. I've been unmedicated (or self medicated with weed) basically since then, though weed actually increases my mania and energy to some extent. I actually have more energy now, but it's clean and focused, if that makes any sense. Such an interesting journey life is! And so weird when a decade of your (my) identity comes from cannabis. And the simultaneous hiding it from my profession and colleagues. When I look back, though, I'm not sure if it could have been any other way. This was my path.  [info] None [info] 1383623718

Camden_Chaos [info] Thank you for your time. I agree, and I would add that schizophrenia is not well-understood, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder following a psychotic episode a couple years ago. It's a terrifying concept at first to one who fears the loss of his ordered thought structure and routine. Drug use primed me for a shift in consciousness, which of course is like another 'eye' in the body that adds a dimension to the information processed. It gives you another view of reality, and more information can be obtained through the process of experiencing them (with different filters that show a bigger piece of the whole).    Semantic understanding of these relationships can be reduced to a universal whole, but the problem has been communication this from person to person. Entropy represents the loss in translation through a medium. Symbols repeat themselves in patterns that can be recognized time and time again, but in an attempt to communicate this same truth in an infinite number of languages, accents, and so forth, it's easy to get confused. Imprinted symbol systems lead to an interpretation of nonsense from someone else.    What is schizophrenia? Why do we see people developing it over and over? Mental health is not well understood, and that is due to all of the social symbol imprinting out there. Try to describe something as "big" and the choices and ways that can be expressed over the whole of humanity is crazy. It is thus a goal to reduce "big" to a direction relative to an observer. The more elements you define, the more confusing everything becomes and the more misunderstandings we have with other people. More people are suffering as the world becomes more technologically charged, and ideas can move more quickly. A life out of balance that will generate negative feedback until we return to a simpler paradigm.    This relationship exists in art and the communication of symbols without discriminatory filters that we might find in other areas of judgment. I have written in my spare time throughout my life, and my creative endeavors spontaneously arrived at a meta-concept. Sure, at first, it appears to be disorganized thinking that is drawing lines between dots that aren't even there. But I kept returning to it, changing it, seeing how it was reflecting issues of my life, elements of fantasy culture and mythology that sparked my childhood imagination, and adding new concepts. I integrated more things, and it seems apparent in the moment that everything is connected. So the natural pursuit at first is to create a beautiful story and share my thoughts, and once I discovered this, the next natural progression is realizing that the physical body is only one component of a continuous infinite experience leads me to not fear death (nor to actively pursue it) but to spend the rest of my time and energy trying to communicate this revelation so that we are not afraid and can align our goals toward increasing future awareness and enjoying the remainder of life unified by this truth.    Perhaps this schizophrenic pattern we see that continues to manifest itself in individuals for an unknown reason is an evolutionary attempt to make sense of this, or of an active process of awakening. It keeps happening until a perfect form is achieved, getting closer at each step. Not sharing this information out of fear of judgement or prosecution is ridiculous. I will acknowledge that in previous "cycles" of my attempts to make this realization, the momentum to proceed has always been in integrating the previous works into a meaningful whole.

the_taraist [info] I thought about using a throwaway, but what the hell?I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder 6 years before I started law school, but I was sick much longer prior to that.  I'm not sure what affect it has had on my performance, because I don't really know what law school is like without bipolar.  I've been relatively stable.  I'm a mediocre student, but I have a job I love, and I think the future looks pretty good.  My latest setback are panic attacks, which I have not experienced before this semester.  I think it is a combination of working 20 hours a week, plus full time classes- just the first time I've done that.I'm going to join everyone in saying that you're not alone.  The stigma is pretty bad, and depending on your state, you might have to disclose.  I disclosed bipolar on my application for character and fitness.  I had my interview a couple weeks ago, and the thing that really let me swim through was 1. I have not gotten in any legal troubles, and 2. I've never been hospitalized.  And how does a "crazy" person, like myself, pull that off?  Compliance with my treatment plan, and general good health habits like everyone has described here.  (Although I'm quite lax with certain things because I'd prefer not to stress over little details.)  Exercise is huge for me, though.So, I guess what I'm saying is its better to get help and disclose, than not get help for fear of disclosing. I realize you didn't mention that, but it was horrifying to me at first.  I talked to my ethics professor, though, who was a huge help.  We had some people give a presentation on mental health at school, and they said something like 10% of people have a mental illness or substance abuse problem when they start law school, and by 3L that number jumps to 40%.  People might not be talking - but they are in it.edit:typo [info] Esq. [info] 1384414147

Lunaskitty [info] I totally get your feeling and must say that I agree with the person who said stay on your meds. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 for years now and have the same ups and downs. I recently stopped taking my meds for several months because "aw I feel better I don't need it" and almost ended up in the hospital. Remember that feeling, its your brain working against you. It does get better give the lithium at least three weeks before you decide that its not working but stay in good contact with the dr about how you feel. One thing that I have noticed is that normal antidepresants make the feelings worse and she may need to take you off the sertraline and find something else to pair the lithium with. Keep going!!!! Have faith that it will get better and if the first thing you try doesn't work don't let it get you down too much quite often it may work for a little bit then quit. At least this is the experience that i have had. But the big thing is keep taking the meds and keep in contact with the dr if you can do that, you are headed the rite direction! Good job keep your head up!!! You can do it. [info] None [info] 1384838168

fruitblender [info] I'm so sorry for your loss, OP. Many hugs to you. My paternal grandfather had bipolar. I didn't find out until after he had passed a few years ago. He had alzheimers and a ton of other problems. I'll never forget him though, I visited him in the hospice a few times, and he would always remember me. Once I visited him and he later told my grandmother he thought I was his daughter who passed from cancer 20-something years ago. Kind of heart breaking, really. My cousin has it, too. I don't talk to him about it though, because that side of my family is a bunch of gossips, and its gotten out to other family members that I'm diagnosed with bipolar, when quite frankly, its none of their goddamn business (I may be a little bitter). &gt;No one in our family really acknowledged mental illness until I was 15 and at an inpatient center.You know, my immediate family never talks about mental illness, and when I talk to my mom about it, she tells me its a phase and we all have highs and lows. It breaks my heart, and I feel really alone sometimes.

ripvanfish [info] When I was diagnosed with bipolar, I was with a partner who didn't believe in mental illness--after my diagnosis he came into my doctor's office and shouted at my doctor for filling me with damaging ideas and "enabling" my behavior, for trying to push pills at me; he ended up flushing all of my medication (over $100 worth, for someone who was struggling to make ends meet even before I started taking medication) and I couldn't afford to replace them, so I gave up on treatment and let my mental illness fester and worsen for another three years. That's three years of my life wasted just barely scraping by instead of flourishing, because my symptoms ran my life and ruined my relationships.I honestly can't understand why your wife would be angry at your over this idea, unless she's like my ex-partner - for you sake, though, I really hope that's not the case. First thing, you should get yourself to a psych for an evaluation, but if you want your marriage to last (especially if you end up with a diagnosis), getting your wife on board with your treatment is really important. I can't tell you the damage it did to my mental health and my ability to love to spend such a long time with a person who kept me from getting help. Bipolar has a stigma. My last room-mate found out I had bipolar after we moved in together; every time she got drunk around me she would make this rambling speech about how when she found out I had bipolar she was really scared and regretful she agreed to move in with me, but it turned out I wasn't really like other bipolar people so she was glad how things worked out. Well... I suppose she meant it as a nicety but it never made it any less painful to hear. But your wife might be like her - well-meaning, but afraid of the idea of bipolar because she's had a bad experience with someone in the past. Just remind her that you are the same person you've always been - getting a diagnosis changes nothing about who you are; you're still the same person she fell in love with, you just now have a better understanding of your own brain chemistry and behavior, which will enable you to manage it more effectively and be a better partner.

wannaridebikes [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar first. But now I think my current psych disagreed with the diagnosis, and I'm more inclined to agree the more I work with him and my therapist.I'm no expert on schizophrenia, but I don't know if this is a genuine visual delusion. It's not like I see a different face than what they are making, I just interpret it differently. I do plan to bring this up at my next appointment with my psych though. I guess I'll be prepared if he brings this up but...I'm not sure if it applies. [info] ADHD-PI [info] 1386648882
kabneenan [info] Warning, speculation ahoy!A few years ago, when I first heard about misophnia, I read an article that suggested the condition is neurological in nature, possibly arising after a traumatic brain injury. That makes the most sense for me. When I hear a trigger sound, it is not a learned or conditioned response I react with. It is pure reflex and not something I can control. It is similar in sensation to my reactions when I am in either a manic or depressive episode (I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago). It feels distinctly like it's not *me*. Unfortunately, it's been my experience that most health care providers across a spectrum of specialties do not acknowledge the existence of misophonia. Until it is and research is done as to its cause, we can't really know for sure.  [info] None [info] 1386704443

ab24342 [info] If you don't want your disorder to be the focus of your SOP, maybe you could relegate it to the section where you're offered to provide "additional information about yourself that may be of interest to the committee." Most of my applications have a section for this. While I am not applying to psychology programs, I am in a similar situation. I was diagnosed with bipolar my junior year after having a manic episode, and I took the semester off midway through to recover, which resulted in a bunch of W W W W W for withdraw on my transcript. I was extremely hesitant to mention it as well (I don't like to have to "prove" or "justify" my stability to others) , but decided I should explain my transcript. I chose to do this in that section that I mentioned and compromised by stating "I fell ill and took the semester to recover." I found this website helpful for how to structure such an essay: http://theartofapplying.com/how-to-structure-an-optional-essay-for-hks/. Since you're psychology though, your situation might be more instrumental to your decision so you would be more inclined to put it in my SOP. Just offering another perspective!

NielsHenrikDavidBohr [info] Have you tried exercise, a sleeping pattern, and healthy eating? There is no excuse to not exercise for at least three hours a week (and with exercise I mean REAL exercise that makes you sweat, turns up your heart rate a lot and gets you out of breath like soccer, fitness, running, et cetera). Sleeping pattern can be fixed by waking up at the same time in the morning every day. Do not get too hard on yourself when you miss a day, but try to be persistent (having to be somewhere in the morning is a great help). Healthy eating is done by not buying crap and reading up on food a bit.The three factors of healthy eating, sleeping well and exercising are in my opinion the BEST antidepressant there is. By bringing this discipline in your life your worries will get less and you will start to enjoy life. More than any antidepressant can do for you.Source: I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after an extremely happy spiritual experience that got out of hand and felt very unhappy on medication and being trapped in the "you cannot recover and have to take medication for the rest of your life"-story. Then focusing on these three topics (also of course having life goals, but these three things are life goals in of themselves) and waning off the medication helped me tremendously and now I am very content with my life.

Wild_Red_Fox [info] Holy shit you might actually be me. I was diagnosed with bipolar over a year ago and gained 80 lbs due to the meds. I've tried really hard to lose it but have been finding it difficult. I also have no idea how to be fat. I've always been fit and normal sized. I returned to university with 4 tops and 2 pairs of jeans. I'm too fat for my regular clothes. And clothes shopping is suddenly so fucking depressing! I don't dress in what I like any more, it's just one big (unsuccessful) coverup job.Oh, and I'm developing an extra chin. My cheekbones and collar bones have drowned =(Oh, and I'm 24.

BisexualBetty [info] It's difficult to get past the diagnosis because it clouds everything I do. Like if I get upset and break down it becomes a constant "oh you're having an episode you're broken" cycling in my head. So it's pretty much made my life worse.

perkelemofo [info] Get help. It doesn't have to be like this.I used to be angry, like you. I used to hate everyone, and everything. I spent my days dreaming about suicide, and hurting others. I thought up plans to kill myself, kill strangers, kill my family. I was panicked, angry, depressed, and self-loathing. I would cut myself, punch myself, and cry until I threw up. My panic attacks prevented me from sleeping. I knew I wouldn't make it to 16. I was seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, and tried medication after medication, but it made no real difference. Every second of living felt like torture, like a horrible mistake, and I slogged through the pain until I could find the right time to kill myself.My mom found something I wrote, angry and hateful like your post, suggesting violence and self harm. She called my psychiatrist. I talked to her for over an hour, and she peeled away the layers; all the things I'd never told her. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and put on Lithium. I railed against it at first, and hated how it made me feel, but I think within the angry, hateful teenager was a scared little girl who just desperately wanted to get better - so I took the pills obediently.Within a few months I was a different person. It evened out my emotions, calmed the anger, and banished my panic attacks. The black cloud suffocating my life began to dissipate, and I rediscovered myself: a person I had forgotten existed, who didn't hate and resent life, no, she even thrived on it. I relearned what it was like to sleep through the night without being kept awake by panic attacks. I relearned what it was like to enjoy the company of other people. I relearned what it was like to not hate myself, and begin to recognize my own worth. I relearned what it was like to see beauty in the world.It doesn't have to be like this. You're young, and you probably grew into these feelings, as I did, and it's probably all you've known as you've grown into self-awareness and emotional maturity. I know you probably can't imagine any other existence than the one you're experiencing right now, and it seems like the only outlet is death. I know it may sound unbelievable to you right now, as it did to me 10 years ago, but you *can get better*. Go see someone who can prescribe medication. Don't hold back, tell them everything you've been experiencing. Any psychiatrist worth their salt will hear you out and take you seriously - if they don't, find someone who does.It's not an easy trek on the road to serenity and self acceptance, but such a road does exist for you, as it did for me. Please get help. You deserve to feel better, and you can feel better, if you take the right steps; the hard part is discovering what that is for you, but once you do, god, is it worth it.If you ever want anyone to talk to, or at, please send me a message. I've been where you are, and I know the horror and bleakness of it. I want you to see sunshine again, and realize that the world is okay. I want you to find peace within yourself. You can get better.

the_taraist [info] Probably just joining in with the choir on this, but my advice is to ask her.I didn't even know I was diagnosed with bipolar until I changed doctors after moving home from college.  I assumed as much based on what medications I was prescribed, but neither my doctor nor my counselor told me what they thought I had.  I understand not wanting to be defined by an illness, or be labeled, but not telling your patient his or her diagnosis is just wrong and unethical.  First, it is insulting.  Second, in my opinion, it can be harmful.  From what I've seen, having insight can be a huge advantage.  I don't see how anyone can achieve any good level of insight while having their diagnosis hidden from them. [info]  [info] 1387421570

Jezabelle426 [info] The biggest thing is that it can actually take 3 to 6 months to get the full effect of the medication. If he's like me, where in the winter months it gets worse, he may need to start taking something,  if it's new, in late summer or fall. My previous doctors would have me on a combination of things for a month and if it didn't seem to be helping they would constantly change it. The pharmacist I spoke with (who had specialized in medications pertaining to mental health), told me to find a doctor and/or therapist who would listen to me and be patient. Best advice ever. I hope it all works out for him (and you). It's not an easy thing for either party to endure. My dad is manic depressant and I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I've had my share.

Satellites- [info] With my experience, there was a whole host of other issues going on with the friendship, including her being fairly abusive towards me, making racist remarks about one of our mutual friend's partners, calling me fat and simultaneously telling other people about my issues (I have been diagnosed with bipolar and an eating disorder) etc etc. The friendship wasn't salvageable, I knew it, I had tried to talk to her numerous times about our dynamic and how her behaviour was affecting me, whilst giving her the chance to talk about any issues she had. Her exact response was "I've never had a friend be so honest with me... and I don't like it", she would shut down or tell me it would change and then it wouldn't change.At the end of the day, it's up to you to decide if you want or don't want the friendship anymore. I was downvoted for relating my experience, likely because I chose to give up the friendship when so many here seem to think that because a friendship is long, you should work for it. I believe that it's not about the length of the friendship but the quality. If you are not getting any happiness from continuing this friendship, then why would you? You don't owe this girl anything, despite what people might say, and if she is so blind that she can't see that her actions might be hurtful or dismissive, then why would you want to continue the friendship anyway? There's nothing wrong with ending a friendship you don't think is working for you, no matter how long it lasted. As I get older, I realise more and more that I am not interested in working extremely hard to keep a friendship going against all odds, and that if I have to have the same conversations with my friends about boundaries and the way they talk about and to me, then it's not worth having them around. I wish that my friendship with my friend hadn't ended the way it did because I loved her. But she changed, a lot, and we just weren't compatible anymore. For months, I suffered, worrying about what I should do and how I should approach it whilst she continued to say awful things about me behind my back. I miss the way she was, but she hasn't got any better and I made the right decision for my own peace of mind. [info] None [info] 1388456006
Vitkauskas [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder... She might be distancing herself in her manic state, it can last weeks or longer. Is she medicated? Stable? I know if I miss my meds for very long I will literally cut out everyone in my life, then when I realize how crazy I am and get regulated again, I have to fix relationships. She could be just having a hard time, and are you sure her period wasn't a miscarriage? Hormones really fuck with your head... send her a text if possible and let her know you're there for her if she needs you, no mushy stuff. Short, and simple, and nothing she can twist in her head. I'm really bad about that.. Then leave her alone. Give it a month of no contacting her, if she wants out, she has out. If she wants to be with you, she'll contact you in that time, whether she is stable or not.  [info] None [info] 1388483113
LilkaLyubov [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar for a few years, two of which I was dating someone with BPD. It was slightly different for me, because I was seeing a therapist and taking meds. He, however, refused to consider treating his BPD, because "it's incurable and therefore why bother?". Even with the help I was getting, he dragged me down. Look, OP, I am not trying to insult people with BPD, I've met a few in my time, and I like a lot of them. But it is a volatile illness. I don't think I need to tell you why, a lot of other posts here already describe it. It was not different with me, and the way you've described it, it's like that with you.That sort of thinking you've got right now worries me. Take away all the mental illness, nobody should be your everything. It's great that you are each other's support, because going at it alone really sucks. But she can't help you, and you can't help her, at least not when you're both this ill. You sound so miserable. Please consider leaving, for both your sakes, because you are just dragging each other down. If you decide to stay, please talk to someone, and consider going on medication especially if you've truly got bipolar, like it says in the title. The side effects suck, but honestly, the side effects of the drug that works aren't as bad as how you're living right now, surely.  You need support of your own if you're going to support her, and neither of you are in a position to support each other right now. Especially her. I'm sorry, but if she wants to be in a healthy relationship, she needs to get a hold on her BPD. BPD is marked by disordered relationships, manipulation, and outbursts. She needs help.

monypooh12 [info] Gosh!  I wish you were a teacher of mine.  I am an 18 year old college student who will graduate college at the age of 20.  I will only spend 2.5 years in college.  I also have a 4.0, as I have had all of my life, graduated valedictorian and held an internship in NYC writing for a magazine publishing company - yet it always felt like almost every teacher and every administrator was a hinderance rather than a help.  I was always begging and pleading for the opportunities I rightly deserved and they were always opportunities that I had to go out and discover for my self as a young teenager.  No one in my school system ever really took any innitiative in trying to give me good advice and my parents had never dealt with a truly gifted child before, so it was mostly up to me to figure it all out for myself.  Luckily I made lots of great decisions and have ended up in a good place, but I am very lucky for this because as you mentioned along the way I suffered from pretty severe issues.  Halfway through highschool I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (and add) and was almost committed during a severe psychotic episode.  I also continued to suffer from symptoms of paranoia, hallucinations and delusions in my day to day life for quite some time.  I don't even really know how I maintained a normal and successful life with all this going on.  Not to mention my mother was a raging alcoholic.  Treatment of an illness like this isn't a walk in the park either.  Some of the meds they can put you on can do some serious damage, but I'm not complaining about psychiatry at all, because when you find the right one or the right dose....boy is it like magic. If there had just been someone there looking out for me who knew what the hell to do with bright students, I probably would have been much better off.  Instead they just fought me everystep of the way - and it was generally over silly technicalities.  For example:  In highschool I wasn't allowed to take the one philosophy course our high school offered because I wasn't in the "Gifted" program, because I wasn't tested for it in third grade, because I went to a private school in third grade.  Yet Lehigh University accepted me on a scholarship in highschool to take philosophy courses there and now I am a philosophy major who will be pursuing a Ph.D. in the field.I understand that those less fortunate with me face great obstacles, but I hate when people believe that being smart is easy as pie, because like you mentioned being smart using comes with a price.  It just makes me so happy to see someone like you actually recognizing this for once.  I am so excited for all of the people you will help.edit:  bipolar with add, and meds [info] None [info] 1389154925

Explolguy [info] First, I'd like to thank you for replying.I understand very much where he's coming from. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years ago after a suicide attempt. I spent a lot of time in a very bad place, and got out because I realized I needed help and let people help. A lot of my suggestions at doing certain activities come with the offer of doing them with me. We play games, we go out and do random whatever now and again. There are also days where he needs to vent, and I listen. But he asks for advice, and I give it, and he simply shrugs it off, saying he, "Can't do it and will never change," among other things.I am one person, and obviously not qualified to give suggestions, opinions, a diagnosis etc. that professionals are qualified to give. He acknowledges that he needs help, but doesn't want to make the jump to get it. I've been going around for months with him. And as ashamed as I am to admit this, I'm ready to throw in the towel.

DrewciferCDXX [info] Ten years ago, when I was diagnosed with epilepsy, my neurologist put me on Depakote, and I too had the fog.  I could barely function.  I told the doctor I didn't like it, and he took me off of it cold turkey and put me on Topamax, which caused me migraines.  I decided to see a different neurologist who said, "You can't quit depakote cold turkey!"  He put me back on it and weaned me off the topamax, and started the Lamictal pack, which I took until I got "the rash".  Eventuallly, I stopped taking anti-seizure meds all together and did just fine.When I was diagnosed with bipolar (a year and a half ago), my pdoc suggested depakote, and I asked him for something different.  I couldn't go back to that fog. [info] Meh... [info] 1390256416

MuchoMaas49 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 about 2 years ago and it has been really great actually. I got the diagnosis from a couple of people who should not have made it, they always put me on prozac and welbutrin. I always ended up becoming more emotionally volatile and ended up not being able to handle myself emotionally.When I went to an actual psychiatrist, they ended up giving me this drug called Lamotrigine. Well, it's crazy but it's amazing, completely turned my emotions around, and for my entire life I never had a way to self-sooth until I started taking the drug. It's not all that common, but I recommend you talk to your psychiatrist about it as an option. At this time I only take adderall and lamotrigine, and just an FYI, it's far more likely that you're bipolar type II, so make sure you read up on it, so you know that your doctor knows what he's talking about.

DungeonPeaches [info] It's not easy, some days. I was diagnosed with bipolar several years ago, and in that span of time, almost every family member I had died from cancer. I'm also under tremendous stress from my career, but honestly, my passion for drawing is about all I have left-- and it's saved me over and over when I'm going through a suicidal stage.

CrystalValkyrie [info] When you feel suicidal and "don't know why", it sounds like a mental illness. Just before I was diagnosed with bipolar I was homicidal and didn't know why.

larabair [info] Mr. B has attended a mental health appointment where we discussed what will happen when we start meds.  He brought me to my HSG. He also was at the original appointments at our initial clinic and diagnosis. He has not been to any of my RE appointments or ultrasounds since they both happen where I work and are just squeezed in.He is more willing to push medical intervention than I, but he is fully aware of what the mental health repercussions may be.   We have discussed all possible treatments at pretty deep length, and so he's prepared for what will happen this spring when we start drugs, then move up to the next steps.  He knew me before I was diagnosed with bipolar, and so is aware of what could happen and what needs to happen if I do snap again.My expectations and desires - that he provides hugs when I need them, that he'll help with shots (though my US tech said she will do them since she's across the street, &lt;3!) That he provide a sane non-freaking-out voice. That he call my therapist, psychiatrist, and RE if the meds do cause me to flip.  [info] PCOS+Bipolar [info] 1391182579
spiritualxp [info] Yeah, I'll probably start working on it again when the school semester starts winding down a little bit.  Thanks for the optimism! I really want to teach creatively and expand students' minds rather than just teaching them to test...hopefully I'll have an opportunity to do it.  The US school system is a little messed up in that regard. I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2011, shortly after I turned 20, but I've had signs of it my whole life.  Dealing with it has been extremely hard, I'm not going to lie.  I basically take a pharmacy of drugs every day, including 400mg of an extremely powerful sedative called Seroquel.  I'm also on a constant dose of birth control pills so I don't have any periods anymore because I literally go psychotic during that time of the month.  Really, the only way you can deal with bipolar is to treat it as what it is...an illness.  That's a concept I've had the hardest time dealing with.  Since my diagnosis I've struggled with believing there was something wrong with me, and I still do.  It's just like diabetes, or lupus or other chronic illnesses.  You take medication to take care of it, and stay optimistic that life will get better.  The craziest thing about bipolar, though, is that I FEEL things at a very different level than those without it.  People's anger at a 10 would probably be my anger at a 4, and I've also had the pleasure of being EXTREMELY euphoric and happy, a feeling that most people don't get to experience. It's a chronic illness, though.  I'll have it forever.  I might not have to be on medication for the rest of my life, because bipolar can be triggered or come in waves, but as of right now I go bat-shit insane if I don't take my pills.

klw [info] Dude, I hate to burst your bubble, but this happens with just about every single mental illness imaginable. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (and a few others), which hasn't been trivialized in pop culture to the point that OCD, ADHD, etc. have. And yet, my entire life, I've been asked to just "get going," "snap out of it," "try harder." I've been told that if I just decide to get better, I will.It's not OCD that's being trivialized. It's the whole idea of mental illness that is trivialized in our society. [info] None [info] 1391732540
MadCalvanist [info] ITT: Look, we can form words!Listen. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since 1997. I recently graduated Magna Cum Laude from Liberty University with a Bachelor of Science in Religion. Do you know how many pastors there are out there who have this disease?Calling it the work of demons only lends credence to the superstitious nonsense of backwater hillbilly country Christians who think *indoor plumbing* is the work of the devil. Just because its not curable doesn't mean there's no medicinal answer. In fact there are so many treatment options, if the doctor tries you on one and it doesn't work, guess what? You try another one. There are actually enough that within the typical ten year period they project to finding your best diagnosis, you will have found the exact right amount of medication and/or therapy.We live in a fallen world - sin is part of the natural order. The devil might try and take advantage of your condition, and by all means, that can and will happen. But remember even Paul had a thorn in his side, we don't know the nature of, but God didn't heal for one reason - it was Paul's job to work *in spite* of that thorn for the glory of God. Bipolar disorder is not your demon, its your thorn. It's your opportunity to glorify God by overcoming your illness every day... not by curing it. By defeating it daily. I've been doing it now for 17 years. Some people have done it for far longer. You can do it to. But do it with your doctor - not a bunch of armchair theologians and the opinion machine of Reddit.

whatOhAThrowAway [info] Well, might as well tell my story since I saw someone with the same diagnosis.I was diagnosed with bipolar/schizoeffective almost 3 years ago. I'm 22 now. My aunt is bipolar and has exhibited way more extreme cases than I ever had, but my symptoms and signs were different.It all started around the time I started smoking weed for the first time (kind of makes me question the diagnosis now, but I'm too afraid to go off the meds, and still feel I'm probably not completely normal in the head). Anyway, not sure of the exact chronology, but one of the first signs that I can remember and i've talked about with my friends was that I became extremely obsessed with my posture-- I couldn't sleep at night unless I felt my spine was perfectly aligned and my heels were equidistantly set apart, etc. This would occupy my mind consistently throughout my daily life too, and I began stretching to add to it. "What great benefits to my body this will produce!" I thought. It became so bad that at one point hanging and smoking with friends (I had been stretching for like 30 minutes or something they say) that one friend grabbed me by the shoulders and told me I had to fucking stop. (They'd been telling me to call it quits for a while). And I just laughed it off and either continued or stopped... I have no recollection of this event. This sort of evolved into a weird psychosis where I thought my bones were misaligned--one shoulder too low "my wrist hurts, that's throwing off my whole body." This is when my family began to notice that something was really off, as I would stare in the mirror for excessive amounts of time and even become angry with them because of my discomfort. There were mood things too. I'm generally a nice person but apparently I was a complete asshole during this time. Kind of sarcastic and proud and just volatile. I don't remember a whole lot of this, either, but I do remember having "deep" thoughts, thoughts that were like "yeah this is the secret to the universe" kind of shit. And that's where the proud stuff came in. I'd say stuff like I knew what I was talking about and people were below me and my higher understanding. Fuck I hate thinking about this.Along with those things, my speech would be incoherent and irrelevant/out of context. I would be paranoid. I would think that everyone was talking about me, not only behind my back, but right in front of my face too. I'll give you specific examples that I can remember: One. We'd gotten a puppy at the time who was chewing on things around the house. Legs of chairs and tables, things a puppy can reach. To counteract this, my mom had heard of a method where you put hot sauce on said things that the puppy chews. The puppy doesn't like the spiciness, no more chewing. Now, I'm not sure if I had been caught smoking weed at this time or not, but for some reason, in my psychosis (if that's a fair term to use, idk) I thought the puppy being bad was a metaphor for me being bad. When my parents would talk about the puppy, they were talking about me, in plain sight, my brothers knew it, they'd laugh, they were laughing at me, it wasn't about the puppy, it was a ruse, a ploy, a trick... on ME.   And everyone was in on it. It was a bad fucking time in my life. Another big ass sign for my parents that something was wrong. At one point I had had enough and wanted to test the little game they were playing. "What's this hot sauce for?" I asked. "The puppy" they explained. Well then, I thought, let's see. And I smugly took a swig out of the hot sauce bottle in front of their faces. HAHA beat ya.Hmm... one more example of the paranoia like that I can remember, if anyone's reading this... Again, conversations had been going on in the house and I was sure they were little gags and inside jokes about me. So my brother (he's really just having a normal conversation) is trying to remember something from a movie, but I think it's somehow a joke on me and I want to test it, or show that I know, or something. "What's that guy from the movie and he's got the chainsaw for an arm?" (something along those lines) "Oh you mean 'whatOhAThrowAway,'" I say. Yeah, I said my own god damn name when he's clearly talking about the guy from The Evil Dead.I could go on, there's plenty more. This shit's embarrassing though. The fact that anyone in my family and my circle of friends even remain in contact with me is a testament to the fact that there's kindness in the world.TL;DR: Mental illness is weird, weird, sad and terribly weird shit. Don't hesitate to get help for yourself or a loved one if it becomes apparent that medical intervention is necessary.  [info] None [info] 1391937884
Durgals [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar for over a year, and I admit, sometimes my anger gets in the way of logic. I've never used my problems as an excuse to lash out at others for no reason, and I've also noticed that she's extremely one sided for a person with bipolar disorder, though, I would probably have to meet her in real life to get a full dose of her personality.

MrPoppagergio [info] This is my first time writing in this sub. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 two and a half years ago. To answer your question, I have this same exact thing happen to me frequently. For me, it all started when my psychiatrist asked me the first time, "Have you had any homicidal or suicidal thoughts?" At that point I hadn't. After I left his office that day I began to contemplate what he said more on in depth. Now, sometimes I think about killing myself but I know deep down inside I don't want to. It's like it's just a sparked thought. I don't know why this happens and it sort of scares me at times. Reason being is that if I'm watching tv and it's a show about murder I sometimes picture myself (this is going up sound weird) killing a loved one of mine in a similar fashion. I am a little uncertain as to why this happens but I don't know what to do. I'm a little scared to talk to anyone about it because of fear of changing my meds and having to start over. I've been stable for the last two years and 5 months and I haven't had anything happen that makes me afraid for my life or anyone else's. I hope I answered your question and please feel free to discuss it more. I was overjoyed to see that this sub existed.  [info] None [info] 1392133817

CaseyAlyssa [info] I can't speak for everyone who's fat, but I can give you my personal experience: I was always a fat teenager - 5'8" and 180 when I graduated from high school. Gained a little bit of weight as a freshman in college (10-15lbs, nothing completely unusual). Shortly before my 21st birthday, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on antidepressants. In just over a year on antidepressants, I gained about 65 pounds. Since I was never small, I'm now huge. I came off the meds, but that doesn't make the weight disappear. And since I still struggle with the depressive half of the disorder in a big way, losing weight just isn't something I've managed to do yet - not killing myself is a lot more important.

Callmebobbyorbooby [info] It definitely gets better. Sometimes I still feel alone even when I'm with other people, and it's something I continue to work on. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 21 years ago when I was 10. I'm a different kind of person and sometimes I don't feel like I fit in, which makes me feel alone. It gets much better though. You kind of start realizing that you're just unique, and you're not going to fit in with everyone. Sometimes you'll feel alone, sometimes you won't, but it does get better. Learn to not compare yourself to others. You are your own person, and you need to do what you need to do to be happy and confident with who you are. If you want, you can read my response on another persons post basically explaining how I made it out.I promise you, it does get better, but you have to want it to.

Boreas-Rex [info] I know that I was interested in it at a young age. I do not have much memory of my childhood, I was raised at a church that encouraged learning about other faiths. I like to learn and the occult is fascinating so I read what I could find. I joined the navy to see the sea, and became a submariner. There is a initiation ritual that happens when you cross the arctic circle called bluenose where you stand trial before Boreas Rex. My crime was "Writing checks my ass can't cash". I was found guilty, you always are, and became a bluenose. I reenlist a couple of years layer and go to Guam. At this point I have found chaos-matrix and was really into Phill Hine, and have moved to Guam. I decided to experiment, and did something dumb. I got a tattoo to try and invoke the essence of chaos into myself. Three days later I got MRSA and had to stay out to sea and work through it. It cures eventually but left a quarter shaped scar right off one of the points of the star. Later that year I am diagnosed with bipolar, and later pshytoaffective dissorder, out of the navy. I receive VA compensation but by reenlisting am left with about 40,000 in debt to the Government so i pay it back 25 dollars a month. That proved to me the trial.As for path I used to say chaos, because I like the idea of belief as a tool, but I think it is best for me to just try and develop my own set path rather than belief hopping, it got to be a bit too much. So I am starting at the basics again with divination. [info] None [info] 1394426821

d11b [info] I'm in a similar situation. I was diagnosed with bipolar type II a couple years ago, and since then I've lost many friendships, mostly due to distance and just stopping talking to each other. I know that some people may not miss me, but others may. It can be hard to resolve this in your mind: I'm such a jerk, everyone I used to know hates me, what's to stop new people I meet from coming to hate me? Why even bother? I'm just going to screw it up.I've found that the only thing to do is to put it all out of your mind as best you can. You cannot change what has happened, only what happens from here on out. Maybe we are destined to have only a few friends, and mostly only have temporary relationships. Don't see this a good or bad, only that it is what it is.

I'm a pretty sane person, but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (pretty well treated now with meds) and let me tell you, when I'm not doing good, whether manic or depressed, stuff that's not real absolutely seems 100% real; there is no doubt in my mind that something irrational is true. Later I look back and am amazed that I felt that way.

carbonmonoxide [info] I went through many medications.  I had cognitive problems on both Depakote and Lamictal.  My reaction to depakote was incredibly severe.  I was young but eventually they figured out that they had to take me off it.  I went from failing third grade to being the top of my glass in fourth grade.For a while, I went without medication.  (Maybe I just had childhood epilepsy.)Nope.  I went back on medication.  We put me on a high dose of Lamictal and I definitely noticed that things were fuzzier.  It wasn't severe, but it was enough for perfectionist middle-school me to stomp my feet and threaten to stop taking my mediation unless we looked for alternatives.I'm now on Keppra.

HavartiParty [info] I just woke up so this probably wont be quite as coherent as I would like, but whatever.  I encourage my clients to use "person first language"-instead of saying "I'm bipolar" use "I've been diagnosed with bipolar."  Your diagnosis does not define you, unless you let it.  You're a thousand things that are NOT related to your diagnosis, try defining yourself that way rather than by an illness.  When people are diagnosed with cancer they don't say "I'm cancer" so why is it that we tend to use a mental health diagnosis as a defining characteristic when describing ourselves?  I hope that makes sense, I was up for 1.2 million hours entering DAP notes. :D  [info]  [info] 1396271014
lightmeup92 [info] Last march I was diagnosed with bipolar rapid cycling. It was following loosing an entire 3 months of my life. During this period I don't really have much recollection of what happened,  it is almost like it was a dream, a distant memory,  pieces of someone elses life and not my own. I remember having a bath after id got home after my diagnosis and I literally felt like I had fallen back to earth, I was mentally drained and my body felt battered and I sobbed for hours. I had been robbed of 3 months and to make matters worse id missed 3 months of my baby daughters life. So in answer to your query I've definitely forgotten my antics during mania. Putting parts together from what people have said I'd been up to, it was like I was a completely different person to who I am. My behaviour went against everything I believe in as a human being. So I also feel that guilt from saying things I wouldn't ever dream of saying in my 'normal' state.  [info] None [info] 1396468560
Goldenboy451 [info] So this is a bit of a weird, personal...thing; I'm not even sure I'd really call it a question, more of a 'thank you'.Round about the time I was starting my final year of uni, I was in a pretty bad way. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for a couple of years, and medication can only really do so much. A few years earlier, I'd spent months doing little more than reading &amp; listening to music, since it was just about the only thing that could get me out of my own head. I ended up reading Kieron Gillen &amp; Jamie McKelvie's 'Phonogram: The Singles Club', which turned out to be just what I needed. It was something I really ended up identifying with, and gave me a lot of cause for thought.So when Jamie posted a couple of your early tracks; ZVVL and Science/Visions on his Twitter towards the start of my final year, I had to check them out. Each one of your tracks made me feel something I hadn't felt about music in a long time: excited. Along with some other synth &amp; pop albums, your early demos and live sessions were a constant on my playlist; during the months I was feeling shitty and deeply suicidal, there was some relief in just putting on a great track that was quite unlike anything else, and you guys were a big part of that.So I guess that's a long-winded way of saying that you guys have played a pretty big part in my life the last 18 months or so; both times I've seen you live you were absolutely fantastic, and I really look forward to seeing where you go in the future.Iain, Martin &amp; Lauren - thank you, and thanks for taking the time to read the angst of an early-twenty-something.  [info] None [info] 1396470432

Wlcome2enemyturf [info] I've had sleep problems my entire life.  I started acting depressed when I was about 9 and it progressively got worse until I was about 16.  That's when I think the mania started since I was first prescribed antidepressants and the rebellious behavior started.  I had a drug problem which was really just me trying to self medicate.  I've had several different diagnoses bounced off me until I finally gave up and stopped seeing psychiatrists and therapists until a couple months ago.  That's when I was diagnosed with bipolar and it made a lot of sense.  But to answer your question, I have never felt normal.  I haven't really fit in, always been an oddball (not socially awkward, just lonely).  [info] None [info] 1397023226
bluefeesh [info] I'm 28. Originally I never moved out because I lived so close to my job. Then when I was 25 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Now I have medical bills coming out of my ass, and my psychiatrists appointments are expensive (I had a super high insurance deductible). Now I just left my shitty retail job because of my illness, and it was absolute hell there. I'm trying to figure out what to do next at the moment.  [info] None [info] 1397160676
ToSayWhat [info] If I would date someone with bipolar would depend on where they are with it, if it's relatively well maintained (on meds with consistent therapy) I'd be cautiously okay going forward. I've been close to someone with untreated bipolar (they were off their meds) and it was...very unpleasantI'd bring it up in a message before the date, maybe:"By the way, so you're aware, I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I'm on medication and see a therapist to keep things steady. I understand if this is a turn-off but I'd still like to see you. If you have any questions about it, please ask" [info] None [info] 1397221501
zebrapig [info] I also have bipolar.    Never be afraid to ask if you can step off the floor. I have had some pretty intense episodes and all it takes is one customer to set me off. If you think your SS or SM might not allow that, I would talk to your SM in advance as a precaution. You could probably even get a doctors note if you needed to.  I can channel my manic episodes into being a badass at work, but my coworkers all joke that I'm always in a bad mood or that I hate everything because I've been more depressed lately. If you can fake it enough to handle the customers, I wouldn't give a single shit about what anyone else says. If "coaching" is anything like it is at my store, I would honestly not worry too much about it. I'm to the point now where I am confident that I can recognize what is needed from me to serve the customer and still let them have a speedy and friendly transaction and if it means me breaking away from deployment for a second, so be it. If this "coaching" is personal or just nagging, without any sbu standard to back it up, bring it up with your SM because that shit is annoying and just a result of people being power hungry.    Also, if you're not already, meds and support groups are extremely helpful and a great outlet when dealing with stress like this. If you ever need to chat, please don't be afraid to send me a message on here. I was diagnosed with bipolar close to 5 years ago, I have been at sbux for a year and a half now and I will agree that it is super challenging sometimes. Good luck out there! :) [info] None [info] 1397263338
Whatsthatskip [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II a few years ago (possibility of type I, but no hospitalization), but I knew long before my official diagnosis.  I have two wonderful, happy children and an amazing husband and this was my motivation for getting treatment.  I have to be healthy for them.  I was lucky to find a meds combo that works well for me, and spent a lot of time doing CBT and researching the illness.  My husband has been very supportive and helps me keep on track (with diet, exercise, sleep and stress management).  We had to make adjustments in our lifestyle, but it's been healthier for everyone.  Bipolar is like diabetes in many ways.  I hope you don't mind me sharing my experience.  I really hope your wife will get the treatment she needs, for all of your sake.  You may have already done this, but I would suggest you have a very candid talk about how it affects you and your kid, but make sure you do it when she is not in an episode.  If she won't seek treatment with full knowledge of how it affects her family, then it would be time to talk honestly about the consequences.  From one internet stranger to another, it is possible to have a healthy relationship and I sincerely hope that you and your wife can get the help you need. [info] None [info] 1397337346
presscolor [info] Sorry, I think my post accidentally gave the impression that this was my first manic episode? It wasn't. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder like 8 years ago. this particular manic episode was just the most recent fuckup in my life.

I changed my mind and instead I ended up going to the school therapy center and then the hospital. There I was diagnosed with bipolar I and now that I've been on medication things are a lot better. There is always the possibility of it getting better. And not just better, but a lot lot better!!  [info] None [info] 1397662549
ocstaway [info] I am a junior in college majoring in political science and am considering OCS after I graduate. In my sophomore year I was involuntarily committed to a mental ward. At the time I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I have since challenged that diagnosis by seeing 3 other specialists who all concluded it was a misdiagnosis and one of them has written a letter stating this.I am, however, clinically depressed. I currently take one anti-depressant. It's prescribed and I have no other substance abuse issues. I believe myself to be mentally fit and functional.My question is whether my medical history is disqualifying for OCS and whether I would be able to get prescription meds if I were deployed. Obviously, given my history this is not a decision to be taken lightly and I'd appreciate more general advice but if you could also answer whether my history would be disqualifying and whether I should simply give up on this dream, that'd be great.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this long entry [info] None [info] 1397700993
denoginized [info] None of us here can diagnose bipolar (self diagnosis is also discouraged), but I'm really sorry you're having a rough time. For what it's worth, it seems like a lot of us here (including me) have had a rough/frustrating time finding meds that work. It sucks, I know. It took 10 years of antidepressants not working before I was diagnosed with bipolar, and then it was still several months before finding the right "cocktail" for me. I'd say the best thing to do is find a psychiatrist, like you said. In my experience they're generally more informed on mental health and illness as well as how psychiatric medications work together than a GP. I hope you're able to find a good pdoc soon and get to a solution. Good luck! [info] None [info] 1397838193
1LongStorm [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar2 when I turned thirty. It cost me my job, my relationships and my entire world pretty much fell apart. Through years of meds, therapy and sheer determination I feel like most of the time I manage the beast. I now care for my 94 year old Gran, my Dad who is in a care home dying of COPD, and this weekend my Mom is in the hospital following a heart attack. My ability to care for others came from my learned ability to face things one at a time, stay mindful, avoid triggers and know and respect my own limitations. A huge part of my ability to function came from the epiphany that my brain has a glitch and I can't just allow it to randomly choose emotions and reactions... I am my own mental police. It was really hard to accept my limitations, but being stubborn about self care and self monitoring has been essential in allowing me to be well enough to care for my family members as well as myself. I found peace in mindfulness. My mantra is "I am here, and it is now." It has been surprisingly effective in helping me remain grounded in the now without letting the future or past overwhelm me. I also repeat ad nauseum "It is what it is" Acceptance of reality moment to moment helps me cope. Edit: I also read a LOT. The best escape is always a good book and there are always books to help understand/deal with  pretty much any situation. And I ditched TV 12 years ago because it is a trigger for me.

TURNDOWNFORBUTT [info] When I was 22 I was in a study located in Sweden focusing on the chemical Lysergic acid diethylamide.  I was interviewed and was told that I would receive compensation for the experiment, and i told them that i had tried it once before and enjoyed the effects. For those who do not know, LSD is not what it is hyped up to be in normal amounts.  you do not see actual hallucinations like a purple bunny in the sky or a man crawling up your pant legs, it is more of a high feeling with small amounts of visual hallucinations like objects breathing or swirling.  I had eaten 5 doses within 12 hours the first time I tried it and I was a 22 year old cocky kid so I was fairly confident I would be a great fit for the experiment.  In the interview they told me what I enjoyed, I told them surfing, skiing, and hanging out with friends.  That my favorite animal was a puppy, favorite food was sandwich, and favorite drink was lemon water. they told me I would hear back soon.two weeks later i arrived at the location in which would change my life forever.  I was introduced to the head of the experiment and he was extremely kind to me.  Everyone had great energy and I felt welcomed and celebrated with my presence.  I was led down a hallway to a large door.  When the doctor opened the door, I saw a big comfortable couch, a King size bed, one wall was covered in fuzz, one wall was made of car tires flattened out, one wall had a 2 way mirror,  and the other wall was old brick.  All over the walls were posters of surfing and skiing professionals.  There was a large clear tub filled with water containing about ten colorful fish.  I had no clue what the fuck was going on at first but quickly realized that they made this room exactly according to things I mentioned enjoying in the interview.  This was somewhat unsettling but also great.  Anyways...I sit down on the couch and the head of the experiment and his assistant sat across from me.  they told me that they would be giving me a large dose of the chemical to see it's effects.  They reassured me that I would be fine and their confidence was somewhat unsettling.  I wish I asked how much of a dose they were giving me.They placed three glasses of water in front of me, each containing about a tablespoon of liquid, and left the room.  I sat there for about ten minutes looking at the fish swim around waiting for further instructions.  After about fifteen minutes I began calling out the doctors name asking for the next instructions but I received none.  I tried opening the door and could not get out.  I realized that this must have been part of the experiment and that I was on my own now, In a weird room filled with things I like. I sat down at the table and stared at the three glasses in front of me.  I assumed that since they were all clear and none of them smelled like anything, it was a choice and placebo experiment as well as a chemical reaction experiment.  I tried noticing small differences in the liquid but i simply could not. I decided that I was in a safe controlled environment and that I was going to drink the left one first...then waited.I laid on the bed and decided to relax.  Ten minutes after drinking the liquid I felt nothing but was expecting to start tripping so my mind was playing tricks on me, making me feel like I was high for a second before I would realize i'm 100% sober.  I figured that this was a water cup and used for placebo.  Just to make sure, I waited about (what felt like, there were no clocks in the room) thirty minutes before I decided that I was going to drink the cup on the right.  I sat at the table and mentally tried to prepare myself for what was to come if this glass contained the chemical.  I sipped it and sat by the fish tank to watch them swim around.  Another ten minutes went by watching the fish and I decided that the left cup was also water and I would drink the last cup with the actual chemical, the middle cup.  I walked over to the table, sipped it down really quick, and went back to the fish. I was watching them swim through the water thinking about how cool it was that there are animals that can live underwater, animals that can swim, how many different types of animals there are, how animals became what they are today, etc.  I was watching one fish in particular that would tend to reflect light in a light blue color that was mesmerizing until the fish started to drip and melt into the water. my eyes followed the fish to the rocks on the bottom that were melting out of the tank, that was completely falling over me. i looked behind me to the massive room wondering how it got so big, before i just went completely blind.  I was tripping so hard that I did not even realize I was tripping, I didn't even realize where I was or what I was doing, but the scariest thing was that I didn't know myself.  I was not a person, I was simply a conscious residing in a case made of bones and tissue through which I could express.  My mind had so many thoughts flying at once, my body felt tremendously light and agile, and my vision was completely distorted to the extent I was scared to open my eyes.  I spent 7 days total in the room.  I do not remember what happened the next 6 days after that, but after learning about the experiment afterwards, I was told that I spent those days painting (never saw the paintings, would love to), watching the fish that I thought died, and simply just relaxing living my life.I returned home a different person, I was permanently tripping extremely hard.  The experiment delivered me so much LSD that my brain simply could not go back to normal, I was permanently high.  I would laugh my ass off for hours, would say deep philosophical things to people that probably sounded so dumb, and was literally just so high on LSD for years after the experiment.I was 27 years old and still not back to normal.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and psychosis from the amount of acid the experiment gave me.  I had lost 5 years of my life for a $100 compensation and was still tripping which I became very used to and was able to cope with to an extent. On April 14th 2006 I woke up one morning and my head was pounding.  I put a cold rag over it and tried to fall back asleep.  I woke up and my brain hurt for days but I noticed that the feeling of the acid was almost non existent.  I went to my doctor to make sure I was okay, having one of the worst headaches of my life.  He reassured me I was okay and that I just needed some rest.  A week later I realized that I was completely sober and back to normal.Doctors do not know how my brain chemicals leveled out.  The doctors also estimated that I took around 100 regular doses of medical grade pure LSD.  I have heard stories similar to mine with people taking 30, but losing 5 years of my life was a bummer but my mind had been expanded to such an extent I did not really process that part of the whole situation.  After a year of healing, I had started a business that became extremely successful due to things I learned from the acid.  I have had a wife and three kids for years now and absolutely love my life.  Not really sure what doctor would ever think that 100 doses of LSD would be okay, but they were guaranteed secrecy about the experiment so it didn't matter to them. People I tell this story to tend to not believe me when they know me in person having my success and family, and I am content with that.  The only reason I wrote this out right now was to inform people of my experience that are interested and would like to learn.  LSD can be extremely fun is smaller doses, but I do not recommend doing 100 doses unless you plan on living in the rainforest or some super hippy shit for the next ten years.Cheers,.TLDR: Experiment gave me 100 doses of pure LSD, 5 years of my life erased, success followed.

Black_Metal [info] Well, I've always assumed it happens to everyone, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 with hallucinations/delusions so that's what it is I guess. I always questioned hallucinations when I was sober obviously, but I guess I always thought that was just a part of opiates. I mean I've seen people talk about having conversations or thinking someone was with you while nodding, so I didn't think it was a far stretch.But still, it is a medical reason for hallucinating on opiates, which was the point of my original post.

g1i [info] &gt; do any other of you INTJs have a burning desire to hurt or even kill someone?There are many ways to hurt someone, why fixate on physical violence? And it seems like you don't have a specific reason for wanting to hurt *someone*. Rather, the way you've phrased it, you just want to hurt *anyone*. Is there a specific person you want to hurt, or is it just a random urge? &gt;  Some background information. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder of the sub-type mixed. However, I've been doing well off medication for quite some time now; at times I doubt that this diagnosis. If you want to go around murderin' people, I'm gonna have to disagree with your assessment. That said, you may well be correct that the medication you're on isn't working for you, or that your diagnosis may not be complete or correct. Ongoing therapy is really critical for managing this stuff. Unfortunately, mental health and medication is never cut and dry. You can't just take some pills and the problems go away.&gt; My issue is that, depending on what I have been doing, one of my parents likes to tell me that I should not be taking certain actions or doing certain things. They like to say "you are gonna end up in the hospital again." Also they keep trying to tell me what I should be doing with regards to diet and whatnot else. So they're turning your hospitalization into a threat to keep you in check. Yeah, I'd want to punch / maim someone who did that, too. Don't let *their* bullshit cloud the issue of your mental health. There may well be something going on with you, but the fact that they are trivializing it with their behavior doesn't make it trivial. Make sense?&gt; This frustrates me beyond any logical reason. That's not true. There are many logical reasons to find that frustrating.&gt; I have a similar reaction to other people who try to force their logic on me. It frustrates me beyond reason and makes me want to break things or hurt the offender. For obvious reasons, particularly the consequences I would face from hurting someone, I have never carried these thoughts out. If I may. You're a teenager / young adult living at home with parents who not only fail to "get you" in the traditional sense, but are also patronizing you and worse, threatening you with treatment for a mental illness you may or may not have. Treatment should never be a threat. It's *treatment*. Your reactions and feelings to being out of control of your own life, and not being given the resources to step up to independence and self-control is incredibly frustrating and demoralizing. Your instincts to hurt people are likely a result of this feeling of powerlessness, but you also recognize that they aren't appropriate and you don't want to act on them.&gt; I am worried that I may one day be pushed to far and do something that I will regret, although I will not feel any remorse, and suffer consequences as a result. I was just wondering if anyone else has these thoughts that pass through their heads on a fairly regular basis.In your situation, I probably would. What I'd advise you to do instead is talk to your parents about starting talk therapy with someone you like and trust. That's the first step in ANY mental health issue, but for you I think it will be more relevant for dealing with your parents and talking through the challenges you're facing. Your worries are legitimate and speak well of you. Instead of feeling marginalized by a diagnosis, take control over your treatment and be proactive. Whether or not you are bi-polar is almost irrelevant here - talking to a professional will only help you, no matter what's going on. [info] INTJ [info] 1399306806
demiquaver [info] UEA is, in my experience, one of the better ones for student support.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in my first year and with hypothyroidism in my final year - I passed by the skin of my teeth and got a 2:1 because of the accommodations my tutors made for me.

jamesick [info] It's extremely easy to get diagnosed with adhd and bipolar by a doctor just from telling them your symptoms which means absolutely nothing. Not to say you don't have these, you may do, but more often than not a doctor just telling you do doesn't mean you do. Everyone and their dog these days seems to have bipolar which is a mental condition and can't just be diagnosed from you telling a doctor your symptoms. Just like most other illnesses it takes more than just saying what you feel to be properly diagnosed with it. Have you had any serious tests like brain scans or anything that could actually give a doctor a reason to diagnose you with these?I don't mean to be rude, it's just everyone thinks they have bipolar or adhd because they told their doctor they feel happy sometimes and sad sometimes and their doctor mentioned bipolar. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and it was absolute bullshit and I know I don't have it. More often than not its just normal the way you're feeling and you shouldn't feel like you have something you don't. If you think you have adhd and/or bipolar you will eventually let that rule your life. Try not accepting it and continue your life as if you were never diagnosed with it, if you still feel you do have it look further into it than just a GP's "you seem to have bipolar".

poopyfarts [info] I was pretty sure he was bipolar. I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2 and I always felt like he sort of acted similar to me. Had similar freakouts that I had. Medication helps but being an entertainer and bipolar go hand in hand because of the powerful emotions and passions you experience and can express in your performance. Unfortunately it's also like trying to go the speed limit in a residential school zone while flying an F-16.  The extreme highs come with extreme lows and just overall inconsistency and instability. It sucks cause one moment you're the life of the party, and the next you think the world hates you and you get extreme violent rushed of anger and destructive thoughts. Thoughts become extremely emotionally charged and theres no barrier between being at a level 2 mood, to a level 10. There's no buffer between complete mood changes, it happens so drastic you don't notice it. The emotions are so strong you genuinely become them and can't think clearly cause your own brain is fucking with you.  Also, you start to like the highs. "Normal" moods and sensations aren't as stimulating as the powerful rush of ideas and confidence you get in a manic state. Whereas some people turn up to a 10, bipolar people can turn up to a 12 and stay there even after the party is gone. Piss one off and that level 12 excitement transforms into level 12 anger and then you end up with some pretty crazy rage. Brain gets cloudy and you cant rationally think because your reptilian brain is feeding off primal emotions and your frontal cortex shuts down.  Medication might make him less entertaining but will make his life better in the long run, possibly. Sometime I feel like Kanye might be bipolar, or have borderline personality disorder. Same with The Game. [info]  [info] 1399702696
ben_ji1974 [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar for years. Been in treatment off and on for years. I spent nearly 3 years out of work and doped up while fighting for disability only to get shut down.During this period in my life I am unmedicated and relatively stable though there have been cost. I don't have the energy to fight a broken system and I know one day time will run out. All I can do is muddle through with one foot in front of the other and try to avoid doing too much stupid crap.For me to try to live a long life the only way I can see that happening is socially isolating myself. While I can muddle through just about any job, I have had so many that at one time my G.A.F. was a 38. I don't like it. I dont have the highs as much anymore but a slow steady low keeps me going just enough to function without crashing. I try to manage everything with routine and trying not abuse alcohol or drugs. I am very fortunate to have my current wife, she truly is my best friend and a far more wonderful person than I could have hoped to have in my life. I feel very fortunate.Both of my parents died in their 50's. Mom was from her physical health and my biological father from his mental illness.

scotty1987 [info] I can sympathise here. I was misdiagnosed for 4 years after bouncing around gp's before I bit the bullet and went elsewhere. During that time, it was my manic stages which were causing my problems. I would go into college (uk) and was always causing others to be on edge. Nobody had seen anything like it before. I was allowed to go on a hiatus until I got myself sorted as it was causing a danger to me and others.During this time, I was diagnosed with almost everything but bipolar and was put on some meds which just obviously made things worse as it was going unchecked far longer.I bit the bullet and went to a professional psychiatrist instead of the gp when I found out that my rugby  insurance covered it due to long standing trauma. Well that's what it said on my forms anyway. She had been in the field for 30 years and straight off the bat, I was diagnosed with bipolar and everything sorted itself out.I have since come off the meds due to problems with my sex drive and stuff and I can tell you now, I have been someone else. My partner has left me but is willing to come back once I get myself sorted. She is my rock and I have hurt her since I came off them both mentally and physically. Both I am ashamed of. I am back to being as I was before. I have swallowed my pride again and have booked myself in, with her, to see a psychiatrist. So please, find another psychiatrist. Don't rush straight in because you are desperate. Take your time but keep an eye on your wellbeing. Ask them questions about things they wrote papers on etc. People seem to think that you can't ask a person of authorit questions and I honestly do not know where that has come from.EDIT: To add, I finished my studies, came out with 2nd class honours and now run my own business with my ex for a while partner.

callmekvothe [info] This is gonna get buried, but here goes:I called a suicide hotline on November 17, 2011, and a man named Ben saved my life. I entered a partial inpatient program on November 19th and spent until January 19th in that program and an intensive outpatient program. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on proper medication, and I slowly began to feel like a real person. I didn't have fifty moods a day, didn't scream my head off at people any longer, and stopped cutting. The scars are all but gone now.Then I made a trip on a whim to South Carolina to visit a friend and met my SO. Now, nearly two years and 1800 miles later, we're still together, still being frank about my disease when it causes problems, and learning how to be adults together. I owe Ben on the other side of the line my life.Thanks, Ben. [info] None [info] 1400688602

linkken [info] Haha, I've been wondering excactly same thing as you OP, and I felt I should share.Of course I was diagnosed with bipolar-disorder when I was 15 years old (I'm now 26). I've friends and so on, but my self esteem has always been really shit. I would second guess everything I do before starting something, and after that I would second guess my self for doing the thing. "Is this really how it should be done?", "Fuck, I'll never learn this" etc.And the story is still the same, but I've learned to appreciate more my self and my capabilities. My trick? I've just bulldozed through every fucking thing. I've failed countless of times or at least that's how I've felt, failing. I thought I could never study computer science because I'm such a failure as a human being and I shouldn't even try. Well, I studied 8 months for the exams to our university, all the fucking time I felt like I should just stop, I'm horrible at math why I'm even doing this? I passed the exams with mediocre score (felt like shit because I didn't got the top scores), but I GOT THROUGH!I also use google a lot and feel like other people are solving my problems, and I feel like shit everytime. So basically what I'm trying to say is, you shouldn't second guess ur self so much. It's really shitty road to take on and it's going to be a very bumpy ride. Appreciate your self and what you do. Whenever you succeed in something congratulate your self. You know, I know and many others know that your worst enemy is you. Just keep on going, google those answers, don't feel bad about it, learn and keep on going if that is what you really desire. Also sorry for my bad English, it's late, I'm not a native speaker, and I also feel bad because I FUCKING SUCK AT ENGLISH. ;) [info] None [info] 1400801074
ArchHero [info] I'm bipolar, and my brother is mentally ill, but with psychotic symptoms. I overheard him telling my parents that being depressed, and suicidal is weak. He also said he never felt depressed, or suicidal. I don't believe that one bit. I don't understand why he thinks that, but it definitely doesn't mean you're a weak person. A lot of my friends have told me that I'm the strongest person they know. I was feeling depressed, suicidal, anxious, self harming, and all sorts of shit badly. It was to the point to where I couldn't take it anymore, and got help. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 16. I have a few cousins with bipolar disorder, and other people in my family who are mentally ill. People like my brother exist, and I don't really know what causes someone to believe we're all weak, or lazy, or just anything else. I've been called lazy when I was in high school, but I just was so depressed that I couldn't even apply myself to the fullest. I even had a B in the class, and that was the teacher who said that. Some teachers were just assholes about it. [info] None [info] 1400812295
mbok_jamu [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and OCD in 2007, but the first time I went to psychiatrist was in 2005. I often faint at school and there were times when I was so angry, I slapped my friends for a very simple problem. My teacher sent a letter to my dad, asked him to take me to the doctor. So he took me to the doctor and the doctor said there must be something wrong with my heart, he says I've got lemah jantung and that's what makes me often faint. But when we went to a cardiologist, he says I'm fine and recommend me to visit a psychiatrist instead. My dad was confused, but we went to the psychiatrist anyway. I don't know what the doctor said at that time, I went with my dad, so the doctor told the diagnosis to my dad. They didn't tell me anything about it, but I remember my dad looks angry. On our way home, he told me he couldn't believe he just took his daughter to the psychiatrist and he says I'm an attention whore, I made up all these things just to get attention. It breaks my heart. I feel offended. I know there must be something wrong with me.My parents are conservative. For them, there is no such thing as mental disorder, if someone should be treated by a psychiatrist, then that person is crazy. Nggak ada yang namanya dateng ke psikiater cuma buat konsultasi doang, nggak ada yang namanya stress, depresi, atau apalah, kalo udah gila ya gila aja. They believe they raised me well, while in fact, they don't. My dad is an authoritarian, when he talks, no one can talk. Nggak ada yang namanya berpendapat, karena buat dia itu namanya membangkang. So that's why I always hide what I'm feeling inside. I was so quiet. There are so many things I wanna tell my parents that they're wrong, but I have no courage to say that. When I entered the university, I started to collect some money to go to the psychiatrist. Finally, I knew what's wrong with me. The doctor said I  have bipolar disorder and OCD. That's why I can't control my mood and anger, I also speak in repetitive form, I often repeat what I've said and done. I feel relieved. I have a disorder and it's not normal, but at least now I know how to deal with it.What you should do right now is find a person that you can trust, a person who will listen to anything you're saying, because I never had that person, I chose to keep it all in my head, until it explodes. Don't wait until you're explode. Find a help. [info] Neng, papa kamu tukang komputer ya? Muka Neng perlu diedit. [info] 1400823522
dolcebellaluna [info] Call me defensive if you want, but I'm a nurse and have bipolar disorder.  I've got several bones to pick regarding this topic.  #1 - Schizophrenia is not an adjective.  Neither is Aspergers.  You can't just use them to describe people.  We have a convenient adjective for people with diabetes - "diabetic" but that's not universal.  You wouldn't call someone with cancer, a "cancer".  I have bipolar disorder but I am not a "bipolar".#2 - Schizotypal and schizoid are types of personality disorders for which there is no generally accepted medical treatment, although therapy and lifestyle changes can be helpful.  Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that is treatable with medication.#3 Why is it that you're focusing on mental illness and making assumptions about how a particular impairment effects someone's ability to practice nursing?  If someone with schizophrenia or a history of substance abuse or autism or even all three was accepted into and passed nursing school, as well as NCLEX, then yes, they too can be a nurse.  **Disclaimer**:I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder during my 3rd semester out of 4 semester of nursing classes.  I started seeing a psychiatrist and therapist but I'll be honest with you, I wasn't "stable" on my medications until almost 4 years after my initial diagnosis.  I have been practicing nursing since 2009 - floor nursing on a psych unit and then in a long-term care/skilled nursing facility, and now I'm a unit manager in a LTC/SNF.  Bipolar disorder has had an effect on my nursing skills and practice, but I don't consider it an impairment.  People with schizotypal and schizoid personality disorder, schizophrenia, autism and Asperger's syndrome generally develop skills to deal with their illness adapt to the world around them.  To assume that a diagnosis of a mental illness means that someone is not functional or able to appropriately interact with the rest of the world is ignorant and judgmental.  I hope for your sake that you can see the truth in my statements. [info] None [info] 1400959085
wannabeomniglot [info] Between my first read and my first reread, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.My entire perspective has really changed - Cersei, whom I hated, I now feel an odd kinship with. I see her arc as less ruthless and more tragic; in her I see a woman helpless against her own delusions, at the whim of her uncontrollable lust for vengeance and power and love.Arya, whom I loved unconditionally (and still do), I now see as much more pathological. I feel like in order to deal with the trauma she has endured, she has decided to be perpetually in motion, and I'm very concerned about what will happen when she stops moving forward.Depression, which is half of what I struggle with, is occasionally described as a grieving disorder. With that in mind, I have come to connect with Robert Baratheon, whom I saw as a philandering asshole completely out of touch with the reality of governance and an entirely self-centered worldview. I now see him as somewhat powerless in the only ways that matter. I am much more sympathetic to his perpetual grief now than I was before.This was probably quite influenced by the show, but I went from loving Petyr Baelish as a crafty mastermind, to being really disgusted as I watch him take advantage of the weak and the principled.

skribeiv [info] OK, so first of all: congrats. The place you're at now is probably not the end of your road to health but you're definitely on the right path from what it sounds like.So hospital experiences are always intended to be temporary, and should be supplemented by regular care from, ideally, both a pdoc and a therapist, if you can afford it with your insurance plan. It sounds like you have already been advised in this direction, but I just wanted to reaffirm it in case you have not. You want to find a regular care provider, and it's probably wise to see them at least once a month right now.Now, you are sadly running into the woefully inadequate mental health capacity that many people run into in many parts of the country. I'm not sure where you're at, but this is not an uncommon story. I am a big fan of the Psychology Today provider finders located [here for doctors](http://psychiatrists.psychologytoday.com/rms/) and [here for therapists](http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_search.php). My SO and I used these to find her care providers, and we couldn't be happier. I feel like a broken record sometimes in saying this, but I strongly suggest seeking a care provider who SPECIALIZES in mood disorders. In our experience, that makes a very large impact in the quality of treatment. Because of the situation you're in right now, I would suggest two things: first, when you are CALLING these providers to make appointments, explain to them your situation. Tell them that you have a limited prescription and that it's working, but that you don't want to run out. Unfortunately, many doctors are not willing to simply refill what you've been previously given without giving you a full evaluation themselves...a practice that I think is actually pretty wise, from experience. Second, and this is not ideal, but WORST case scenario, you could simply check yourself back in to the hospital when you run out of medication. Your ability to do this might somewhat be regulated by the laws of your particular state, and doing this can obviously be more expensive, but if this is what it takes to maintain treatment, it might be best. When I say "check yourself in" I mean literally drive either to an emergency room or psych hospital and basically say something along the lines of, "I have been diagnosed with bipolar illness, I was in the hospital last month and they gave me prescriptions that have been working but they have run out now and I am worried that I am now a danger to myself or others." Even if this is fudging a bit (and you DON'T legitimately feel like a danger at the time), this is generally enough in most states to get you in to see a doctor for an eval (and, by association, a prescription). Again, not ideal, be super diligent and persistent in reaching out to actual offices for care providers and explaining your situation. That would obviously be best.Oh, also, in your situation, with the limited time you have, I wouldn't be above seeing a psychiatric nurse if that's all they can get you in to see. A pnurse should be able to get you the meds you need in conjunction with a doctor in the office. Again, overall, congrats on starting down this path! I think often getting to the point you're at NOW can be one of the most difficult steps. Also, a bit of general advice: you're likely to have a few more setbacks with medication and such, understand that they are normal and in no way mean that you are untreatable and hopeless. It might take some trial and error to get you on a truly long-term, stable, treatment plan with tolerable side-effects.Good luck!EDIT: I should probably also say, I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice, etc. Just advice from an experienced bipolar illness caretaker.EDIT2: I just noticed a few things I missed down there at the bottom. Trying to have the pharmacist call the hospital is fine, but I'd say it's unlikely to work. Also, without insurance, all of this is going to be expensive. I would see what you can do to get some coverage if you can, the ACA has helped somewhat in this regard for individuals with bipolar illness. No more pre-existing coverage denials etc. If you are AWARE of a free clinic, by ALL MEANS, go. It might not be best, but if you already know whats been working for you, it's certainly better than nothing. You DO ultimately want to get a personal care provider with whom you can start a longer term relationship though, whenever you are able. [info] None [info] 1401157678
skribeiv [info] I'm sorry that you're feeling so lonely. A successful relationship CAN work. I think one of the trickiest parts is figuring out WHEN the right time is to have that conversation with each partner, and I think the "right" answer to that varies somewhat. I think there is nothing wrong with casually seeing someone for a bit to see if there is some compatibility there, and then, if some real feelings develop, sitting them down and going, "hey, so I really care for you...and I sorta want to get more serious...but we need to talk for a bit." Some people might resent it, but let's be honest here, if they can't handle the "I have been diagnosed with bipolar illness" shock...then their hope of dealing with the more legitimate surprises later is basically nil.One thing that I pick up on here is a sense in which I think you need to recognize that the energy of you IS you, you know? I mean it's a component of you, and being attracted to the energy of you is certainly something worth being attracted to. I am certainly attracted to my girlfriend's energy when she is up...even when it's a bit excessive. Some of the things she does and says are funny, and not at all scary as long as we are managing her condition well and being honest with each other. On the opposite end, when she is down, I'm the type that likes to fix things, so it does frustrate me a bit, but I just do what I can to make her comfortable and give her the encouragement she needs to stay on the wagon with her treatment (and life in general). I guess my point is this: I love my girlfriend BECAUSE of, and not in SPITE of, her bipolar disorder. It is a part of who she is, and it's something worthy of being attracted to.There are obviously aspects that I would love to change, both for her and for me, but I can say the same of basically every woman I've ever been involved with. Anyway, I guess that what I'm driving at, is that maybe your first concern up top there is a bit artificial. Maybe there isn't as much of a difference between "you" and "your energy" as you think, and it's something to just sorta stop worrying about--from that respect.I think there are absolutely some real concerns when it comes to dating and bipolar, but they are more pragmatic, like "when is the right time to discuss it?" or "how involved should my partner be in my care, and at what point in the relationship?"Maybe try not to add additional complications by being overly concerned with what is and is not ok for others to be attracted to? Does that help? [info] None [info] 1401160800

BipolarTypeOne [info] Ulgra,Whenever you start something new in life, you start from first principles and with beginner lessons and techniques. It doesn't matter if it's a sport, programming language, cooking, whatever. This illness isn't that much different. You start with basic techniques and move up as you learn. Decades of medical experience treating patients with bipolar disorder have taught clinicians to start with mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, sedatives upon first diagnosis which they tune over time. This is the medically indicated way to treat this illness. Someone who is just starting treatment or considering it, should start at the beginning by following medical advice and taking their prescribed medications. Suggesting otherwise is unethical as it steers them away from proven treatments and worsens their outcomes.After a few years trying lots of medications and living with the illness you become more knowledgeable about yourself and about which medications have worked and have not (something you cannot at the beginning). At this point, if the medications have worked poorly or are a direct immediate threat to your health, it might make sense to start considering med-free as your other options have been exhausted. This is not a recommendation to make to someone who is just starting out.People who have this illness and are untreated are in a very poor position to learn how to "think critically" about an illness they don't yet understand much about. That is a time where their focus must be on medical advice and stabilization, not on how to avoid taking medications because they read somewhere that yoga and a better diet might do the trick. It is so hard just to get people to seek professional help--telling them they don't have to take medications is fundamentally irresponsible. I can't tell you how many times I've heard someone say "Oh, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but I've never taken any medications so I don't think it's that bad." That is what you are enabling.Holding out the idea that there is a point in the future where medications can be discarded is also unethical and against medical advice. There are special cases and considerations, but these are a minority and must be treated that way.This kind of "guidance", take your medications, is as straightforward as "quit smoking because it is bad for your health". It is unambiguous and not debated by any reputable clinicians. Your thoughts and feelings about smoking do not change the fact that it's bad for you. The same goes for the need to take medications. People who are just starting out should focus on the basic rules as promulgated by medical mental health experts, not the rare exceptions. In this case, it's "you must take your medications." When I was diagnosed, I needed my psychiatrist to unwaveringly tell me that I needed to be hospitalized and stabilized on medications after which I would need to keep taking medications. The worst thing he could have done is said "well maybe you'll do ok without meds. why don't you think critically about this and get back to me if you need anything else?". That guidance to take medications remains the same decades later. It is the only responsible advice to give a new patient. Period. There's nothing flaky about guidance. It isn't a shot in the dark. It is the best known course of action as determined by thousands of clinicians analyzing decades worth of data to discover what works and what doesn't. Your car may seem to drive fine on bald tires, but most don't and even yours should be changed according to guidance (laws) provided by your state.People can decide not to take their medications, it's just that in the vast majority of cases, that's a really bad decision. I think we, who have been dealing with this illness all of lives, understand that point and should guide others towards medical guidance not provide them rationalizations for blowing it off.

R1CHARDCRANIUM [info] I watched my dad cry for the first time when I was 15. The look in his eyes as he was standing over my hospital bed will always be with me. The story:I was 15 and everything was going great. I was a 4.0 student, was seeing one of the hottest girls in the school, was in driver's ed, was a star wrestler, etc. My life, from the outside, was perfect. One day, out of nowhere, I felt the need to kill myself. I overdosed on some medications we had lying around and just sat on the couch to fall asleep. My sister found me when she got home from school and called 911. My dad arrived at the hospital and just cried. He felt it was all his fault. My dad was military and was gone often. The look in his eyes was that of fear. He truly feared he had lost his son. I still have to fight back the tears when I think of the look on his face. To this day, I do not know what caused me to try and kill myself. Why, when everything was great, I felt that it was the way out. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after that and have been living (sometimes struggling) with that since then. If anything good came from this, it is that I understand what it looks like and can see the warning signs if they appear in my son. Also, when I was young, the military community viewed mental health issues as weakness so counseling and psychiatric help was avoided. This will not be the case with my children. They will get any help they may need. But Jesus, the look in my father's eyes.  [info] None [info] 1401463651

Aenderung [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 19 but had been going to a therapist since I was 14. I had a really rough time with it all the way up until I was about 25 when I realized that it was never going to go away.  I know that sounds scary,  but for the entire time I was dealing with it before I was coming at it from an 'I'm a normal person and am temporarily fucked up.'  when I finally said OK,  this is what and who I am,  these are my new sets of parameters.  The first thing I did was start being honest with those closest to me. I explained my situation,  how it could affect me, and what if anything they could do to help me.  The second thing I did was look for positive outlets for my manic stages, and mitigation for my depressive stages.  For me they both came in the form of exercise and mma. The endorphins released from working out served as a Kickstart to me working towards a balance.  I wasn't going to be super happy,  or super motivated,  but I'd be better than I was.  If I were to give you any advice it would be this: be honest,  accept your new parameters,  find a good psychiatrist who you click with and can guide you and work to found positive outlets for your negative emotions.

Let me tell you, pedophiles are scum of the fucking Earth. They deserve to burn for eternity, with what they do to children. If they don't act on their urges, whatever, I don't care. But if they do...After that, even though I didn't fully comprehend what had happened, I was numb. I couldn't feel shit. I was just a walking shell. From fourth to seventh grade, I was bullied horribly. People telling me to kill myself, I got in fights, it was bad. I started cutting at age nine. I tried to kill myself three times at eleven. I was fucked up. I was depressed.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in sixth grade, or when I was eleven. I went in a psychiatric hospital. I got medication, but it didn't work.I started hallucinating, and developed sociophobia, in ninth grade. Or around there somewhere. I had panic attacks every day, and by this time I was off medication for some reason, so I had nothing to help with my bipolar disorder.I went to a psychiatric hospital again, and was put on a different medication. That one worked for a while, then they switched me because of hormone levels, and that one worked until a few months ago.Now I'm seventeen, and fucked up with no medication to help. So yeah, it sucks.And that is why I haven't been happy for ten years. [info] None [info] 1403816015

wellthisisawful [info] Female here.  Throwaway, obviously.From the ages of probably 11-14, I would jerk off my friend's dog.  I'm trying to think back to how I found ways to be alone with the dog, but it was over ten years ago and at this point I have no idea.When I was around 13, I would sometimes force my younger brother to let me give him lap dances.  I liked making him uncomfortable and seeing if I could make him hard.  It only happened 2 or 3 times, but we have never talked about it since then.My senior year of college I lived with a girl who had a golden retriever as a pet.  When she was out of the house, I would sometimes get the dog to eat me out.My first year out of college, while in a serious relationship, I would regularly sleep with random men on Craigslist.  I guess that's not really a true "secret", since my boyfriend at the time eventually figured it out.  He thinks it was only one guy, though.A little over a year ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  That's not a secret, but it has helped me put together the above events as hints of past manic or hypomanic episodes. [info] None [info] 1404097417

pero_dero [info] Will try to keep it short:My american football coach had just started talking with the national team and colleges in the US for me to start playing for them. I tore a ligament in my groin during a match and the doctors found out I had an anomaly in my hip so I had to undergo a surgery, which meant no more football or MMA.The two sports were my way to vent all the negativity I had so I became heavily depressed. I started drinking heavily, even got to school drunk sometimes. Then drugs came into the picture and I eventually had a psychosis.Lateron I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, which I dealt with. Had a good period where I started in college, but shortly after I dropped out and went back to my drug abuse. I'm 22 now and the struggle is over, it was 3 1/2 dark years, and I remember little. I'm going to study sports science in the best university for sports science in my country. To be stable I had to stop doing drugs, never get more than tipsy when drinking, and **keep a routine** to stay active and get out of bed every morning.  [info] None [info] 1404235633
sweterek-w-jelonki [info] I don't go on dates, but whenever I meet people I like and think things are going well enough (they like me too and I feel comfortable with them) I tell them I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder. Maybe not the best thing to reveal on a first time meeting, but I think it's important that people I hang out with are aware of it and I'm not really bothered with anyone knowing. I don't know if it is lowering my chances of 'finding love' or getting an actual date, although I know people take this into mind when engaging in interactions with me later. I just want to be honest with everybody and usually get to explain some of the stuff about the condition, so at least I can spread awareness of the problem. Even if this might mean I won't get a boyfriend in the foreseeable future- I think it's worth it.  [info] None [info] 1404290652

wannabeomniglot [info] Cersei. On my first read, Cersei was an arrogant, unloveable lunatic and everyone would be better off with her dead. I watched her descent into madness and felt like she got what was coming to her.Then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.Cersei could've been *great*. She's a pretty base tactician, and she's got a lot of pride, but imagine if she had trained at the knee of Tywin Lannister? What if instead of growing bitter about and towards her sex, she did not feel constantly maligned? Already we're looking at a woman whose missed opportunities and social constraints have turned her into an asshole. And then she goes insane, which I now know not to wish on my bitterest enemy. Can you imagine the fear of living with constant paranoia? Cersei is the most tormented character we've met, and the only one who wakes up every morning, regardless of cirumstance, afraid. And her grandiosity? I've been there; it's really really fun until it's really, really scary. I can honestly say I feel the most connected, the most distraught, and the most emotional when I'm reading Cersei's chapters. [info] None [info] 1405263177
Yeargdribble [info] I don't know honestly, though i can walk you through some of my journey.  I was always very depressed growing up.  I was relentlessly picked on and bullied hard pretty much from 2nd grade until I graduated.  I was diagnosed with bipolar II which I would often learn to manage to my benefit by taking advantage of manic episodes and being productive.  The rest of the time I would just to stay very neutral.  The higher you are, the farther you have to fall, so I tried to never get too happy.  I was suicidal pretty much the entirety of HS.  Like... suicidal thoughts almost daily.In college, things changed.  I went from being very unpopular to very, very popular.  The things that made me such a target in HS... you know, making an effort and not trying to pretend I was purely apathetic, was suddenly a thing admired by people in my field.  Also, my very unique personality, which was always squelched for being weird in HS was very cool in college.  In retrospect, it's not that my personality type was so weird, it's just that I was pigeonholed as the loser and so in the social pecking order nobody was allowed to like me.  In college, that was gone and it didn't matter.  As I realized people weren't going to hate me for being me, I was me turned up to 11 like I'd never been.I literally learned to give absolutely no fucks.  After all of the getting mowed down in HS, the amount of freedom to be myself in college made me realize that worrying about it was silly.  The most horrible things anyone would have to say about my personality in college would always pale in comparison to the "just kill yourself, please" type stuff from HS.  So let it roll off of me when it did rarely come.I've really grown into the giving no fucks thing.  Nowadays I realize that even as an adult, that's really rare.  I don't give a shit about ordering "girly" drinks.  I don't give a shit about trying to act all manly.  I don't care what some random person I'll never see again thinks about something about me.  I'm not tone-deaf to social cues or anything.  I still keep some opinions to myself, but just the little crap I see so many people on reddit paralyzed about, I just couldn't care less about.  If someone is going to judge you for some small, silly, subjective thing, why do you care?My friends often joke about what I'll be like when I'm old.  If I already don't care what people think, what will it be like when I'm old where people stereotypically stop giving fucks.I also stopped settling on a lot of things.  My wife and I are doing well now because I never let her walk on me in stereotypical fashion and I returned the favor.  We talk about shit rather than play the silly relationship mind games and gender-role bullshit that most people allow themselves to get tied up in.  I just started cutting that type of thing out of my life.  Same with friends.  It may sound dickish, but there are people who just cease to be worth my time.  If you are going to spout idiotic non-sense and are one of those who "doesn't care about the facts" I don't need you around raising my blood pressure.   If you are the type likes to go drop half a paycheck at the bar on a Friday night and drive home half drunk, I don't need you in my life.  I try to only surround myself with people who don't suck.  It's definitely a very tight handful, but I'd rather have quality over quantity.I'd take small steps to remove people who are not positive from your life.  Don't like your relationship?  Take steps to change it and if your SO is not flexible, you probably need to move on and find someone who wants to make a relationship work rather than dictate their own terms.  Definitely don't feel like you have to be in a relationship to be a full person.  The job part is harder because you have to stay afloat.  My employment situation is literally a dream that happened purely by accident so I can't really make an practical suggestions there. [info] None [info] 1405276221
ALotOfArcsAndThemes [info] Uh...source for that? I was diagnosed with bipolar and moderate to severe ADHD and was on meds for both for a while.

sayhitothehobo [info] I am 25 years old.  For 4 years I was diagnosed with bipolar.  I suggested other things like ADHD, but to no avail.  The problem is both bipolar and ADHD have a lot of overlapping symptoms.  The bigger problem is if you are bipolar and you take stims, you can cause or worsen mania episodes and make medications less effective in the future.  Unless the doctor is treating you poorly or inadequately, I would say wait it out for a bit.  Good psychs are really really hard to find.  But mediocre psychs will stop listening to you if you "become a troublemaker".  The docs I met were all qualified, but honestly most docs just don't give a shit if they think they are right.  I admit they knew more than me, and so I tried their way first.  Eventually I noticed that the drugs they gave me either did absolutely nothing or made me feel worse.  After that initial try it becomes YOUR choice.  Try more mood stabilizers/anti-depressants or try something completely different.  Sadly, trying something different almost always requires a new doctor.  Remember, after everything is said and done the doctor is working for you, not you for him/her.  If you don't like what they are saying, get a new doctor.  After 5 doctors I finally found a doctor who did not just agree with me, he actively tested me and talked with relatives and friends before he actually diagnosed me with ADHD (2 months later).  No other doctor ever tried to talk with my family or tried testing me.  It's sad, but my record said I was resistant to doctors and that I was manipulative.  Once people see that it becomes hard for anyone to listen.So I guess in summary try to be a little open with other diagnoses.  If you think you doctor is qualified, listen to and follow his advice.  If you think something is wrong, tell him.  If he disagrees it becomes your choice to stay on his path or change docs.  It is best not to fight with him.  Lastly, try to find a doc that has the time to see you and who actively tries to empathize and understand your situation.  These docs are very rare and if you find one, I would seriously consider staying with them instead of leaving.PS:  Mental health diagnoses are very commonly misdiagnosed.  If doctors make that mistake then I would imagine it would be easy for us to make it too.  It could be that you are neither bipolar nor ADHD.  You could be both.  You could have no illness at all or you might have a more serious one that you haven't even suspected yet.  It is very tough and sometimes speculative.  Some, like ADHD, are commonly comorbid with other mental illnesses.  And basically all of them have a lot of related symptoms.  It's tough and research is very important.  If you wanted to pick up some beginner books about ADHD you should try "Driven to Distraction" by Hallowell or "Taking charge of adult ADHD" by Barkley.  They both say pretty much the same thing though I liked the one by Barkley more.  Some people don't like Barkley because of where he gets his research money from.  He seemed legit to me and probably has researched Adult ADHD more than another other person alive.   [info] None [info] 1405305307

kristjkm [info] I always joke to my friends that I peaked too early and in high school.Not to humblebrag but I was friends with kids in every year, almost all my teachers loved me, I had a 4.0, won Mr. North (my HS name). Even in my yearbook I had to add an additional 6 pages because there wasn't enough space for people to write/sign mine. I could literally pick and choose between the girls that wanted to date/hookup with because there were enough that wanted me. Since then, I was an average student in college, had a decent amount of friends and settled into my first long term relationship (after a few failed attempts). I joined a fraternity and no more sports. During college, I was diagnosed with bipolar and that's something that I had to really learn to deal with. After graduation, got a decent job as a social worker but I love it and I love what I do and I love my life. I definitely have fewer friends, but that was partially by choice. Growing older, I learned that it's literally impossible to have as many friends as I did in HS and it's just too much effort and not worth it. I have fewer friends but they are of better quality and I'm glad that's how it is. It seems that life isn't as exciting, but I enjoy it just as much because there's a point where the Bruce Wayne/homecoming king lifestyle suddenly stops becoming fulfilling. Yea it can bring temporary happiness but I really had to take a look at my life as a whole and what I wanted to do with it. My life isn't terrible, per se, but it's certainly fairly average compared to the HS celebrity status.  [info] None [info] 1406045495

ToddEscolars [info]      While you said you were not looking for legal advice just simply someone else's opinion on your situation, I just saw your post and as a Social Security disability lawyer will respond with a little dose of both.       Basically your chance of being approved for SSI (Supplemental Security Income) or SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) at age 24 is not good.       First of all, I doubt you have worked long enough and paid enough Social Security taxes into the Social Security Trust Fund to have the required quarters of work to qualify for SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) based upon your own work record.  Next bad piece of information is that simply seeing a psychiatrist once or twice a year since age 13, is not likely to be viewed by the Social Security Administration as a "serious enough" childhood condition or impairment, that would keep you from working as a adult and so would not be a basis for you to draw SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) based the work record of either your father or mother.  Consequently, this leaves you as someone, who would only be eligible for SSI (Supplemental Security Income) a program that pays only a measly "maximum benefit" somewhere around $700.00 per month, if you are deemed disabled. The problem is SSI is based upon your "family income" and if you are living with your parents, any support from them (i.e., "free room and board") counts against you and the monthly benefit is reduced accordingly.     Enough about the "financial criteria" (i.e., prior work record for SSDI, family income for SSI, etc.), now lets look at facts you have presented and how well they will withstand scrutiny by the Social Security Administration in determining if you are "disabled" and eligible for monetary benefits.     Basically, mental health impairment claims, are not favored at all by the Social Security Administration.  Very clear rules and standards in deciding cases.  For a mental health condition to be considered "sever" and "disabling" it must result in "repeated periods of decompensation requiring prolonged periods of hospitalization of a week or more."  The Social Security Administration has construed "repeated periods" to mean at least three or more periods over the course of a year occurring in intervals of every four months.  Thus, one visit in the hospital psych ward years ago for a "nervous breakdown" and weekly chat sessions with a psychiatrist is not enough to qualify for disability benefits.          You mention being:&gt; "[B]edridden for weeks on end with random panic attacks"and under the Social Security Administration's rules, which I noted above, that is not enough.    You also said:&gt; "I was afraid of seeing a psychiatrist and saying something wrong and end up being involuntarily committed for saying something like 'Yes' to 'Have you ever thought about suicide?' so I wasn't 100% honest about everything. It was about a 30-60 minute appointment and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with mild psychosis or something like that. She prescribed me some anti-depressants and abilify, which don't seem to have any effect on me so far (It's been 10 days). I'm going to see her Monday and I wasn't sure to bring up applying for disability or not." Well, because you didn't tell the psychiatrist the whole story regarding the severity of your symptoms your medical records, which the Social Security Administration will obtain and review, not only don't show the required repeated periods during the year of stays in a hospital psych ward, they contain language describing your condition as simply a case of  "mild psychosis."  Adjudicators and Administrative Judges working for the Social Security Administration, who review claims for SSI benefits understands a "mild" condition as one that really does not have a great impact upon your life!    Now for a big dose of reality at your age of 24 the Social Security Administration feel you are young enough that you should have no problem getting GED, maybe even complete college degree, and have a long and productive career. At your age you would definitely need to show: a documented learning disability, with evidence you had an annual IEP (Individual Educational Plan) for you at school and got sent to special classes, and even different specialized schools, as a result of your disability.  Simply, dropping out of school at 15 does not help your case.  If your were over 55 years old and seeking disability benefits, than the fact you. "[D]ropped out of school,"  carries some weight.   You mentioned weight gain, but again obesity is not a disabling condition!     Finally, very damaging for any case you might try to start is your own admission, "I spent 12+ hours a day on the computer."  One of the important questions you are asked when you start a disability claim is, "What do you do all day all day long from the time you wake up until going to bed?"  With the information you have given the Social Security administration will tell you that you are well suited to find employment as a "data entry clerk," a job of which there are thousands in Texas alone, the work is simple, easily learned in a few days, and is done in an isolated work setting away from other people such as members of the general public, and necessitates only occasional interaction with co-workers.      In other words they are probably going to let your know you are employable, you may need to first get GED for anyone to hire you, but that is not their problem that is your problem.

rusemaen [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 12 and was medicated for about a year and a half before I stopped taking it (and hid that fact from my parents). I'm still not sure if I actually had bipolar disorder, but the lithium and antidepressants they gave me really fucked with me. Nothing fazed me, in a bad way. I also couldn't remember things very well. Even my physical reaction times were slower and I started to shuffle around uncoordinately rather than walk like I had before. It was basically like being a really mellow burnout - sluggish, forgetful, hazy, inept. I eventually realized what was happening to me and I quit everything immediately.

Splinter1010 [info] Yeah, I feel the same. Up until I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after attempting suicide three times and cutting myself for two years at that point, though they only thought I had attempted once, I had thought that suicide was for cowards and selfish, and that no decent person would do it. Of course, that all changed. I was nine when it started, actually. So yeah, up until I was nine, I thought that all that shit was cowardly and selfish. Then I lived through it, undiagnosed for two or so years, and came out changed. I also used to have a completely wrong idea about hallucination causing disorders. Then I turned fourteen, and developed hallucinations. They still don't know what I have, they just know that I have them. But yeah, mental illness really changes you. For me, it made me extremely empathetic, caring, and compassionate, with an intense value for human life, and a passionate feeling about how people treat mental illness. However, it also gave me a fucked up sense of self worth, a lack of motivation, and in general made my life a living hell. Do I wish I could make it so I never had it? No, actually. But do I wish I could get rid of it? You're god damn right. [info] None [info] 1408078592

How would I go about finding a group? I admire the thought put into your decision to not have kids, but I get a little teary eyed that you feel that you can't! I totally understand where you're coming from, though. I always thought I'd have more than 2, but I now realize chances of that, with all the meds, are very slim. Would you want to PM me your response? Not that I want to take away your knowledge from others that can gain from it, I just don't want to share my more private life details to the world wide web! I'm also curious, if you don't mind sharing, did you do CBT or DBT? [info] None [info] 1408339416

PrairieWulf [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type II rapid cycling) six years ago although it has ruined me for my entire life. My loved ones made little to no effort to learn about it or help me. My friends all disappeared. When I was put on income assistance and couldn't afford my place anymore I had to move to another city because my cousin was the only person that could help me out, but that situation was way worse (at least six people at any time living in a three bedroom party house). That was year three, things got so much worse, and it doesn't account for the nightmare my life was for the 22 years leading up to the diagnosisI am never going to be able to get out of this myself. I have one friend in the city I live in now and he does his best to keep my spirits up but he's never going to help me change my lot in life and I can't do it alone. My only hope is that one day some kind person will take me in and help me get my legs under me before I kill myself. The only reason I haven't done it yet is to spare my family the pain, but I can't keep going on like this. [info] None [info] 1408541666
ChubakTheGreat [info] Thanks for your advice. You see... I kinda tried that before. And well, well, I'm not going to tell you what happened. It involves Ambien, Ritalin, a few punches, me being thrown in a mental asylum for three weeks and losing all my asshole (in retrospect) friends.I really, really can't socialize. I was diagnosed with hyper activity at the age of seven, but my shitstain of a father who thought he's a doctor because he went to med school decided against any sort of medication because according to him it made me "mellow". Anyways, at the age of fourteen I was diagnosed with bipolarity. Despite the fact that my ADHD is still there, my bipolarity stole the thunder and I take like ten pills a day just for that.You can imagine a person whose brain is literally a toilet can't handle the society. I hate everyone and everything. I'm not pretending, I'm not a sixteen year old girl or a twenty year old NEET who blame their laziness and creepiness on their self-diagnosed mental problems. I'm the real deal.I can socialized if I want to. I'm not the ugliest dude out there and although I'm still wearing the pair of pants I bought in my senior year of high school I can restock my wardrobe.

Gotslurm [info] It doesn't me, though I guess it should.  I'm a mental health counselor and it was drilled into us "People are not their mental illness, they have a mental illness.  You wouldn't say someone is cancer!"  I've been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder for..oh goodness, ten years now and I still say "I'm bipolar" instead of "I have bipolar disorder."  I think it's due to the fact that it's socially acceptable, or maybe even expected.  I really need to change that and keep it from defining me.Anyway, I hope that answers your question from me.

MyShhAccount [info] I was bipolar as a teen, but never diagnosed.  After a pretty nasty breakdown in my early 20s, I suffered from derealization for a number of years.  I was numb to everything and my moods were nonexistent.  I finally saw someone about it.  The treatment worked.  The numbness went away, but the bipolar returned.  After a number of referrals, I was diagnosed with bipolar NOS due to the irregular, sometimes rapid cycles.This happened as I was just hitting my stride in my career.  My employer forced me out (I won a nice settlement over it, so I had that).  My friends drifted away.  My family became wary, or in some cases, hostile.I don't have a solution for you, but you're not alone in your experience.  Others have been there, are there, and are willing to be there for you.

ArchHero [info] I broke down in middle school in front of everyone, because of all of the shit I was going through was just one thing after another. I don't like crying in front of people, and I felt extremely embarassed back then. When I walked to the bus stop that morning these puppies were chasing this guy on a bike, and then they started to follow me. Well, they were still there at the bus stop, and one of them fought with one of the other ones. The ear got all fucked up. I don't know. My cousin had recently died, and I've just been through a lot. I was walking up to the band instructor, and I couldn't talk, and I just broke down in front of everyone. The counselor was shitty, and really didn't help. Something that small just made me break down, but it was all because of the other shit that was going on in my life. I'm 20, and I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder along with other shit. After my cousin died, my mental health went to shit.So, even the smallest of things can just make you cry, or just in a shitty mood, because of other stressful stuff that's going on around you.

Since I am considered attractive I feel like my "quirks" have worked out for me in a strange way.  Basically, I am trying to ask how did you know that you were on the spectrum?  There is overwhelming evidence that I have something going on; I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1, BPD, GPD, PTSD and an eating disorder. I feel these diagnoses are inconsistent but any doctor I talk to seems quick to dismiss anything to do with autism.

Kirena [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 18 months ago, and that was about the time I got into makeup as an escape. When my grandmother died in October, I spent three hours applying and reapplying different colours and looks, natural and artistic looks, as a way to cope with my grief.Makeup has become a way for me to express my personality and feelings, which are heightened and varied even on medication. There are times when I lose interest, and feel crappy because I lost my love for it. These feelings will pass.To combat those feelings of loss, I do a facial mask, moisturise the shit out of my face and hair, watch a ton of tutorials and pull out colours and just look. Sometimes inspiration won't come for minutes, hours or days, but eventually I pick up my primer and get started. This all sounds so rambly but these feelings will pass. Don't force it, go for a walk and clear your head, do some skincare and hair care just to get back to basics and get your body feeling flawless. If you ever need to talk, send me a PM. Depression is not talked about enough, and is never, ever something to be ashamed about. There is always someone out there who is willing to listen. [info] Glitterati [info] 1410433345

briefanfiction10 [info] Depending on how disabled you are, you may be able to get into the National Guard. I was having a chat with my campus Vet Rep and he asked me if I wanted to go Guard. I said "Sorry sir, I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder." Without blinking, he said "I know a Master Sergeant who will get you in. Period." I personally don't really agree with that line of thought, but I respect his loyalty. Perhaps you could mail your CSM and ask him for a letter of recommendation, kind of a "I know this guy and he's squared away" type of thing. That would be a nice tool in the toolbox if you tried to get a waiver to go Guard. Also, it sounds like you really like inspiring people and bringing out the best in them (you sound like a natural leader).

hatetowels2 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a couple of years ago. It was impacting my function at work at the time of my diagnosis, so I told my principal what was going on. The office staff and several of the teachers also know. I had to call in more frequently than usual in the year following my diagnosis, and it was nice to be able to be honest about why I needed a sub. I had the sick leave and I always prepped for a functional school day so I never saw any negative consequences. My boss and coworkers have been extremely understanding. I don't broadcast it with parents. I believe my lack of consequence is a result of my several years prior to diagnosis, doing very well at my job (hypo mania and teaching go well together... Until you crash). I held myself just barely together during the height of my initial diagnosis, and now again, I'm doing better than ever. I know my situation isn't indicative of every work place, but as long as I do well, my boss is very supportive. I'm sure if my illness impacted my work, I would not be met with as much warmth. Sad. Also, I've been in a committed closed triad relationship for a few years now... Fewer people know about that than my bipolar. They are aware of my husband, but think that my girl is just best friend and roommate. Whether true or not, I feel more protected about my medical status than my relationship status. It sure would be nice not to have be in the closet about anything... But I do like being employed in a job I love and I've already pushed it and indulged my desire to share a bit much. I just keep my fingers crossed it'll keep going well. I'm extra vigilant with all aspects of my mental health care in an effort toward job security ;) [info] None [info] 1412320823

I'm in the process of trying to lose weight, I just have to buckle down.  I'm starting to track my calories and I'm starting to work out.  It's hard to get into.  I read somewhere that it takes 21 days to get into a new routine.  If you are having serious concerns, I would go to your doctor and have a sit down with him/her.  When I've done this, they have listened and changed my medication as needed.One or two made me have sexual dysfunction...to the point that I couldn't feel anything and sex just...the thought of it made me cringe because I felt like I had to for whoever I was dating at the time, but I got no enjoyment whatsoever.

mbok_jamu [info] Some of you might knew that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, now I will tell you the story that triggered my OCD. My parents are childhood sweetheart, they met each other in primary school and always attended the same school until high school. They married after they graduated from high school and have two daughters. They really want to have a son, so after they married for 24 years, they decided to try once more. My mom was 40ish at that time, getting pregnant seems so risky at that age. God says otherwise, my mom got pregnant, but only for several weeks until she had miscarriage. A year later, my mom got pregnant again. So, after waiting for 25 years, my parents finally have a son. It was the happiest moment of our lives. I never saw my mom so happy before. But it didn't last long.When my brother was 9 months old, he was diagnosed with meningitis. It's hard to see him lying on the hospital bed, but I have to go back to my kost in another town (waktu itu gue masih kuliah semester satu). So I kissed him while he's sleeping. My heart says, kiss him once more, please kiss him once more. But I told myself, "Ah, ntar kan minggu depan gue pulang" (gue pulang setiap weekend). The next morning when I was at my kost, my dad called. My brother died. It breaks my heart to know that I should've kiss him one more time. It would be the last kiss that I will always remember. A goodbye kiss from me to my wonderful little brother.Several years later, I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I always do things in repetitive order. Seems like it happens because since my brother died, I always have an urge to touch everything I've seen every time I will leave a place or when someone left me. When I was eating out, I will touch every objects in front of me after I finished eating or before I leave that place. I did it because I'm afraid I will never visit that place anymore. Or every time my bf came to visit me at my kost, I will hug and kiss him several times before he leave. I do it all because I'm afraid I will never see him again. I don't want to miss the last kiss like what happened before my brother died. [info] Neng, papa kamu tukang komputer ya? Muka Neng perlu diedit. [info] 1413424864
Emeryn [info] It is common. that's because people don't take mental health anywhere close to seriously.

KnittedOwl [info] I'm a little younger than you but I've been dealing with mental illness since I was 9. My parents threw me into the psych department of my hospital for "anger issues" that no one could see. I was just a moody kid that didn't like talking to people. I never stopped seeing a therapist and psych. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder the day I turned 18. Now with a back story where parents seem to think something is wrong, you would think they are supportive of me having a diagnosis but having bipolar might as well have been a death sentence to them. They don't allow me to drink, though I'm 21. They don't allow me to be moody. I've learned to "fake it until I make it" until I reach my room where I lock my door and get to be however I want to be. I've given them the bipolar disorder survival guide book to read. I've had my psych write explanations to them on what I have.I think the biggest thing is that when they grew up, being bipolar was a bigger deal then it is now. People could be put in psych wards for a very long time just for the diagnosis. I have an aunt who was very helpful in explaining it to me. She said "If you had cancer you would get treatment for that right? Your head is just a little sick and it's something people don't understand and will want to say you don't have, just like cancer because it's scary, but that doesn't mean you don't have it. You just keep treating it, going to the doctors and doing what is best for you"In the long run I started ignoring most of what my parent's said that was discouraging including the most recent "you should come off your meds so you can be skinny again" and I'm doing really well.

Being a minor at the time, my parents ended up just taking me off them altogether though and were completely unwilling to have me try meds again (who knows why) until I was diagnosed with bipolar iiI didn't know they had a test like that. It sounds like a blessing though. Any clue why it isn't used more widely and/or readily? I'm glad you've got such a support system :) that's fantastic.I have a very supportive boyfriend as well, but lack strength in my coping mechanisms. [info] None [info] 1413903066
plornt3 [info] Haha, I'm getting an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist this Monday. I know that neglecting such symptoms can be very dangerous, as once I had a very severe manic episode which rapidly escalated into grandiose and persecutory delusions with catatonia - I was stuck in the bed and couldn't move, or I paced around mindlessly. This was the worst experience in my life - I lost about 11 kg because I couldn't even feed myself due to the catatonia. I just held to the water bottles and drank as soon as my catatonia subsided, not to become dehydrated - after all, dehydration kills you faster than starvation. I was diagnosed with bipolar by one psychiatrist, then, when I was hospitalized, I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia by another one, because the psychosis was very severe. Now, my new psychiatrist thinks that I'm bipolar as well, because I didn't show any deterioration in though, emotion and cognitive functioning typical of schizophrenia.

MrB0mbastic [info] I've thought there wasn't any difference between a person with aspergers and a normal person, and I even have a sneaking suspicion that there isn't much difference in any mentally ill person and a normal person. I was once a pretty uncontrolled person but I've been getting better, I recently got off my meds and feel much better since I did. I was diagnosed with bipolar and getting off meds is supposed to be the last thing I should be able too do. I feel better and they say I shouldn't. I have no way to back this up but I'm certain that the brain is just the hardware that we write our thoughts on is the software. And I feel just like how a computer can get a few important drivers become corrupted, same goes with the brain. If a child is told that small talk means people don't like them and no one corrects it and if that small child grows to adult hood then there is going to be huge holes in their experiences with other people. and I've been thinking about this for a long ass time. It's like some people think that is someone is so stupid to never figure out that small talk is fun and leads to good things then they must be stupid, but in reality all it takes to never learn that is a hateful parent or one that is too controlling. lots of things can cause that and no one seems to get that. They just try to say it's some sort of genetic bullshit.The truth is no one needs any pill for an emotional problem, the truth is they need someone to care about them. Sad too say it but the idea that pills can fix anything has caused way more harm then good. Pills for mental health is going to be the death of mankind if we don't stop it.

StaringAtTheGalaxy [info] Wow!  You sound so much like me!  I'm bipolar also, and especially in middle and high school I was bullied for being "different" and highly intelligent.  The bizarre intelligence was always present because it was something I clung to for inspiration, but only during my manic phases did friends and peers see how "weird" I was.  I'm not, I just have unique interests for my geographical location like anime, foreign literature, video games, (I'm a girl), volunteer work, etc.I'm 22 now and was only hospitalized and evaluated for the first time two and a half years ago.  During the first hospitalization I was diagnosed with bipolar and panic attacks.  I've been hospitalized for related struggles since then.My panic attacks, to me, usually seem to be a result of my brain "misfiring" or "being an asshole," as you said.  I know I've told my fiancé the latter explicitly before.  "I wake up in a good mood then end up having a panic attack in class...  I feel like my brain's just being an ass!"If I don't get somewhere alone to deal with mine...  they just repeat, repeat, repeat, until I am alone, and then it peaks and it's terrible.  Sometimes, if there's many repeated attacks, it affects me for several days--either more attacks or a major mood swing.  I do feel that my fiancé has helped me with this, though, especially the "I'm losing my mind!" sensation of a sudden panic attack.  Though in public, those are still terrible.  Sometimes I feel like my brain postpones the worst ones until I'm in the car or at home. [info] None [info] 1414549673

lookielurker [info] I used to smoke, a lot. I cut it out completely after I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder because pot added to the meds I was on was just making me miserable with paranoia. I couldn't really enjoy it anymore, so I didn't really go back to it. Now, I'm on different meds, and I limit it to when my back hurts too bad to move without help. I figure it's better to be mostly functional (as in a little bit stoned), than to be completely non-functional due to either pain or opiates (yeah, the Rx drugs for my bck pain are too strong for me to take and be alone with the kids.)I won't drive after smoking, that's about the only limitation that I put on myself. It doesn't impair me enough to where I don't feel comfortable around the kids, but I know that my reaction time goes down just enough that I probably shouldn't be operating a ton of steel.

mclovinsgirl [info] As someone who has a mental disorder that requires medicine, I have experienced the pros and cons of giving kids medicine for disorders. Starting when I was in middle school was given diagnosis after diagnosis in an attempt to treat my particular issues before a more fitting diagnosis was found. My old doctor told me to drink caffeine for my ADD because it calms my mind instead of making me hyper, but I am extremely sensitive to it and don't drink it ever (only had one cup of coffee ever. *gasp!* I know). I wasn't medicated until my junior year (mainly antidepressants) and they didn't help me. So I was given another. Then another. And so on and so forth. Eventually I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and given different types of meds (mood stabilizers) on top of different antidepressants. Over the years, I have experienced symptoms such as feeling emotionally numb, body shivers, muscle cramping, and even becoming suicidal. I actually had a doctor  deny taking me off the first mood stabilizer even after I told her it made me hear voices that told me to kill myself (I had felt suicidal in the past, which is par of my bipolar II, but never heard voices before). The only way I was able to get off of it was by telling her that the voices wouldn't stop telling me to kill myself and I didn't want to kill myself and begging her to allow me to voluntarily commit myself to a psych ward. I still have memory recall issues due to that med and it's been almost 2 years since I stopped it.Anyways, I have been off all meds for over a year (I tapered off) and I accepted that my disorder won't magically go away. Mental disorders are so hard to treat because there are no blood test to see if you're positive for one. You can't see them on an x-ray. Treating psych disorders is trial and error. Some people need meds their whole life, some people need them to be able to start therapy/other treatments, and some people just need the other treatments. I must add that there is a genetic test to determine what type of psychiatric med will work best with your brain chemistry (will hopefully getting that done within the next few years). I get nervous when people argue against medicating kids because I know I could've used meds when I was younger to treat horrible panic attacks. I also know a lot of people (kids and adults) who have benefited from ADHD meds. The thing people mist keep in mind is if you feel like a doctor is not listening you or your child, get a second opinion and "fire" your doctor if necessary. Not all doctors are the same and 99% of the time it's their fault, not yours. [info] None [info] 1415265312

ThisIsNotMyBody [info] This is my one and only regret in life as well for very similar reasons. I had the chance to transition quite younger, but my psychiatrist at the time dismissed it as a symptom of bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed with bipolar at a young age, medicated, but never felt right. Eventually I became an adult with severe dysphoria, so I find a new doctor. I was misdiagnosed with bipolar, and put on hormones soon after. Everything then started to improve, but the damage was done and I regret not pushing harder at that time.

JoosMoose [info] Something that discouraged me was the sheer amount of schooling, and also everyone telling me that I'd burn out working in a field like that.  I mean, I'm sure it is hard seeing dead people every day, some of whom were young or met with foul play or whatever else.As a teen I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and school got really hard for me as I tried to learn to cope with that.  I think that convinced me that I couldn't handle all the schooling required for something like that if I couldn't even get through sophomore year of high school, haha.  So that dream kinda fell to the wayside and when I did go to college I got interested in anthropology (archaeology especially).  But then I got interested in the hard sciences and medicine again, and now I'm a certified phlebotomist because why not.I think I will go back to school for something else eventually, but I doubt it'll be to become a medical examiner at this point in my life.

Korinney [info] - Coop advisors can be useless, coop offerings can be shit, coop isn't guaranteed to be paid (or even paid hourly) so you can end up in debt for that time as well.- Very small sense of real community. The campus is scattered and because of coop cycles, you really have to work to make friendships and relationships last.- Because on-campus housing is so expensive and near-campus housing is insane, commuting becomes a reality for many students very quickly. I moved off campus after my second year and immediately felt like I was going to a different school. Hell, even when I was living in Davenport B and didn't have a meal plan I felt like I was in a different school. (Can be solved by not moving off of central campus and keeping a meal plan.)- Shuffle shuffle shuffle. I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder through UHCS and went on medical leave for two months. Came back part-time and struggled endlessly (in therapy and on medication from an outside psychiatrist regularly). Two YEARS later I've been told that I was supposed to have been given an advisor at the Disability Resource Center to help me with school. YEARS, PEOPLE. No one told me it was something I should use/could use.- School is really run as a company/brand. I don't feel like the administration wants me to learn, I feel like they treat me like an incoming check. I don't feel valued as a student, encouraged to learn, because my classes (STILL! AS A SENIOR!) are all medium-sized to large and so I can't get to know my professor easily. Even if I make the effort to go to office hours, they still have tons of students.- University relies heavily on adjunct professors which it doesn't value or treat well.

commanderemily [info] My real sugar sin is we use a lot of Coffee Mate creamers. My partner drinks french vanilla like its water. Usually thats the only actual sugar product I use, that and syrups for my cappuccinos. Stevia was my replacement for sugar in my tea when I was diagnosed with bipolar. I was supposed to cut back on sugar and caffeine. So I sub a cup of coffee or two a day with a decaf tea, reduce the number of espresso based beverages I have (barely once a week, if that, and near none in the summer because its too hot and the nerd in me knows icing espresso shots completely ruins the shot), and wherever I would have added a few teaspoons of sugar add a packet or two of stevia. Like iced lemon water and tea. Coffee is the exception. Disgusting in coffee. But I'm trying.. I think the need for sugar comes from hormone fluctuations. I tend to want chocolate when my hormones fluctuate. So I'm not to worried about it leading me astray, cutting things out slowly worked when I went vegetarian (not anymore, was for 8 years) so I am most way there with the sugar problem. I just like flavor balance lol. Too much savory, need sweet. Only occasionally do I actually feel I need a sugar boost. Thats just how my body worked (blood sugar gets too low, eat something like raw oats mixed with applesauce as recommended by my trainer), but going on keto I am not doing that. So I am not 100% on my I am having cravings, but I'm hoping just drinking more stevia laden tea and kicking the sugar habit will help. [info] None [info] 1416891953

dandeliondid [info] Don't take it from me, really, but you might have borderline personality disorder. It can be mistaken for bipolar sometimes, since the symptoms are somewhat similar. To be honest, I was diagnosed with bipolar II (this means that the manic episodes are not as "up") when I was in my teens, but later on the diagnosis was changed to borderline.I'm pretty sure that doctors can't tell your parents what's going on unless you're planning on hurting yourself or someone else. It may take a while to find a therapist you like (i've gone through a bunch), and to develop a relationship with one that do you like. Often when dealing with emotional or mental health stuff, there's a lot of trial and error with treatments and doctors. It takes time, but if you are really worried about yourself it's worth putting the effort in. I'm glad your girlfriend is concerned for you. Even if your relationship isn't "average" or whatever, the person you're with should always have your best interests at heart. I'm sure even your parents are just worried because they want to see you well and happy. [info] None [info] 1417195166

buttscrew [info] I can actually kind of talk about this from an experience I had. In 2007, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was forcibly medicated in a psychiatric hospital. Being a broke college kid at the time, and having no health insurance when I was discharged after ten days in the hospital. I couldn't afford the $700/month for the antipsychotic medication I was prescribed.   I suddenly stopped taking the medication and have a ten day black spot in my memory. I have heard a few accounts from my family of my actions during this time. I was alive and moving but no one was home. When I regained consciousness I was back in the hospital on day 7 of another 10 day stent. I complained vocally about this feeling of numbness at first, however, quickly got used to it and forgot what it was like to feel. Things seemed so foreign to me. I had a hard time doing simple tasks like driving without huge feelings of paranoia and a reduced sense of direction.When I awoke, I was numb. I had a very distinct feeling of disconnection in my brain. Everything I knew about myself, the city I lived in, and myself as a person was gone. I could actually feel a disconnection in my brain. Two years into therapy I had a therapist suggest that this what I felt in my head was brain damage that occurred from my manic episodes.I went through more therapy and went through all five stages of grief for myself. I buried who I was and adapted to this new form. It wasn't all bad, the brain is a very powerful organ. I had a good job and a nice bit of money saved up. I could tell something was off about me though, the suggestion of brain damage was constantly on my mind as I felt this disconnection from others. During this time, I didn't establish very many meaningful relationships. I was perpetually single and had only gained a few acquaintances from my job. There was something that other people had that I just didn't seem to get. I really didn't think about it all that much and just kind of chalked it up to my disorder and the damage it had done. I had been living in this state of emotionless being for 6 years at this point. In June of 2013, I started a new medication and ceased my long lived relationship with the antipsychotic. One night, I was standing in my room looking at a picture and it a moment, it happened. The hemispheres of my brain realigned and I was overcome by emotion. I felt a rebirth, my brain had a familiar sense of the world again. In a instant I was teleported back to who I was at 21 years old just in my 28 year old body. Now, I identify as having two "selves", the person I am today, and the person who I was during those 6 years of non-emotion. This quick transition didn't come without it's own challenges. Skills and habits I had developed while working almost vanished entirely. I had to relearn (and admittedly still am) stuff like personal financial responsibility but, at the same time things like driving were back to being familiar and absent of  fear. My map of the town I lived in was back inside my brain.  My break in consciousness I did wholeheartedly think of as a death. I had known and accepted this although it took years of therapy to do so. Denial is a powerful force.    Now, I feel as though I am whole again. Even if the last few years have been a lot rockier than their predecessors. Self is absolutely a series of not only memories but emotions and sense of being.    TL:DR I was reincarnated in my own body.Sorry if this got a little off topic. It's kind of a hard thing to explain.Edit: Also, I have been knocked the fuck out before and I pretty much equate that to death. [info] None [info] 1417528893

orangeystripes [info] Hey there.  Sorry if this is presumptuous of me, but after looking through your post history I am assuming you are a girl.  Which puts us at very similar starting stats.In March of this year I (F/22/5'8'') was weighing in at 326 pounds.  I decided to finally get serious about my weight loss and realized I had just had enough of being fat.  However, it wasn't an overnight snap in my life where I suddenly had enough willpower and drive to get it done.  The previous few years I had been through so many ups and downs with my mental health issues that I honestly felt I had no future.  I threw away scholarships in school and a year of hard work, I had to end a relationship with an amazing guy, and I was on so many medications that I could barely function as a normal human.  It was shitty.  I decided to take the reigns on my own life, and over the course of about 2 weeks last November I really examined what the sources of my unhappiness were and tried to change what I could.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so aside from taking medication I couldn't do much about that.  I did, however, move four hours away from my home town to a bigger city where a few of my friends live and decided to start as fresh as I could.  It took about 3 or 4 months after the big move to realize that I could be happy and that life was worth it.  It was not until I was truly happy with myself that I could decide to truly change my life as lose weight.  For the first time in my life I wanted all the best for myself, health and longevity included.  I also got to go off of all but one of my prescriptions!So that brought me to March!  At first I just "watched what I ate" and took some classes at the gym.  I definitely saw weight loss in the first three months, but it was not until I started calorie counting that I saw my progress really kick up a notch.  Pounds 30-ish through 80-ish over the course of 4 months were lost solely through staying under my daily calorie budget in MFP and trying to dedicate half an hour of my day to walking.  It wasn't until recently that I started working out at the gym and I am really glad I waited.  I can do physical activity now that I 100% would not have been able to do months before, and I definitely agree that would have been a deterrent for me at that point in time.I apologize for the novel I wrote you.  But I will sum it all up with some basic bits of advice.  Don`t go too hard too fast.  Work on yourself and your happiness and the drive will follow.  As for the weight loss side of things, just begin with calorie counting and trying to be moderately active through non-strenuous activities.You`ve got this. [info]  [info] 1417966284
Dricos [info] Yo dude, I was diagnosed with bipolar II as well as ADHD and figure may as well pipe up as this thread is quiet at the moment.  So I know I and II react differently and stuff but ritalin has never triggered a manic episode for me. However, the doc has said tht if it ever does I'll be put on Strattera which is one of the non-stimulant treatments.  Who told you to stop taking them? Honestly would recommend only doing so if doc/professional has assessed it - I went off Ritalin a while back of my own accord and ended up wasting almost a whole year of being irritable and unable to control myself.. leading to rapid cycling. Yay. I am unmedicated for bipolar, using low stress lifestyle and a whole lot of mindfulness as thankfully only triggered by stressful events. Which I understnd is not overly helpful to your question, but I have  a friend who is I and ADHD and when ritalin made him manic, they just put him on non-stimulants for ADHD and it worked fine.  I don't know what dexy's are - we have limited medications over here - but if they are stimulants, ask your doc about other methods? tl;dr - Bipolar II, never been manic due to meds. Talk with your doc about other methods before going totally off the meds, especially if still manic.  [info] ADHD-C [info] 1418033608
drowningwithoutwater [info] After my brain injury I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type I. When I'm manic, I hallucinate and I manage my manic episodes with a cocktail of meds including an antipsychotic. However, I also experience auditory hallucinations when I'm not manic and otherwise stable. I was told that as long as the hallucinations aren't causing any harm or distress, I shouldn't worry. I hallucinate classical music and "far off" conversations (can't make out any words, it's just background chatter). My question is, can auditory hallucinations be considered "normal"?

Manassisthenew6pack [info] When I was 20 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after having a psychotic break and needing to be committed, after that I ended up dropping out of college and basically looking to drug use as the only novel thing I did that gave me an identity. I moved back to the small town I was originally going to college in, and began attending a technical school where I would binge on adderall the night before an exam and stay up for 12 hours straight to pass the exams. Because I liked adderall so much I made an appointment with a psychiatrist, who proceeded to give me mood stabilizers but wasn't convinced I needed adderall. In the process of getting adjusted to mood stabilizers instead of the anitpsychotics I had been taking (and stopped taking), things had to get worse before they could get better, and my moods got into new weird areas, to the point where I wasn't comfortable just drinking my feelings away because they would come roaring back when I was drunkest. In light of this, I went to the gym nearly every day, no routine just going as hard as possible for 2ish hours a day trying to exhaust myself. That was all about 8 months ago, I've just been working in fast food since that happened, and my use of everything has precipitiously fallen off to nill at this point, I'm even on a five week quitting smoking streak right now.

peweje [info] Me being bipolar is an important thing to know, and sometimes it comes up in conversation, or they ask.They ask "is there anything I need to know about you before we continue" and I go "No, not really. I was diagnosed with bipolar at 14, but I manage it quite well"What's crazy is I usually say this and then they still fool around with me.Maybe I'm too serious with people? It's not just women though, it's people in general. I have a hard time making friends because I get annoyed quickly. I don't think it's so much what I'm saying, just how I'm saying it or the subjects I'm bringing up. I tend to talk about serious things with people, and sometimes that's not okay.

peacelesswarrior [info] How much my pops and my relationship strengthened.  When I was a kid, he was the strongest man in the world.When I was a teen into a young adult, he was an absolute asshole with an anger problem and I hated the very idea that he was my dad.  He told me straight up, when I was just 16 that he KNEW that at some point, we were going to have a huge fight and probably stop talking for a few years, like he and his dad did.When I turned 21, his dad died.  At this point, he had fixed his relationship with Grandpa and they had become best friends.  I was also extremely close to my Grandpa, closer than anyone else.  When he passed, both my father and I broke.  Since then, there's been a massive change in my dad.  He's become less explosive, more understandable, more caring, more supportive, and more loving.  We still had a couple hick ups and one did leave us not talking for a few months, but we always got over it.Things have been going really great for us in this last year and a bit.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year and a half ago and he's been doing his best to try and understand that and to understand that life is pretty fucking difficult for me to control sometimes.  He reads and watches documentaries about it and asks me all sorts of questions to help him understand.In May, he fucked his left knee and then snapped his right ankle.  Today is his first day back at work since May and he's only working a 4 hour shift, inputting information at a desk.  My dad's an electrician underground, but may never be able to go underground again.He was in a wheelchair for most of the summer and he lives at our cabin so basically, he couldn't do a damn thing for himself and nobody was around all day.  We didn't have tv or internet at the cabin, so he basically sat in silence all day, unable to even just go outside.  So every Wednesday on my way town from a mine site I go to on Wednesdays, I started stopping at the cabin to visit him.  We'd have a couple beer and talk for a few hours, then I'd go home.  I'd also show up every weekend and make sure everything was taken care of for him.  Minor renovations, hooking up our pump and all the waterlines, planting our bigass garden, mowing the lawn, getting the wood pile cleaned up and ready for more wood, dump runs, and absolutely anything else him or my mom needed.  It is insane how much he appreciates everything I've been doing for him.  I don't see it as a big deal because he's my dad.  This is what a son is supposed to do.  This is how I was taught to be.  But in my dad's eyes, and he's explained this to me a few times, is that he CAN'T do these things now.  He just can't.  And he hates asking for help and he hates watching people do his work and him not being able ot help at all.   But I would show up and sometimes bring a friend or two, and he didn't even have to ask.  I basically grew up at the cabin so I know how everything works and what needs to be done every season.My dad and I have grown closer than I could ever imagine us being.  He even vents to me and tells me shit he can't tell my mom because it would upset her.  He tells me all sorts of shit.  He gives me praise about what I'm doing and advice on what to do next.   Because he's learning so much about bipolar disorder, he's learned to watch for possible triggers and to watch my mood changes to try and catch an episode before it starts and he has, more than one, sat me down and said, "look, I've been noticing you've been acting a little funny lately," then tells me the things I've been doing and asks what I think and if I need any help.My dad's become my best friend.  I HATED him and who he was.  I promised I would never be like him.  The things he's said and done to me out of anger.  He doesn't even remember hitting me.  To this day, he denies it ever happened.  I can't stand talking about it because I know he hit me and I know he doesn't remember it.  Truth is, he was so mad that he simply doesn't remember.  When you're overwhelmed with emotion, shit gets fuzzy.   Regardless of that, it's in the past.  We've both grown a tremendous amount and I couldn't imagine this man not being in my life.  This last year has seen our relationship strengthen far more than I ever seen it possibly going and I am forever thankful for it.   [info] None [info] 1419442478

wtfgiraffe18 [info] Well I apologize if this came across as an argument because I didn't intend that at all. I'm well aware that there are people that don't "appear" to have autism. I consider myself to be very experienced in working with people with autism/ASD on all ends of the spectrum, for someone my age (21.)10 years old is extremely young to be diagnosed as bipolar II. If you don't mind me asking, how did that diagnosis come about?I wonder if there is some connection between bipolar disorder and autism/ASD. I've heard of quite a few people getting one diagnosis and switching to the other later. I've been diagnosed with bipolar (one doctor said it was bpI, another said bpII, another bpNOS so I don't know which one it is, if at all.) My mom has Bipolar II and ASD and my brother has ASD.

rusemaen [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar at a young age and was given some mood stabilizers and anti depressants to help cope with the issues I was having. The pills worked, but they also kept in a constant state of pilled out stoned 24 hours a day. After using for a year, I began to feel like my mind was slipping and I didn't like it, and I suspected I could deal without meds, being a bit older. My proudest moment is when I decided at the age of 13 to quit the medication secretly against my parents' wishes and risk becoming suicidal again because I thought I was going to lose my ability to think and become a burnout before I graduated high school. It took a lot of foresight for someone that young to make that choice and in retrospect it was one of the best decisions I ever made. [info] None [info] 1419613377
MuchoMaas49 [info] I've had this experience on a few drugs. Luckily my DMT experience was a happy one, but on the same note, I didn't want to eat meat for weeks after.I considered killing myself when I was on 10 hits of acid once. To truncate the story, which I've posted about in the past, I was incredibly overweight, probably about 450 pounds. I decided I'd rather go out in a selfish quick manner instead of eating myself to death and dying selfishly but without any sympathy.I'm still fat, but ever since then I've been diagnosed with bipolar II, moved to Seattle (from Utah), got pharmaceuticals that changed my life completely (PM me if you're aware that you're bipolar II or ADHD,) and I lost about 150 pounds. I'm climbing back up in weight, but that's because I'm in a relationship with a little lady that I just recently proposed to. I went from someone who thought taking 10 hits of acid once a month, a 25 year old virgin who never thought they were valued enough to be loved, to a pretty stable 28 year old who has one of the best possible living situations for what he's got.I've also had a threesome.

Coises [info] &gt;he can be the sweetest guy on Earth, but it's very easy to do something to upset his sensibilities and I get overwhelmed sometimes trying to talk to him because it can be impossible to reach him once he's upset about something.Well, aspies can get upset like anyone else, but there’s a sort of special aspie-type upset, too. You’d recognize it... it just doesn’t look or feel like the way a normal person gets upset. When that happens, there are three things to remember:* It’s not personal. Even if it seems to be in response to something you said or did, and even if he’s verbalizing “at” you, it’s not about you.* Don’t try to reach him (and especially don’t physically approach him unless you are *very clearly* invited). An aspie can and will calm himself down, but any additional outside input just makes that harder for him to accomplish. Give him space, don’t react, and let him find his own way back.* When he does come back, he’ll feel bad enough about what happened. The more you can treat it like it was no big deal, the more help you will be to him. (*Don’t* think you’re indulging or condoning “bad behavior.” It doesn’t work that way.)There is a dark side to this, though. *You* have to be strong and self-assured enough to handle this without it wearing on you and stressing you out beyond your own breaking point. Not everyone is up to it, and there’s no shame in that... it’s just a fact of life. He has his limitations, but you have yours, too. Give it a chance, but be prepared to accept reality if you discover that you just can’t do it.If you want, read some [information](http://snakedance.tumblr.com/post/26926395653/meltdowns-and-adult-aspergers-part-1)[about](http://snakedance.tumblr.com/post/27380864608/meltdowns-adult-aspergers-part-2) [meltdowns](http://snakedance.tumblr.com/post/27786575185/meltdowns-adult-aspergers-part-3) and see if that seems to fit what you are seeing.&gt;he got really agitated and told me to never ever compare him to autistic people, even though that was not what I did at all, that he's not autistic, and that he's had really bad experiences with thatAsperger Syndrome *is* an autism spectrum disorder. Full stop... there is no debate about that.&gt;I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder this year (have been receiving proper treatment though!)I’m thinking that means you’re seeing a mental health professional of some sort. Can you bring up this situation with him or her? You might be able to get advice better tailored to your own strengths and weaknesses.I keep getting the feeling there is something going on here that you probably don’t know about. OK, we have AS (maybe... the freakout over “autism” when pretty much every aspie knows that Asperger Syndrome is a form of autism troubles me). We have a drinking problem that he claims to be working on (maybe... one does not work on a drinking problem by getting drunk).Let me guess... he is adamant about working out his problems with alcohol and with AS on his own... just mentioning the idea of professional help is one of those things that will “upset his sensibilities”...?If my guess is wrong—and I hope it is!—encourage him to get help rather than tackle this on his own. If not, at least talk to your own therapist. [info] None [info] 1419845428
askmeifimapotato [info] Yeah, that sounds terrible! Tbh, I have been diagnosed with bipolar, and now that I've been through an extensive list of medications and therapy and working through things, I'm plenty stable, but I always worry when someone sees my meds (Effexor xr and Topamax) about how I'll be judged. My last Dr never had any qualms about any of my meds, even when I was heavily medicated, but I've had a few one-time visits with other Drs when I was strapped for money who tried to tell me that my mental health was the issue, and tried to change my meds, when I knew better. Now, I'm only changing because the plan I got through BCBS is an hmo, and there are literally zero family Drs on their provider list. It's all Drs of internal medicine at a couple different hospitals. I didn't have much choice. Even if I don't like him, there are only about 5 providers approved within a 30 mile radius. If I feel crappy, I'm not going to want to drive a half hour to the Dr. So, I'm pretty much stuck...so I'm hoping he's okay. If I don't like it at all, I may just have to pay a higher premium for a different policy in 2016. That, and I don't think my psychiatrist is in network either. I haven't been paying for it (County provider), so I'm hoping they'll work with me. Yes, post nasal drip is a huge issue, when I have it! I try to make sure I'm taking an antihistamine daily, since that helps.  [info] None [info] 1420340885
yankowitch [info] I don't have bipolar as part of my identity. As a woman, I identify most strongly with my identity in relation to others. I am a wife and mother. I am Canadian. I work with computers and I'm pretty smart. These are the things that are me, help draw a picture of what I'm like. I identify myself as disabled in diversity questionnaires but that's just so I can get accommodation and treatment,  a label only in relation to the medicolegal complex.Having bipolar is interesting but so was my accident and bursitis. Both give cognitive effects, the hip condition counterintuitively can affect the brain more due to the damaged proprioception and cognitive effects of pain. Although the experience of both "builds character" I choose to frame the experience just through the lens of suffering, recovery, chronic disease management,  etc. My feelings and behaviors are part of the experience, not part of my identity. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 10 years, it never made it into my identity. I guess I just look at identity politics differently. [info] None [info] 1420393344
DylsWorld [info] I saw a psychologist for about two years after I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I of course talked about how I smoked from time to time and the benefits and also side effects it caused me at the time. The one thing he never did was tell me to do it more or tell me to do it less/not at all. He left the decision up to me, and instead asked me questions and provoked my thoughts as to why I used it. I think this is the most important thing a good psychologist should do. A good psychologist should help YOU find out why YOU do the things you do. Psychologists aren't magical wizards. They do not know everything there is to know, they are just humans like the rest of us. The best psychologists don't inflict their personal beliefs onto their clients, they help their clients come to terms with their own beliefs. I think for her to give you an ultimatum like that is silly and if I were you I would switch to a different psychologist.  [info] None [info] 1420409349

pickledpeachcake [info] I had a seriously shit year in 2013. I was diagnosed with bipolar then terrible medication choices and I was just off the rails insane. While it was pretty awful I learnt a lot and I am much happier now than I ever have been. I have great friendships, I am doing well at at work/uni, travel. So.. * Don't sweat the small stuff. Only worry about things that are actually worth worrying about. * When someone hurts or upsets you mostly they are not being malicious or nasty they just didn't think. The world isn't out to get you and most people are pretty nice. * You can only control you and you should do this to the best of your ability. Be mindful and empathic but you can't control other people (refer to above)* How to get people to like you? Listen and just take a chance ask someone out for a coffee. Chances are they'll say yes. But just don't be desperate. This could be a separate point. Desperation is the biggest turn off in pretty much every aspect of life (romantically, friendship, work). * remember that you are a worth while person. Everyone has positive traits- everyone. * Be happy with who you are and find people who appreciate you for you and do the things you enjoy. Do you like knitting life size star wars figurines? Fuck it just do it. Extreme ironing your thing? Fuck it just do it. And just a little bit of faking :)  [info] None [info] 1421295596

courtney10 [info] When I was diagnosed with bipolar, everyone told me to stop drinking.  My doctors, my therapists, my mom, all of my bipolar and self-help books.  And I didn't listen.  I couldn't see myself as a sober person, it seemed so dull.  How would I have a social life?  Would anyone still ask me to hang out?  All of my friends were heavy drinkers, that's how we all socialized, how could I stop?  And besides, I love craft beer, wine, cocktails, drinking culture. Well, after about two years of rejecting sobriety, I realized that I had become an alcoholic after all.  I figured it out this last summer, and I battled most of the logical fallacies, excuses, and justifications for why I could drink once a week, one drink per day, just when I go out with friends, etc.  Moderating like that doesn't work for me, because I don't enjoy drinking a single drink.  When I drink, I want to drink until I don't feel my emotional pain anymore.  So I am officially three weeks sober, with many one or two week long streaks before this.  I've finally committed myself to the idea of being sober and it's going pretty well.  I did change which friends I hang out with.  I ended an enabling romantic relationship.  I go to meetings sometimes (SMART Recovery) and check in with my psychiatrist about drinking every week.  I've had to do a lot of work on my impulse control issues and not giving into cravings in general, not just with alcohol.  Every time I've tried to abstain it keeps getting easier.  But I stumbled A LOT when I was first coming to terms with being an alcoholic.  GOOD LUCK!   [info] None [info] 1421645492
withdelight [info] I have both. I was diagnosed with bipolar not long before I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's. Honestly, my diet needs some work so I really can't be of much help there...but I do take synthroid and cytomel for the thyroid, and wellbutrin, lamictal and cymbalta for the bipolar. I have a psychiatrist who deals with my psych meds and an endocrinologist who deals with the thyroid, but when I get labs for my thyroid they usually send the results to my psychiatrist as well to keep him in the loop. My labs have been consistently in a good range for several years now. As far as fatigue, I do have a lot of fatigue and always have, but since going on medication for my thyroid I've found the fatigue to be more related to my psych medication; for example, I was on seroquel for several years, which made me exhausted! So besides the thyroid, you may also want to do some research on whatever psych meds you're taking, in case that may be part of it.Oh, and I also take a multivitamin, plus fish oil for omega-3s, every day, per my last psychiatrist's recommendation.

8bitdeer [info] I'm a 21 year old asexual/panromantic woman.  I've known I've had a learning disability since I was about 6 years old when diagnosed with ADHD. Given that my mother herself has ADD, I was accepting to the fact that I was disabled for the most part, but I would still gauge myself on how well I stacked up with NT people and I was made fun of from time to time for my behaviors I used to "calm" myself and get rid of excess energy (such as touching my hair and my face a lot, shaking my legs, playing with my hands, getting up and walking around the classroom, etc). I was good at school, but totally awful at focusing on things that weren't stuff like art or computers. But for most of my childhood, being "random, hyper, and creative" was more of something I proudly used as an identifier than being "disabled".Then sophomore year of high school hit and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder NOS. I *really* resisted the diagnosis at first because: a. I was experiencing delusions that convinced me that everyone was out to get me and that I was justified in the manipulative and destructive actions I did to others and myself as a means of "self-preservation", and b. I didn't want to be "officially cr*zy". I had a LOT of internalized ableism issues and was terribly ashamed that I had a mood disorder until senior year. By my senior year of high school, I was more or less reclaiming the identifier "mentally ill" for myself after I had made reparations and apologies for my toxic behavior I did during my depressive psychosis episode and started to gain better coping skills that didn't involve me lashing out at people and manipulating them. I didn't know if I could reclaim the word "disabled", but I lost a lot of that old shame I had towards my bipolar disorder after a year of feeling shitty and isolated because of it. My main coping mechanism became using mathematics to distract myself from emotions I'd just have to "wait out" and it was really really effective.But after freshman year of college after realizing how absolutely difficult my ADHD and bipolar disorder combination was (which lead to me developing ED NOS - which I'm still struggling with), I started identifying as disabled. I realized that I could no longer put myself on the same "scale" so to speak as neurotypical people, and that I was not bad/weak for needing accommodations, although I'm still trying to overcome these remaining feelings that my ED centers around (it's a messy issue). I'm not afraid to say I'm disabled anymore, and I'm ***much*** more vocal in my support and activism for the rights and fair treatment of people with disability (but only really speaking for my lane). So yes- I started really accepting my "status" as disabled about 2-3 years ago. I'm glad that I did because it's now something I identify very strongly with. [info] None [info] 1422221693
whatahorriblestory [info] Ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 10 years ago in high school it has been a struggle.  I managed to hobble through school and university by making good use of my support network and coping strategies.  It was tough and took me a lot longer than it took everyone else, I struggled a lot but now...now I work as a Peer Specialist for a crisis mental health team.  I wouldn't have this position without the experience and lessons afforded to me by this diagnosis (or the diagnosis itself).Even with a bad hypomanic episode my first week on the job, knowing when to ask for help, finding that right medication combination and having the proper coping strategies and habits in place...It can be done.  I know it looks bad now, but you can get through this.  This disorder sucks a lot of the time, but it does have a lot to teach us about managing ourselves if we are willing to learn.

I'm no psychiatrist, but if you have a history of drug abuse, you might want to talk to one. They are incredibly helpful and will probably help you start to feel a lot better.I know what you mean when you say you don't want to kill yourself, but you want to stop existing. The thought used to cross my mind all the time before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I'd close my eyes and think "Wouldn't it be nice to just fade out? Just stop... existing."

It's shitty when you're in a depressive phase and you think "welp this sucks everything sucks forever nothing is ever going to be good again." It's shitty when you're in between and you think "I HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY but everything sucks and I don't wanna do anything."I don't tell people I'm bipolar. My husband actually has it as well, but he is open about it. More than once, when he told someone, they replied with "so are you going to murder me?" [info] None [info] 1422761419
Ib_dI [info] Not sure yet, to be honest. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a couple of weeks ago and the doc added the lamotrigine. Feeling very drowsy a lot of the time and I'm sleeping like a corpse but with mad vivid dreams.Mood-wise I seem to be quite stable but still able to tap into that manic energy, which is pretty awesome. It's a wee bit like having a really mild super-power actually. [info] None [info] 1422765210
SpreadableDuckbutter [info] Get professional help.  The more you isolate yourself, the worse your condition will get, especially since a big portion of your happiness is stemming from how you perceive others to view you.  Talk to a mental health professional at your school.  Even as terrible as our system is here in the US, most colleges will at least provide you with some sort of therapy, even if it is an intern accumulating hours for their certification.  If you try to talk to anyone else about how you're feeling, you'll most likely get the same reaction.  I only speak from experience.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and borderline personality three years ago, and everyone treated me the same way they treated you.  Most people told me I was making it up or using it as an excuse.  It's just going to take time, but don't isolate yourself.  Just surround yourself with the right kind of people.  There are people who care and want you to feel better, even if they're a continent away on a computer screen.  If nothing else, I care and I understand.  And, I know it's hard sometimes, but thank you for surviving.  Please don't end it.  It will get better.  I promise.  Don't give up. [info] None [info] 1422784197

unique616 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and to keep myself from doing anything stupid, I compare my normal self (before I had it - age 25) to what I'm like now (age 26), and if the emotion I'm feeling now doesn't match up to how I would've acted before I had it, then I refuse to feel or at least refuse to act on the new emotion because I know it's fake.For example, a bipolar issue I've heard in group therapy a couple times is constantly wanting to break up and get back together with your boyfriend. You hit the depressed lows and think you're a bad person and that they deserve someone better, but when you get back to the normal, middle range, you don't feel that way any more so you get back together, and the cycle repeats.If that ever happened to me, I would suppress or keep the depressed wanting to break up feelings a secret, but I've been told that what I'm doing it wrong, and that all of the feelings I have a real and I should express them, but I don't really understand why. All it will do is ruin my life, right? Please explain why it's a bad choice. [info] None [info] 1423232960
mremaids [info] Saddest part about my life is that I'm not successful. I grew up with immature addicts for parents, with an older brother and younger brother. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, aged out (18) of foster care which allowed me to go to community college for free and get a monthly payment of $400. I went to college, after graduating high school early in Dec., and was not prepared, dropped out two weeks before finals. I tried the fall semester after that, and dropped out even earlier. I was supposed to have this success story, become a published writer, but right now I'm an unemployed 19 year old, living with her grandmother. And I married my high school sweetheart.

owlcandle [info] I still do. I mistyped as INTJ for AGES when I was younger, in my teens... then ENTP when I was in early college. The last year, I was constantly mistyped as NFP.I'm ESTJ. Like... being honest with myself and really getting down to the nitty-gritty of my personality has been hard because I was diagnosed with bipolar 5 years ago. It's hard to separate what's 'you' and what's you reacting to things a certain way because of a disorder. Now that I've been on meds a long time, it's a lot easier to narrow down types.At least NFP and STJ share all the same functions? People always assume that I'm too lackadaisical/too Fi-heavy to be STJ but really I'm just lackadaisical because I've already thought about every issue and planned/prepared for it most times lol [info] ESTJ [info] 1423402451
purpleky [info] Pot &amp; kettle: I always maintained that I couldn't be friends or hold relationships (with family) with bipolar people because they were crazy and untrustworthy.

Torreau [info] All forms of hormonal birth control destroyed my drive and eventually over the course of about 7-8 years it just made me off-my-rocker crazy; we're talking white hot rage over stupid things, like that he didn't notice the floor needed to be swept or that he went out for a drink with friends after work.I know that this is somewhat common, however in my case it wound up being a sign of something more, and the fact that you mention mood issues sets off alarm bells for me. When I went off the hormones I felt better for quite a while but then my moods started to go nuts again and I realized that the birth control just amplified what I would have gone through anyway. For what it's worth, I was also super horny when not on it.I no longer take hormones because of what they did to my moods, and just over a year ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.I am not at all saying you're bipolar, just saying I'm seeing some similarities in your story.

charms_ [info] I relate SO much. My parents (who are self-proclaimed mystics) have always believed in extraterrestrial life, psychic experiences, visions, spiritual warfare, etc. When I was eleven, I noticed that I saw things and heard voices, but I never brought it up to anyone because I honestly didn't really think it was that abnormal. My explanation was that I was born partially in another dimension, and that's why I could perceive things others could not. My parents have seen me mildly psychotic, and didn't think it was weird at all. I think that's why I went undiagnosed for so long. That, and the fact that I was homeschooled and we moved every couple years. I just recently told them that I was diagnosed with bipolar and my dad mentioned that it probably wasn't bipolar, but just a supernatural connection to the emotions around me that I've always had. When I told him about my psychotic experiences (especially the one where I thought aliens were outside my window waiting for me to get close so they could phase through and grab me), they didn't even flinch...I think that's why I had such an intense reaction to my diagnosis... I felt like my world was being shattered. Everything I thought was "normal" and "real" was exposed to be totally crazy!Thank you for posting this! I feel a little less alone.

yesdnil5 [info] oh my god, I totally understand.  My whole life I used to be socially anxious.  I would second guess everything I said and could barely talk without analyzing every thought and how people interacted with me.  I didn't have very many friends and was kind of labeled as a bitch or whatever because of how of how cold I was to people or how I treated everyone like shit because I thought everyone hated me and I treated them like they did. I was diagnosed with bipolar II last year and started different medication.  Now it's like my whole life has turned around.  There are days where, like how you described, I have no filter.  As soon as I think I should do something or say something, I'm already doing it.  It caused some awkward situations but I found myself making so many friends (at least meeting a lot of people) and was labeled fun and social for the first time in my entire life.  The other days, I do the same stuff but it's kind of forced.  I don't think too much about what I say and do and it's definitely made my life fun but it had also alienated some people.  I'm in the mindset right now that everyone hates me so that social anxious stuff still happens, but I know when I get into work tomorrow, I'll still act the same way.  Which could be good but could be bad.I'm going to start working on finding a middle ground.  Some things need to be analyzed.  Not everyone cares about my dog or the stupid pointless stories of my morning.  I've also followed people around just talking to them because they seem kind of interested and I want to hear myself talk.  Some people are okay with that, but it doesn't make it socially appropiate.Sorry for the rant!  I guess I'm saying that those days are awesome sometimes and to try to incorporate them into your day to day life (easier said than done) but at the same time it can kind of get you in a bit of social trouble.

flatwhiteandcakepop [info] Thanks for responding Compass_One.What scares me the most about pursuing the surgical route is the 12+ years of schooling/training. The hefty price too. And from my parents... they try to sway me from it because of my personal medical past. It's kind of a long story but I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1. It's disheartening to have to deal with this mental disorder; I hallucinate and go through psychosis if I'm not well. That's why my parents want me to seek a different career. They urge me to go into accounting (currently in business school). It's another reason why I'm taking a gap year from school just to figure out how to deal with my illness and plan my years ahead. What you want in a surgeon is to be mentally sound, ready to deal with various patients and pressure. But if money, time, and my flaw weren’t a factor, I would love to pursue a career in surgery. Though I'm a bit shaky with meds, my manual dexterity is still there. Making a difference in someone’s life would be meaningful.  [info] None [info] 1424859754
mrscarpenter25 [info] Hi there ,I know your looking for an answer from a specific type of people , but I felt I needed to give my advice about the medicine from my point of view. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1. My psychiatrist prescribed me zoft ( the generic brand sertraline ) once a day and another antipsychotic rispodone once ever evening. It took a couple months for me to finally start feeling happy (peaceful) again. I never once decided not to take my medicine at will (once or twice I would forget if I had a busy morning) . The biggest advice and fact you should know is if you are not getting your proper sleep , you medicine will not work . You must let your doctor know your sleep amount and if your having issues. There is help and it does take time and patients . I hope it gets better for you !  [info] None [info] 1424881660
ClassiestBondGirl311 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II when I was about 15-16 (teenage years are a bit blurry for me). I was very lucky and found a combination that worked for me for a VERY long time. I didn't have to adjust my medications until just last year, so 11-12 years (and about 4 years ago was able to be weaned off a couple I no longer needed). Now I found another combination that works absolutely great. Think of it this way: the reason you haven't had a depressive episode in so long is BECAUSE of this medicine. I know it's hard to think like that when you don't always see immediate side effects if you forget your medicine, but I guarantee you the medicine has been working in your favor for a long time - and that's great!If you're having suicidal ideation, even if it's momentary and fleeting, just keep an eye on yourself. Try to pay attention to your behaviors, or ask a trusted friend or family member to keep an eye out. I know I can always count on my mom to tell me when she thinks something might be up. Before you think of changing your medication in any way, consult a doctor.It sucks, I'll probably be on medication for the rest of my life due to some stupid chemical imbalance in my brain. But the medication works and makes me feel like my REAL self, so I'm going to take them as along as I need them. [info] None [info] 1424882769

atsiday [info] Six months ago, I got very very drunk and slept with my married boss. He's rapid cycling bipolar and it was clearly not his first or last affair, but the entire five weeks or so messed me up real good and ended with him giving me his psychiatrist's card. I was diagnosed with bipolar II shortly after and I've spent six months trying to figure that out and get properly medicated. My life is really weird and I've made a lot of weird choices, only some of which are related to my bipolar.

seeking_freedom [info] I am writing this post based on my own experience and acknowledging that everyone's mind and situation are different. Hopefully some of this turns out to be helpful for you, but always defer to your doctor. I was diagnosed with bipolar type II 6 years ago, and your post resonates strongly with me. Moving out of my parents' was the best decision I could've made for my mental health, because it removed so many triggers and negative experiences from my day-to-day life. Believe me, I know it's hard -- but it does get better. It doesn't ever go away completely, but you get better at knowing yourself and managing your symptoms so they don't spiral out of control (or at least, you know when to call for help). I've learned to recognize and validate my feelings, even when my logical mind knows they're irrational. For example, I might wake up feeling utterly depressed for no reason. So rather than beat myself up for not being happy, I'll think to myself, "All right, I am feeling depressed this morning. That is ok. Today is a down day. I'll make myself a hot tea to take to work, and maybe later have a relaxing bubble bath. Everything is ok. I have shelter, I have food and creature comforts, I have people who love me. Even though I feel very down, things are going to feel better eventually." Obviously when the depressed mood has a specific, stressful trigger, things work a little bit differently. And sometimes I've had to call into work "sick" to get a recovery day (use sparingly). But for most days when your mood just decides to act up on its own, positive self-talk and little self-indulgences do uplift :) My best advice? If you have a medication prescription, take it as consistently as possible, even if you feel like you don't need it. Try to eat a steady diet of good nutritional foods, and try to stick to a sleep schedule. Food &amp; sleep make a huge difference for me, but being bipolar means it's hard to control impulses and overcome insomnia. Some days will be easier than others, for sure, but striving for a schedule definitely helps. I wish you the absolute best on your recovery journey.  [info] None [info] 1425505693

adiposehysteria [info] The good - I was able to remember pretty much everything to a kinda photographic memory extent when I was younger. I barely had to study until I was well into law school and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given medication for it. I even had one class that I never went to in college. I would buy the notes in the copy center the afternoon before, read them once, take the test and score an A. Mostly now I can ramble on about weird shit and beat people at Quiz Up. The bad - That pesky bipolar/crazy thing that is now treatment resistant. Also, my husband and I can't have kids. Sometimes we care, but mostly we don't. The ugly - I pretty much have no friends. I don't even have a Facebook account anymore, I deleted it over the holidays because it was driving me crazy. Not a ha ha crazy, but a "I don't think I'm getting out of bed this month crazy".

izModar [info] But as you mentioned: teenagers, hormones, yadda yadda yadda.I've seen kids and have been a kid who were victims of bullying. From personal experience, I'd say this has been building up for some time. One guy who had pretty much bullied me from kindergarten to 6th grade. The reason he stopped in 6th grade: I did something about it. I let him have some of what he was dishing out to me. Everyone in the class saw, even the teacher. Didn't get in trouble, and he sure as hell stopped dicking with me. Hell, I gave him a glance when he was pestering other kids and he stopped when he saw me staring right at him. He even started sticking up for me when someone else tried to dick with me.When I was a sophomore in high school, an even more hellish asshole started bullying me. He would steal my wallet and the money I had. I bought one of those wallets with a chain. He ripped it off of my belt-loop. I found an actual chain and used it as a belt. Got chewed out by the principal for bringing a "weapon." When I explained why I had it, I got, "[dude] is a nice kid with good grades. I doubt he's bullying you." One day he came up and shoved my head straight into a locker. This was only days after I got a concussion from hitting my head against a locker above mine by accident (our lockers were complete shit. They wouldn't stay closed or lock if they did close.) That's when the bully from the previous paragraph stepped in and had him back off. After that I started having violent fits of rage and punched the crap out of lockers, yelled at people for no reason. Some other dicks who bullied me ended up apologizing to me. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar II two years into college. Go figure.TL;DR: Got bullied, got to the point where I couldn't take it any longer. [info] None [info] 1426234875
moosaidthegoat [info] When I was 18, I was diagnosed with bipolar and given mood stabilizers. My boyfriend at the time did not like it and did not want me on them.

pumasocks [info] I'll share my experiences with suicide.  When I was 7, I was playing outside and looking in the basement window I saw my 18 year old brother with a big knife on his wrist.  I ran in the house and told my parents, who stopped him from slitting his wrists.  Several months went by and my brother got really depressed again.  Now it was winter and we lived near a river.  He was sobbing, and saying how he wanted to end his life.  He said he was going to jump in the river and die.  He ran out the door towards the river.  I grabbed my dog and ran after him.  We caught up to him before he made it there, and I begged him not to do it.  The next day my parents decided to take him to a mental hospital.  While in the car at a red light, he opened the door and bolted. This time my parents chased after him and convinced him to come back.  He spent a few days at the hospital, and was diagnosed with bipolar.  After that to my knowledge, he never made any more attempts.  He spent years trying different medication, and today he is mostly stable.At 12 years old my grandma died due to cancer.  I didn't process it well for many years.  I didn't truly mourn for her until I was around 16, and understood death better.  By my freshman year things really changed for me, and I started to act and feel differently.  In my junior year these changes got really bad.  At school I was extremely happy, and acting very strange.  At night I sat in my room in the dark with just a candle, writing poetry and sobbing.  I would get so upset I would hyper ventilate.  This is when I started contemplating suicide. It became almost an obsessive thing, while driving I would think about driving into a tree, or picture myself hanging from the branches.  I had access to guns, but didn't want to leave a mess.Going from a manic to severely depressed mood in a single day really took a toll on me, and I told my parents.  I went to my doctor, and he refereed me to his brother's psychiatrist.  I was diagnosed with Type I, rapid cycling bipolar.  Type I is where you hallucinate, and I certainly did that as well.I took way too much medication though, he started me off with 900mg/day of serroquel (sp?), and a couple hundred mg of lamictal.  You can skip this last part if you're offended by people talking about God, but I can't leave this part of my story out.I took various levels of this medication for about 3 years, but I still struggled with the ups and downs.  It was incredibly difficult on my relationship with my future wife.  She prayed during those 3 years, and I started to pray out of desperation.  At this point in my life I wouldn't say I had a great relationship with God.  I was casual, more agnostic than anything.  I was desperate though, and prayed in sincerity.  Call this a hallucination if you will, but one day I prayed that God would take this away from me, and there was a spontaneous thought much different than my own "sound" that said, "I will be your medication".  I figured out that this meant to stop being casual, and to actively pursue God.  The next day I stopped my medication, partially because I was almost out of meds, and my doctor was on a month long vacation.  I listened to worship music, read the Bible, and went to church.  The strange thing is I never noticed a difference, as if I was still taking the meds.  It's now been about 3 years, and I haven't ever taken any medication.  I have noticed though, if I get busy with life and don't pursue God, that I start feeling a little depressed again.  When I feel that way I know what I got to do, and every single time it's faded away.  I'm sure people will be skeptical about this, or think of some sort of scientific explanation, but this is what has worked for me.  The thing to remember about this though, is that I have rapid cycling bipolar.  While other types can go years without an episode, I never went more than a day without a full cycle.tl;dr  My brother and I both have bipolar, I helped stop his suicide attempts twice. I was diagnosed with bipolar later, struggled with it, and God became my medicine.  I rarely ever have any sort of symptoms. [info] None [info] 1427029465
decide [info] &gt; This is a slight x-post from /r/Entrepreneur just some of the content is adjusted to better suit this subreddit.5 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Meds, therapy, family support, exercise and improving my self-awareness really helped my successful recovery. It’s what inspired me to start working on Stigma.I spent 1000 hours teaching myself to develop iOS apps with no prior coding experience. To do this, I took two free online Stanford CS courses: 106a &amp; 193p (and a TON of help from /r/iOSProgramming). It took me two months to learn how to build apps and four to build this which consisted with 2 months of testing and iterations. I'm excited to launch today!**What is Stigma?**Stigma (www.getstigma.com ) is a micro journaling app that helps you be happier and improve your self-awareness. Stigma visualizes your journal/life in beautiful word-clouds. We also measure your mood trends. We’re Fitbit for your brain. Around 20% of people that download the app still use it every day even after using it for sixty days. There is also a lot of scientific research proving how journaling makes us happier with a variety of other benefits.We got a really awesome one minute video commercial done.

anonwasawoman [info] I was diagnosed with an eating disorder (a type of anorexia) three or four years after I was diagnosed with bipolar, but I'd been living with it for about five years by then. I agree with you, my bipolar definitely fed into the eating disorder. I've been in recovery for about nine months now, but every day is still a freaking struggle. It's really tough to get yourself to eat when you're still dealing with all the bipolar nonsense. Kind of nice to see I'm not alone in that, though. [info] None [info] 1427663263

bipolarcarebear [info] Oh fuck, don't even bring this up. I had a smile that would make the joker feel jealous before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It was so bad I had complete strangers whispering about how much I smiled. I heard about how I must be on meds.

dialogics [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2 and have experienced the shifts in self-confidence like what you describe. It's played out mostly in my career; I can look over my career history and see the peaks and valleys of bipolar influences - professional positions in my field when elevated and hiding-behind-the-scenes labouring jobs when low. It's good to start exploring things now, at a younger age, so that if you do fall somewhere on the bipolar spectrum you can address it and potentially ward off or at least minimize the periods of low self-confidence and other effects. I'm 46 and am just now starting to get things under control with medication. Good luck to you and if you can, I'd recommend seeing a psychiatrist for a diagnosis and if warranted, treatment.

misanthropicusername [info] Tips on how to deal? That's tricky. I guess some background on where I'm coming from.I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 15 years ago. I spent most of that time completely unmedicated. When I went to college, I tried "hacking" my bipolar like you're doing. It worked in the short term, I got a lot of epic work done. I'd deliberately induce mania with, e.g., sleep deprivation and just ride it. But the crashes were pretty bad. And I think I'm proof of the kindling hypothesis, which is roughly that repeated episodes make bipolar worse. (I'm now bipolar NOS with psychosis and mixed episodes, neither of which I used to get.) It also spun out of control easily and I failed to get work done, getting easily sidetracked by things like partying.If you don't have medication, I'd recommend you don't try to induce mania and try to do what little you can to take control of it. Take benadryl if you have to to sleep. (Warning: if you're not in the US or Canada, benadryl might not work - it's a different, non-drowsy drug in the UK and EU. So you'd have to find something else.) If you are manic anyway, don't feel too bad, it happens. And if you're productive, great. Taking care of that productivity is probably the least bad way to approach it. Just don't get addicted to it.Anyway, I've been medicated since August 2012 finally, and it's been a godsend. I'd had a lot of false starts with meds that were bad for me in the interim, but once I got on something good I've only had a handful of episodes since then (and only 1 since starting HRT, on account of losing my antidepressant). I'm rapid cycling, so that's saying something.You're not insane, just less stable than other people. I know it can feel like insanity sometimes, and maybe you are temporarily if you get psychosis, but it doesn't own you on the whole. Episodes may take control of your life temporarily, but they're transient.If you ever want to talk about it, feel free to PM me. And good luck. I know you're in a rough spot and could use it.

thisisnotsarah [info] This story sounds all too familiar. Your perspective as a family member of something similar is helpful. It's gotten a little better recently, but I used to get so angry when she would be calm and optimistic. I couldn't see the world that way. I couldn't understand her positive perspective, just like she didn't quite understand my pessimistic outlook. She was always looking for possible solutions and I was always shooting them right down.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a little over two years ago and my doctors and I are still working to figure out what works best for me. It's a difficult disease that is irrational by nature. It's explosive, self destructive, selfish, occasionally fun, and generally difficult to treat. I know she struggled a little at first with accepting the diagnosis and the fact that she had a daughter who has a lifetime illness. She's done so much research and I know she worries because she knows how complicated the disease can be over the course of a lifetime.I know this is irrational, but I feel that there are so many other young adults out there who actually deserve a great mother like her. Who would treat her better than I do. Who would be better daughters than I am. Another piece I struggle with is that I can know that my emotions are irrational and still not be able to change my thinking, which is something I am working on with my therapist.

rylinn [info] I just found this sub! I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the transplant center I was working with was very hesitant to let me donate. Granted, I was not medicated at the time, relying solely on more holistic treatment. After four months of meeting weekly with a psychiatrist and his assistants, and the psych office communicating regularly with the transplant office, I was finally cleared to donate. (I'm almost three weeks post transplant!!!)Their concern was more about me having an episode right after the surgery, as it is a major stressor and could be triggering. They wanted me to have the medication as a safety net so my recovery went more smoothly.  [info] None [info] 1429551129
RENDMC [info] I wish I could :(I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teenager, and although a lot of that angst I was feeling at 17 has been alleviated, I am still sick and I probably always will be. I'm not saying this will be your situation, but this is a possibility. If it is, though. You'll still be okay. You get better at managing stuff with time. Also -- there is no final road to "happy." Life is full of ups and downs and it sucks but as you grow, your capacity to handle these things will get better! Here's what you have to look forward to: when you're an adult, you have a lot more agency over the situations you put yourself in. If there are specific situations that are triggering you or making you upset, you have a bit more freedom to get yourself out and do what's right for you. When you get older, you get to kind of make your own circle or your own family based on what you need. Being a teen sucks. You're constantly learning really hard life lessons and experiencing new types of hurts that you're not 100% emotionally ready for or capable of handling. I empathize with you, because I was a total mess at 17. Just remember that you're still evolving and that the situation you're in will change. Your 20s will be full of lessons too (although a different kind.) That can also be hard for some people, but keep in mind that every tough thing you experience is about building the best you possible, and that comes with some bumps in the road. Good luck, hang in there, take care of yourself, maybe talk to your parents and doctor about how you're feeling and make good use of your high school counsellor!  [info] None [info] 1429609457
TheLoneGreyWolf [info] Hi Doc!   I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it runs in my family. I recently learned that bipolar manias, especially rage, destroy grey matter of the brain in almost the exact same way that a seizure does. I've also had months where my sleep cycle is ~ 34 hours awake, then ten hours of sleep. That is supposed to be terrible for the brain too.  I've since learned ways to help sleep become more natural, but I wonder about how much damage has been done and if it is permanent. Can my brain heal??  If there is anything else you would like to say about bipolar disorder, I would love to hear it. It's really interesting! [info] None [info] 1429725402
katcalling [info] Insomnia. Some of the earliest memories I have of my life is of nights I couldn't fucking sleep. As I got older it got worse.

Every single day I yawn hundreds of times and I'm worn out constantly. I've had bosses and college professors call me out on it because they thought it was rude of me to yawn when they are interacting with me but I just can't help it.

shitjoesays [info] My ex committed suicide in front of me in September 2007. I didn't see your previous post (wasn't horribly active on reddit at the time), but I'd like to share my experience with you if you don't mind. Sorry in advance for the wall of text.I was a mess after. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around the same time, so I was put on medication. It made me numb. My mom said she didn't see her daughter anymore, I was a shell of my former self. I stopped going to church and stopped answering phone calls and text messages from my friends and family. I dropped out of school and pretty much fell off the face of the planet for a few months. I felt that his suicide was my fault (didn't help that he and a few of our mutual friends felt the same way). We'd been together for 2 1/2 years and had broken up only a few months before he committed suicide. I thought I was going to marry him, we'd started planning and everything. And he took that from me in the blink of an eye. He even told me when he called me to come over thay night that he wanted to talk about getting back together. I was (obviously) foolish enough to believe him, mostly because I was still in love with him. He used my feelings for him against me, much like he had for most of our relationship. He was never wrong, and I was never right. My feelings were regularly dismissed or even made fun of for the last year of our relationship. Our "friends" regularly told me I needed to back off and give him space. In hindsight I understand, but at the time I was just confused and upset. No, I wasn't perfect in our relationship (far from it actually), but he made me feel even more crazy than I actually was, and that wasn't okay. I tell you all this so you can understand what happened in the months after his suicide.I started using again in the days after his suicide to escape the reality of what I was feeling. It was much easier to just forget I even had emotions rather than actually deal with them. I checked myself into rehab (again) before I had to have my parents or roommates do it for me.I couldn't go to his funeral. His mom asked me to come but I just couldn't trust myself in that situation. Not to mention the fact that I had actually seen him die, had held him as the life left his body. It took three rather large police officers to pull me away from him. I kept telling myself that he was going to wake up, that the bullet hadn't actually gone in and he was just unconscious from the shock. I blacked out when I saw the coroner, and the next thing I remember is waking up in my old dealer's house three days later. I don't know how they even let me go, but apparently they did. For a solid year after I believed what he told me. It was my fault he committed suicide. It didn't matter that he was sleeping with not only both of my best friends, but his boyfriend as well. In the days after his suicide they found he was HIV positive. He came from an extremely religious family, and if they had found out they would have disowned him. To this day I don't know if his parents even know. I was lucky that he had told me he was saving himself for marriage so I wasn't exposed, but both of our friends and his boyfriend tested positive a few months after. I couldn't care less about our friends, they got everything they had coming to them. But his boyfriend was innocent.  He had no idea any of us even existed. And his life was dramatically altered because of my ex's selfishness.After that year, I suddenly got really angry. I would lash out at anyone I felt had disrespected me, and I did a complete 180 on how I felt about his suicide. I went from blaming myself to hating my ex. I truly believed that he could have changed his circumstances,  and therefore he was incredibly selfish for doing what he did. It wasn't until I met my now husband in May 2009 that I really started to heal, to forgive my ex. He was sick, and for whatever reason he couldn't reach out for the help he needed. And I didn't see the warning signs, no one did. He had just gotten a promotion at work and moved into a much nicer apartment in a better neighborhood. He hid it very well, and I was too wrapped up in my own head to even realize there was a problem. If you've made it this far, thank you. If not, I'll put a TL; DR at the end. I told you all this because I want you to realize you're not alone. And if you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to pm me.TL; DR my ex committed suicide right in front of me. In the days after his suicide I found out he was sleeping with three different people, two of them my former best friends. [info] None [info] 1430836482
bipolarcarebear [info] This is where the lines get blurred. To many people, "mental health" and "mental illness" are one and the same. You'll even see this when groups try to advocate for awareness. I feel it's like comparing having a cold to having cancer. I have no doubt that one in four people will experience some kind of mental health crisis at some point in their life, but mental illness isn't an experience, it's a lifelong condition we haven't found a cure for yet. There are effective treatments that often help, but there's no magical pill to make a mental illness go away in spite of what most people have been led to believe. In my own case, I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I've been struggling with it my entire life. The amount of ignorance I run into even when people are trying to be helpful is mind boggling. They haven't a clue what the condition really means. I mean, it would all go away if you took your pills, right? Only it doesn't. It only tones some of it down. On top of that, even if everybody somehow understood what it was like, many of us have co-morbid conditions. You could literally know ten people with bipolar disorder and not a single one of them would be the same.Yeah sure, we might all have some similar symptoms, but one of us might be a compulsive liar while manic and delusional, another might be a sex addict, and another a vicious drunk. To the outside world it looks like a bunch of people making poor decisions without taking any responsibility for their lives. On the inside, it's like being in the passenger seat of a race car. You're not the one driving, and the driver can't really hear a fucking thing you're saying. You're yelling "Stop!" and they're pushing the pedal to the metal. It all leads to a really frustrating situation where everybody you know starts to think that all you're doing is making excuses unless you're so far gone that they just feel sorry for you. You're either a piece of shit human being, or somebody to pity. I'm sorry, if that's a bit of a rant. I've been hypomanic for weeks and while it feels fucking fantastic I have a hard time keeping my mouth shut.  [info] None [info] 1430851379
SnowAndInk [info] I used to feel this way. I was always the one sticking my neck out for people, helping them through hard times, attempting to nurture while receiving nothing in return. It used to bother me. Over the years, I learned some things:1) Expect nothing from others. You already know you interpret the world differently than most. It's unfair to expect change from others. Do what feels right, help when you want, but remember: sometimes people will take advantage of you. It's unavoidable. The most you can do is accept your plight and do what feels right.2) Seek a therapist. I was angry, depressed, downtrodden, and angry for YEARS. After extensive sessions over a long period of time, I was diagnosed with bipolar. Since being on medication I've noticed an **extreme** change in my world view. You may or may not have some sort of chemical imbalance, the least you can do is look into it. If there is an imbalance in you brain chemicals, it can be corrected.3) Accept yourself. You are you and you are wonderful. It's hard to be an idealist. I understand that completely. You are not stupid or delusional. It's the burden of the INFP to see the underlying woes of the world. 4) Take your own advice: Do loosen up a little :) The night is dark and full of terrors, Jane Snow. But this shouldn't stop you from seeking the light. You don't have to throw yourself into bars and sleep around, but look at those people who do: They dance and don't care and have sex and party without thinking. Sometimes, I like to watch these people from a distance. I've noticed most seem blank and forward and happy and I have several friends who are exactly the type. They wear stupid hats and sleeveless "Tapout" shirts or play the prep look. However, the other day, one of these people, a friend of mine for many years now, broke down in front of me crying. He told me "Sometimes I feel like you're my only true friend, Inky." Everyone is scared, and everyone is lonely. As an INFP, you have the gift of seeing through others. Use it. You'd be surprised at how many people really do value sincerity over fluff and fun (The best people always do.)

zkushlvn [info] I have this problem and it is by far my worst enemy.  Until I was diagnosed with bipolar I just thought I was a sex addict.  I mean come on, sex with random people, whether meeting them at a bar or online frequently.  I could not tell you the number of sexual partners I have had and I don't want to know.  Even medicated it is still something I struggle with and given my preferred sexual style (Dom/sub) it is even harder since it seems like a double ended sword for me of conquest and satisfaction through sex alone.  I always hated myself later on but could not and still cannot stop.  I have been somewhat successful lately but still I crave it.  While medicated I am able to keep to porn and just reading/fantasizing but it is still a thorn in the side I am unable to keep in check.  For resisting, if I can, I have a support person I can call.  My wife is amazing and I am able to talk to her about it.  It is weird to tell your wife you are craving sex and want to fuck each woman you see etc etc but being able to talk about it and know that she will relieve my issue later that day is such a weight off the shoulders.  I wish I could be more helpful for ideas but others have said what else works.  Channeling your energy to something else which takes time.  Mostly is writing my ideas down if I have nothing else.  It clears the mind, even if it is an hour session or just sexual babble that doesn't make sense but hey it kept me from cheating on my wife or fucking some random person.

S0TM [info] I guess this really wasn't her fault but she was born.Seriously. As soon as my sister was born she got the attention (which I realize happens because she's the new born, but attention should eventually fall back into equality.) The problem is, is that the attention never went anywhere except to her. She would always be in trouble at school, or in regular life. ie: Police and drug troubles. As a child attention from your parents is important in my eyes but not so much as an adult. Because of this I feel as if I raised myself as in having to do everything for myself as a young kid. Which honestly has made me who I am today and the reason I'm able to be so independent but on the flip side it really fucked me up to the point where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder freshman year. To this day I don't speak with my sister and honestly don't plan to in the future. She's still living at home with my parents and I can see the stress she causes them but there's not much I can do about it because I'm so far from home. I can sincerely say I resent my sister for turning out to be who she has become. A young drug abusing, reckless and inconsiderate teenager.  [info] None [info] 1431591951

From then on I was just the tall crazy white girl in a Hispanic school. Things got worse from then. I had all my credits to graduate by my junior year, and had already been accepted into an art institute, but they refused to let me out early. Became severely depressed and did hard drugs and drank heavily my senior year until I found out I was pregnant. I had worked so hard to get the fuck out of there early to get away from the bullying and drama bullshit, I was crushed. It changed my whole life.

zelkovafr [info] A few years back, I had a relationship. It was a bit on/off because we were both a little crazy, but we worked well together. At some point, she started doing better, and I started being a bit of a dick. Things just kind of fell apart. From there, I was diagnosed with bipolar. It was pretty young to be diagnosed, so as it's fleshed itself out, I've been able to keep somewhat of a handle on it - enough to keep me from ruining my (professional) life. I suspect it played a role in ruining that relationship, but it's a bunch of pointless what-if-maybe bullshit-hole. Had a rebound relationship with a girl where we were pretty much just using each other to advance socially - it worked pretty well, but we kind of lied to ourselves that there was something happening. About 5 months in, I did a cost/benefit analysis - by breaking up with her, I would lose physical affection, by staying with her, I would lost nothing. 6 months in she told me it wasn't working, and I basically said that yes it is. Ironically, we became closer as friends than we ever were when we were together.From there, I had a steady decline over a few years where all of my friends (especially her) betrayed me or left me behind when things were rough. Basically, shit was BAD. I began to recover about a year ago, by realizing that a support network, for me, was guaranteed to fail and the only person I could rely on was myself. While this ultimately not only allowed me to be happy and functional again, but was the ONLY way for that to happen, it gave me some profound fucking trust issues that pervade every relationship I have. No one knows I'm bipolar, that I (used to) SH, that I did martial arts for 13 years, or really anything else that is at all possible to hide.I am unable to rely on other people. I'm not jealous, because I anticipate people's failures from the start. I don't talk about my feelings to anyone because I can't. I just can't. I can't imagine being happy with someone else. When I think about that old relationship - the one where I was genuinely happy - I can't imagine being that close to anyone, with who I currently am. I don't avoid contact, I just avoid my feelings as much as I can and when that fails, lie my ass off. I can't do anything else. Even sadder, if this wasn't true, I couldn't function.The weird thing is, by pretending to be okay, and by hiding, and by lying, I've gotten some of the best friends I've had in my life. I don't trust them as I should, but I just can't. I think in a few months, one of them will learn that I SH, my roommate for next year. Things can move forward, trust can come back, but it takes time, and sometimes things get worse before they get better. [info] 20 m started Feb 2014 / clean since Mar 2015 [info] 1432069014
rivanne [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar in January and dropped out of college. But I also have responded very well to treatment, (officially) moved in with my boyfriend and--best of all--got engaged! I'm going back to school in the fall and I'm probably about to get a job (unemployed for a year). The bipolar diagnosis has been an absolute blessing, and I'm finally starting to feel stable after years of struggling. I'm happier than I've ever been. I guess you could say 2015 is shaping up to be one of the best years of my life so far.  [info] None [info] 1432137397
brighteyedsmile [info] Thanks for that.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 back in college, and the doctors asked me if I had manic episodes and I didn't know what they meant.

shitjoesays [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (among other things) about 8 years ago, so I'm already talking to a psychiatrist on the regular. I plan to bring this up at our next meeting, as well as talk about my weight loss goals.I decided to wean off my medication when we decided to have a baby, with my doctor's permission of course. It's been difficult,  but I'm coping, and talking to someone on the regular really helps. I know blaming myself helps no one, but it's a lot easier said than done. My husband has been incredibly helpful in this regard. Mostly I'm just angry and confused. I don't understand why it keeps happening, which is a valid question by itself. I just have to make sure I don't start blaming myself in the process. Honestly, talking to others who have been where I'm at helps. I know there are a million different reasons why women miscarry, but knowing I'm not alone helps. [info] None [info] 1432569245
imightbejake [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1 in 2001, and I have had a difficult time with the disease.Meditation helps a great deal. I use guided visualization, but in the last few months, I've started to leave the visualization behind and just count my breaths. I go back to visualization when the counting is not working, which is when I get distracted easily. I'd say it's about half and half now.I have no goals for my meditation. I just do it. I know it helps me monitor my moods. I'm able to differentiate between moods that are transitory and ones that are more troublesome and stay longer. As a result, I don't let minor things upset me as much as they used to. I have more equilibrium in my moods. I don't have wild swings like I used to.I also take medicine as prescribed, and I exercise. I walk 3 miles/3.8 km almost every day. All of it helps me stay healthy. [info] None [info] 1432586382
Morally_Inept [info] Very nice!  I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 in 2013, almost two years to the day.   It took 10 months to find the right meds but since then life has been getting easier.  I was in therapy as well and my therapist discharged me last fall because I'm doing so well!  Prior to my diagnoses i was like you with rapid cycles ( sometimes up and down within 24 hours).  I was very close to suicide when I sought help.I agree, it gets much better.  Thanks! [info] None [info] 1432669347
rhoslyne [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in middle school, but when I did research about the disorder on my own, the diagnoses didn't really feel right. I didn't think it really fit me. After doing some more digging, I discovered BPD and felt like the symptoms really resonated with me. To fit the criteria, you have to have (I think) 5 out of the 8 markers (again, I might be skewed with the exact numbers here, but I know I'm close lol), and I have/had almost all of them, some more prominently than others, at various times in my life. Went back to the doc with my questions about BPD, they told me they didn't know too much about the disorder because hardly any research had really been done on it at that time, and they recommended I see someone else. Being 13, I was extremely discouraged, and didn't know how to go about finding a new therapist after feeling so wholly abandoned by my first one that the school had appointed to me (ah, classic borderline), so instead of finding someone else to confirm my diagnosis and help me, I withdrew from therapy. About three or four years later, I went to another therapist (briefly) who did formally diagnose me with BPD. They also immediately wanted to treat me with medication, which I had read didn't really work for patients with borderline. They were very offended when I suggested we try talk-therapy instead of meds, as I had read everything I could find on the internet about the disorder, and almost every source said meds don't help, BPD is best treated with talk-therapy (or DBT, dialectical behavioral therapy). That therapist gave me an ultimatum and said that I would take their prescription or find another doctor. I just decided I would try and help myself (which is... Nearly impossible, after *years* of trying, you *need* someone else to stay rational and objective, because folks with BPD can't). Yes, I am currently in a relationship with an amazing man with unmatched patience. It's a constant struggle to have a good, healthy relationship, and mine actually almost ended this past weekend. I'm still an incredibly insecure person, have huge trust and abandonment issues and that causes a lot of strain on my boyfriend in the first place. Couple that with the fact that it is extremely hard to regulate the bombardment of irrational thoughts, and that sometimes I cannot even tell that I'm being irrational (because my imagined fear is SO real in my head, as crazy as it seems to you), and then toss in the fact that folks with BPD can have mood swings with no obvious triggers literally within *seconds*... Yeah, it's hard. Plus there's the whole being combative aspect of it, and the identity issues, and the feelings of emptiness, and the self-loathing... It's not something most people want in a partner.I try my best to stay self-aware and hyper vigilant when it comes to monitoring what I'm thinking and feeling. Where I used to be a person who had no filter, I now take a lot of care to think before I speak, and think about why it makes me feel the way it does, or of I even need to say it. Or if I feel the need to do something impulsive, like shop online or drive recklessly, I try to stop and give myself a friendly reminder that I'm letting my BPD get the better of me again. I thought I was a victim of it for a long time, and sometimes when I'm in the throes of its bullshit, sometimes I still do. But I try to snap myself back to reality and remember that at the end of the day, I can take control.As soon as I have health insurance, I'm finding someone who specializes in DBT. I've really needed it this year. Sorry for all the word vomit. I hope I answered your questions adequately, and if you'd like to discuss it any further, please PM me. I'm happy to chat about it.

MCLovin1181 [info] I worked construction for around 3 years. It was basically me moving heavy objects(I used to be a shot/discus thrower).I made a solid $150 a day but hated my job.The job was actually affecting my mental health and I was diagnosed with bipolar type 3.My brother told me of a possible business he wanted to start. So I quit my old job and moved to Washington 2 weeks later. I'm so much happier now.

growlergirl [info] You guys are being way too harsh on this girl. Let me guess, you're all a bunch of nice guys and nice guys finish last, right?I'm in the same predicament as this girl. I recently dumped a guy because I was falling in love with him. I broke it off because I was scared that sooner or later he'd see the real me then reject me. So I got in there and rejected him first as a defence mechanism. I felt so guilty that I wound up in hospital with self-inflicted injuries. The day after that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.Your ex sounds like she has a similar pattern of behaviour. You saw her at her worst (drunk and careless) and I think she probably broke up with you because she felt ashamed of herself. She was afraid that eventually you'd begin to feel just as much shame for her as she does and dump her. So she beat you to the punch as a defence mechanism.Should you try and win her back? I don't know. If I had a chance to get back with my ex I probably wouldn't take it because I still have a long way to go before I get better and I wouldn't want him to have to endure me at my worst.She can only learn to love herself on her own, until she gets to that point she probably isn't ready for a relationship.

Blastifex [info] I first started having cluster headaches in early high school. All I remember of the first one was vomiting on some piece of math busy work and being sent to the nurse's office, where she called my parents and told them I was having a stroke. I spent a few days in the hospital while they tried to figure out what was wrong with me. Later, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so first depakote then lithium have really helped with the prevention. I still worry that I'll hit a tolerance threshold on the lithium in mid may and they'll come back (my episode frequency was may 20xx, april 20xx+1, may 20xx+2, so it seems to be somehow seasonal.)I can't beat clusters for physical pain.

yege90 [info] Absolutely not. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and autism. I can't hold a job very long. I had to move back in with my mother which is very embarrassing for me. The worst part was that when I was in college I was also in the army reserves and loved it. I had my own place, a good amount of money. The bipolar disorder got the best of me and even though everything was going well I attempted suicide. After that the Army just cut me off. I told them about it and the response was "I don't care." A few weeks later I got a letter saying I was discharged. It crushed me. I never really recovered. I'm in and out of psych wards and on a bunch of different meds that are constantly being changed. I'm in VR but I lock up at every interview they get me. I'm in a lot of debt from my hospital bills, my collage loans and the army wanted my bonus back.I'm trying to see if I can get disability. This is not the life I wanted. I feel that everything I do will just blow up in my face. [info] None [info] 1434337195
socratesthefoolish [info] Thanks MedievalPenguin! I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well. I never attempted to suicide, but I was hospitalized roughly 3 years ago.After being hospitalized, I received treatment, and after some time, I was able to discontinue use of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. My doctor is always really pleased to see me, because the outlook for people with our disease typically is very poor.It helps though, that I converted after my hospitalization. Whenever I get any weird thoughts, I can immediately ignore them, and recognize their source, because God, who is Truth, Goodness, and Love itself, wouldn't present me with the possibility of completely insane things being true. So, I've been asymptomatic for the past three years (disregarding the occasional insane thought once every month or so, which, all thanks be to God, I'm able to put to rest within a millisecond or so).I still take medication for ADHD, but for some reason I doubt that that would be as concerning as bipolar disorder.Have hope! I'm not sure if you get completely insane thoughts like I do, but, if you can begin to recognize their character, ask God to give you the grace to have a sincere and total revulsion for them. Eventually, they will become less and less frequent as time goes on.For me, it's all a matter of not giving into the insane thoughts. Without my faith, I couldn't give a principled reason to do that. But, taking for granted the truth of the Gospels, Sacred Tradition, the Magisterium of the Church, and the insights of the Doctors of the Church, the insane thoughts are pretty much akin to a fly that I will have to shoo away occasionally.Edit 1:For anyone else reading that has problems with irrational thoughts, taking these steps have been a tremendous help:1. Go about your day.2. If presented with a strange thought, immediately recall to your mind first, that God exists, and that his existence can be proved by reason, following from cause to effect, second, that because God is Goodness itself, and the Good does not deceive, that God created the world, and yourself, in an orderly, reasonable way and third, that the past, and your memories of the past are reliable, and thus, because this strange thought would contradict one or more of the preceding, it must be immediately disregarded, deeply resented, and recognized as the wicked fruits of a wicked creature.3. Thank God that He has given you this opportunity to grow in the spiritual life, and more completely depend on Him, and His promises for your well-being.4. Say an Our Father, Hail Mary, or Prayer to St. Michael (this is my standard rebuke).5. Immediately put it in the past, and go about your day. When it happens again, go back to step 2.Edit 2: It is of the UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO NEVER DOUBT ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN NUMBER 2. IF YOU SINCERELY BEGIN TO DOUBT THEM, YOU ARE DONE, TOAST, I HOPE YOU ENJOY HOSPITAL FOOD, THEY ARE DOGMAS FOR YOU [info] None [info] 1434496819

HitomiSenpai [info] I remember that when I was 3 or 4 years old, my mom asked me to go and call my sister for dinner. I went looking into every room, and I opened a dark room, and I could only see the wall being illuminated by the light in the aisle. Suddenly, I saw shadows of someone in a car and getting out of the car with other people and kidnapping a girl. I could even see the girl moving her legs and what the other shadow was covering her mouth and forcing her to go in the car and then they went. They were shadows, on the wall. Then i heard my mom and went back to her. Did not say a word. Up to this date, I don't know what that was...but turns out that some 20 years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

confusionhysterical [info] I had a nervous breakdown in the beginning of what would have been my senior year. My mother, noticing that I was on a downward spiral of drug addiction and general craziness encouraged me to withdraw and move home. Years later, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which explains so much of my behavior. I wish I had taken her second piece of advice and sought mental health help earlier, but c'est la vie...Life since then has been a series of ups and downs, but I don't think I would change anything for the world for if things had been different I wouldn't have ended up in Charlotte where I met the love of my life. Since leaving school I've worked several different jobs ranging from boring office work to retail to animal care but currently I'm working as a stripper, which I absolutely love.The only thing that really gets to me is still paying my student loans and having nothing to show for it.

Essjayc [info] Well, I went from literally one step above kindergarten drawings to this in literally "redditor for 29 days" so wow, I've told people a lie! I told them a month and a half. It hasn't been a month yet. So yeah. I mean, I won't lie, my sister's artistic, my mother's artistic, grandfather, etc. They all painted or draw. But I've always had difficulty learning, and I'd end up quitting out of frustration. I got "lucky" and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and thankfully my manic period made me feel better than taking ecstasy. No joke. I'd never felt that good before, and my head was clear, and I just decided "video games are boring. Let's take up drawing. I've always wanted to do that." And I drew.I drew so much, I was up 36 hours straight, and still wasn't even tired. The first 5 days or so was literally studying the hell out of anatomy and trying to draw the drawings in the book (I can link the book if you want, it's really good). They weren't great, but they looked like human proportions.Then I started drawing with references to how big the proportions should be. I'd draw one picture and basically try and trace it without tracing it. Then I'd compare the two side by side, and notice where I screwed up. Then I'd trace the picture to learn where I would draw the defining lines (which is important for comic books, where your lines define shapes). I watched tons of videos while drawing, and I spoke with like 10 artists and was constantly asking them questions about how they did this or that or whatever. Basically, I am treating this like a full time job. I'm still too messed up to work because of the medications I'm trialing, but drawing is "easy" enough to do. Sorry for the wall of text, but I really wish I could help people that think they can't draw. I still am not that great compared to most of the artists, but I want to be. I literally want to draw and paint until I die. I've never had something I could say that about, but I do now. It's addicting! But yeah, even someone I talked to said he believes anyone can learn how to draw with enough practice, it's just learning rules, and then executing them. You learn to draw circles, and then you learn to draw those circles with a certain size relative to the other circles you draw. Then you just connect them, start adding more details, etc. [Like, I watched this video of a painting by a professional artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjHeOmMVy8E) and honestly I used to think coming up with this stuff was insane and impossible. But the more I learn, the more realistic it becomes for me to one day achieve that level of skill. Anyway, I wrote too much. But seriously, you're the best. :) I hope if you want to draw that you keep drawing.  [info] None [info] 1434981503
skimcortado [info] Hey man, thanks for writing. I thought about your response a few times through the day. It was a hard day and I needed all the encouragement I could get, so, thank you.I've had some form of a therapist since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 6 years ago. I moved 2 years ago and since then haven't found anyone I like. It's near impossible to find a psychiatrist where I live so I've been making do with a general practitioner and a therapist. When I quit pot I finally got off my ass and found someone that I can actually sort of get behind. My last therapist was very pro-pot.I've been meditating and practicing mindfulness on and off for the past 5 years but it's hard to dedicate myself to it consistently. I practice yoga regularly and I went today and had this aha moment where I realized my yoga practice is firmly tied to my mental states.

Kedestria [info] I've been with my fiance for 2 1/2 years, and known each other for 4 1/2. I'm diagnosed with bipolar, and we suspect that he may have it as well. Relationships can most definitely be hard with mental illness, but just like relationships without mental or physical problems, it's something both sides have to be willing to work with. There will always be issues in relationships. I'm currently unmedicated and I get pretty wild on both spectrums, but he's stuck with me through all of it. The nights of breakdowns and self-harm where all I can do is cry and the days of irritability and invincibility and flying off the walls. We've seen each other at our worst and we know we can keep doing what we've been doing. I love my man deeply and wouldn't change him for the world, and I know he feels the same way about me. So while it can take awhile to find someone who will stay with you and love you for who you are, it's not impossible and it's definitely worth the search.

My moods change, and this alters my perspective of the world, and my own past experiences and actions.  I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, if that means anything to you.  I don't take psychiatry seriously, but I will admit that my basic personality does seem to shift somewhat wildly in short spans of time.  I don't view that as being problematic.&gt;  Have you ever considered that maybe your elders don't interfere with your family relationships because they've been instructed to keep your past suicidal tendencies in mind?If that's true, that would really bug me.

If they believe the Watchtower's direction to the effect that ex-members are apostates and that current members must have no contact with them, then let's see the elders uphold their obligation to see "Jehovah's" direction carried out within the congregation.&gt;   But I don't understand why that means you need to come here and insult other people who have very different circumstances than you, or imply that they are inferior to you because they chose a different path.Because that would have helped me when I was about to die.

anarchyarcanine [info] I wish you both the best. I was diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD in 2010, when I was only turning 18, and then a few years later was told I had Gen. Anxiety Disorder. It's scary at first. It's gonna feel freaky, but the best thing to do is to keep it from defining you. I've had the hardest time with that, because it's been a rollercoaster for me with tons of meds, and dealing with new situations and recurring/new symptoms, but you have to remember that you are still a person underneath of it, one that is valuable and precious and wonderful.You don't have to tell a single soul. For me, the people I trust know, and I only tell other people if it might be beneficial for them to know in order to understand me better. The sucky part for me is having to explain to people that PTSD is not just a soldier's disease, but having to only vaguely explain why I have it because I don't feel okay with telling people my story.You two are gonna be just fine. Get treatment that you are comfortable with, and think will be best, if you choose to treat it. But above all, remember to take care of yourself first and foremost. Do what makes you feel happy and safe, and check in with yourself now and again to make sure that you're still doing that. If not, figure out how you can change it.

bloodsoakedrainbow [info] They did at least pay me off with a fairly large sum of money, I think because they knew they were in the wrong. So they paid me a bit more than I likely would have got from an unfair dismissal lawsuit. I prolly could have sued anyway, but the whole point was reducing my stress, not increasing it.And to be honest, I'm happier without that job anyway, so while I'm still a bit annoyed at the whole "mothers can work part time but the mentally ill cannot" thing (and probably always will be - I absolutely loathe the special treatment that mothers get compared to everyone else in this country)... I hated most of the people I worked with and the heavy workload I had was definitely a contributing factor to my instability. So I'm better off without that job anyway.

The bipolar diagnosis never sat right with me, but I couldn't figure out what else it could be, so that was my label for a while. Because I did well in school, I didn't think I had much of a problem with focus/distractability until I ended up in the working world and everything started unraveling for me. I think the added responsibility of the working world plus the fact that everything isn't laid out neatly on a syllabus way ahead of time is what really tested my ADHD (although I was still a chronic procrastinator, even back then). Also, once I started having important meetings, I realized I would zone out during conversations and miss chunks. I always assumed I would zone out during conversations because I merely was disinterested, but I would actually try very hard to pay attention during meetings and still have trouble. That's how I ended up discussing it with my psychriatrist and ultimately getting diagnosed. I have had hyperactive symptoms that have persisted into adulthood (running around, being ridiculously goofy, being unable to sit still) and these were previously misdiagnosed as mania. When I take Adderall, they completely go away. In fact, I even feel a little sleepy on adderall, but I don't think it's a "real" sleepiness. I think it just feels that way because some of my energy finally gets mitigated. Anyway, the point of all of this is that I don't think it's black-and-white. I think plenty of people learn coping skills to help them get through everyday life that makes it even harder to distinguish ADHD from other disorders.  [info] None [info] 1436379034
bipolarcarebear [info] I found two of these tests online, and strangely enough I get the same answers as the schizophrenic even though I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Though I should say that my symptoms seem to lean on the schizoaffective side. I hope one day we can learn more about whether or not bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are connected in some way. These illnesses both seem to run in my family.  [info] None [info] 1436383387
TheLonelyScientist [info] This is great. When I was a child, a doctor told me and my parents that my ADHD would go away on its own, so nothing was done about it. Then when I started college, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and treated for that. It didn't help and I landed myself in a psych hospital for a while after some suicidal episodes. Everything went south and I ended up back at home at a community college for 3 years until I could transfer to another school. I had stopped all medication for bipolar because it didn't help. Then things started turning into how they were before. I finally went to another doctor and got help for my ADHD and it has turned it all around. [info] None [info] 1436638201
GreatEvilBetty [info] Your dad did the right thing. My mother was a bipolar schizophrenic, but that wasn't until after all the drugs and alcohol.When I was around 3 years old(my sister being a year old) my parents separated for a nine month period. We lived with her and some guy, and my dad would visit every chance he could get. I didn't like that period of time at all. Though I don't remember much.Anyways, my mom then came back to my dad after almost a year, and my parents were back together!A few months later my dad started getting bills in the mail for a total of about $20,000. Turns out my mom and the guy she was living with were just filling out mail in credit cards, maxing them out, then throwing them away. Since my parents were still married, it became his debt as they were all in her name.My dad almost didn't take her back at that point. But they came to some sort of agreement.Fastforward about a decade. My mom was an awesome mom, loved her so much. She was fairly erratic, but still awesome. One day she snapped though. Couldn't handle it anymore or something. She went completely off the deep end, got into drugs, alcohol, sex with minors, my dad divorced her immediately.My mom only got worse, the amount of psych meds she was taking being negated by her constant alcohol and drug abuse. Eventually it killed her.I wish after my parents split up the second time, my dad had worked harder to keep her out of our life, but he is just so kind of a man, that he couldn't do that. She messed with my head hard, and I can attribute to most of my current problems due to the shit she put me through. I wanted to help her. I felt it was my fault, and I threw myself into her world trying to fix her and ended up damaging myself instead.I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 17, and have been in a mental institution three times, hospital after attempted suicide twice, and homeless for awhile.I am doing good now though. I have a good job, regulated meds, weekly therapy, a wife, two kids, and a house. My life has literally never been better.I still feel like shit sometimes. Today is one of those days. I called in sick to work just because I needed a "mental sick day". I feel so ashamed of myself for not sticking it out though. I feel weak. A failure. I can't become my mother. Every day is a struggle to handle my mental illness, some days are good, some days are bad.Also the meds I'm on have stifled my creativity. I use to be a writer, poet, whatever. I though for sure someday I would be a famous author. But yeah. That's not happening. [info] None [info] 1436829670
Gema232 [info] 18/F/USA. My best friend is my beloved pooch too. Mine's a cockapoo, and I volunteer at the retirement home and soup kitchen near my house. I love knitting and crocheting. I'm actually doing a project now where I take plastic grocery bags and crochet it into plastic mats and give it to the homeless, so they don't have to sleep on the ground. I'm not exactly frugal...Well, sometimes I am, but most of the time. I've never been hospitalized, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Anyway, I'd be happy to talk to you if you're interested.  [info] None [info] 1437197313
happyfinesadrepeat [info] My parents are like that. I used to be the perfect kid, then I just kind of changed, got worse. My mom, also speaking on behalf of my dad when they learnt about my biggest fuck up, asked me where they went wrong and told me that they thought they did everything they could. She was trying to hold back her tears, but she couldn't. I told them they weren't the problem, that it was me. And I was sincere. I didn't say those just to get them to shut up or to sound like I was surrendering. Six months later, I was diagnosed with bipolar I.  [info] None [info] 1437239507
happyfinesadrepeat [info] This will probably get buried, but I just need to get these off of my chest. I've had so many heartbreaking things said to me at different times of my life. Here goes nothin':* Up until I was fifteen, whenever I did something wrong or something my parents deemed was wrong, my mother would tell me that she wished she had pinched my nose when I was a baby if she had known that I'd grow up to be the person I am. I'm the first born. I was conceived on the first month of her and my dad's marriage. I still don't know if she meant it all those times or was just extremely disappointed. Either way, it's heartbreaking to hear my mother tell me on multiple occasions that she wished she had killed me and didn't waste money, time, and effort on me.* When I was kicked out of university, my mom said, "I thought you were happy with us." We're a typical working class Filipino family. They did their best to provide us, their children, with things we need, but we always had less than the other kids. I'm fucking intelligent. My IQ when I was twelve was above 140. But it'd be nice if we had a computer or a TV. So, yeah, after I was kicked out, my parents forced me to talk to them. I told them about my problems and my insecurities, how I didn't have any friend because I was afraid that people would leave me. Then, she told me that. I felt so guilty. She accused me of not appreciating all the things they did for me. That was not my point, but I didn't say anything more.* I was diagnosed with bipolar I a little more than two years ago. I don't know whether my parents can't understand or are not trying to understand my condition. My mom said, more than once, "Why can't you be normal?" I'd be listening to showtunes, classical music, or metal, and she'd say that. I feel incapable of forgiving my grandmother, her mother, who accused me of attempting to murder her a coupla months before my high school graduation, and my mother would say that. I'd be depressed, and she'd still say that. She'd hear about how successful the people I went to high school with are, and she'd say that. She and my dad would ask me what I want to do with my life and I'd tell them that I want to be a writer, and she'd wished that I were normal. On my last birthday, my sister wanted to eat the cake. It was lunchtime. I told her we should wait for our dad. She then got mad. I heard her asking our mom why I couldn't be normal. Sometimes, I lie on the floor of our living room while listening to music, then tears would just leak onto my skin and then the floor. Why can't I be normal?* When I was fourteen, my dad asked me if I was sensitive. He wasn't asking, so he'd know what to do with me. He asked because he wanted me to deny it.* When I was sixteen, my mom's mother accused me of trying to murder her. I grew more quiet than I already was. One night, I borrowed my mom's phone and went on to read her messages. Her sister, my aunt, told her that she's going to kill me if I ever hurt their mother again. My mom's mother is a manipulative bitch. She physically and emotionally abused me and my younger brother. She's always twisted the truth, so she'd come out as the victim. Nobody, not even my parents, really did nothing to stop the abuse. My soul wasn't ready for that kind of lie, that accusation.* My mother's other sister told me that I'd get nowhere. That I'd wind up like my drug addict cousin. My mother was there. She heard it, but didn't say anything. I still cannot decide which is more heartbreaking, what was said or what wasn't. My mom probably believed her sister. I was accepted into one of the top universities, but was kicked out on my third year. At 25, I'm living with my parents again, doing freelance work while I write and rewrite and delete paragraphs of my novel. My aunt probably could see into the future. I'm a nobody and, for so long, there just doesn't seem to be a chance that I'll be great person that we all thought I would be.* One of my four college friends told me I could never have friends because I was a weirdo.* Still in college, someone told me I looked like a dog, and not in a good way.* There was this girl in college. She was one of my closest friends. Valentine's Day some years ago, I fessed up. Told her I liked her and that I'd probably regret not telling her than possibly ruining our friendship. She stopped talking to me. I heard from our common friends that she thought I betrayed her trust. That the only motive I had for being her friend was to get on her pants. I didn't even like her when I first saw her. It took at least a year before I realized that I liked her. * There was this other girl. On her going away party (she was going to graduate school in Europe), she told me to find a girlfriend. I thought she liked me. I thought I had a chance.* At our high school reunion a few years ago, my closest friend during high school bullied me. She was fucking proud of it. It wasn't that she called me a liar. It's the fact that she, as well as the others, saw me as a person who doesn't have a shot in life. She thought I could only lie about good things happening to me because good things would never happen to me. [info] None [info] 1437242507
from_the_black_hole [info] I have bipolar 2 disorder.  I take Lamictal.Don't take an SSRI if you have bipolar disorder.Having bipolar disorder makes you prone to addiction.  You have to really understand your illness and don't fall into the cliche.  You need to find the gifts inside your illness.  I don't like when people romanticize bipolar disorder and mental illness, but us bipolars are usually geniuses in one way or another.You have to find a reason to quit.  I always get horrible cravings and it seems literally impossible to quit until 48 hours after my last smoke.  I personally think smoking affects my medication's effectiveness and after abstaining for a few days, I feel like my mood levels out and I find less reasons to want to smoke.Bipolar is hard.  People don't understand it.  You'll lose most of your friends, you'll spend a lot of time alone.  You have to learn to love yourself and get proper treatment with medication that won't make you groggy or feel out of it.  You'll need to have a consistent sleep schedule and diet.  You'll need to exercise and stay productive.  Avoid caffeine as well.  Try to avoid any psychoactive drugs.  You want your brain chemistry to remain consistent so you can learn to identify your mood cycles.I've been through it all and kicking pot is a real challenge for me because I use it to self medicate.  It makes me unproductive and I've lost a few years of my life just smoking to mask my illness.  I'm the same age as you; my parents don't believe I have bipolar disorder and thought I was making it up.  My parents are both hoarders and were severely emotional abusive and negligent.  I dealt with self harm and considered suicide many times over the past 5 years.  Once I turned 18 I was able to go to a psychiatrist on my own and get diagnosed and treated.  My parents never ask or care about my mental illness or the medication I was prescribed.  I remember being 18 year old and telling them I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and they gave me an awkward stare, grabbed a beer from the fridge, rolled their eyes and walked off.Not to go on about a sob sorry of my life, but in case someone else reads this because of the title,Before I knew I was bipolar I was self harming every day and considering suicide every day from age 16-18.  Child protective services came to my house because my school guidance counselor suspected something was up and I broke down and told them everything going on in my life and at home.  She tipped off CPS and they contacted my parents.  My mom unleashed an angry tirade on me and forced me to clean the entire house before their scheduled visit.  At the time I had no friends except for a girl who talked to me on the phone and texted me for hours every day pretending to like me.  I fell in love because she was the only person I had.  Typical teenage girl bullshit went down and it turned out she was just using me for attention; she loved talking to me and hearing me tell her how much I loved her and she would pretend to be interested in me but she wasn't.The bad living situation and emotional trauma on top of being untreated for a severe mental illness caused my grades to suffer and it took me an extra two years to graduate, I had to set myself up with an alternative education to graduate once I was 18.  Since I wasn't able to go to college I had to work minimum wage jobs with demanding hours and high stress which set my bipolar off.  For the past few years all I have been doing is smoking pot to deal with all of this past trauma.  It seems impossible to get out of it. [info] None [info] 1437460907
LookOfRegret [info] Hi, I am diagnosed with bipolar one with cluster b features -- borderline type, basically the same thing as you. I also take seroquel and have for several years; I take 300mg instant release at night, along with lamictal. Everybody feels the way you do when they start taking seroquel, it will last about 2-5 months. But you'll get used to it, and eventually it will be hard to imagine life without it. If I miss my medication I don't sleep, and feel terrible the next day. Nevertheless it will calm your mind and your emotions, and can change you life for the better. I had been baker acted 3 times for psychosis before I started taking seroquel, and never since.  [info] bp1, bpd, addiction [info] 1437522492
organizedfellow [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.One of the many traits associated with it is, [racing thoughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_thoughts). I've always had them. They've made it hard to pay attention in school. Tough to listen to my ~~girl friend~~ *wife*. Difficult to follow along the plot of a good movie. My entire life has been over run by racing mild/wild thoughts. Sometimes the next string of thoughts is related to the previous ... other times they are not and become morbid or obscene.Let's start with a simple item. A peach.&gt; My daughter just asked me if she can have a peach, I said sure, share with your sister. Peach. i could eat a peach fo rhours, nicolas cage was in a movie where he says that to a woman, i could each a peach for hours, james and the giant peach, mt friend james now lives in port orchard washington and thinking of him makes me a little sad because i have not seen him in several years. nick cage was in another movie that i really liked called Con Air. in the end, steve buscemi character escapes and i think he kills or eats the little girl? oh shit, didnt jeffrey dahmer eat people? i read that a police man went to jeffrey dahmers apartment once and jeff had just killed a man and was really calm talking to the police man at the door. peach. grapes. wine. beer. my favorite beers are guiness, arragant bastard, sierra nevada, lagunita IPA, mmm, heinekennnn ... why are the bottles green? i remember once at an old church i went to and saw a stained glass window and the cross was the exact same shade of green as my heineken bottle. peach. grapes. i'm gonna grape you in the mouth! i love youtube.I don't want to go back and edit that, I know there are spelling mistakes in it, but I'll leave them be :) So yeah. I'm an over thinker.Can't stop it. Why would I want to? I am creative, artistic, fun to be around, witty as fuck, charming as hell, funny and I always have something to say. Never a dull moment. Life of the party. The high five guy. You'd want to take me home to meet your mother, but not meat your mother, lol.Yeah, I won't edit that either. Racing thoughts. They've gotten me in so much trouble over the years with work, saying the dumbest shit, not following directions. etc. etc.___OH.Don't get me started about my sleep problems! I'll lie in bed and just ... thiiiiiiiinnnnnnnk. [info] None [info] 1437525636

shiro321 [info] That I was insane, a murder, tortured animals/small kids/elderly, attempted suicide, a molester/rapist, a sadist and pretty much everything else you can think of about mental illness.I was  a shy kid who never had a lot of friends and always stayed to my self, I have Adhd, bipolar disorder, central auditory disorder and mild schizophrenia and have been on meds and getting treatment for it since I was 7 years old. I was the kid that had to stop by the nurses office twice a day for unknown reason(to take my meds). So this had already labeled me as a "weird kid."Near the end of my last year in middle school I spent two weeks in a mental hospital where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When I returned to school no one knew where I had been. I just told everyone that I was sick and had to stay in the hospital but one teacher decided that the official explanation from the principle was not good enough and was going to fail me for missing the two weeks and forced me to explain where I was and why in front of the whole class. This was two weeks before the year ended and kids being kids no one would speak to me, sit near me or even make eye contact with me for the rest of the year, they avoided me like I had the plague. Over those two weeks and over the course of the summer the rumors started to spread and when highschool started it was every where. The rumors followed me all through highschool and I was always treated like an outcast for it, I had a very hard time making any friends and I was bullied and ridiculed for it. This led to me becoming even more depressed and having to spend more time in the mental hospital my senior year. The school finally caved and gave me a home tutor to finish my senior year from home.

possessednayru [info] Same. I was put in a psych hospital when I was like 12 or 13 for a suicide attempt. (That's when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.) Hearing the cries of small children in the hallways at night... It was something else. They cried for their parents, yelling out into the hallways to the night nurse. Lots of movies with psych wards portray everyone as buddies and lifelong friendships. I listened to kids cry every night, a girl that found her mom's dead body, a boy that talked about microwaving cats. It was not fun, nobody had friends, and it was so sad.

Rosie_Martinez [info] Hi .... Very sorry to hear this and I can speak from experience that this is just the beginning stages of her getting better . Once the therapy starts .... That will help . She will have someone else to help her sort her problems and with logic ! She will be able to express herself and get out so much and have someone that is on her side . Things will get better you just have to tough it out for alil while.... Never normal ...never perfect but better. Once they get her on the right meds that helps it even more .  Medication can't heal her but they can help her . I've been w my husband 6 years .... Two years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar I . It took the first year to get it all worked out and its wonderful. Not Normal ..... But normal is overrated. We have a connection no one can touch .... During my onset manic episode of 6 months tried to take my life 6x . This man stood by me .... He fought for my life harder than I did. This is love in its truest form ... Not normal but definitely the kind you read about in a book. When you come out of that fog and you see who is by your side now that is something . No other man can touch my husband.... This is a man that saved my life . I promise you the road isn't easy but really anything special isn't meant to just be easy ..... What builds that bond is what you do during those rough times.

RiverStrymon [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in the middle of a particularly intense semester at a university. I was studying music composition and to stay on top of my piano class I had to practice at least two hours a day. I found it was useful to completely micromanage my day into a strict and comprehensive schedule of bite sized chunks. I literally had five minutes carved out especially to be practicing with my right hand on the second fifth of one of my three pieces. It helped me stay barely on top of things, even though it was exhausting.Tl;Dr - Depression can make regular tasks seem overwhelming. Try breaking them down until they reach a size that's more manageable. Doing something is better than nothing. [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1438122404

strugglebusss [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 a few years ago after having a manic episode and spending 2 weeks in a mental hospital.  I think what people really need to recognize is that there is a distinct difference between individuals being treated, and those that are not.  Additionally, everyone's illness is different; we have the same label because that's makes treatment easier for doctors, but my disorder is very different from any one else diagnosed with bipolar 1.  Since my diagnosis, I have not been in a serious enough relationship to disclose my disorder.  I am currently very stable, medicated, seeing a therapist, working full time, etc.  I actually have my shit together much more than many of my friends who don't have a mental illness.  I would only tell someone in the event that my disorder would begin to effect them (aka I am loosing my stability), or I am interested in pursuing a serious long term relationship.  It really sucks that so many of you have had bad experiences with individuals suffering from an illness, but try to remember that it truly is an illness. Do not mistake mood for personality, and please, try not to lump us all together.  I am much more than my disorder. [info] F/dc chillin [info] 1438185992

mistixs [info] Well...I entered the therapy when I was 16, a sophomore in HS...I went into the mental hospital first, WHICH WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE 0/10 DON'T RECOMMEND GOING TO SUMMIT OAKS IN NJ EVER. It was literally the closest to hell on Earth I've ever gotten. I'm not even kidding. But that's only the hospital I went to. There are many hospitals that are better than the one I went to. So I'm not bashing hospitals in general; I'm just bashing Summit Oaks. Anyway, after that, I went to a Partial Hospital Program, which was basically a "hospital" I went to, but only during normal school hours, from like 8am to 3pm. That *really* helped. That's where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and learned a lot of these coping skills, including the ice cubes one. They had different "classes" throughout the day, like anger management, group therapy, etc. I do recommend. I used to go into psychotic rages like you wouldn't believe, for really stupid reasons, but with the therapy, I learned how to control it &amp; channel my anger in healthy ways. (&amp; For further update, I then went to a therapeutic school to finish up high school, and just graduated last month. I'm doing so much better now. My mom said that sending me to the therapeutic school was a godsend. Now it's at the point that it's not that I need to control my rage, I actually don't feel any rage to begin with! Which is amazing, considering how it used to be a weekly thing) You can still go to Partial Hospital Programs even if you're not in school. Like, adults can go to them, too. But you probably don't want something that intensive, so I would recommend going to anger management therapy classes in general, whether in a group, or solo. Learning CBT &amp; DBT skills is also good. Even if you don't see an actual therapist, you can probably find PDFs online! :)  [info] None [info] 1438637789

ediesweet [info] I was in a similar situation to your daughter. I was a little younger than her when I was diagnosed with bipolar. To this day my father thinks I am making it up, that bipolar isn't real, and that I'm just mentally weak. Being around him was very upsetting and infuriating for me, because I always considered him intelligent and wise and I couldn't believe he could be so ignorant. I think it's for the best if she doesn't see him until he learns to empathize. I can only speak from my point of view but that is what I did. It seems like your daughter is taking positive steps and is getting better. I think things should stay as is for now. Good luck, you're a great mother!

timefraud [info] Thanks.Trashed is probably a better word.It's my fault too. I've been hanging out with people who don't care about me that much or who are just using me, but then again, I suppose I'm just using them for their company.I just got back home from the house of the person I'm dating. We had sex before I left. I started to cry towards the end which went unnoticed (not really related to the moment..I think. Just happened.). My mood afterwards wasn't. I said my mood had plummeted which was as far as the conversation went.This person I'm dating is high (on weed) all the time and has said he prefers to be blissfully unaware of the painful parts of the world, so I can understand why he didn't press the issue. But then again, when I try to open up, the conversation usually gets shut down. Or I'm told "dude, you're crazy" (now that he knows I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder). And lol. That sounds so stupid.  [info] None [info] 1439327377
shtuf [info] Yep, I always make it a point to remind people of this too since LSD is often regarded as something impossible to physically cause harm with. There are at least several documented cases of people having life-threatening seizures or even dying when combining Lithium and LSD. I was on high doses of Lithium for nearly 6 years, started experimenting with psychedelics towards the tail end of that period. Started with 2c-c, then 2c-b, then DMT. I'd read erowid trip reports day and night to try and learn from others' mistakes, and when it came time to try LSD I noticed one major common theme about many of the train wreck and disasters section of the LSD trip report archive: the subjects were taking pharmaceutical doses of Lithium.I made sure the Li was out of my system before finally trying LSD. Had no problems. I've since tried some of the other related psychedelic lysergamides such as AL-LAD, LSZ, and 1P-LSD. Hope to try ETH-LAD some day soon as well.NOTE: if you are truly bipolar and Lithium has helped you stabilize your life please don't just stop taking it suddenly so it'll clear your system and you can drop acid. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, which in retrospect think is a made up diagnosis allowing docs to Rx certain drugs, but even then...after stopping 900mg Li daily for 6 years cold turkey...I would not recommend that approach to anybody. The most invasive suicidal thoughts I've ever had for at least 2-3 days. [info] None [info] 1439340010
Zolazo7696 [info] Man that's really sad. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was little and my mom never did anything about it. It wasn't until I was older that it really started wearing me down. It's a pretty crappy thing to have. [info] None [info] 1439353735
QueenNoor [info] Thank you for posting this. My dad died suddenly of a heart attack when I was 6 years old (I witnessed it) and I learned to turn to food for comfort. I piled on the pounds quickly but my mother was too engrossed in her own grief and concerns about being a jobless single mother to do anything about it. By the time I was 13, I was 200 pounds. I was a fat kid, a fat teenager and now a fat adult.Thankfully, I'm getting help. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and am on meds that have really helped me to manage my symptoms. I'm also in therapy. I still struggle a great deal with comfort eating but it's slowly getting better. My weight has gone up and down but I haven't gained any weight in a long time. I'm confident that the weight will start coming off again soon.For so many of us, it's not so simple as "eating less." Life hurts, so we turn to food. I fight this battle every day and I just hope that I can one day love myself enough to get past the pain and become the healthy, happy person I was meant to be.  [info] Diet books are stu-pid!

gotstonoe [info] i say take the risk but ultimately it comes down to what your mental illness is like. If you think you can manage it or will be able to see a therapist while in uni then by all means go for it. Also uni is where a lot of people get mental illnesses since it is at about the age where they show up and the stress of uni can push the stress-diathesis. I would suggest if you do go don't overwork yourself, eat healthy, exercise, and create a solid support system while there. Don't be afraid of seeking help from profs, friends, and in some cases family. I was diagnosed with bipolar II this past year and i'm still in uni and working my ass off. I've learned as much as i can about it and seek therapy. It can get in the way at times tbh. It's hard but i've grown and learned so much these past couple of years that i don't regret coming. I'm glad i have my support system and i help them out when possible.I hope this helps [info] None [info] 1439580735
headexpl0dy [info] Look, I'm STILL walking in his shoes. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and medicated after years of self abuse and hatred for myself. I was convinced that death was the only option. I've been locked in a mental facility on HRSA and let me tell you, those state run facilities are hell, fucking hell! I almost died from the shit they were pumping down my throat and I saw brutality that you only see in movies. What kept me going? Knowing that feelings like these pass and that holding on till they do brings comfort. And as for the "what's the rush" I was trying to see why this person wanted to die and why living life didn't seem like an option anymore. And you come in accusing me of being insensitive?!?

chiefofthesky [info] Well if we're talking definitions, then yes, your lack of interest in sex seems to lean toward asexuality. The most important factor in the asexual definition (meaning all other factors are very individual-specific) is that you aren't *sexually attracted* to anyone. It doesn't mean you don't enjoy sexual pleasure, but it means when (if) you experience sexual desire it isn't a result of a specific person. This isn't taking into account gray asexuality of course. Aversion to/lack of desire for masturbation is another individual-specific factor that might be present, but isn't always. And you don't have to have sex to know you're asexual either. Hope that helps. I can answer other questions too. Edit: I am diagnosed with bipolar II. My libido definitely changes with my cycles, but I still never feel sexual attraction to a *person*. And whether it's due to my medications or what, my usual libido is pretty low. I don't get aroused easily. That's just me though.  [info] None [info] 1439930892
hms_surprise [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 9 months ago and figured out that I had been suffering from minor paranoid delusions for the past 24 years. Side note: I am completely 'normal' now. It's kind of laughable how long I spent being just on the edge of psychotic. No one could ever tell.There were days when I would start climbing and completely derealize (if you've ever been high and had the feeling of waking up over and over again, derealization is like that except scarier). There were other times that I would be in the middle of a route—especially multipitch—and have a full panic attack. Sometimes the weight of the world would hit me while crimping or jamming or anything and my arms would completely lose their ability to grip. There were a lot of uncontrollable tremors and stuff. And everything in between! Physiological symptoms of mental illness are sometimes the worst. It was very awful for a while. [info] None [info] 1440017816

hawkeyeking [info] The issue is, that I get paid hourly from 10am to 10pm, then a flat rate of 40 from 10pm till 7am, then I'm paid hourly to the end of my shift. The guys I support don't sleep well, so on a 'good' night I might get 2 hours sleep (any hours I'm awake and supporting we can claim, although they make it hard too, as you have to prove you were awake and supporting an individual). I get to 11am, and I start getting snappy and short tempered, which I feel has a negative impact on the support I can give as well as negatively impacting my working relationship with my colleagues. I'm also worried, as I was diagnosed with bipolar two years ago, and I'm worried that me getting fatigued and if I get snappy etc, then they will try an blame my bipolar and try and get ride of me Fingers crossed it goes ok.

wilbanks951 [info] I really do appreciated all of your words of encouragement! I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 for almost a year. I'm typing this on the mobile app so I might not remember everything you said and reply to it, but I am seeing a therapist as well. She's not much help, all she's really done is talk about herself and then ask me how things are going. I'm basically paying her $100+ an hour to talk to her about things I could talk to my friends about. She isn't really helping me get to the root of my problems. There was my first therapist, I've had three, who I might end up switching back to. She was the best but I just couldn't afford it at the time.  As far as being bipolar though I don't blame myself. I know this is a disease, I didn't choose to go through life like this (obviously.) But I do blame myself for my actions, even though I feel like I can't control them.  I recently starting talking to someone, they told me they really liked me and that they would help me through this. I believed this person, and now I'm afraid, after a depressive episode last night, that they're gone. This was someone I really liked. And I screwed it up.  I think the thing that pushes people away is the constant whining. At least that's how they may see it. I'm sorry I get depressed, sad, tired, lonely, or don't want to go out like a normal person. But I'm not normal. I'm... this. This thing that I hate. This thing that hides behind a mask. I've built such a large cement wall around myself that nobody will ever be able to break in. Yeah there might be a few cracks, but I refuse to ever let anyone see the real me. Why? Because to them I'm insane. They don't understand. And it hurts to feel like the only one, especially with friends or in a relationship that someone even cares to understand the pain I go through on a daily basis. The sickness in my head.  I guess I'll wrap this up here, I wanted to mention one more thing about what you said about your job. I've been at mine, nothing big just retail, but I'm in the process of a promotion. I'm working full time (30+ hours) as well as going to school full time (12 credit hours).  I'm proud of myself for that, but at the same time I wish I could do more.  I don't think I'll ever be satisfied with myself or my happiness.  Again thank you for sharing everything you have with me so far. It's meant a lot and I'm really glad you understand.

TheHonourableCurls [info] Around my freshmen year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my way of coping was being a condescending demeaning prick to everyone. My grandfather and father were the exact same so I guess that's why I adapted that behavior as appropriate. But throughout high school no one pointed it out to me, I had friends so it didn't really bother me. It wasn't until I moved out and was one my own traveling and working that people actually told me I was an asshole. They explained why and how and for a while my outlook was "Well I've made it this far, why should I change for others?" Then it got the point where I was in a relationship with my now prepossessing girlfriend that I realized it was a problem and I had to change for her. It got to the point where I would act that way towards her and I could see she felt like a piece of shit when I spoke like that towards her. It's like seeing your mother cry. No matter what, even if it's your fault, it's the most deplorable feeling ever. So I changed, I talked to my girlfriend about it, decided I should get some help to figure things out and see what needed to be done. That was about 2 years ago and we've been together for almost 3 years now and we're happier then we ever were. I've been receiving the help I needed. Now whenever I see someone I knew in school I simply apologize for how I used to be, not that it really matters or that they remember but if it were me I'd appreciate someone doing that.

ImTotallyAHistorian [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and cluster b personality disorders. I was able to get my doctors to prescribe me any medication I wanted. I could play it off well and everything was like a game to me. I ended up addicted to benzodiazepines trying to commit suicide. i ended up on a 5150 and now I feel like I have to start back from square one as far as treatment goes. Basically it's very difficult for me to get proper treatment, I think. I went in seeking genuine treatment, knowing I had some mental issues. But halfway through, I realized nothing was helping me and I ended up playing everyone trying to help me. Now those doctors refuse to help me further my treatment. I've gone to a few doctors and I've never received anything more than a diagnosis. It's tough waiting around that long with nothing helping you. You end up feeling discouraged, and end up falling back to your old ways. It's like a continuous cycle of ups and downs and I just don't think many doctors want to deal with something like that.

MezzGFX [info] Story time. (I was probably considered the weird one after.. but bare with me)When I was younger I was diagnosed with bipolar. The doctor didn't believe in diagnosing younger kids with bipolar at the time, however he eventually did it after no other option. I attacked my mother, I would tell her I was gonna kill myself, I had trouble in school, I skipped school at a young age, I was a mess &amp; put my mother through a long and tough time for years. I never meant any of the actions I did. I was never going to kill myself. I regret all of it. And unfortunately, all of my actions were due out of anger. I couldn't control it. And every medication I was on only made it 10x worse.Eventually, the doctor had no other option but to send me to a special "home" with other kids that had problems. I was there for 2 weeks. And it was the longest 2 weeks of my life. To me, and other kids.. it felt like Jail.Before I tell you about it, you have to understand. My mother knew it wasn't the place for me. She loved me and knew all my actions were from my anger and not "me". But she had no other choice but to send me there for 2 weeks. When I got there.. There was some WEIRD kids. I KNEW I was not supposed to be in there. I was a perfectly normal kid.. with anger issues. That's all. And after seeing some of those kids, My anger problems did not even compare to some of those other's.The reason it felt like jail?We had separate rooms, and separate bed-times depending on ages. No bathroom breaks past 9pm for me. It was bed time. I couldn't leave my room at all once 9pm hit. There was a small office in the hallway with a worker that would watch all doors in case someone decided to leave their room. My mom could only visit me every few days. (She was the only person I wanted to see).. I remember crying at the window when she left because I didn't want to be there. I also remember seeing her cry as she walked to her car and saw my pounding on the window wanting to leave that god-forsaken place. Every time she would visit, she would bring me a book to read. (It was the ONLY thing I was allowed to have in my room. 1 bed, books, and clothes. The rooms were cold, dull, and the bed was a cott. Early mornings, every kid was woken up at the same time to eat breakfast. EVERY DAY WAS ON A SCHEDULE.. and every kid was treated differently and had different privileges depending on age. The older kids got to play the N64 in the hallway. And I was forced to watch reading rainbow with other kids in the living room EVERY. FUCKING. MORNING. And to top it off.. I never liked that show. But was forced to watch it after breakfast.(To this day, I can't watch that show or even listen to the theme song because of how much hatred I have of it and flashbacks of this "jail" I was at.)After reading fucking rainbow, we would go outside and play.. I guess that was the only time I really enjoyed because I got to be outside. It was heaven to me.And at night, every kid had a schedule to take a 10 minute shower. Then go to bed after a snack and 15 minute play-time. (again, depending on age)Now, the only reason I feel I was considered a "weird" individual when I left was because of the one thing that I look back at and feel proud of because of how much I hated that place.Remember when I said there were no more bathroom privileges after we went to bed? Well, I needed to use the bathroom quite late every night. Was I allowed to use the bathroom even though it was 4 doors from my room? No.What did I do? I took the extra blanket off my bed, threw it in the corner and pissed on it every other night. For nights on end... When it was finally time to go home, I remember some lady coming in and grabbing my blankets and such. She went to the corner, picked up the blanket with both hands and asked "Why is this blanket soaking wet?"My answer? "I sweat a lot when I sleep""Why does it smell like pee?"My answer? "Some people's sweat smell like pee?"I look back at this memory now that I'm older and realize.. She definitely knew I pissed on it. Do I give a fuck? lolnope. Fuck that place.

MK2579 [info] I'm late commenting but figure you will still appreciate a response. You are not alone. I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 and borderline personality disorder as well. It is hell on earth. I have done therapy and am on meds, which keeps me somewhat stable, but it is still excruciatingly hard to deal with. As though having one or the other isn't hard enough to deal with, having both is brutal. I am never truly stable, and constantly wonder which symptoms are caused by which disorder. My life is a series of extremes, my mood is constantly up and down and I never know if it is because my meds aren't working or if it is the borderline mood swings. It is a daily battle against my dysfunctional brain.  [info] None [info] 1440689629
neonfuture [info] I think it's hard to spend your whole life on the same antidepressant because after a while it starts to wear off, so you have to switch around. Transitioning from one medication to another is really rough because it's all trial and error, there's nothing that guarantees that people with your problems will be helped by a particular medication. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder two years ago and have been on medication ever since. Exercise really does help because no medication is perfect, but without it I wouldn't even be able to get myself to the gym multiple times a week. I imagine that a lot of people are like that--they need that baseline level of help before they can help themselves in other ways. tl;dr obviously this isn't the case for everyone but for some people yes, but not the same kind of antidepressant for the entire time. EDIT: that being said, things like diet and exercise can make medications much more efficient (or from another perspective, they make *you* much more efficient and it works in tandem with the meds) and you will absolutely feel worse if you treat your body like shit and rely on the meds alone to help you out. IME, once you get to a point where you're able to start taking care of yourself physically, you need to do it or else you'll be more or less subject to the whims of how the medication chooses to react to your brain chemistry.

claireplane [info] For me, it was all about fighting the urge, realizing I needed healthier chipping mechanisms, and reaching out to therapists and others who had stopped. I had a moment where I really wanted to cut, but I immediately stopped myself and I said, "this will not make the situation any better and I'm ready to get better." I must say, though, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have been on medicine and done a lot of therapy, so that is likely to have helped. If you ever need to talk, I'm here...

theoptionexplicit [info] I understand, but it's a bit more complex for me. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and cigarette smoking is actually used by myself and others like me as a coping mechanism. Quitting suddenly can induce a depressive episode. In fact, many mental health professionals don't advise quitting until the patient has been psychologically stable for several months (this is also in an attempt to make the patient more likely to succeed in quitting). This is why it was recommended to me to attempt a harm reduction method. If you look at the statistics for people with bipolar it's rather frightening. They are much less likely to succeed at quitting, and besides suicide, smoking is the #1 cause of death for us. I'm doing my best to not become a statistic. [info] None [info] 1441076254

Sad when I should have been happy, irrational with relationships, impulsive, angry, overly emotional at times, lacking emotion at other times.

One moment I'd be reading a book in my living room and the next I would be absolutely sure that my very loving parents hated me.I lived in a small town on the west coast my whole life and my college was in Chicago. That first night, something flipped in my brain. The flood gates of what was happening to me lifted and I went insane(not literally).

FlamingZebra [info] It made me realize a lot about the world. But also it split my ego with my ego-less self. A lot of times I have problems coming back to reality because reality is a place where ego will push you into a place where you work and make money and are a slave to society. I want to be successful, but losing me ego has caused me to realize that life isn't about anything that society says it is. Acid can help to a certain extent, but when you become addicted to escaping reality it becomes something that pushes you away from the world itself. I find disconnect in other people. However, I am getting better. I am going to treatment and learning ways to piece my reality back together.Edit: I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and taking acid took the different personalities in my head to a different level to the point where it's hard to know who I really am anymore. If you start feeling like acid is creating a different world for you, you should take a step back and take time to settle and understand that being able to cope and work with reality is a part of living a happy life. It is a beautiful drug don't get me wrong, but when you start getting to know people who take acid way more than they should, you start to realize how it can negatively affect someones life. It's a drug to take with caution. Every trip is a different experience, and for some people, it's hard to stop thinking they way they did when they trip. It's a powerful tool for altering the mind, but that doesn't always mean people use it in the right way. [info] None [info] 1442008774

decide [info] OP - Love what you're doing &amp; how you're inspiring others to journal. I'd love to hear what you think about the journaling app I made (and I share my story behind it too)...I was diagnosed with bipolar 5 years ago, but I've been able to be stable and happy for the past 3 years, predominantly off of medication. To achieve this, I needed to and fortunately was able to develop a high EQ (emotional intelligence). At least for myself I define the internal EQ aspect as: being able to understand which emotions you feel, pin-point what causes them, and being able to moderate them.I had the hypothesis that if I could create a tool get people tracking their emotions, I would be able to turn it into a tool to help people improve their self-awareness and emotional intelligence. After months of trying, I finally made it happen! We cloak the 'mood tracking' aspect by branding this as a journal, because it is. The way it works is you write a 200 character entry, and you select a mood. From there we present cool charts and visualizations. There's also a really powerful reflection tool. Do you remember the most positive or negative emotion you felt 6 weeks ago? what about 6 months ago? Do you know what caused it? Do you want to? You can with Stigma. Gahhh that feels so sales-man like. Eewww.I've been so focused on improving the product, I haven't been promoting it much and people seem to really like it. I'd love your feedback as to how we can improve it, you can actually message me directly through the app for live chat :) [info] None [info] 1442296851

-Master-Builder- [info] I wouldn't say it's negatively effected my life.I was diagnosed with bipolar type II when I in the USN, but I have been self-medicating with marijuana since I was about 14. After joining the military, I obviously stopped smoking marijuana. I didn't realize at the time that it was the only thing keeping my mood stable. During my time in the military, due to a combination of stress and lack of medication, I had the biggest psychotic episode of my life. This is what led to my hospitalization and diagnoses of bipolar type II.Now I'm vaporizing marijuana on a daily basis, and it helped me quit my cigarette addiction of 10 years. I haven't had a major episode in years, and I can fall asleep every night (insomnia comes hand in hand with bipolar).

Em42 [info] I have absence seizures (I know nothing like those of you with really serious, disruptive forms of epilepsy) and bipolar disorder.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 20 years ago, I'm 33, I've probably taken around 100 different medications in countless combinations, so I know meds suck, they don't work as advertised, the side effects are hell, drug regiments are complex and difficult to follow, I'm taking 7 different drugs right now at 4 different times a day.  One drug I've been on for a few years is Lamictal and it actually makes me less depressed (and with Topamax no more absence seizures yay), I don't know if it would have that effect if I weren't also bipolar, but it might.  It does dumb me down some (not as much as Topamax, honestly they should have just named that one Stupamax) but that effect has dissipated over time and isn't as bad now (plus I'm lucky I won the genetic lottery and have the IQ points to spare which helps some but I still fucking hate it).  Maybe they could try changing things up or adding something with some mood stabilizing properties to the therapy you're already on.  It's worth taking to your doctor about.Since I'm also bipolar I've had many suicidal thoughts over the years so I can really relate to how you must be feeling.  They come in a few forms, the "I just don't want to go on living" kind, which are the least serious but still very upsetting, the "I want to kill myself" kind (but have no plan), which is a little worse and really hard to cope with, and the "I'm going to kill myself and I know how and I know when" that last one, if you're having that, go to an ER and tell them you want to die and you have a plan.  You're a danger to yourself and you need help.  The first two fall under what's known as "suicidal ideation" the last one does not, it's the serious kind, when you start planning you really need help.  I hope you feel better soon, life isn't all shit, even when it seems like it is.  There are a lot of good things out there even if they aren't what you originally set out to do, I was pre-med before I became too sick to finish my schooling, being a doctor was all I ever wanted to do.  In some ways it became a trap and I've never been able to move on because that was the only plan I had.  I worked a lot of bullshit jobs since then.  I had a baby, unfortunately not with a nice guy (he beat me), but my son (11 now) while he has some issues (high functioning autism, ADHD) is really smart and kind and funny, I probably wouldn't have made it all these years without him.  I'm trying to get disability since I haven't been able to work since 2013, I figure if I do then I'll take a painting class or a bonsai class at the local botanical garden or something, get myself out of the house a couple days a week.  There are positive experiences that you're are still capable of having even if they aren't the super driven ideals you had in mind for your life.  You can still contribute to things in a positive way, there's always a need for people to do charity work and that's something you could do a bit of to keep busy while you job hunt.  I've done some work at shelters for victims of domestic violence (it was a good fit since I was a victim at one point in my life) and I found it to be really rewarding, I never left there feeling bad about myself, I always left feeling like I had done something meaningful, something good, it always made me feel better knowing I had made even a small difference in someone's life.What you're feeling now, it's not forever.  Things will look up again, maybe not how you expect, but they will, I promise.  I know it's cliche, but it's true, suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Every single person that has ever jumped off the golden gate bridge and lived says pretty much the same thing, to paraphrase "about half way down I realized all my problems were fixable except that I was falling to my death."  You will make it through this, you've gotten this far, I can tell from what you wrote that you're a strong person, forget about throwing in the towel and just focus on the little things that make life just a little better.  It's just like I tell my son everyday **"what are we going to do?"**  **"We're going to try to make today just a little bit better than yesterday"** you're not looking for a miracle, it's about **Progress Not Perfection**.

jenericyousername [info] Yeah, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago. Some mornings, I would wake up from having cried myself to sleep to think "Well that was certainly interesting" and almost forget about my existential angst for a portion of the day before I realize how unproductive I've been and how much of a failure I am.Annnnd lather, rinse, repeat.

dasoomer [info] It's a long story, but I'll truncate it. I was on the tail end of a 10 day party. I started in Austin for the F1 race, flew to Albuquerque, and flew to Vegas. There was a lot of alcohol, cocaine, and MDMA to help fuel the way.I stayed up the entire night doing MDMA and started drinking at breakfast prior to boarding my flight. I continued to drink on the plane and was sufficiently trashed when I landed. A buddy picked me up and we went back to his place. Needless to say I was sufficiently exhausted and needed to grab a few hours of sleep prior to continuing. This was my first experience with sleep paralysis and it TERRIFIED me. It was the worst experience of my life. I wanted to scream but couldn't. I tried rolling off of the bed with no luck. Regardless of what I did, nothing brought me out of it. I have no idea how long it was, but I know once I came out of it I started googling what was wrong. I looked through all of the potential causes and stopped after I counted 6 items that could have caused it. Once back home, I really reflected on everything and decided I needed professional help. I was diagnosed with bipolar mania and immediately started making the changes I needed to avoid that situation. [info] None [info] 1442778984
gurl_meat [info] That's a great way to describe the feeling of klonopin! I've been taking it for years to help me sleep, but when I need it the most it doesn't work (went from 0.5 mg to 1.0 over the last two years). I don't really enjoy thc. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar I tried some cbd candies in Colorado and it was the first time I fully enjoyed pot.

Jew_With_a_Knife [info] Seconding the mental issues! I'm admittedly a really picky eater (although nowhere near as bad as OP's bf), and after YEARS of struggling with that (and a plethora of other issues) I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My psychiatrist told me that picky eating and issues with food textures can often be related to disorders such as bipolar and borderline.That being said, with encouragement from my therapist and psychiatrist it is something I'm actively working on. But even before I got help I would have NEVER limited my partner to my shitty diet. That was my burden and mine alone, I've always known that it's an irrational behavior. Wanting to control your partner's diet like that hints at more than just food issues.Honestly OP, you should stand up for yourself! Eat whatever the fuck you want, and tell him that he needs serious psychiatric help for his control and food issues. [info] None [info] 1443211275

charlieq46 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in 2010 by a psychiatrist, it was treated by depakote which ruined an entire year of college for me. Depression was diagnosed by a general practitioner in early 2013 and then "rediagnosed" in early 2015 by a psychiatric nurse practitioner.Pituitary growth was diagnosed by MRI in Nov. 2014 by an endocrinologist.

Perpetuoso [info] Don't know if it matters that I'm male, 3rd generation, but I tried to commit suicide when I was 17 over some self-shame bullshit and my parents didn't make an issue of it either way. My mom was mad at the time, but it was never discussed further. I don't think they knew what to do and what to make of it. I did see a counselor for a while. Many years later, I was diagnosed with bipolar after I kind of lost it - full blown delusions of being surveilled by local college students, spycams and everything, who could also manifest themselves as solid holographic 3D avatars, and where they could appear in photographs to taunt me...pretty fucking insane. I never got violent though, just frightened. Violence was never a consideration. The circumstances were I was living thousands of miles from home, far from family &amp; friends - literally no social support, isolated - I'm usually very social, but I was a city kid in a rural area and I just did not click with any of the locals, lack of sleep, and lots of alcohol in order to try to get to sleep. Police were called as I was in the parking lot of the apartment complex talking to "them" and the justifiably concerned neighbors were afraid I would hurt myself; again, I never acted or spoke in a way to suggest violence towards others. I consented to voluntary observation that immediately turned involuntary as soon as I entered the facility. Over the course of a week, I related my delusions, which I swore were real, that I knew it *sounded* crazy, but I was the exception. So medication was prescribed and after a calming and cooling out period, I was released. Been on the meds since asnd things have been fine, no more drinking. I made the mistake of telling one of my brothers who has since used that against me whenever we get into a verbal altercation. He hasn't told any of my other siblings or my parents, and I haven't told them. I've told a couple of really close friends and they have been supportive. I've also moved back to my home range. It was pretty frightening, and seeing the delusions for what they were had to come on my own. No 3rd party was going to be able to convince me otherwise. [info] None [info] 1443663500
riker89 [info] Incorrect, there are other reasons for failure. For example, I flunked out because I was near-suicidally depressed, self harming, and many days literally did not get out of bed except to eat or pee. A year or so later, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. So it wasn't that I didn't do my best, my best just wasn't enough at the time. Now that I've successfully been in treatment for a few years, I'm looking forward to going back next fall.  [info] None [info] 1443699159
MonarchSW [info] This is downright dehumanizing, what you're saying. I've been diagnosed with bipolar. And let me tell you, it's as real as any chronic disease. In fact, it can only be treated effectively by medication like and chronic physical illness!Have diabetes? Take insulin every day for the rest of your life and change your diet. Have bipolar?

narwhalactivist [info] I've had my moments. I was diagnosed with bipolar II when I was 16. My advice is a little different and I find it more effective in reminding myself why I'm here. In all reality, we're going to die. Awesome, right? As an atheist, I believe once you're done, the lights go off. Poof. The best part? Our lives are so fucking insignificant that none of this matters. Hear me out, we're here right now. Life throws a lot of shitty things at you, but it also has a lot of great experiences to offer. So you know what? Suck all the life you can out of this world before you go out. This life, your suffering, even happiness, it's all temporary. Find something worth living for. *But narwhalactivist, that's so easy to say. Don't tell me this generic bullshit.* Seriously, it could be anything. Learning something you've always wanted to learn. Turns out it wasn't your thing? Fuck it! Find something else! I've tried learning an instrument, crocheting my favorite LoL characters, making Youtube videos, etc. And guess what? I sucked at all of it! But you know what, I was excited to learn and progress, and even though it didn't turn out to be my cup of tea, I'm still alive. Take it day by day. Help yourself out. Family sucks? Use that as motivation to put yourself in a position that gets you out of there. You have three people inside of you. Past LibrtyUniversity, Present LibrtyUniversity, and Future LibrtyUniversity. The game is to help each one out. Set Future up for success so that when the time comes, that Present you can be like "Hey, thanks Past LibrtyUniversity! Because of you, I'm happier than I would have been if you wouldn't have done xyz." Set yourself up for success. Not only do you deserve it, but you'll thank yourself and be so happy. I'm not going to make any comment on the girlfriend situation because I don't have enough details on the reasons why you're not digging her.Student loans? /r/personalfinance has you covered. Bull fucking shit you're alone. My inbox, as well as other users on here have an open one. Dude, prediagnosis (fuck, even after) I've done a lot of self-destructive things. You're not alone. I don't know who the hell you are, and you don't know me, but as a fellow homeosapien, I'd hate to lose one of my own to a state of mind that may just need a little nudge in the right direction to get over.I would also highly suggest looking into the basic principles of Buddhism.

FurriesRuinEverythin [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar II and I'm in the process of being assessed for ASD. I begin the assessment tonight and I'm really on edge today...Anyways, my friends all know I'm bipolar, some suggested it before I was diagnosed. They've seen my behaviour during my hypomanic and depressive phases and seen my mood swings.They've also been telling me for years that I should be assessed for ASD.So they (my friends) all know and they're accepting.  My family do not, and will not ever know. I don't tell anyone else. Apart from on reddit. I don't think anyone needs to know. If you have good friends they will accept you no matter what.

geekyphilosopher [info] I'm actually in exactly the same situation. The BPD diagnosis fitted all my symptoms perfectly but when I went to see a psychiatrist I was diagnosed with bipolar with BPD traits. I've been to see a few psychiatrists now for second opinions and it's pretty much the same thing everywhere. When I asked my current psychiatrist about it, she told me that she doesn't like to give out BPD diagnoses because of the stigma attached to the illness. I personally think that's ridiculous because the stigma attached to bipolar is just as bad, and the most important thing is to get an accurate diagnosis but that's what my doctor told me. Maybe your doctor has a similar mentality? It might be worth asking about. I also had similar problems when I went on abilify. I'm on 5mg as well, and have been for a couple months, but when I went on it alone it caused really violent mood swings. For me it got a million times better when the abilify was paired with a mood stabilizer (lamictal in my case). You should definitely talk to your psychiatrist/therapist about all this and explain your worries and hopefully they'll be able to come up with a solution that works for you.

Celarcade [info] Is there a reason that you can't tell your parents you've gone to a psychiatrist? Are you safe if they find out you've gone to see one? You're right: It would probably be relatively expensive to see one out-of-pocket if you don't make a lot of money. For my family, even $200 is a lot of money, so I totally understand. If it's just a matter of having an argument over it with your parents, I would put on my brave face and do it. You don't owe them an explanation. Just use the insurance and get the prescription you need. I also think you should use all the resources available to you, including those available at school. It probably won't replace the help of a real psychiatrist, but in conjunction with his/her help, it could make a difference. Even just having someone to talk to can make a huge difference. I've been under the care of a psychiatrist for a few years. I'm diagnosed with bipolar type II with psychotic features. Before that diagnosis, I was also diagnosed with PTSD. If you want to talk, I'm just a PM away. [info] None [info] 1444675481
swedishgoron [info] I was very afraid of that when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but at the end of the day you have to make a choice between staying who you are (depressed) or meeting the you without symptoms.

herbistheword [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at age 22! In my experience, life has been a total 180 since my diagnosis... So many of the things that, up until that moment, felt to me like personal failures and flaws were explained by my disorder. I learned to spot signs of the onset of an episode (for me, I develop bouts of insomnia before any behavior effects kick in. If I can can get myself to sleep during these pre-episodic symptoms, I can abort the swing completely!) and my therapist and medication have helped me develop into a more grounded person that I'm proud to be.Basically- it sounds scary because there's such a stigma associated with it. It implies that your life and emotional state is out of your control... but in reality, a correct diagnosis is the moment you get to reclaim your control.Don't let yourself be defined by a disorder you have. Define yourself by the person you become and the actions you take. If you wanna talk ever, or have any questions, please shoot me a PM. You aren't alone! [info] None [info] 1444937925
JustaLittleDuckie [info] I wouldn't full on say she is a scumbag, but absolutely scumbagish.My younger sister is very naive and self centered. My older sister and I have been holding out hope that she matures with experience but I have since abandoned all hope.A few months ago she graduated from college, got a job, and then was fired "for no reason" although there are plenty of reasons (namely the fact that she dressed so provocatively in a business environment that the company set up a mandatory meeting just to review the dress code. Three times). My parents have been her other source of income since forever and had then cut her off. So, then she is fired and for the first time she experiences what it is like to not have enough money for food, have to choose between rent and car payment, etc. So, being a mom of 3 paycheck-to-paycheck, I call her several times a week. I walk her through the process of asking for extensions on her bills, explain the process of welfare. I encourage her, support her, reassure her that her lack of employment does not mean she is a bad person, etc. I am supportive. Damn it.So one week she gets a new job. Yay!!! That same week, I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This is emotionally devastating. I am confused, alone, devastated, terrified. Not to mention my career is over. I am lost. Scared.I tell her through email. She responds that I not "throw it in peoples faces to get sympathy" and to not expect special treatment.I still haven't gotten over it. I haven't mentioned it since, and likely never will. But it really crushed me. I am not a whiner. I am not attention seeking at all (actually, she is) so it really broke my heart.I still haven't gotten over it. Can you tell? Lol [info] None [info] 1445015465

13XRay13 [info] Hey fellas, quick question. I've brought this issue up several times before, so I'll try to keep it brief. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was four years old. I had no cause to question the diagnosis, so I just took my meds and talked to whichever professional my mother had set me up with at the time. However, my aspirations to become a police officer have caused that diagnosis to be a source of concern for me. Recently, new information has come to light that leads me to believe the diagnosis was in error, and even if that is not the case, my mother, who was a medical professional herself, and my psychiatrist both told me that I would likely outgrow the disorder after puberty. As it stands right now, I'm 20 years old, and I was cleared by my psychiatrist earlier this year to stop taking medication, and my files have been updated to mark me as being "In Remission". I'm trying to find a way to have the whole thing marked as a misdiagnosis, but either way, I have no mental issues that would cause me to become a liability or impair my ability to do my duty. So, to get to the point, what should I expect when I apply? My current department of choice is the LAPD. Research has led me to believe that California does not automatically disqualify applicants for mental diagnoses, and suitability is determined on a case by case basis. I can't find much beyond that however, so I thought I'd ask you guys. I've been told I'm an excellent candidate, and I'd like for someone to tell me honestly what I'm in for when I disclose this information, which I will be doing. I see no point in lying.

octopus_dog [info] I used to like politics. I was a self-described libertarian in college. I would almost obsessively keep up with current events and loved to discuss the possibilities that could arise from each decision. Now, some three years later, I couldn't give less of a shit. I don't read the news anymore, I don't have any political ideology, and I'm starting to think that holding strong opinions of any sort is an all-around bad idea.It changed when I went to a psychiatrist. I wasn't sleeping more than a few hours a night, hadn't eaten in a week prior to the appointment, and was convinced that I was in danger for posting my opinions about things online. After an hour long appointment, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was thought to be in the throes of a manic episode.I was a 20 year old self-described libertarian who read conspiracy websites almost exclusively and visited the YouTube channels of complete whackjobs spouting "truth" every day for at least 5 hours -- and I had been doing so for years.Once the mood stabilizers took effect, it was like I woke up from a bad dream.  I was simultaneously embarrassed and horrified at how easily I'd been sucked in. I never want anything like that to happen again. [info] None [info] 1445476850

enmason [info] I've taken the quiz before all of this shit happened (and before I was diagnosed with bipolar). I got INTJ. It will be interesting to see how (or if) my personality type changed.Okay so after taking the test again, I am INFP, but it says I'm on the border between E&amp;I. So I'd say I'm more like XNFP.

isSlowpokeReal [info] I was 21 when I was diagnosed with bipolar I and there's a similar stigma in my family, plus growing up with movies like Garden State. I haven't had any negative experiences with the medicine I'm taking, a baby dose of depakote. I'm 23 now and I've been on the same medicine and the same dose for almost two years exactly. I gained some weight when I started (135lb--&gt;145lb) but I've since gotten back down to my starting weight and there are other factors I believe contributed to my weight gain (cut hours at physical job, started school, settled into relationship). It's possible the depakote had nothing to do with it. The medicine also makes me feel "tired" because I was used to having so much energy from being manic. I often want to take a nap in the afternoon but I can easily power through with coffee or an energy drink.If the first medicine you try doesn't work after the right amount of time (I think depakote takes 2 weeks?), you can always go back to the doc and ask for something different. Being on medicine is so much better than dealing with the moods. I still have emotions, they're just not overpowering anymore. 10/10 will stay on forever [info] None [info] 1445917212
_Just_To_Get_By_ [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar in May, but my psychiatrist is planning on changing my Dx to Borderline when I turn 18 in a couple months.  You can't diagnose yourself.  The only way you can get diagnosed is by a psychiatrist or a qualified mental health professional.  You are looking up the symptom checklist.  The criteria is broad enough that you can diagnose anyone with it if you try hard enough.  Also, think of it this way.  Do you really want the label of Borderline?  A lot of people hate and stereotype Borderlines.  I want my diagnosis to be correct more than anything so I know exactly what is wrong with me so I can try and fix it.  Do you want that?  Or do you just want it so you can flaunt that you have a Dx.If it really concerns you, bring it up with your therapist or psychiatrist. Honestly, what you are describing is just reading off a symptom list, and it doesn't seem that you think there are reasons for you to feel this way.  The major thing about Borderlines is that our disorder is based on how we react to things, where something like bipolar is just how you are with no reason for it.  I'm confident that the Borderline Dx is correct because my psychiatrist specializes in it and he was recommended to me by my therapist, who made the initial suggestion that it was Borderline, while the psychiatrist Dxed me with Bipolar initially, but as I said, he told me he is planning on changing it to Borderline when I turn 18.  I'm okay with the Dx of Borderline as long as it's accurate.  Are you okay with it?  Do you really want a label? [info] 17 [info] 1446001105
kamace11 [info] These were my exact symptoms as a child- the anger, fits, and OCD-like self harming (the latter of which I still deal with). I was just diagnosed with bipolar II this past year (26 now). It's totally possible that your daughter is just going through a stage, but this could be a sign of much worse things to come. Because I did not receive treatment until a later age, I spent most of my youth fairly miserable, and I am just now starting to get healthy. I wasted my childhood sick and without treatment because my parents thought I just had to "outgrow" it or "toughen up". Please, don't be like my parents. Impress upon your husband how this is not about him or his beliefs, but about the happiness and childhood of your little girl. It's not fun to feel so emotionally up and down as a kid- she may go right back to being happy, but that doesn't mean the pain and frustration she's feeling isn't having an impact on her (i.e., the nail biting). Also let him know that this is preventative- God willing with good help she won't end up in a much worse situation later on. If it is bipolar, it will get much worse with adolescence as well- however, early treatment means you can lead a happy and normal life. Do NOT ignore this just to make him comfortable. This is about her wellbeing and health, not his comfort level. Think about it like you would vaccines.   [info] None [info] 1446180612

1playerpiano [info] Or even just talking about it. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder my junior year in high school, and when I would go a few months feeling really depressed (read: suicidally depressed) my dad would always say "I don't care why you're in such a bad mood, you need to get over it" or "Whatever your deal is, you need to move on"...It really took its toll on me, and I didn't start therapy until I was forced to see the school's counselor because of some "concerning" english reports.Even my mom, who I love to death, is bad about it... I'll explain things to her and she says "oh I feel like that sometimes... I just drink lots of water and go for a walk and I feel better"... I know she's trying to help, but she honestly doesn't seem to understand. Maybe she does, but she's not talking about it.I've been to therapy in college too, for a few months last year and for about a month this year, but I can't bring myself to talk about anything while I'm there because of how I was raised.

quix27 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar after having one manic episode brought on by situational factors. Luckily I was able to ditch the meds they tried to give me while continuing to see my psychologist at the time and worked through the trauma that had caused the manic episode.Something to consider, do you feel like your mood swings are random or situational based? I think if they are situational, then drugs may not be all that effective. If you feel like you are taking drugs that aren't helping you (and especially if they are hurting you), you should probably talk to a professional about it. I have a lot of people doubting me too. Especially because my discovery of ASD (and the likelihood that I am on the spectrum) is still really new. Being an adult female is particularly difficult to diagnose, but hopefully that will change as more research is done. [info] None [info] 1446588961
Furiousme [info] Thanks for your thought out reply. Writing this post helped me put out my feelings about this situation, it was freeing in a way. I'm not going to tell people about what he's done. There are enough people out there that are aware and hopefully his reputation will follow him. I'm out of the dating pool. I've not attempted to be close to anyone since this happened back in April. Like I said, I can't really get close to people or trust my own judgement about others. I'm still very polite and friendly outwardly. I put on a strong appearance and nobody has caught on. I prefer it that way. People are drawn to me for some reason. The only time I go out in public is to attend classes and work on assignments at the library, and I often get approached by classmates to chat or study. I'm not going to day dream of exposing him anymore. Im working on forgiving myself. I'm gonna just keep to myself and see about getting through each day. I am diagnosed with bipolar 1, and I don't want to procreate and pass these genes along.

maotzu [info] I tried a few different mood stabilizers (lithium, lamictal, topamax), risperdol, and prozac. None of those worked well for me, or they made things much much worse. I've tried these things for the past 1.5 years or so (that's when I was diagnosed with bipolar and started seeing a psychiatrist). My symptoms have been the same for a long time, besides the joint pain which is relatively new. Everything else has just slowly been getting worse for years now.

TangledUpInAzul [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple years ago. Because of a few factors in my particular case, it was statistically like a doctor telling me, "There's a 90% chance you'll kill yourself before you're 40." In the days that followed the diagnosis, I probably listened to Looking Like You Just Woke Up fifty times. It has, in fact, gotten harder and only slightly easier to hide. It's scary knowing just how steep and potentially short the uphill climb will be for me. That's my lifelong aching.Also, "When I am sad, oh god, I'm sad, but when I'm happy, I am happy," is *painfully* relevant to me. I'm like 95% sure Brian or someone very close to him has bipolar disorder because of how specifically relevant to bipolar disorder many of his lyrics are.  [info] None [info] 1447908719
iamthefragbot [info] I am not prior military, but my father, several uncles, and a couple close friends of mine are all former marines. They all know that I was diagnosed with bipolar, and they all told me not to enlist. They told me I most likely wouldn't be accepted, and if I got off my meds I wouldn't be able to handle the stress that goes along with it. I don't know 100% for sure if they will discharge you for bipolar, but I don't think they would. If you'd like I can ask a couple people including some friends who are currently in and see if they can find out. Is it possible for you to see a civilian doctor? Lots of psychs out here where I live in Georgia don't take insurance and operate strictly on cash, including mine. It may be worth looking into and you can kinda try to keep it on the down-low for a while until you get a handle on it. But I would hate to see you start a business and be working your ass off only to run into a severe depressive episode and have to stop everything because you can't get yourself motivated to continue.

SoButtscrewed [info] I went through something similar, OP! I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one. I was diagnosed with bipolar in the Air Force about a year in and had attempted suicide. My actions also led to a stripe being removed (which I never think is the right thing to do with someone diagnosed with mental illness). I personally faced my leadership not being as understanding (my commander even said he didn't think I was mentally ill!). I think it's great you wrote this because it's important for people to understand what mental illness is like and that it's not a state of mind that goes away by smiling or watching sponge bob and pretending everything is hunky dory. In most cases it sticks with you for life. I've been out of the Air Force for about 6 months and the outside world will do you so much better. I'm off my medication, I've lost 30 pounds (gained 100 in the military), and I have a job where I feel appreciated and needed, and have time to spend on myself.

eccentricmanic [info] If you are comfortable with telling him,  you could tell him what you're going through-  that you're taking meds for a condition. Don't feel pressured to say flat out "I'm bipolar" but I guess you can reveal that you have a medical history where you need meds to help you deal with mood swings through the days and see how he takes it from there. Ideally after you have met up in person and get to know each other personally face to face for some time. From my personal experience, if I care about the person enough, I always tell the person I'm dating that "I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder". On a side note, I had a therapist tell me not to say "I'm bipolar" because bipolar doesn't define you as a person, but it's a medical condition you're dealing with. If he's worth while as a boyfriend he would be understanding and patient with you and listen to what you want to reveal about your medical condition. If he's not accepting then probably it's not worth being with someone who can't be emotionally supportive. I know it's hard when a boyfriend doesn't respond right away,  since he seems to be dealing with his dad and his medical issues,  but try to just be patient. He will get back to you if he cares.

googuxcan [info] Yeah, when you have both it is called "co-morbid bipolar disorder with adhd". I am diagnosed with bipolar 1 and adhd-pi. It took a long time to diagnose both, as I'm pretty mellow due to the adhd and my manic stages are easily hidden because I withdraw from my own social groups and go out on my own seeking thrills. Plus, no drugs. So I've got that going for me. If you think you have both, you need to see a psychiatrist and have them really observe you for a while.

quantum-freedom [info] From about aged 19-22 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II, which is where you bounce from feeling normal for a few days to being clinically depressed for a few weeks. I was also diagnosed with adult A.D.D. I tried over 10 types of prescription medications. Almost none of them worked for me. I would be stuck in my parents basement for weeks at a time. I couldn't hold a job. I had a long distance girlfriend who I would see about once a month.My whole life changed when I stumbled upon a book called Seth Speaks. I went from there to discovering Bashar, and then finally Abraham-Hicks. The Abraham material helped me the most, especially the books Ask and It Is Given and Law of Attraction. I went from the experience I described earlier, to moving to the city my girlfriend lived in, finding a job for $11/hr, finding the perfect apartment, marrying her. I also got off of all the prescription medicine I was on. I was gifted a car. I was gifted a washer and dryer. I now play instruments in two punk rock bands, and I make almost $100 per gig or more where I use to make nothing from music.I just quit my job to pursue an I.T. certification, which I got. I was then offered two jobs, and I took one that pays me $45K per year, and within a few years I will be on track to earning over $100K per year. Please bare in mind that all of these manifestations I'm mentioning were over the course of a 2-3 year period. It takes time, yes, but I have no doubt I wouldn't have been able to do it without LoA processes that I've learned.Meditation is a must. Look up a few ways of meditation and choose the method that you are most attracted to. It is the quickest and easiest way to release resistance. I've had manifestations after meditating almost immediately, like a job offer. Also one of my favorite processes is having a small journal where I write down the things I want in the present tense as if I already have them. I read a few of the affirmations once or twice a day, and I feel really good about them and imagine having them. An example is I wrote down, "I am receiving $1,000 in a positive, unexpected way." I repeated for a short few minutes the affirmation in my head, and I imagined receiving the money, and what I would spend it on. I almost completely forgot about it, until about three weeks later, when I received a call from my wife. Someone had showed up to her work, dropped off $1,000 in crisp, new $100 dollar bills as a gift for my wife and I anonymously. I was stunned. This was my first "big" manifestation. We even knew the security guy and tried to get security footage from that day, and the cameras were down just that day.Study every day. Read LoA related books. Go on youtube and listen to Abraham-Hicks, and maybe even Bashar material if it suits you. Apply processes every day. Most importantly, try to feel as good as you can in the present. Good luck, my friend. [info] None [info] 1449547237
yakimavalleyhops [info] See someone now or ASAP. No time like the present. This shit won't just get better, and the more responsibilities you have and the higher the stakes, the worse it gets. I also bought adderall from friends sometimes in college. It was a huge part of the culture at my college (that I ended up washing out of). But unlike my friends, I couldn't function without it. The semester I continually bought adderall from the apparently vast number of people with totally crooked doctors continually was the only semester I passed all my classes (I spent most of my time otherwise on academic probation). I didn't recognize at the time though that I wasn't using it like the other people and that what I was getting out of it wasn't the same. I ended up washing out of college twice, and I didn't understand "why." I just thought I was some kind of nebulous "crazy." I knew so many people who were diagnosed with ADHD (who almost all now say they didn't really have it) that it seemed really silly to me. I was like, surely not everyone can get away with doing this ADHD shit (I didn't take it seriously at the time because of everyone I knew who was diagnosed and then sold all their pills, it seemed very minor if even real to me, and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and bought into that because I was clearly much more of a mess than the people I knew who were diagnosed with ADHD, I didn't get how serious ADHD actually is or can be). I thought, surely someone has to be just a total fuck-up?You have actual insight into what is going on with you, and that is a great thing. Once you come to the realization that you have a real problem, you can move forward. You can make a game plan. That's power. It's rough, but you can take control of it. [info] None [info] 1449604490

kybp1 [info] My mom is diagnosed with bipolar type 2; I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 1. I was undecided about for three years. I didn't believe in mania, for one. After two years in denial about my ever-worsening manic episodes, I finally decided that whatever is meant by "bipolar type 1" is similar enough to my experience for me to justify trying BP1 treatments. And, lo and behold, lithium brings me out of mania (and the psychosis of peak mania...). Meanwhile, my sister and brother have no bipolar symptoms or diagnoses....  You may not have "bipolar 2," whatever that is. And, as someone with what I consider to be bipolar 1, even I'm *a little* iffy on what "hypomania" looks like. But -- without seeking to convince you to decide in favor of 1) bipolar two's existence or 2) that you have it -- I do vouch for how useful the "bipolar" diagnosis and treatments can be for providing effective solutions to people's health problems. If you're interested and/or haven't done so already, you might lurk around /r/bipolar/. Posts from people unsure about their symptoms or diagnoses are common and welcome.

Bittykillakitty [info] I'm not surprised. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 because of a hypomanic episode after being prescribed Effexor. Within a week after an increase in dosage I was...gone... Hallucinated and everything. I told my psych nurse that the same thing happened after taking Prozac about a decade ago, when I was a teenager, but she gave me antidepressants anyway.

idontcareyoupicksome [info] I am also 19 and in college. I was diagnosed with bipolar at 15. Instead of trying to take time to address my diagnosis I keep myself really busy to ignore my issues. I really regret this. I don't think you are making a mistake, but if you don't commit to a few things (take an art class, enroll in classes part time, volunteer), that's also not healthy. No matter what you do, there are always major downsides to your choices because bipolar requires so many life modifications that can't be perfectly satisfied. Try putting yourself in new situations, take a trip, change you surroundings, trick your brain into being stimulated so it doesn't sit in the comfort zone of mental illness.

Like you, I research everything about it, and also price check it ten times over, and spend months before I make the decision.The only times I've spent money was when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my medications made it worse, to the point where I was ALWAYS manic.

ceffer [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder nos at 17 and went through a lot of situations similar to this that year and the few following it until I was able to get stable and really understand my disorder. The fact that your mom is there sitting by you and wanting you to take your meds and that your dad wants to take you to the hospital means they care. They really care. And they're not going to give up on you. I know it's so easy to take it out on them because they're right there in front of you. They're the ones trying to force things and make you "better." My advice is to just tell them you love them tomorrow or next week, sometime, just a little sign to them that this challenge is worth it for all of you. You WILL get through this. They won't give up if you don't. Edit: sorry, read that as your dad wanted to take you, I see now it's your mom. Either way I feel like they really do care.  [info] None [info] 1451198604
downhillwalrus [info] This happened to me. My doc threw fluoxetine at me and sent me on my merry. Three weeks later I felt like Jesus and thought things were getting better. My doc said "oh that's good". Except it wasn't, I was drinking heavily, got kicked out of where I was living, sleeping in my car, missing class, and the worst part was I didn't (couldn't?) think anything was wrong. It wasn't until I was describing the changes to the university physician during a flu shot and she sent me to the psychiatrist that I was diagnosed with bipolar. While there was no real indication that my doc should have been worried (to put me on prozac in the first place), I feel like that should have been something that was brought up or at least looked for by a GP in the following weeks. Looking back now on that episode is terrifying. [info] None [info] 1451226722

PositiveNed [info] The symptoms you described are hypomania. I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 which means hypomania,  I can relate to you. What you describe is essentially hypomania, which is less severe than mania. [Mania often requires hospitalization due to the damage they are doing. Hypomania, on the other hand, may be an unusual mood, and it may cause some harm to the person or their lifestyle, but not to the point where they need to be hospitalized.

I take 12.5mg at night and 5mg during the day. It used to make me sleepy during the day but once I got used to it it helped regulate my mood.  [info] None [info] 1451534543

hermosarosa [info] I like to think I'm pretty unique. Let's do this statistics-wise. I'm female, American, narrows it down to 157 million. I attempted suicide in October, that narrows it down to 0.9 million. I was diagnosed with bipolar II this year, that means that 200,000 people could share my experience. Ooh, and on top of the bipolar, God blessed me with this wonderful thing called Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome, so every time I'm hypomanic and stay up all night, my internal clock resets for me to sleep at ~3-5am. That brings me down to 157,000 people who could have the same exact experience, at least the number of people who could have DSPS is smaller than the number with bipolar II. The number of people who drop out from my faculty in my university each semester is about 100, so I hit that landmark last month. I think it's safe to narrow it down to 1 at this point, because I really doubt anyone has my exact life. At least, I hope they don't. [info] 1∆ [info] 1452387819
Niconini [info] I'll start this story by saying I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder. So this story is mostly about that. As a result of being given antidepressants, I was thrown into a manic episode at the wonderful age of 15. I stayed up for about four days, only sleeping at max like two hours if that counts. I even took those 50mg sleeping pills you buy at drug stores to try and sleep. Nah. Didn't phase me a bit. I just couldn't stay asleep. Day one was chill. I was pretty okay. Day two it started getting to me a bit. I was more irritable that day. By day three I was out of it. I was hearing voices and seeing shit in my peripheral vision. But I kept trucking on. By day four I was convinced the government was after me, I was so jittery I was hopping in my seat, and the voices were a lot more prominent. Then again, this was a manic episode. But the fact I wasn't sleeping was probably contributing to the severity of it. I do not remember the rest of the episode, and I have to rely on what my friends and parents told me I did. Moral of the story: sleep is good for you! Please sleep!!  [info] None [info] 1452474819

jessaloo [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar and ptsd ...amongst other things. Every visit I've had has brought on different diagnosis, and not everyone agrees.

I'm still learning/coping with my own issues but, you aren't your illness. Just because you may be bipolar doesn't mean you are crazy, or ruined for life.

FurriesRuinEverythin [info] I don't think they are. They're commonly misdiagnosed though. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and possible ADD before ASD. I believe that BP was an incorrect diagnosis. My psychologist thinks that I could have both, I don't believe this is so. I didn't understand what was happening to me a lot of the time, why I was strange, why I behaved the way I do, why I think the way I do. So I used to think I was depressed for no reason, rather than recognising the things happening in life and having an inability to explain what was going on with my head. That's become easier since learning about ASD and having a better understanding about the way my head works. It's probably the same for a lot of people. They don't understand why they're depressed, so they say they become depressed for no reason, then they get diagnosed with bipolar disorder. [info] None [info] 1452643355

Mephistia [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teen, and always suspected I was misdiagnosed --- long story, family background and mom projecting her own illness and I actually have ADHD and whatnot -- but one of the key factors in my ultimate realization that I was in fact not bipolar was reading about how the disorder presents in children. Apparently bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are beginning to be viewed by some as less separate illnesses and more as the same illness on a spectrum of severity. Normally, these mental health disorders present in adulthood -- twenties, as our brains finish developing.Occasionally, they present much younger. I read a series of articles in the early aughts in Tme and Parenting and some medical journals about bipolar presentation in children, and they all basically said that kids who have bipolar will act out in extremely violent, self-harming,and repetitive ways. It's confusing to psychiatrists who are used to looking for "adult" markers of manic and depressive cycles, but the youth of the child means they lack the emotional maturity and structures of dealing with extremes in emotion, so they respond by becoming violent or dissociative. Also, hallucinations  (auditory, visual, and tactile) are normative symptoms in a bipolar manic state. So while its impossible for a layperson to diagnose over the internet, I would strongly suggest that you try to find a child psychiatrist who specializes in bipolar disorder to look him over, just in case. If nothing else, they might have suggestions or ideas for a direction in which to point you.  [info] None [info] 1452713879

poopscoopmcgee [info] Heh thanks! It has been a long, painful, almost deadly road.I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 20. I think I've had it since I was 11 though. That's the first time I remember wanting to die. It took until I was about 28 to finally feel like I had a good grip on everything, so about 8 years from diagnosis. Within that 8 years was 3 suicide attempts, about a month in hospitals, and months of group therapy, as well as 3 different individual therapists. Hmm, has anything stuck out from therapy... one time in group therapy, we had to write a sentence about everyone in the group. We ended up being a pretty tight group so this wasn't awkward really. Someone described me as "a mighty little giant," because I'm such a strong person in a little body. And for some reason that meant the world to me. That group in particular did wonders for me. I was in it for 7 weeks and I feel that it kind of got me to the next stage of recovery. The best things I've taken from therapy is that it gives me perspective- a professional is there to tell me when I'm being ridiculous or when it's actually not me, it's them- mostly that second part. I would fault myself for everything, even things completely out of my control. She was able to get me to see how that wasn't the truth. That and when they say you have to change your thought patterns, you have to change how you talk to yourself- it's true. I thought that was a bunch of shit for years but when I actually started to do it, it made a difference. I mean it still sounds like psychobabble to me but it works. Here is how I know I've made it "to the other side." Whenever something bad would happen to me (for instance, my boyfriend dumped me out of the blue and then i lost my job a couple days later) I would fall apart. After that particular incident though, something clicked in my head. I can't control other people, and I barely can control how I react to things, but I have to work with what I can control. So I made a very conscious effort to control how I react. It's hard sometimes, but that has also made a big difference. Honestly, what helped the most was finally getting stability- a job that didn't fire me, learning to love myself and be comfortable with being single. Then add being really good at that job and working for someone who understands mental illness, and it gives a good foundation to work from. I hadn't had that until 2014. Sorry for the wall of text! I'm happy to answer any questions. Don't beat yourself for not being 'on the other side.' Also, and I never forget this- I could end up back on the other side, no matter how hard I try not to. This is a disease and it will come roaring back from time to time. I can only do my best to deal with it, and if I falter, I have built a support circle to catch me and help me. I'm grateful I have that, because a lot of people don't.  [info] None [info] 1452903687

I've learned to hide my emotions, but they're definitely still there, ruling my inner life.I always thought my mom was just as emotional as me, that I got it from her. But one of the hardest things for me to realize was that her emotions are all completely rehearsed and fake.But do you wanna know the funny part?Her face is CONSTANTLY red. Like, to the point my sister thought she was Native American growing up. Of course, do you know what one of the biggest causes of red faces is? Heavy drinking! In the same way as crying, it causes those blood vessels to open right the fuck up.

jsfarri [info] I think it is a mischaracterization that their therapist wanted them to cut off contact with you. Therapists don't tell you what you should do; they listen to you and offer some rational critiques and guide you while you make your own informed decisions.Honestly, you deserve more than just "We can't talk now." They need to explain why and put some kind of time limit on it so you're not just indefinitely floating around. That's not to say that they give you a two month limit and then they have to get back together with you in two months. You deserve a time limit and then a reassessment of the situation after that time has elapsed.Sure, maybe it would be a good idea for you guys to go on a break while they figure their shit out. Perhaps they want to spare you just how much trouble it would be until you're both further along in the relationship. However, just because they are sick does not give them carte blanche to change your relationship and give you no information.Before I was diagnosed with bipolar, I had a boyfriend that was bipolar, and he called me from the ER where he was being admitted to the psych ward, and I asked him how I could contact him and he said I was being selfish for wanting to talk to him. O.oI think it's fair that you receive an explanation and some parameters and not just a one sided conversation. [info] Bipolar 1 with Severe Psychotic Features [info] 1453769498

(the only manic episode ive ever had, to my knowledge, was from zoloft) I was diagnosed with bipolar last year and i just started geodon and lamictal. hoping that i get lucky and these work because id love to get some sort of stimulant on top of them for college. my add is severe and with bipolar on top of that i cannot focus at all. it is quite the double whammy.

craycraythrowaway69 [info] Speaking for myself, I'm diagnosed with bipolar and I can tell you that I am sick. Before I got on lithium, I was tortured by obsessive thoughts of being stabbed in the genitals, among other horrible, almost unbearable symptoms. Every waking moment of my life was torture. After I went to a doctor and got on medication, *poof*, the obsessive thoughts went away and I my life stopped being a waking nightmare. I agree, the pharma industry is beyond fucked, and we as a society need to change the way some "mental illnesses" are looked at. I'm all for celebrating neurodiversity, but for a lot of people, access to mental health care can be the difference between life and death. Were it not for pharmacological intervention, there's a chance that I wouldn't be alive right now. [info] None [info] 1453962953
inspiredwench [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 28, I first attempted suicide at age 12.

Inhumanely_human [info] Well I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder which to an extent I feel I can attribute to my original death. That seems like a pretty unfair thing for God to do. And if there is a god he probably isn't looking too kindly at my starting a church etc etc. You can't blame being a prick on bipolar disorder but it certainly doesn't help. That being said I have prayed on numerous occasions to the Protestant God asking for strength and wisdom but never forgiveness. I think it's up to me to forgive myself before God can step in and take charge. [info] None [info] 1454267351
lukesgaming [info] I don't understand the hate for meds. MEDS ARE FANTASTIC. JUST FIND THE RIGHT KIND.The definition of meds is trial and error. I had bad reactions to um, 5 different meds before I found the right kind. Including not being able to swallow, hallucinating, having potentially life threatening heart problems, and lack of appetite, to name a few. But none of that really mattered once I found good meds. They never made me feel less like myself as far as I can remember, only less suicidal all the time, which was good in my book.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but I went off my meds awhile ago and haven't felt the need to take them anymore. But I should. Because I feel like shit all the time. So there you go. [info] None [info] 1454403555
agencyrep [info] I mean, I'm not neurotypical, and I'm sorry if you took what I said to be so.

I mean focus on literally anything else other than focusing on tropes and feminism and other stuff while blowing shit up. Spend the time thinking of new ways to blow shit up, future shit to blow up, or how puppies are cute and should never be blown up.As for the second, I'm sure they have their reasons.

TheHonourableCurls [info] I might be a little late to the party but as a child I was terrified of circles and spheres. I always had this dream where I would be floating in a grey room that was full of spheres, and they would slowly grow in size and eventually jarring me awake just before they suffocated me. I've spent years looking for an interpretation of this dream without success. When I grew up I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and GAD, so maybe this dream was a foreshadowing (not sure if that's the proper word in this case) of my adult diagnosis.

Brootalmouse [info] My mom would tell me how difficult I was to love and be around all the time. I still kind of believe it sometimes. Its hard not to believe it though. I get told by her all the time how awful I am as a person and nobody has really told me any different. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 16, and this was even more of a reason for her to hate me. She said she couldn't be around me. She said I was hard to love because I was so clingy when all I was trying to do was get some support. I don't go to people in person with my problems anymore and have turned to Reddit because nobody cares enough to help me and just be there for me to talk to. Whenever I try to tell her if I'm having a rough day that was brought on by my bipolar disorder, she just says she's too busy or she's working and that I should go see a therapist. I've been to many therapists but my mom complains about having to pay for them so it's kind of an on-again-off-again luxury. I've never really let myself get close to anyone because I fear I annoy them and they won't care about me anyway. I don't have many friends and at 19 years old have never been in a relationship with anyone because of this. I don't want to hear more people I care about tell me I'm hard to love and to be around because I feel like I know this is true for me, but it hurts to hear it. [info] None [info] 1455148083

MigBoney [info] My intention is not to reject or minimalize what other people have gone through.  My intention is to show that they went through whatever they went through because they are themselves and not what some doctor says.  This is exactly what I'm trying to show.  I actually think that by rejected the bipolar label people can see themselves as themselves rather than a product of illness.  I will not be attributing my struggles to the fact that I was diagnosed with bipolar.  I struggled because I needed to struggle.  What I'm tired of seeing is all of these gloomy posts and you people just expect other people on this board to know what you are going through.  Sympathy is one thing.  Making excuses is another.  I am so perplexed as to how these labels have such a large psychological manifestation in people's psyche.  Is society really this ignorant?  Does anyone understand what I am trying to say?  Why does this have to be so damn exclusionary.  I went to a bipolar outpatient clinic and it was the same thing.  Its like hey guys want to talk about how awful our lives are?  We get each other because we all have bipolar.  No you fucking don't.  None of you people understand me.  Nobody understands me.

euhedralandalusite [info] I can't really help OP but I take Dexamphetamine for adhd and have bipolar. I was also diagnosed with ADHD before bipolar. I found that the optimal dose to help my adhd (mainly inability to sit still and inability to focus) was slowly pushing me into some sort of episode and was giving me crazy side effects. I couldn't sleep, I was so irritable, I couldn't eat etc etc. And not taking it made me so freaking depressed, so I kept on it as it was helping me focus. After a while, I was diagnosed with bipolar, my doc was worried about Dex and bipolar together so we lowered my dose slooowwwlly and whilst it doesnt help as much to focus (which ive tried to supplement with exercise, diet and mindfulness), the side effects have mostly disappeared.I am taking meds for bipolar though, which has helped my moods and probably helped stabilize me enough to take the Dex.

my_bipolar_brain [info] Oh, friend.  I'm so sorry.  I was once on prednisone before I was diagnosed with bipolar, and I don't know how to describe that experience as anything other than a shit show.Bipolar and prednisone don't go together.  Any doctor should know this.  It is an extremely well-known fact.  It makes us manic.  I have never in my life been so enraged as I was when I was on prednisone.  Literally, no angering stimulus would happen, and I would be in an uncontrollable rage.  My parents were completely shocked at my behavior (it was many years ago that this happened; now, my doctors would rather see me suffer than give me a corticosteroid), and they said over and over that they felt that I had turned into a totally different person.I'm sorry you're going through this!  But it's not just you, and I know it's a shit show.  Hopefully someone will prescribe you a sedative, but just try your best to stay calm (probably, that statement pissed you off...it would have pissed me off back when I was on prednisone).  As far as I know, the regimen is like 2 weeks - just try to remember this will all be over soon.  Don't take any dramatic action in these two weeks - it will last forever, but this "Roid Rage" will subside soon.  So sorry you have to take the prednisone!!!  But hang in there!

PeachPlumParity [info] First: you don't have to tell people about anything you don't want to. It's your own personal mental health, not theirs, and it is entirely within your rights as a human being to keep it to yourself if it makes you uncomfortable to tell people.    Second: alcohol is dangerous when mixed with bipolar disorder. Alcoholism has a high co-morbidity rate with bipolar disorder (and mood disorders in general actually). I would not drink to more than a buzz if I were you because alcohol turns into a depressant when you start to metabolize it, which can set off a depressive episode, or it can knock off your inhibitions which will make manic episodes worse. It'd be much better for you to try different mood stabilizers and anti-psychotics until you don't need to drink to turn off your thoughts and feelings.     Third: while you may live with bipolar disorder for the rest of your life, you WON'T be living with the same shitty thoughts and feelings you have when not being treated. I was diagnosed with bipolar type II a few years ago and it was honestly the hardest year of my life. I was on the edge of attempting suicide for about a year straight until my roommate found a knife under my pillow and I was asked to take medical leave by the residential office to be treated. It took me about 7 months to finally be diagnosed as Bipolar and find the right medicine to treat it. I went through lamictal, abilify, seroquel, etc. before I hit a stride with Prozac and Zyprexa. You just need to hold out until you find a medication that works because now I am genuinely happy without being manic for the first time in 10 years. It WILL get better, please know that, but it will be tough while you work to find a treatment that fulfills you. [info] None [info] 1455674097
draggingalong [info] !!! I've never seen anyone else say that before, I have been taking low-dose seroquel for insomnia for over a year now. Before that I barely slept at all, my brain somehow 'forgot' how to doze off/sleep on its own, it was excruciating (I do not have bipolar 1, at one point I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 but my doctor now thinks that was a misdiagnosis. rather, I'm a product of severe, chronic stress for my entire life. and my emotions and sleep and my body are all damaged from that, also childhood trauma from a mentally ill abusive father). I was in the hospital a lot, I was in so much pain that they institutionalized me at one point (they got me to admit I wanted to die, even though..I didn't want to die, I just wanted the pain to stop.) and that is where I found seroquel (I would never have thought to try that...as I though it was just an anti-psychotic in high doses, but it can be beneficial off-label in the treatment of insomnia. medicaid wouldn't cover it for that though, so my doctor had to lie about why she prescribed it so my insurance would pay for it) I had tried all the benzos, ativan, xanax, klonopin, and ambien and the 'z-drugs' as well and they did not work, often I was worse off than before. I have been on over 20 meds in the last two years (absolute insanity, I was desperate)I had a sleep study done but they cannot help you unless you have sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome (I don't have either of those)we are so far behind in sleep science.I read about 'intensive sleep retraining' (I think I gravely still need to do this ) being the most effective, but there is literally no place in the U.S where you can go to fix your sleep (which I think is ridiculous. sleep, stress, mental illness in general. we all need a lot more resources) my sleep is still absolutely out of control (it has been for four years now. I think people think I exaggerate. when there literally has not been a single day I've been able to sleep on my own, I've forgotten what it's like in a way. it's awful. the pulmonologist I saw had never seen a case as severe as mine and was confused how there wasn't a genetic link. I do have a genetic link for mental illness but no one in my family had sleep issues.)sorry for ranting about this. it devastated my entire life, it forced me to drop out of college and I haven't had much of a life since.I still don't think I get restful sleep on seroquel, I'm exhausted all the time, it has been years since I've remembered/had a dream. my life is often unendurable due to extreme fatigue and pain relating to all of that (well, the sleep doctor I saw last in Denver said that I may have an underlying issue such as fibromyalgia or something but I haven't been able to find a rhemotologist that takes my insurance here). but at least I can rely on seroquel to sleep no.. I think I would have killed myself from the sheer hellacious pain of it if I had not found seroquel. it is my only relief. [info] None [info] 1455681194

I would say so much stuff that I would regret hours later, and didn't understand why no one else was "over it" too, because I had moved past the incident and expected everyone/everything else to go back to normal. The diagnosis really helped me not feel so "crazy". I've been on medication since and honestly was shocked by how quickly it helped and made me feel regulated.

BornToClaire-ify [info] Years ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was put on a medication that actually slowed my heart down because that's how my panic attacks/episodes would start -- increased heart rate, then shortness of breath, a feeling of the world caving in... I'm sure you know the feeling.I hated the medication. It was great if I were to have an episode, but on normal days, I felt like a zombie in slow motion.About 6 years ago I weened myself off the medication by talking myself down when I felt an episode coming on. I'd like to share what I do now with you, in an effort to help.*Close your eyes.  Breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth.  When you breathe in, do it for 2 beats: I-N.  When you breathe out, do it for 3 beats: O-U-T.  Count your breaths.  For each one, picture the number in front of you, large and 3-Dimensional.  Now as you inhale, picture the number filling up with water.  As you exhale, picture the water draining.  Do this for as many breaths as it takes to slow your heart, and feel like your feet are on the ground again.  The sweet spot for me is about 15.*It doesn't take long. You can do it in a bathroom stall at work, and no one will be the wiser. It's *really* helped me, and I hope it will help you, too.Please reach out if you ever need help.

tartansheep [info] a psychiatrist in the UK (what's LPC?) when I was just starting uni - I was diagnosed with bipolar ii at sixteen, bpd at eighteen (i think) and npd at twenty. they never said anything about that, although i'm going for another evaluation next week. i see a therapist and she said that essentially it's very difficult to put people into these boxes because nobody is actually that clear-cut, like it'd be rare for someone to have bpd traits (although I certainly am very emotionally unstable, lol) but nothing else. like stuff is almost always cormorbid, apparently. idk though.  thanks. my doctor said the reason it took me a while to be diagnosed with npd (obviously once I was eighteen) was because of the foul temper and the self harm. tbh, i don't think i actually HAVE bipolar, most of the time. my moods are dependent on stuff happening rather than arbitrary time passing. although it's difficult, because on here i was like oh hey I have bipolar so i'll sort of post in those pages etc, and they don't sound like me. i think i was looking for the bipolar symptoms in myself when they didn't exist, persuading myself that i was hypomanic when in actual fact i was just in a good mood because it was sunny that day! does that make sense? as far as PD goes i was raised by a narcissistic father and a depressive mother, and was groomed (but never properly sexually abused) by a paedophile at ten. the dr thinks that might have something to do with my weird attitude to sex as well. like, sex is a way of getting power over people. who knows.  thanks for your response. this is going to sound super petty but do you think the person who said i'm dramatic and ridiculous is right? it's not my fault i'm dramatic!

DearyDairy [info] Likewise in Australia,  once you have a diagnosis a lot of specialists and treatment services are free or heavily subsidised,  but if you're over 18 the process required to get a diagnosis can be expensive,  if your GP doesn't think you're mentally unwell then you can't access subsidised psychology. When I was a teenager I had a diagnosis from my psychologist,  bipolar psychosis.  My mother and I believed thus was incorrect,  and that I actually had PMDD,  it took many years and a few thousand dollars from our wallet to see the specialists needed to make that diagnosis,  in the meantime most experts agreed with the bipolar diagnosis and reassured us that the reason I wasn't getting better with bipolar treatments was because bipolar is very hard to manage. When I found a psychiatrist and endocrinologist who believed it was PMDD and got me started on HRT,  all of my symptoms resolved within a week. Completely. During the year when I was diagnosed with bipolar but chasing a PMDD diagnosis,  I won't lie,  I told people I had PMDD even though at that point it was a self diagnosis. The fact is that my self diagnosis was later supported by specialists and getting it looked at professionally allowed me access to effective treatment so it could stop disabling me and ruining my life. Taking my suspicions from self diagnosed from actual diagnosis was the only option for me in terms of living my life properly. Yes,  getting the right professional care is difficult for a lot of people,  access is difficult because the nature of the disease prevents normal social ventures like going out and getting help. But you can't claim that you suffer if you're openly choosing to remain self diagnosed and not looking into how to get a clinical diagnosis. In Australia headspace can consult you via Skype, cam, talk or text. You can talk to a therapist while taking a shit!Our system is not ideal,  people slip though and get missed all the time.  It's mostly because their illness is such that they don't want care or require so much care that short of a full time personal mental health nurse,  they will just bounce around in the system or fall out of the system completely.  I see it a lot,  but these people who fall through are not the same people as the timblrinas who complain.  [info] None [info] 1457415014

Ktrenal [info] No problem. Happy to help. :)The sneaky thing about the hypomanic phases is that sometimes it just seems like "not depressed". The milder forms of bipolar are so much harder to diagnose than the ones with full manic episodes, with the hallucinations and delusions. Hypomania can also just be irritability, instead of the typical euphoria, too. So it's sneaky!For me there were two very distinct signs that I wasn't "just" depressed: my tendency to start writing a novel a couple times a year, which I'd work on intensely for a couple of weeks, and then abandon when the hypomanic episode ended, and the way I reacted to antidepressants. The fact that I'd tried so many different antidepressants, all of which either made me more depressed or made me manic, was definitely under consideration when I was diagnosed with bipolar.Totally agreed with f.lux is the best thing ever!

PagansInVegas [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II first, and I still have that diagnosis along with BPD as I do get hypomanic sometimes. Like the others said, you only have to have 5 out of 9 criteria to be diagnosed. It's fairly common to not have all of the symptoms. I have all 9, but mine are only moderate, whereas someone could have all 9 symptoms severely. I'd say this makes BPD exist on a spectrum, which is pretty hard for us to comprehend because we tend to think in all or nothing, black or white terms. Also, mild bipolar disorder is called cyclothymia. [info] None [info] 1458168222
gold_miner_94 [info] I understand the cornered feeling. Listen, I'm a sufferer of bipolar disorder and childfree. I've struggled with just getting out and meeting people. I've struggled with keeping relationships together during manic episodes. I can promise you from someone who has been to very dark places that there is hope, and there are more women out there who don't spring this crap. This subreddit is full of them!&amp;nbsp;That one in a million feeling is in reality brain chemistry and hormones. I met the one in a million girl once. Didn't want kids, smart, chemical engineering student. The day she found out I was diagnosed with bipolar she left me on the spot. I was miserable and swore off dating for months. When I finally got back into dating all I could think about was her. You know what ended that? Seeing other people who weren't her. Didn't matter that the relationships didn't pan out, I just began to see that she wasn't a unicorn or a 1 in a million girl. She was a person with her own flaws and problems, like me. I finally met a girl who is understanding of the fact I will forever live with bipolar and that I choose to remain CF, which she is also. She's not a 1 in a million find. She's a person with flaws and problems, but I want to be with her regardless of them. You will find other people who share the childfree lifestyle, it might just take a while. I go years between relationships that pan out, and even some of those don't last long. Just keep your head up and go about this in a manner that lets you go on and be happy, because I promise a child will not make you happy in the slightest. [info] 21/M [info] 1458278987
Hydroelectric_dam [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 13. I am now 28 and in remission after years of counseling and treatment. Ultimately, I found the counseling and delving into philosophy and myself far more beneficial for my recovery than the drugs ever were, but I would be dead if I didn't have both. Based on what you just said about dosages, etc., I believe you probably have been diagnosed as well. Believe me when I say I understand wanting to get away from traditional meds. I urge you, however, to really think about the effects you are describing. It does not sound like you are experiencing remission, it sounds like you are hypomanic: you have it all figured out, what you have found "is love for everything and everyone" , "mystical effects" of the treatment you came up with.  I know how incredible it feels, but you are not better, and the crash that is coming is not worth it.   Do this microdosing thing if you want, but please at least be in counseling if you are trying a non-traditional approach. Please don't fight this battle alone, we don't all make it when we do.

dreamyproject [info] Ooh, I'd like to enter! OK, so my best girl is obviously Honoka. I watched the anime for LLSIF in 2014, around when I first realized something was kind of "off" with me. And it made me cry a lot to see Honoka say the things I was saying to myself ("I'll never be as good as them" re: A-RISE in season one) but then, in the end, with all of her friends by her side, she never gave up. Not long after I watched the anime I was diagnosed with bipolar, and years later I still look up to her a lot because I have she gets me up when I feel lost and down. She's one of my inspirations to never give up, even when I feel the lowest of low, and her shikishi is right across from my bed on my nightstand so I can always look at her to cheer me on with a "faito dayo!" Last two little reasons: I would love that account is because it has a UR Nico and Nico is right behind Honoka in my fav girls! I've never rolled a UR Nico on my main and would love to have her. And despite my ex-dolphin tendencies I don't have an idolized UR on any account I've ever had.The best thing that happened to me in SIF was probably scouting New Years Honoka on my first JP account because UR of best girl! And I love "hatsumoude" themed cards because while I studied abroad in Japan, it was one of the things I really wanted to do. (Unfortunately I lost that account when my phone just decided to dump a whole bunch of data so that's another reason having her idolized would be aces. Thankfully someone was nice enough to trade me an unidolized Taishou Honoka though!)And now that my story is done, I love Ene the most and I played her songs a lot on rhythm games while I was in Japan!

mspen1018 [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar I disorder because I have these really long manic episodes and I don't do cops but when it was the male ex more recently, I changed in the window pretending I didn't see him and closed the blinds and once I went into full blown mania and the calls and texts started, I made rounds and texted and called nonstop and could stay up for a week like that so I kept him up all night.  He decided after 2 weeks of that to give up his 8 months habit because he called crying and begged me to stop terrorizing him.My ex girlfriend did it for months when we were on and off because she was abusive and the cops laughed because "why would I get rid of a piece like that was what one said".  I got back with her and one day she started her yelling as she awoke about paper towels so I went to BJs and bought enough cases of it to where I could fill the basement and started filling them up but I got fixated on something and decided to move across the state suddenly at 2:30 am and just left.I hated that state of mind after the fact but when a person with a personality disorder tries to go toe to toe with me on the rage, harass and not stop bothering crap with their recurring, "I'm crazy, I am not one to mess with", the risk is worth skipping meds and loading up on caffeine and stimulants to stay awake and about after a week, the phoenix rises and when I counter harass, I do it night and day for days at a time.  I was scared I would snap on her though.  I block her on facebook when she makes new accounts and she is gorgeous but that voice gives me PTSD.  She mickey'd me to try to get pregnant in my sleep and my friends and family all laughed at me and my mom even slapped her five and said, gotta get that grandchild in case he falls for a dude.Mental illness sucks and all but I will say, setting of a manic episode was one thing that they didn't hold a candle to.

mspen1018 [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar I disorder and also have ADHD with hyperactivity and hyperfocus.  I actually KNOW when ADHD affects me whereas when the mania starts I "gush" and have this intense passion and my overall personality changes and I can just up and go out and am very social and funny but it turns into perky/angry/panicked/irritable and like narcissistic personality disorder on cocaine.  I end up psychotic after 6-9 months of that but I never believe I am manic and I am in complete denial until after the crash.  I have been stable from that since 2007 though.  It flares up a little more pronounced than the average season.  My ADHD seems hypomanic though but I see the problems there.  I will not even think or care about it if I am manic.

Katielynn92 [info] Personally, I would want to see how the medication works or see how things go without getting a bipolar diagnosis first. There is just something about the stigma of mental illness labels that can be very damning. I don't say this to scare. I had mental issues for ten years before I got the real diagnosis as bipolar 2. My general practitioner had just always said I was just depressed and put me on Zoloft. The Zoloft threw me into manic episodes. Explaining the effects of it to my psychiatrist later was part of what helped determine my true diagnosis also. But years later when I got the Bipolar diagnosis and now have career changes, it messes with that. See, I'm studying criminal justice and the bipolar official diagnosis on my record can prevent me from having certain jobs. There is a definite stigma and label that come with an official diagnosis on your record. So your doctors just may be wanting to be careful of putting that official diagnosis on you and they may be trying to be very careful before they make any big judgements that can affect you for a long time. Lamictal/Lamitogrine (sorry for the spelling) was what I started out with when I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and I titrated up very slowly. Those are mood stabilizers. This medication works extremely well for a lot of people, I just happened to be one of the few it didn't work well for at all. There's different "categories" of medications for people with bipolar. Stabilizers like lamictal are usually what doctors start you off with and then they slowly move in another direction such as antipsychotics (latuda, seroquel). I'm on seroquel now which is great (except the weight gain which I'm on topamax to counteract).  I do think it would be wise to try the medications and see if it helps move you towards a happier life. I felt so validated with a diagnosis knowing i wasn't crazy with all my mood swings. But with the stigma that came with my official diagnosis I almost wish I hadn't gotten diagnosed to be honest. Just my thoughts. You can always try a second opinion from another doctor bI wish you SO much luck! [info] None [info] 1458804696
LostinWoods83 [info] I was always praised for my intelligence when I was growing up and throughout graduate school, always told I would do great things like INTJs are supposed to do. I was skeptical. And then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder before I started my PhD program and had to drop out. I didn't have much of an ego growing up thanks to a verbally abusive father, and I certainly don't have one now thanks to the stigma of the illness. But give me a problem to solve in an area in which I'm knowledgeable and I'll solve it.

I know the antidepressants I was on before I was diagnosed with bipolar made them really bad, my condolences.My therapist suggested writing down the intrusive thoughts on a piece of paper because the idea is that you'll give them tangible attention and will be able to ignore then sooner. Though, I always thought writing down "I keep picturing me bashing my head into the wall until my skull ruptures" a little awkward if someone was going to read over my shoulder.

AsphaltChef [info] You can tell people it's just a thing they can get over and they'll abandon treatment because just some thing is just a bootstraps issue.Or you can call it what it is, and help that person to express their true intent.Adhd was fucking he'll for me.  I was ready to commit suicide dozens of times in my life.  I have like 70 percent of the coping skills, and my home life was highly adapted, simply via intuition and trial and error.I have a 150 plus IQ and graduated high school with a 50 percent average.  I was almost homeless when I was diagnosed at 30, and a month away from what I had decided would be my last day alive.How is being at the whim of your emotions and external stimuli a weakness that can be managed?  No really tell me, because I tried willfully for twenty five years.  It is a developmental delay.  A disability.  Literally a lack of an ability others have.  I'll also say this.  I was diagnosed with bipolar II prior to this.  Compared to that adhd is a walk in the park.   I think the problems with self image and adhd flow more from the attitudes that keep making this argument surface than from it being labelled what it is.It was a RELIEF for me to find it was true.  I am not my disorder, it has been blocking me from expressing and acting in accordance with what I would actually want to do.   You are not your disorder, even if you have one.  There are healthy ways to internalize it that don't put you cognitively at risk of not taking the thing seriously.Also this : on average it's 30 percent delay.  That means that when you give a 16 year old a licence and he happens to be ''I'm just different'' aka adhd and he has the impulse control emotional control and focus of a 12 year old, that's just fine? Adhd is objectively a disorder.We use the behavior to class people because we can't read minds yet.  The behavior is just a reflection of broken and disused cognitive tools.  Those are objectively broken.  And crippled working memory?Yeah totally just a quirky behavior.  *rolls eyes* [info] None [info] 1459325602
ChaosTheRedMonkey [info] It's a trend that applies to many mental conditions and I am always a bit surprised that apparently people have a hard time reconciling the trend with Autism. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder pretty early (around 4th grade so like..8 years old?). The doc who diagnosed it was a bit stumped on how to treat me because it usually wasn't diagnosed that early, and suggested I get evaluated later in life to be certain about the diagnosis. 20 years later it still fits.Anyway, I remember when we first started talking about history of mental illness in the family my dad said something like this: "Well none that I know of, unless being an alcoholic counts. But its hard to be sure. My folks and their generation tend to be tight lipped about that kind of thing, and would rarely get checked out. So at most we might have stories of "Weird Uncle Billy who was always a bit odd" or something."So yeah, definitely an awareness and openness shift has impact stuff like this.

Salty_goon [info] Depression is a motherfucker. Little backstory I've been diagnosed with bipolar and I've been struggling with it my whole life. I've survived three suicide attempts from when I was younger, and usually I'm pretty much a normal functioning 26 year old male. But these past two weeks have been hell. I've been waking up suicidally down to the point where I took off of work yesterday cause I woke up ready to jump in front of a train. I mean I'm sane enough to realize it's just my brain chemistry that's out of whack so I guess that's a good sign, but I'll be damned if it isn't hard to keep your mind off of it when it's mind beating you over the head with the idea of killing yourself. I worry most days cause in all honesty I have a lot to live for. Namely my daughter. I really try to hold on to that but idk these past few days have been particularly hard for me to stay on track.Today I'm feeling ok, a little emotionally numb but I'll take that over how I was yesterday. I'm gonna hit the gym hard today hopefully then have a tea party with my little one and pray that I can just wait this shit out.

iamtoastshayna69 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 7 years ago, but first they said it might be borderline. I am working on my bachelors in psychology so I have been doing research on my diagnosis. I don't know why I didn't get diagnosed sooner. I showed clear signs of mania even as a child but they always said it was ADHD. But they should have caught on when I was a teenager and was both hyper-sexual and suicidal at the same time. They just kept giving me ADHD meds which I have learned is only going to make bipolar so much worse. It's a wonder that I am still alive with how severe I was getting.

CivilNassar [info] Well, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, then I stopped seeing my psych. I realized later that I lied to him a lot and didn't give him the full rundown. My symptoms are much more BPD than bipolar, and I understand that the two are often misdiagnosed for one another, so I think my self-diagnosis is pretty accurate. I think for things like this, self diagnosis really can be accurate if enough research is done. The sketchy area would be more like someone diagnosing themselves with stuff like schizophrenia or OCD. Regardless, people do what they do and it shouldn't make you feel any less legitimate because you know where you are and what you've been through.  [info] None [info] 1460358905

But I tend to spread it around while drunk in new groups of people just because I know some people can't handle it.

Liz688 [info] I'm on it now and I love it.  I started on lamictal but had to go off it because it interferes with birth control (so does topamax but only at doses 200 mg or higher).  I'm on a low dose (50 mg) but seem to be one of the ones that feels better at a low level.  Personally, I've really loved it.  I feel...well, it's a little hard to describe.  Stable is the word generally used but it's a little more than that and I haven't quite found a way to put it that feels exactly right yet.  Calmer.  Less prone to being sad and upset, more able to look at things rationally.  Able to get over things quicker when they do upset me rather than being upset all day long.  Less obsessive over things that don't matter and more able to appreciate the things that do.  None of that is perfect--I still obsess over the things that don't matter more than I would like, still get angrier quicker than I would like, etc--but it's definitely a huge step up.  I did notice the side effects that most people complain about.  The foggy-headed feeling the most.  My doctor prescribed vyvanse at a low dose and that combats a lot of it.  I also take it at night so I sleep through the worst of the fatigue caused by it.  The foggy headedness and fatigue seem to be fading over time, as does the tingling/numbness.  I felt the numbness in my face and hands a lot the first few days but in the weeks after it faded and I hardly ever feel it anymore.  It also had some sexual side effects to begin with but those started fading around week 3 and are almost gone entirely now.  I hope you have a positive experience like I did.  Good luck!Edited to add: I was diagnosed with bipolar II so I don't know if that makes a difference.  Also, topamax is a heck of an appetite suppressant so if you feel bad on it, start setting reminders on your phone to eat and drink.  Drinking especially--a lot of the feeling bad may be from blood sugar crashes and dehydration.  The weight loss side effect has actually been a huge health benefit to me as I'm already very overweight and thats part of my my pdoc and I picked this particular drug to try in the first place over some of the more traditional ones that cause weight gain.

phatalphreak [info] 18 years ago when I was 15 I got tired of being bullied. So I took my dive knife to school, it was 12 inches long and looked scary as hell with a serrated back but was actually really dull. I was going to confront my bully and make him apologize. I was young and dumb and showed it off to some friends, one of them told on me and I was arrested. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and spent 2 years bouncing around between 9 psychiatric facilities and juvenile detention. I had a lot of adventures, lost my virginity, got into fights, tried all kinds of interesting drugs and picked up several fun hobbies. The one thing I remember most was at every facility the food was always really good. At one place we actually had a chef who was a graduate from the Cordon Bleue. If I have any advice to give it would be that the sooner you stop resiting the treatment, accept that you need help, and work with the counsellors, the better you will start to feel and the sooner you can get out and start living your life.

DoctorHeadshot [info] Because I'm sick. Not physically, but mentally, and rather severely, too. And for these last six months, I have been getting help for the first time in my life. Initially I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but then that was struck as a possible diagnosis because of how young I am; not even 20 yet. According to my psychiatrist, they know that I am very sick, but they're not sure what it is that I have. Different things were listed, terrifying things: schizophrenia, borderline personality, bipolar, PTSD, and many, many more. It's a lonely war, but I knew that going in. It still hurts, but I cannot possibly look for someone, because if I did, it would mean forcing them to endure me destroying myself every two weeks in a vicious cycle, and I can't ask that of anyone.

jannvancena [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, attention deficit disorder, and ~~antisocial personality disorder ~~ (edit - my mistake, definitely I wasnt diagnosed but I recall antisocial tendencies and low empathy/impulsive behavior being a serious concern) in childhood. In my experience, my best therapists were what some might call "neurotypical". I hated how othered the endless days in counselors offices and psychiatry clinics made me feel. In that space, everything you do is seen as part of your disorders. Being around a lot of other kids with problems like mine made me realize how insufferable and difficult I was for others. It was encounters with the "neurotypicals" who taught me empathy, who taught me how to come out of my shell a bit, made me realize I'm sharing the world with other people who don't think like me. Similarly, meeting and knowing me may have helped them come to some better understanding or deeper sympathies for the neuroatypical. I don't even know what neurotypical means tbh - I don't know anybody who hasn't had psychological or emotional troubles in their life. We should be able to relate to one another and sympathize as human beings without obsessively categorizing people like this. What's so bad about being interesting? I don't find it dehumanising or insulting when someone is surprised by or curious about the way I think, or what's different about my mind etc. If those damn "neurotypical"s aren't allowed to study psychology, they'll end up with exactly one reference point for encountering the neuroatypical - stereotypes. That's helpful why?  [info] None [info] 1461435096
khaosnmt [info] I'm a bit late to this one, but I've been trying to figure out how I want to tell this story. Wall of text incoming.I went to apply for summer and fall classes last week, and both my advisor and the associate Dean of students told me that I should give up on getting my degree because I'm obviously not trying hard enough. I have had the last two years of hell dealing with family and personal health problems, and that apparently means nothing to them.They told me that I am too far in debt (the only point they made that I agree with, by the way. $100k is a lot), and that I am too far behind and lack the focus and dedication to ever finish my degree. They have all the doctor's paperwork and notes to show that I wasn't skipping out on classes, so that's not the problem. To me, the problem is that they only want my money and their certifications, and me failing and dropping classes is screwing up their certification numbers.I plan on transferring to an online school soon. That way I can do shit on MY TIME and deal with everything else.Background below:I am adopted. My parents adopted me late in their lives. I was 6 weeks old (so I'm told). My mother is currently 74; my father is 70. I am 23.Both of them have COPD and my father's is end stage. I am a full time college student trying to get a bachelor's in information technology at a probably the most known school in my state. As such, it's a difficult school to attend.Lately, both parents have been having health issues. Both have the beginning stages of dementia (although my mother won't admit it). I have been back and forth countless times in the last two years making sure they are taken care of. It's a 3 hour drive one way. I am my father's only child, and one of four for my mom (her youngest, in fact). My brothers never call, but one of them lives 30 minutes from her and visits for lunch occasionally. Mom still works full time because it's the only way she can pay her bills.I live paycheck to paycheck. I go to school full time, and I work full time. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and type 2 diabetes last year. (Thank you biological parents and genetics...)Two years ago when this all started, I talked to my instructors about missing classes because Mom ended up in the hospital. I ended up dropping out that semester to take care of her. Last semester, I had hell because of all of the tweaking and testing the doctors had to do to get me stable on my medications. I failed a class and passed the others. One was a passing grade, but not enough for my degree requirements. I missed about a month of classes this semester because Dad ended up in the hospital and then a nursing home for physical therapy and rehabilitation. Being his power of attorney, I had to be there to deal with the paperwork and money. If you actually read all of that, thank you. I needed to get this out. [info] None [info] 1461446185

Trillibub [info] I'm not attacking you, but you sure went all-out defensive.  Many bipolar people experience exactly what you listed, and those things are not generally considered functional. If you meant to say that they're functional with medication, you should realize how different that is and possibly correct it. Since you want to puff chests and bring it up, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for almost three years. I've been hospitalized and gone to support groups where I've met many like me. It's been hell, and I'm often only functional *with the right cocktail of meds.* As are many who are diagnosed. It's not some mentality or way of thinking; if the whole world was as depressed as some of us have been, there'd be far fewer people alive today. Thanks. [info] None [info] 1461708646

uhohherewegoagain [info] I feel you. I am ABC also and brought up in the same way. Exactly the same situation, same emotional abuse and phrases word for word, except maybe worse as it was from my father and he mixed it in with a lot of cussing. Things never changed for me until I could remove myself from the source of the problem when i moved out of home in my late 20s. It is only then that I was diagnosed with bipolar stemming from this environment. Going back to visit my father only caused the same symptoms you are experiencing to reoccur for me (anorexia and fatigue being the most immediately visible to those around me). Things are slowly changing for me but it is happening. When they say things like you don't love them only guilt tripped me into staying and prolonged the abuse. Ever since getting out all aspects of my life have improved immensely including my relationships with women. [info] None [info] 1462068458
xxola [info] * I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 in 2013 and I believed it right away due to my ebbing and flowing depressive episodes that came in cyclical manners.* I was recently rediagnosed with type 1 due to an apparent manic episode, and to be honest I still don't honestly believe it. I'm going along with it and saying that I am because I feel like I'll get in more trouble if I don't agree to it, but in actuality I don't feel like what happened was as big of a deal as everyone said it was. I talk fast naturally and always have, I have a loud voice that carries *even when I'm depressed*, and the person I screamed at was a teacher who had an inappropriate relationship with me and was treating me unfairly in the classroom. It's hard to believe in a disorder when the situation was nonstandard but I have to just do what everyone says and take my meds even if I don't agree because I don't want to get in any more trouble.

droidwolf [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and I have faced similar ways of 'not doing things'. What I remind myself of when I don't feel like doing anything (really I mean anything) is that I have morals and values that I want to follow, keep, and uphold. Some of those values are knowledge, health, and power. I try to keep these in my mind at all times so when I need to brush my teeth, or take a shower, or be productive in what I want to accomplish, I can do so knowing that the thing I need to do is going to help me out in the future.Also, I try to forgive myself if I do let my time go to waste and I end up doing nothing. There is nothing worse you can say to yourself then constantly blaming yourself for everything that happens or doesn't happen. You only get to make so many choices in a day and the rest is up to 'the unknown'.My advice would be to try to do something more for yourself each day, and eventually it will add up and sooner or later you will be a better you. It isn't easy, but who said life is easy? [info] None [info] 1462343028
manku_timma [info] See. I think it is rather insensitive to think of it as something "edgy". It's trivializing the issue. There *are* people out there who don't give a fuck. Why does one fear death? Because they are comfortable with life and don't want to lose it. Now think of a person who hates even waking up in the morning. He hates life and has nothing to lose. Why would he fear death?I was diagnosed with bipolar, and I am suicidal, and tend to punish myself by self harm, and I am aware this is because I am mentally ill.The fact still stands that, people who have nothing to live for and have nothing to lose, don't really give a fuck about death. Yes they might be mentally ill and need help, but they still exist. I mean I will raise my hand and volunteer myself for the hydraulic press channel lol. I know how it would be. Head slowly gets crushed. As the pain builds, you have instant regret. Panic builds and you want it to stop, but it's too late "I want to live! Wtf did I do!". Then you cry about doing this to your parents. And then crunch, your head's a patty. I am aware of death. The only thing I fear about death, is the affect it will have on my family.

spacedrgn [info] Sounds exactly like my symptoms before I was diagnosed with bipolar. The last six weeks have been an emotional roller coaster for me, in every direction and sense. Last week I haven't been able to sleep well due to my problems. A month before I was on such a high, I was crying tears of joy because the world we're living in is so beautiful... then I came crashing down.My doctor raised the daily dosage of my medication a bit and it seems to be helping. Remember, like everything in life, this too shall pass. You're feeling shitty now, it's gonna pass. Consult your doctor, make sure you exercise regularly (it sucks for the first weeks, then you start getting used to it -- see /r/fitness), eat well, drink enough water (really, it helps) and most importantly, try to socialize. Sometimes a walk in the park is all you need.It's hard to stay strong when you're alone with your thoughts. Keep yourself busy. [info] None [info] 1462364378
smfa700a9f4 [info] That's very interesting.  I'm a nerd with an abstract math degree and I've asked myself a bunch of times whether I might have some kind of very mild version.  I don't have any social deficits and like you I'm very empathetic and have very good social skills with no problem reading other people.  But my cousin has Asperger's and there are some things I feel a definite connection to, like becoming obsessed with technical subjects to the exclusion of all else.  I'm obsessed with patterns and would spend hours staring at the woodgrain in my childhood bedroom.  Often I feel my social skills are really just an act, that I'm playing a part.  But I don't think it rises to the status of a diagnosable condition.Some sounds I can listen to all day no matter what the volume, but others drive me insane no matter how quiet they are.I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which muddies the waters for everything.  Who knows where one begins and the other ends?  The bipolar often fills my head up with random bizarre imagery, but it's unrelated to any external stimulation, but rather has a mind of its own and is as detailed as a photograph.  This is usually in my mind's eye, but I have outright hallucinations from time to time.By contrast, synesthesia imagery is always abstract, and is exactly in time to whatever sound produced it.  When I'm hallucinating, almost always the first thing I see is the synesthesia imagery right in front of my eyes, and only afterwards come the complete images. [info] None [info] 1462567080
Funkingthefake [info] I had a similar internal struggle when I was diagnosed with bipolar 2.  If I could  go back and tell newly diagnosed me anything, it would be this:A diagnosis is only a tool that lets people help treat you.  It isn't a defining term for you, it isn't an explanation of your behavior, and brains are all different. My bipolar parts are different than other people's bipolar parts, and diagnosing mental illness and psych disorders isn't cut and dry.  If the *treatment* works, it they can diagnose me whatever the hell they want.Bipolar often presents as different disorders at different times, due to it's nature.  It's also comorbid with a lot of conditions.  That's fairly common.That makes finding the right medication difficult.  But the good news is that most modern therapy models target a variety of disorders, and if you sit down with a halfway competent therapist, they won't care if you're bipolar or borderline or a fire engine.

A_Grimm_Life [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar only after taking a bunch of antidepressants which likewise made the bipolar symptoms worse. I am on a blend of medications right now, and lithium was added to it just about 6 weeks ago. So far so good, but only time will tell. Abilify works great for some people, but it wasn't for me. It made my mouth numb making my words unintelligible, and I gained 40 lbs. (I've since lost most of it but I still have stretch marks.) So lithium works great for some but you won't know how it will affect  you until you're on it.There is a stigma with all mental illness. I haven't told many people that I have bipolar disorder for that reason. But think of it like this. Some people are diagnosed with cancer. They can't do anything about that, that's just their cross to carry. (Just an expression. Not trying to get religion involved) we have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It wasn't a choice on our part, we just have to do our best to deal with it. Anybody that truly loves us will be willing to support us through this.Stigma is out there, sure. People will makes jokes about bipolar just like people will still call things retarded even though that's an actual condition people have. I think it's improving and you shouldn't be hesitant to tell anybody about it. If they are to immature to accept it for what it is, then that'll tell you a lot about them as a person.

RobbyBobby88 [info] I was in a similar situation a few months ago. I had an insomnia attack and ended up loosing my job and my girlfriend while having a severe manic episode. Afterwards after seeing a therapist and a Dr I was diagnosed with bipolar. In my past, I used to overly drink, I ended up getting a DUI after my friends and I were in a huge bar fight. We got arrested at gun point and I was out of work MIA for a day. Almost lost that job as well. Know that your not alone when your feeling like getting out of bed is the toughest thing in the world. It seems like the more I take care of myself, the better it gets. The less I take care of myself, the worst it gets.Social life plays a big part in it for me as well. The longer I go without socializing the more depressed I get. I started taking medication about a month ago, still only at a half dosage, waiting for it to get easier.  [info] None [info] 1463341532

GoodAtExplaining [info] um... You know, I'd like to have an answer that doesn't make me sound bitter, burnt-out or tired, but...I think the fairest way to say it is that I found myself becoming that bitter, burnt-out teacher, and I didn't want to be that. I wanted kids to love the language and be fascinated by it, not subject to the bitter disillusionment of someone who no longer loved what he did.Basically, if you're going to be a teacher, you gotta love what you do - The kids can see it. If you don't love what you do you're not going to make them love it, and we all remember what it was like to learn from a teacher who'd lost their passion. I didn't want to do that, so I left while I still could.About eight years later I was diagnosed with bipolar, so that might've been a reason as well, in fairness. [info] TOR - NHL [info] 1463618811

UnicornPlus [info] Yes I have felt that way about having a uterus for a long time, menstruation started at 10 years old for me, I had a b cup at 8 years old. I wasn't prepared for all the comments and stares and people assuming I was 14 or 15 at that age. My little sister was born when I was 11, and it led to people thinking that *I* was her mother. So for as long as I lived at home strangers and my parent's acquaintances would assume I was some knocked up teen with problems and the "she's my sister" thing was some kind of cover story. I figured out early that taking a shit load of ibuprofen would stop periods temporarily and I did that whenever I was fainting or vomitting from the pain. My parents were poor and didn't want to be bothered with my "kid problems" and were usually too busy hitting each other..  so I didn't get help for that problem until I was 15 and took myself to a state health department to get on birth control. Come to find out I have pretty bad endometriosis.After a lot of different forms of birth control I figured out that Depo would stop periods completely, which was awesome because vomitting, passing out and being barely able to move and bleeding for 7-15 days at a time was not how I wanted to live my life. I was taught that periods and child birth were special and magical because women created life and that was the ultimate purpose for a woman. My mom lost a few pregnancies and always droned on and on about grandchildren and how those would be 'like her own children'. I didn't want that, I practically raised my little sister and I knew diapers and crying and being responsible for another person's survival was NOT my bag. I also never wanted to experience that kind of pain again, there was no way I was ever going off birth control again. Later at 21 when I was diagnosed with bipolar that was the final nail in the having kids coffin. That doesn't need to be passed on to anyone. I'm *still* encouraged to have children anyway, because it's ok if more people suffer mental illness because "I might get lonely when I'm old and have no one to take care of me"I've learned that being a woman does not HAVE to be my main identity in life. My accomplishments are separate from my gender and that's how it should be.  [info] None [info] 1464047624

guilty_by_design [info] &gt;That just means weight loss is hard, but not uncontrollable.This is 100% true. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on medication that made it *very* easy to put on weight fast, as well as cruelly increasing my hunger at the same time. In a matter of months, I went from 180lb to 225lb.For a while I felt sorry for myself. Even the doctor seemed to think that permenent weight gain was inevitable. "What's more important? Controlling your mental illness or being slim?". I gave up. I was disgusted by what I saw in the mirror, but I felt powerless to change it.Then, on a month-long visit back to England to see my mum, she scolded me for giving up so easily and getting fat and lazy. She went shopping with me to help me buy healthy but filling foods, encouraged me to walk 3 miles with her almost every day, and made me cups of fruit tea to control the hunger pangs when I felt like snacking. When the month was over, I had dropped from 225lb to 213lb. I felt incredible.When I got back to the States, I continued. I joined a gym, signed up for a free Weight Watchers membership courtesy of my insurance provider, and went shopping just like I did with my mum. I made it down to 205lb so far, shaking 20lb off my pre-mum-visit weight and almost half way back to my pre-weight-gain start point.It's hard. I've plateaued a few times, and even gained back a couple of pounds when I've let myself slip (e.g. after I had gallbladder surgery recently and couldn't exercise for a while in combination with being able to enjoy any food I wanted without gastric distress!), but when I see it, I remember my mum's firm but loving scolding and I get back on the wagon.I've had the same fight with drink. As an alcoholic - a coping mechanism for the bipolar - it's *incredibly* hard for me to quit drinking. I managed to go dry for 18 months, then fucked it all up in one night by drinking a half bottle of absinthe in one sitting. Is it not my fault? Is it 'out of my control' because I have an addiction?Of course not. The fact that something is *difficult* doesn't mean that it's *impossible*. Being fat isn't more okay for me because it's hard for me to lose weight. It's still a problem that has to be addressed. And having people say "It's okay that you're fat" doesn't help at all. It made me complacent before. It made me give up. And probably contributed majorly to the gallbladder issue I later had. Next time it could be worse. Don't enable fat people. Support and encourage them if they want it, leave them alone if they don't. But enabling them just helps them to keep hurting themselves. [info] 20lb [info] 1464294214

Never found any significant symptoms of BPD and voiced my doubts to my psychiatrist.

I also have a circadian rhythm disorder. My mother has schizophrenia but I am not sure if she is diagnosed with anything else. Same with my uncle. My grandmother also has bipolar, but I've never heard anyone say that she has been diagnosed for sure. Schizophrenia runs in my family, I've had my episodes of being very paranoid and delusional, I've also had hallucinations quite a bit and I've had auditory hallucinations since I was 8 years old.I wish you well, there are many like you out there, and having multiple diagnoses is honestly the norm, like what u/normalornotwhoa said.

edgar__allan__bro [info] Maybe a bad example, but I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder yet every group therapy session I've gone to and online support group I've been a part of... I can't relate to those who really seem to be heavily affected by their symptoms.At the least I think that there need to be more than a few classifications. Really though I think that these things need to stop being diagnosed as permanent conditions. In my case, I really only exhibit symptoms when under a ton of stress... And I feel like that just makes me a normal person. When you have the flu, it's common knowledge that you're temporarily ill. When you start flipping out because you're under immense levels of stress, you're labeled with a permanent disease and stigmatized by loved ones and medical professionals alike. I'm not fucking crazy. I just need to learn to cope with stress in more productive ways, just like some people with the flu might need more help recovering than others do because they don't cope well with physical illness.

MoonbeamThunderbutt [info] I never considered that my diagnosis could be wrong either, but when I finally read the BPD criteria (more than a decade after my bipolar diagnosis), I was flabbergasted. BPD makes so much more sense for me in retrospect. The criteria fit so much better, but most of all: BPD is a result of trauma. It's a manifestation of CPTSD.Bipolar is treated more like a genetic illness, like schizophrenia. It's treatable but incurable and "just happens" to some people, like a random chance force of nature. At this point, I'm angry that I was ever diagnosed with it, because I was actively being abused and neglected when I got that diagnosis. Did my fucking therapist not see that? I was doing the best I possibly could in a completely intolerable, psyche-breaking situation. The fault was with the people putting me in that situation, not me for trying to survive it. And yet, I was diagnosed with bipolar, which is really just a way of saying "Your brain is defective and you shouldn't trust yourself. The abuse is your fault, because you're too difficult to handle. You drive people to treat you badly and who can blame them."*Fuck. That. Shit.*Some people might consider BPD to be a "worse" diagnosis, but for me it gave me back my dignity and allowed me to trust myself again. I didn't cause any of this. I'm not defective. I've just been doing the best I can with very limited resources. [info] INFJ . F . 29 . 5w4 [info] 1465510625
Creepy_Faeries [info] She was always a stubborn child, a bit rebellious. but never enough to cause problems to this extent. She always had a thing for taking what wasn't hers. Before she began getting like this we were really close, we would always watch anime/ read manga together. Talk about everything from our childhood memories to our beliefs and what not. We would tell each other everything and she'd always ask me for advice when she had a problem. Once she began 7th grade she began disrespecting her teachers and started disrupting class alot. The principal got involved and had her removed from normal classes to go to a special ed class that was held in a different school. From there she got worse, she was surrounded by other kids who also got kicked out of normal classes due to behavioral problems. She got kicked out of that class because she got into a fight and was sent to another school that dealt with kids who had issues in public school. From there thing completely went to shit and she started with her drugs, not coming home, aggressiveness, etc.  My mom had taken her to the same therapist I was seeing, but after a month,  she started skipping her appointments and started going off about how she wasn't crazy and she didn't want to see a therapist. Now about me seeing a therapist, I have been in therapy since the age of 11, I was a troublesome teen too, but never went as far as her. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I sought out treatment and would call mobile crisis whenever I was going through a really bad episode. I voluntarily attended programs and took medication. I stopped going to a therapist this past fall because I left home to live with my bf. I moved back in two weeks ago and I just can't stand to see this girl disrespect our mom anymore. Us being kind to her is not working, she takes advantage of that and believes she's free to mop the floor with us. It's just been a huge fuck you for believing that I'll change. She constantly tells us that she doesn't care, she wants to leave the house, and that she'll never change.  [info] None [info] 1465512646

bibibipolarbear [info] I'm sorry it made you tearful, its important to talk about that stuff. I really think letting your feelings out (whether it be with a therapist, family member, friend, or rando on reddit) will really help you to understand why you experience the emotions you do. I was diagnosed with bipolar about two months ago, but i was sure of it for almost 7 months and once i realized all my past intense behaviours made sense. If i didn't go to a doctor I was well on my way to ruining my life. I had already pushed so many people away, almost destroyed relationships, had really terrible habits that could've got me into a lot of trouble. Sure being diagnosed with bipolar was scary at first.. realizing i have a disorder that im going to have to manage seemed like a huge responsibility that i wasn't ready to take on. But what was even more terrifying was the feeling of not being in control, feeling like i can never catch up to myself, not realizing how badly my actions hurt someone until weeks later because my sense of empathy and reason was completely gone... that was the scary part. Especially because i am normally a very caring person, i had no idea what happened to me or how i turned into someone i couldn't even recognize. Being diagnosed was actually a relief, because it meant there was something i could do about it. Ive been on mood stabilizers for 2 months and I can not explain how much they have helped so far. I dont get nearly as annoyed about little things as i used to, dropping something doesn't make me go into a full blown rage, i dont have panic attacks anymore, and i actually feel in control. Don't forget, you are not your sister.. her actions and the fact that she has bipolar in no way reflects who you are or how bipolar disorder will manifest in you. I do suggest you see someone as soon as possible, even if you just have a slight suspicion you may be. Thats what i did and i'm so grateful. I went to my doctor and straight up said "I am depressed right now and i think i may be bipolar" and that was enough for them to actually assess me and take the time to set me up with the right resources. If you live somewhere with free health care or at least a good health plan I really hope you do go see someone. sorry its so long!  [info] None [info] 1466045845
laserdragon [info] First off, don't feel bad for relying on people! You're a human being, and that is one of the things we do. It's completely natural. Secondly, I have experienced these things also. I had [psychosis](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248159.php) after experiencing a traumatic event 3 years ago, and I'm still dealing with it. Socializing has been somewhat difficult for me ever since.I have been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. However, I'm not a mental health professional. If you're in school and feel comfortable with it, perhaps you could talk to a counselor. If you're in college, you should be able to see one for free if you're currently enrolled or going to continue next semester. If you're not in school, you could also see if there are any counselors or therapists that your insurance will cover.If you're uninsured, there might be free or low-income clinics in your area, just make sure that they have mental health services. Same with seeing a psychiatrist, or nurse practitioner working underneath a psychiatrist, they could possibly prescribe you medication to help with possible delusions. I take an anti-psychotic (I know, the name sounds horrendous), which is prescribed for delusions and/or hallucinations in people with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder.Like I said, I am not a professional, and it would be best for you to talk to them so that you will receive a proper diagnosis and proper help.

KsoFly95 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar during my college years, and I have to admit in my honest confession I really survived college mainly because of a close-knit group of friends. A combination of my low attention span, racing ideas, and confused emotions, all led me to my barrage of abysmal grades and struggle in the classroom. I was lucky because while my classroom work wasn't very good, I was able to befriend a lot of the smartest and most supportive friends/students in my class. I had already contemplated changing majors, and dropping out multiple times, and they pretty much stepped in and bailed me out on almost every time I needed it, made sure I was on top of my work, and the real truth is that with there help I was able to finish one of my hardest semesters passing all my classes with a semester GPA in the lower 2.0s range. While it might not seem great, the truth is my GPA was expected to be in the 1.0 range at times, and the help allowed me to barely survive and just make it to stay in school and make it in the program.

SunChild91 [info] I was diagnosed with anorexia when I was diagnosed with bipolar (and they definitely directly correlated) I still try to stay away from mirrors and I practically avoid showering even, but then I will completely binge eat for days, hate myself more, not eat, and so the cycle continues! I have started eating pretty much a zero fat diet, I stick to fruits veggies quinoa tea instead of coffee (although caffeine could definitely have something to do with it, I had to quit when I was first diagnosed, it had pretty much kept me hypo for like 5 years)etc.. That way things like yoghurt or a grilled cheese become really filling and satisfying like junk food. I seem to just become immediately addicted to sugar I feel like it does something to our bipolar chemical make up. If I don't have sugar like chocolate or something, I don't over eat as badly.. Oh and milo is good! I'm not sure if you get that in America but it's like hot chocolate and if you switch to tea (which also hydrates and detoxes and helps with weight loss!) after drinking tea all day if you get cravings for chocolate trust me, it's totally satisfying!

NIGGERSNIGGERNIGGERS [info] A lot of you guys already know that I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I have told a hefty majority of you guys in private. Basically what that means for me specifically is that I have long periods of hallucinations and delusions where I am made to think things that are not true. I have been struggling with this since late last year, and really it's only gotten worse sense.I have a person who follows me around named Connor. I know for a fact I have told several people about him before, specifically Anna Zotta and Derf. He used to just follow me around and ridicule me but recently he has gotten much more threatening and he forces me to do things that I do not want to do.Another big symptom I have been having is more on the delusion side than the hallucination side. I have very vivid dreams that eventually turn themselves into false memories where I think things have happened to me when they really haven't. Talk to any of my close friends (Alex Nesler, Anna Zotta, 4%, Sp1nda, April Shaw, etc) and they will know that I am constantly out of my mind with crazy theories and stuff, and I thank them for not judging me and just telling me simply I'm being delusional.The past two weeks I have honestly been scared for my life. I was told that I was the target of a government experiment on the viability of the Esports industry and using influential people to control masses of the population. Connor told me I had poison in my blood that they could activate to kill me at any time to make me die.They needed me to become a very important and followed member of the community so that I could control people for them. I know I'm an asshole for throwing you guys under the bus like that but I was honestly scared for my life. I needed to get enough fans so that I could make them vote how I said or go to certain events that I wanted them to go to or whatever.So the only way I could think of to get a lot of fans was to capitalize on my knowledge of the inner workings of melee and my ability to hack the game. With the intent of making a name for myself as a low tier hero so I wouldn't be killed, I made a hack that would make Pichu's hitboxes bigger and stronger if you held the stick in the bottom left corner of your controller and held the L button while you started a match as Goggle Pichu.I tried to tell quite a few people I was cheating, but every person I told thought I was being delusional and that I had actually deserved the wins. People I told include April Shaw, 4%, Derf, cWeb, and Walt. They all wrote it off as me being delusional, but I couldn't prove it to them without the government figuring out I was warning people of their plans to control them, so I didn't dig into it deeper.I know this doesn't excuse my actions, I just had a lengthy phone call with my doctor and I have an appointment lined up for Tuesday at noon. I should have told more people even though I thought it would kill me to do so, I should have recognized I was being delusional. I am making plans to apologize individually to each and every person I beat with the hacked character and to pay 1st place payouts to every person who's bracket I ended with my hacked character. I don't expect forgiveness for this, but I felt I needed to explain my thought process.

pkcoll [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder three years ago and have not held a job since. I did have one through university (which I did not finish) and worked full time two years after that but I have no idea what it'd even be interested in. I go to college part time but it's not something I want to do (carpentry) I just want to feel like I'm accomplishing something, anything but personally I have no passion, no aspirations or drive for anything. It's really frustrating, it's so difficult to commit to a job you don't enjoy. I know many people do, many work to live while others live to work. I don't have a passion to live or to work so it seems like I'll never find anything and when I try I lose interest making it really hard to complete what I start. This probably doesn't help you at all. I will say I don't think it's every too late for help but just getting help doesn't make things better. It's a great start that you're at college, I think accomplishing and finishing that will help. One thing I've learned is I need flexibility because of my mood disorder so maybe the jobs you had were too demanding in terms of a strict schedule. [info] None [info] 1467499368

greenbriergoodsire [info] It sounds like you and I have some common ground in experience, though differing degrees I believe. I'm also 23, have been measured as having an above average intellect, and am going to a good school (at least I am now, one more bad semester and I'm calling it). At 19 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, then at 22 it changed to bipolar I w/psychotic features. About nine months later, I still had quasi-psychotic symptoms and I was told I have StPD, closely related but typically without true hallucinations or bizzarre delusions. The scattered, impossible to "herd" thought problems are still there, so the cognitive issues I definitely get. I get really frustrated with myself with regard to cognitive problems because I feel like I should be able to do it, and my brain is just gonna fail me more and more until people can't understand me at all. Most of the time I get my point across, but stress these past couple weeks has amped up all of that for me.In a general sense I dont know its the same worthlessness, but I am almost incapable of instigating social interaction because I get this picture of whoever it is rolling their eyes and letting the call go to voicemail because my friends don't actually like me, they're just indulging me out of pity. I don't have that self-directed shame or anything, but I do get caught up worrying for like 30-45 minutes that all my friends are eventually going to gradually chip away and I'll have nobody. Those are the hardest for me to handle, because I  can see why others wouldn't be on board with me.As for finding something elevated to channel energy and time into, I've always gone creatively. I write and play bass to unwind, and for purpose in life I have stand-up comedy. That was when I found the "joy in life," when I started writing jokes and realized that the world isn't as odd as I see it, but it's not far off. There's also something to be said for looking for reasons to laugh, even passively. If there's anything you used to do that you head just clicked with and you understood viscerally, pursue that.

MarnietheDoug [info] &gt; Another thing I want to add is that sometimes they may or may not say some pretty mean things to you, but just remember it's not her fault and she doesn't mean it.Thanks for saying that. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was having periods of extreme delusions and that all my friends hated me. My SO couldn't understand because he got nothing but love from them and why I wasn't registering the same way. I would say mean things about them to my SO but he knew that I didn't mean it. I mean, I felt deep down that there was some sort of conflict in what I was saying and what was going on in reality but I couldn't sort the difference between the two. Which one was true and which one was false. I'm just glad I never said anything to them because they are really good friends. I had a really bad manic breakdown last week where I was paralyzed at work I was freaking out so bad. I told my good friend about it the next day, we work on the same floor together, and she told me to contact her the next time that happens so she can come over and take care of me.

It's hard for me to smoke sativa since then - not fun anymore, just a lot of paranoia. [info] None [info] 1468880688
frangipani_c [info] I'm 02/08/1981 (2nd August 1981).Completing my specialisation as an anaesthetist in Australia.  I love my job and feel blessed to be able to make a living doing something I love.Undergraduate Medical Science (Honours) degree and then my MBBS.Have had my first dog (as an adult) for nearly a year now.  He is a 2yr old staffy kelpie cross who I rescued from a shelter.  I'm so happy to have him in my life :) .I live on the opposite side of the country to my family.  I moved here with my ex and I haven't left.  Been here for 10yrs now.  I miss my family very much but we also have our issues, so sometimes the distance is good.  I speak to my mum nearly every day.  I have a strained relationship with my older sister that improved somewhat when she had my niece.  I adore my niece and am sad that I am not a part of her day-to-day life.  I have a younger brother who I speak to maybe once a week or fortnight, but when we talk, we really talk.  We understand each other very well.I am in a fairly new relationship (less than a year) with a lovely guy who really loves me and I think I am falling for him.  My main hang up is that I am still in love with my first love.  We were together from the age of 18 to 29.  We were each other's first relationship.  We were engaged to be married and inseparable.  Then I had a depressive mental breakdown in my final year of med school and became extremely self destructive.  Excessive drinking lead to black out drunk episodes which lead to an infidelity at a med school party whilst my partner was away with work.  Whilst drunk, someone I thought was my friend (who was 'looking after me whilst drunk') kissed me and I initially kissed him back.  I ended up pushing the 'friend' away once I realised what was happening and drove home drunk.  I confessed to my partner and after a time, he forgave me.  However, my self destruction just got worse as I then started to doubt that I truly loved my partner if I had put myself in a position where I was unfaithful.  Yet, I did love him, but I couldn't resolve the internal conflict of what I had done ... so I somehow convinced myself that I didn't do anything wrong.  This then led to a spiral of deceit and further infidelity, and eventually to the loss of my partner, loss of my reputation, and loss of many friends.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my manic episodes coincided with my infidelities.  I truly had no insight at the time that what I was doing was wrong.  I had days where I would barely sleep or eat but I felt incredibly energetic and daring.  I drank excessively during those episodes and didn't care what I did or who I did it with - I honestly thought I could do no wrong.  Those few months altered the course of my life catastrophically.  I managed to complete med school and have since created a new life for myself, but I now have very few friends and I'm scared to get close to people for fear of losing them.  The loss of my ex and of so many mutual friends devastated me and I just don't have the strength to go through anything like that again. I have travelled all around Australia quite a few times and have travelled overseas to New Zealand, Indonesia, Thailand, Eastern Europe, Switzerland, Spain and London.  I'm hoping to travel much more.I don't have any kids and due to the demands of my career, my creeping age, and my history of mental health disorder, I'm not sure whether I will and/or want to have children.  Being a doctor just makes me even more aware of the risks of my advancing age and of the risks of a relapse of my bipolar.  Overall I have a pretty great life.  Yet losing myself and therefore my ex will always be my life's biggest regret.  I am now a strong advocate of seeking help for mental health problems early and not buying into fear and stigma that stopping me reaching for help when I first needed it.

theflamingskull [info] &gt;Yes, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 17. I have a family history of bipolar and when my therapist found that out she started asking me some leading questions which basically led to me admitting to manic episodes I actually didn't have.You've had a previous inaccurate diagnosis due to lies.

canwegoback [info] I just want to say.. I would have had a very similar reaction to him (before I was diagnosed with bipolar myself haha).It's just something that he was unused to, and he was trying to make light of it to make the conversation more comfortable. It's also a lot to drop on someone that maybe you're not incredibly close with already. [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1469587252
ThatGreekLady [info] My father was an asshole, not just to me but to my brother too. When I was a kid he used to call me worthless and a psychopath and then he would apologize and after a while he would start the verbal abuse again. I suspect he has bipolar disorder as his behaviors are similar to mine and I was diagnosed with bipolar (he wasn't because he never visited a psychiatrist) At least he didn't hit us and I have forgiven him, I just don't want to see him. Also, my first boyfriend tried to cheat on me, but to be fair I didn't really care about him either, so I don't hold it against him.  [info] Non-Red Pill,anti-romantic [info] 1469649660
Reubenls [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar and life was still a rollercoaster whilst on lithium and effexor. Missing my medication meant some days I couldn't get out of bed or I was hypomanic - being on medication was innately still a struggle in itself. Within the past three weeks I installed f.lux a blue-blocking computer program and an almost magical shift in my life was apparent. I was able to get to bed early and wake up early, I was able to attend work, my mood was excellent, I had energy and most importantly I was able to function. I didn't even connect the dots until a few days ago and I installed f.lux without even the thought of such a benefit passing my mind. I was functioning so well I decided to come off effexor cold turkey and since coming off effexor I no longer smoke and no longer get impulsive and reckless urges like I was prior. I haven't been able to do these things in a very long time and it could be attributed it to the immense amount of time I spend on the computer being bombarded by blue-light. I still obviously am very cautious with the disorder and I continue to take my lithium but it has been quite an interesting change.tl;dr: Blue-light blocker had incredible effects on my bipolar disorder [info] None [info] 1469705331
Glibat [info] First of all, I wouldn't make excuses for your GPA in an interview. Own it. I didn't graduate with the best GPA (3.2 overall), and that's largely due to screwups my first two years when I was figuring out what I wanted. When I was doing interviews in college, I handed them my transcript and immediately explained what bad grades they would see, and how I have grown from that. I also was careful to point out my progress through the years (graduated with straight A's for my last 4 semesters). Have your grades increased over time? Can you show that you've gotten better? Learned more?A lot of places I looked at had GPA requirements straight out of college, but the place I ended up working at waived their requirement for me (3.5) because I had an internship for 1.5 years using C#, and they could see I got good grades in the classes that mattered. What were your internships like? What did you use while there? What did you learn? Focus on these strengths.Finally, and this is just my opinion, I would focus on getting some certifications. That's something that you can own and will show your ability to complete something well. Overall, though, I would not walk into an interview talking about bipolar disorder and a car accident. That's not really something they want to hear. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 10 years ago, and have never mentioned it to an employer simply because I don't ever want them to treat me differently.

RCampbellSproul [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar type II as well. I for about a year or so I was diagnosed as major depressive, but about three months ago my psychiatrist noticed some patterns of hypomania and changed my diagnosis. I definitely know what you mean about not wanting to tell people about bipolar, and I agree about the stigma. I was willing to tell my friends or even acquaintances I was depressed, but I have a lot of fears about social consequences about telling people I'm bipolar. I've told a few of my closest friends who have all been very kind and supportive (which is of course a huge part of what makes them close friends) but outside of that I generally don't tell folks. I definitely struggle the most with the mood swings, particularly because when I'm hypomanic I can't sleep. At first it feels really good, but after a while of sleeping too little, things start to get pretty bad for me. I hope you get better, I know that this has been incredibly hard for me so I assume it is for others too.  [info] None [info] 1469840667
DopamineDays [info] At 21 years old. Hid the psychotic symptoms for years.  Parents found me after skipping clases spacing out hard to voices in my head and thoughts of being watched, hardly connected to reality.

ashpinktea [info] Being in the cult wouldn't cause something as severe as schizophrenia however it definitely could make it much worse. For me, I was diagnosed with bipolar a couple years ago around the time I became inactive the first time. I think that having to deal with judicial committees and all the guilt the first time I got disfellowshipped definitely made my symptoms worse. Personally I think that telling someone with paranoia and psychosis that there's a person in the sky watching them constantly isn't the best thing to help with their disorder.

WasARealBoy [info] I'm in the same boat. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since I was 17 and I think that goes a long way in "feeling" some of things that go on in the game. Your analogy toward uncomfortable therapy sessions is pretty spot on - that feeling of facing something you've been avoiding so that you can work yourself through it. It's definitely why I naturally gravitate towards things like LiS.&gt; Whether that's healthy or not is subjective I guessYeah, that's the tricky part. To the extent I've seen in some places, I really don't think it is. But I mean, I know that *I* do a ton of unhealthy things to cope, so I don't have a leg to stand on. I guess it's just a "do as I say, not as I do" thing. I just get worried about people.  [info] None [info] 1469960757
huss3742 [info] I went to inpatient treatment in 2009. I was really apprehensive about it, but when I got there everyone was very welcoming, staff and clients. It was nice to be surrounded by about 20 other people who were going through or had been through the same things I was. I made friends quickly being around other addicts 24/7. After getting done with 35 days of rehab I went to aftercare once a week for 2 years. It was one of the best decisions of my life. I was diagnosed with bipolar about a year and a half ago. I got on medication that really help evening out my moods. [info] 70 days [info] 1470070143
thelionsmouth [info] Huh. I was diagnosed with bipolar II as well. I've been having a hard time accepting it, but I do have trouble with my emotions. In here it seems people have the same problems as I, rumination and obsession, getting lost in parallel worlds where things could have happened differently.I'm not saying it's bunk, but it's something I'm going to think harder of for sure. Maybe my mood swings are just a part of my personality rather than a mental disorder...In the end, I guess whatever makes you happy. If the bipolar treatment helps you/me handle difficult emotions and mood swings, then awesome! I do not like feeling out of control. And I want to like myself. [info] None [info] 1470112224
kinkykittenmeow [info] Oh gosh I hear you completely. I graduated high school in 2011 and that was the time that I was diagnosed with bipolar. After all these years, I have basically been in and out of hospitals, into rehab for my substance abuse, having sex with way too many people who I cannot even count, attempted at school maybe 5 or 6 times now by jumping from colleges to a university while ONLY receiving three credits that I was given out of a sort of pity (or kindness) by a teacher who saw my struggles. I even showed up to the lectures piss drunk and making a scene. I dropped out and got medical notes from my doctor. I feel like an utter failure. Even this summer I attempted to do school and I ended up vanishing from classes due to my gongshow of ups and downs. I feel so scared for my future. I always think I have it together or I feel like I can go forward and accomplish my dreams, but each time I get that confidence I crash and burn. It really feels hopeless. The longest time I stayed employed at one place was only 6 months. Then I end up disappearing because I mess things up in my life.It feels like I am stuck. I know you feel similar and I turn to reading others posts to realize that I am not the only person seriously struggling out there with this sort of thing. It is disheartening to get yourself up, dust yourself off, and then fall right back down numerous times. I still do not give up and I am still super determined to figure this life the fuck out lol.I'd say your best bet is to take medication NO MATTER WHAT. I am still doing this now this year and it can be so hard. It can feel like it isn't working at all. But I am trying to hold this promise with myself to no matter how shitty I feel or how hopeless life gets with my BS, I will not purposely quit any meds. I will keep trying and if they do not work, then the search for the holy grail of meds continues. I have the hopes that if I keep trying with these then at least I stand a way better chance at succeeding at anything. I know that without meds I am instantly gone and way more unstable.Anyways, that was a big ramble. I feel you and I hope we both get through these sinking feelings. Just have to keep going and trying. Suicide is tempting but I have already landed myself in a coma and nearly in the morgue with a bracelet on my ankle because the hospital thought I was a goner in 2012. Nope, still here. Still going to live and keep the past in the past.  [info] None [info] 1470130361
kinkykittenmeow [info] Haha oh sorry but the way you wrote that with your wording and how you typed lmao seriously makes so much sense to me.I can feel completely alllll over the place with my manic episodes and go from wanting to kill myself to wanting to live but hide from everyone from my life to thinking about how lovely it will be to have my first child and how I will love them to no end. Like, what the fuck? All in a matter of minutes my head spins. It makes zero sense to most people. Only doctors or people with the disorder or who personally know someone with these symptoms would get it. I would try to get those 25 mg seroquel tablets FROM your doctor once you ride through the storm. Those help me when things get out of hand. I just drink it with my water and boom I sleep or at least get too tired to be manic. It helps for those really bad times with it. Also, from the sounds of it....maybe find a better doctor. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 18. Treating bipolar with just anti psychotics or like anti depressants won't get the job done. It's tricky and time consuming and disheartening, but the struggle is real for us. Have to search for the holy grail of meds and understand that getting support, medication, and making mental stability the absolute number one thing for us to strive for is necessary pretty much for our survival. Everything else will fall into place better after we get that as our foundation.  [info] None [info] 1470131665

123BuckleMyFuck [info] Sometimes I have no idea how some doctors are allowed to practice. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and when I was let out of the hospital I was assigned to an outpatient psychiatrist. This man believed that all my problems stemmed from me not being respected by people and that my psyche was damaged because I wasn't the head of a household. He then proceeded to tell me that mental disorders are created by the brain and there is no such thing as a legitimate mental disorder. This man was a medical doctor. [info] None [info] 1470291700
JeffRulesYou [info] Well, unfortunately before I got diagnosed when I was going through my "episodes" I did a lot of uncharacteristic things and hurt a lot of people (not intentionally) I was just very unstable at the time and not myself, but my family and friends didn't know I was ill and blamed a lot of my faults on bad behavior and personality.  This was before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  As I've gotten older people have used my disorder against me for either (a) things I can't remember doing in the past or (b) any sort of emotion/decision I make in the present.  My disorder is always mentioned in those regards.  I try not to get upset, because I know they mean well, but it is very frustrating and upsetting to be reminded of it.  It's hard to find a balance of the two without either party getting upset with one another.  Also, not everyone is truly going to understand.  So, you have to be as honest as possible with your loved ones on how you feel when they try and do that to you.  Also, I forgot to mention if you're doing well and are stable than they have absolutely no right using it against you.   [info] None [info] 1470331671

However, I've been trying to talk myself out of the "condition"for 3 years, without great success. But I have responded well to doing the posetive affirmations. And now use them as an emergency when my thoughts are getting really negative and looping on me. My favorite is Louise Hay. You should check her out in any case.

My husband and I divorced five years ago after he ran off with another woman, but I didn't slip back into unhinged behavior so I think it was just a phase.If you think you need extra help, seek out a therapist.

About 6 months later, my wife saved my life during a suicide attempt and I ended up in a psychiatric hospital. After three months there, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. Mental health put me on a profile that prohibited me from using a weapon and told my CDR I was high risk.I'm now at a WTU and getting evaluated by the VA to be medically retired.

FriendVriendin [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder while in law school. By incredible coincidence, my boss *also* had bipolar disorder. Now I was his only employee, so he was very reliant on me getting my job done. My sleep schedule was completely out of whack, and he let me do a lot of my work whenever I simply could. If I was up all night, I'd work all night and he'd understand that I had to come in after lunch the next day. He wrote many "memos" for me detailing his experience and giving advice on how to survive in a competitive, stressful, unaccepting profession. During this time I had a hospitalization brought on by lack of sleep and improper meds. Some years later, I had to disclose this on my bar application. It triggered a denial and appeal, and he went to the mat BIG TIME for me in front of the bar association. I was able to sit for the bar. I'll never forget how he "outed" himself as bipolar in the process. He legitimately could've lost clients or colleagues by "coming out," but he did it after 30 years of secrecy to show me that I can be a good attorney regardless of my condition.Edit: I take meds and adjusted to a healthy lifestyle.

CakeToPersonRatio [info] My freshman roommate, let's call him Tom because his name actually was Tom and its generic enough.Tom was my bedroom roommate in a suite of 6 guys (3 different bedrooms, 2 per room). College was a different world for me. I didn't have many friends at all leading into it, had a bad high school experience, and moving into incredibly new environment was scary for me. As background info, I attended school in New York.Tom and I met and were courteous to each other. We didn't hit it off, we were just polite to each other. I should quickly describe us: Tom is incredibly handsome, intelligent, and funny, and I am almost the polar opposite in every facet. Saying Tom is very handsome is almost doing him a disservice (and tom if you ever see this, "no homo").With the 4 other guys in my suite, we didn't hit it off at all. See, they were all athletes and i felt like an outsider because I was an outsider. Tom wasn't an athlete either but he was handsome, smart and funny so it was easy for him to be included in their circles. At least that's what I thought.A few weeks in and I was miserable. I was getting more attuned to the people I was living with but I simply wasn't enjoying myself. Tom and I stayed up talking together one night and I found out he was unhappy here too. He wanted to move out of our suite and live with his friends. He sounded sheepish talking about it with me because I was part of the reason he wanted to leave and I was the guy closest to living with him. But I understood him. Who wouldn't want to stop living with me? The same went for my other suite mates, those guys just didn't really want to have me living with them because I wasn't assimilating well into their athletic culture.But things changed. Alcohol. Alcohol allowed all of us to loosen up, go out together and have crazy fun times. I think I earned myself a reputation because I'm a small guy and I'm drinking almost as much as my roommates who are 2x my build. They learned about my party side and I learned about theirs. Throughout this, Tom was learning to not only enjoy their presences, but mine as well. We slowly became a lot more attached. We hung out a lot. We were living with 4 other athletes but we bonded over the fact that we weren't athletes. We talked about girls, smoked weed together, shared interests, future aspirations, hobbies, everything. It was the type of relationship that I don't think I ever had 10 years before it. Things were looking good for me and I was starting to love college.The second semester came and went and it was just as good as the last, if not better. This time I had a love interest throughout the entire rest of my freshman year, and my suitemates were playing their roles as wingmen (and they succeeded, months later her and I dated for 3 years). Tom and I grew closer. I don't know if he ever considered me this way, but I viewed him as my best friend. He cared about me, I thought I cared about him, and I really enjoyed our companionship. Life, which it hadn't been in years, was good.This all changed the following year. I was dating someone. I spent a lot of time at her place. Something I also didn't mention, was that I was running a business while attending college. All of it was done from my laptop which made it possible in the first place. My roommates were aware of this and supported me, and the company become immensely successful. I was making more money than I could imagine, which I confided in Tom. Tom came from a very humble background so this amount of money was astounding to him, which becomes important later. I had to split time between gf, business, school, and friends. It's safe to say that I neglected my friends and gf + biz came first in everything. Tom still cared about me, I cared about him but I didn't show it much at all. They progressively stopped seeing me as I basically started living in my gf's apartment. I also started feeling like it was me vs. my roommates. For whatever reason, I thought they didn't like me and it caused me to drift even further away from them. I continued being successful in business.The following Junior year is when it all went to shit. I moved with them, my stuff was in the new house we lived in, but I spent 0 time in that place and most of time in my gf's new apartment. Tom and I were hardly close. I neglected him and all of my friendships, all that mattered was my gf and my business. Eventually, I fucked up royally and put the nail in the coffin to our relationship. He had always shown interest in my business. He asked me one day if he could learn about what I did, and maybe get a job because I did mention I was looking to hire someone. Not only did I reject him with the excuse that I didn't want to mix friends and business, but the real reason was that I was greedy and didn't want to pay anyone well. I told someone else that the money I was making changed him. I slapped him in the face the hardest way possible, when he had already came to me feeling very vulnerable. Of course what I said eventually got back to him, and our relationship was over.  The money changed him I said. The only person the money changed was me.Something I should add was that throughout my college experience, I was envious of Tom. He was so much better than me in every way shape and form. Better looking, much smarter, much more sociable had great friends and got attention from girls left and right. That's part of the reason why I treated him so poorly as a friend.Senior year came and I eventually stopped talking to everyone except my girlfriend. My social life was dead outside of her. I graduated, said bye to them and that was that. I went on a hiatus from social media for 2 years so they never saw or heard from me after college. I saw them once in those 2 years, we got drunk together, but Tom got agitated with me sometimes, didn't trust me, and clearly held a lot of resentment towards me.It's now been 3 years since I graduated college. I regret it all. I met with one of my roommates recently, got very drunk and talked about our college days together. He talked about how some of his fondest memories was me and the rest of the crew just doing stupid shit together. I felt like crying, because I neglected them so much after all they had done for me and shown me such companionship. He told me how Tom was doing, and how much I fucked him up. He asked me to go talk to Tom, and I still haven't. I'm ashamed, Tom now lives in another country thousands of miles away after he found a beautiful girlfriend I've never met. But even if he lived in the same state as me, which he did for a year, I still wouldn't have seen him.If there's anyway to give a valid excuse for my actions, I was diagnosed with bipolar a year ago. I've been dealing with it since, trying to find the right medication and working with a therapist weekly to improve my life. We spoke a lot about Tom, and the funny thing was that I had no idea how much I wronged him. She had to show me that. I also deal with a lot of body image issues and a ton of family baggage and mentally I was a wreck but I'm pulling through.I'm not sure if anyone has read this at all, but it feels good to write this down. I wish I could show Tom this, but I never will. I miss him dearly.**tl;dr** My freshman roommate in college became my best friend and I severely neglected him and what we had. I was the horrible roommate. [info] None [info] 1472053450

bigdumps42 [info] I relate to struggling with the idea of being on meds. the long term effects are still a concern of mine. but what made me overcome wanting to not have to rely on a drug just to be normal was changing my perspective on what purpose the meds have for me. I think it's a misconception to think that meds are a cure all, or that you'll necessarily have to be on them your whole life. I view them as a tool to lessen the extent of my symptoms to put me in a better position to work on the issues that are causing a lot of the mental health problems to begin with. I'm diagnosed with bipolar and adhd. it's possible that I may have to be on some amount of medication throughout my life, but I like to think I can reach a point where I can be stable without them. even though there are physical causes to my symptoms, a lot of it is still coming from issues I have that can be worked through. so at the very least I can lessen the amount of meds I'd have to be on to remain stable. at least for me it's not worth not being on meds that I know help me just because of pride, and it doesn't make me weak or less of a person for having mental illness and taking meds. there's a quote from danielle koepke that I think you may find helpful. it's certainly helped me:"The fact that you’re struggling doesn't make you a burden. It  doesn't make you unlovable or undesirable or undeserving of care. It doesn’t make you too much or too sensitive or too needy. It makes you human. Everyone struggles. Everyone has a difficult time coping, and at times, we all fall apart. During these times, we  aren't always easy to be around — and that’s okay. No one is easy to be around one hundred percent of the time. Yes, you may sometimes be unpleasant or difficult. And yes, you may sometimes do or say things that make the people around you feel helpless or sad. But those things aren't all of who you are and they certainly don’t discount your worth as a human being. The truth is that you can be struggling and still be loved. You can be difficult and still be cared for. You can be less than perfect, and still be deserving of compassion and kindness." [info] None [info] 1472326315
RachAgainstLeMachine [info] Yes. Since eighth grade is been suffering from random, unexplainable emotion breakdowns. My senior year of high school (2015), Easter Day, had reached breaking point. My family and I were eating lunch at my grandma's house. I excuses myself from lunch and drove home.I then proceeded to lock myself up in the garage with all the windows and doors clothes and let myself get poisoned. 2 hours later, my family somehow. I got a call from my brother telling me to stay calm, but my dad (who didn't even live with us) had called the cops and they were on the way. I lost my shit. I screamed, cried, broke shit, went on an all-out rampage. When the cops and ambulance arrived, I begged not to be taken away, but I was hospitalized. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and then thrown into a correctional clinic with a bunch of ex-convicts and prostitutes.Although in the moment the situation kinda sucked, I wouldn't have changed anything about it. Going to that clinic and hearing about all the shit that these people had to go through made me realize how good I have it. It also made me realize that when we hear about people committing crimes on the news, we shouldn't be quick to judge because we don't know their entire story. As for me now, I am on meds and an completely happy. I am going to be starting my second year of college, have a stable job, and have an amazingly loving boyfriend. Life honestly couldn't get much better.  [info] None [info] 1472554230

Mangatato [info] &gt; She's been diagnosed with multiple other things, including borderline personaity disorder and ocdSorry, but this doesn't mean shit.I'm not saying that she 100% doesn't have those disorders or that she 100% has autism. But a diagnosis doesn't mean shit. I was diagnosed with bipolar. I don't have bipolar. I never once fit the symptoms at all. That wasn't the only thing either, I've been diagnosed with bpd and ocd and adhd, etc. Doctors tend to think they're better at their job than they actually are, and in my experiences, often don't listen to a word their client actually says.&gt; they wouldn't have missed autismNow I'm certain you have no idea what you're talking about, because I'm 21 years old, and despite seeing doctors since I was about 6-7 years old I wasn't diagnosed with autism until only *six months ago* and that was because I self-diagnosed myself by looking up the symptoms and then brought that information it to a psychiatrist  Thing is, unless she's like 11 years old, when she was younger doctors didn't know anything about autism.And when it comes to adults with autism, doctors are even more oblivious and ignorant. Doctors tend to look for the symptoms of autism that *children* have when they're deciding whether or not you're autistic. Regardless of the client's age. For some reason when it comes to autism, all common sense goes out the window. People who are 8 don't behave the same way when they're 16. or 19, or 30. Autism is no different, but for whatever reason people think they stay the same for their entire life. From what I've seen, not just doctors but almost everyone has a misconception of what autism is, ranging on the stupid scale anywhere from1) autistic people lack empathyto10) only boys can be autistic / *sees teenager throwing tantrum on staged prank video* "He must have autism" Until recently, it wasn't a well known condition. Actually even now it isn't a well known conditions. People hear the word 'autism' and what they think of is a bunch of stereotypes that have nothing to do with autism. There are even autistic people who don't fully understand what autism is.&gt; even if she had autism I'd still be perfectly in my rights to find her boring and annoying if she was boring and annoying.&gt; There is absolutely no requirement that people have to like everyone and not find them boring or annoying.That's true. But you're wrong in saying that ignoring someone is different from treating them poorly. People generally consider ignoring someone to be about as rude as insulting them to their face.When I said that my parents cut ties with people in our family for how they treated me, I was almost exclusively talking about his sister and her kids, because they pretty much didn't acknowledge that I existed in family functions. I wasn't talking about direct insults. One day my 'aunt' called and asked to have another family dinner and he basically flat out said he's tired of her and her family acting arrogant and rude towards me, and that he was breaking off the family ties permanently.

asilentsound [info] Eugenics is the selection against certain traits on the basis that one expects them to be passed on genetically. Granted, I'm in favor of evidence-based eugenics (which, by the way, is already widely practiced in the US without much hubbub), but there is a distinction between psychological screening to protecting children and eugenics. For this to be a eugenic policy, those with a genetic predisposition to mental illness would not be allowed to reproduce regardless of their treatment status. As I have repeatedly made clear, this is not what I have advocated.For example, CPS will remove children from home situations which are particularly unhealthy. Is this eugenics? Of course not (I would think), yet the difference between this and mental health screenings is simply a matter of degree. My proposal is simply a more exacting and preemptive version of policies already in place.In regard to the targeting of minorities, I would offer a few points. Firstly, I am a member of such a minority. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and before I finally received proper treatment it would have been immensely unethical to entrust a child into my care. I have yet to meet anyone with a diagnosed mental illness who was remotely fit to raise children. Second, much of my extended family suffers from various mental illnesses, so I am similarly familiar with the damage an ill person can inflict on a child's psyche. As far as this being a policy which targets a "minority", I think you underestimate just how widespread the sort of parental unfitness I described actually is. If anything, this would be a policy which targets a large plurality or nearly a majority, forcing them to receive treatment before having children.  [info] None [info] 1473116618

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in my late teens and somehow managed to see the beauty in that, and I'm hoping maybe one day I'll be able to see the beauty in this as well.

yowzabowsa [info] I have been in similar situation, but from your girlfriend's end. I'm diagnosed with bipolar as well. I was in a relationship with someone during a time when I shouldn't have been. I could hardly take care of myself and it was clear they were unequipped to handle severe mental illness (and very unhappy), so I ended the relationship. I felt very self-conscious about the burden I was placing on my partner. I find it notable that her suicide attempts were before your visits. Not to jump to conclusions but she may have felt that same stress about feeling burdensome.This is always a tough topic to handle. It hurts when people break up with you because of brain chemistry you can't help, but there's no avoiding the fact that serious mood disorders affect the people around you as well. There's also the problem of suicide as a manipulative threat but from your post it doesn't seem to be that kind of situation.Speaking of suicide-- that disturbs me. She was clearly deeply unhappy, and you specifically describe her bipolar illness as severe. Not only that but summer is just now ending-- these were awfully recent. I don't know exactly what "delay" followed but that moment should have prompted IMMEDIATE emergency action, possibly enrollment in a mental health facility for recovery. An actual attempt on your own life is something done in complete hopelessness. Relationships are very hard work and require a lot of sustained effort and communication and it's reasonable to assume that someone trying to take their own life cannot keep a healthy relationship in that time. Is she on medication or in therapy? You haven't made it clear. This is vital. She needs urgent help. It doesn't matter that the attempts were in the past, it's clear she is really not in a good place and is in need of some medical support.You're asking if you did the right thing, so I'm assuming you already broke up with her? In that case: make sure she has a safety net. This should be your first priority. Make sure she knows she is loved and cared for, and that her wellbeing is not dependent on you. I would see if you can get in touch with her parents-- she wants to be near them, so they must have a good relationship. Let them know you're worried for her and want to make sure she's okay. This is especially important if she was not medicated or in therapy. Bipolar left untreated only gets worse. Not only that but a breakup truly makes you feel alone in the world-- if anything she needs to be reminded that she is not.As for whether it was a good decision, your health is just as important as hers. If you truly felt that a breakup was the best option for the both of you, it's okay. The world won't end. Make sure she is loved and safe with her parents, and move on.The only thing I personally feel is better is that if you break it off, to really solidify that the relationship is over in that way. No "but maybe in the future, we may work it out, maybe we just need a break" etc. I feel like the open ends cause more distress than they're worth. Letting her know you care as a friend is good, but from experience I just really feel like implying you two can resume if she gets better is not worth it. Mental illness will never totally go away; you two have discussed long term, but mental illness is absolutely a long term consideration.EDIT: So she has been getting medical help, but feels abandoned. In that case I *really* want to urge you to get in touch with her friends or parents and let her know she's not alone. But don't let her manipulate you into staying. Emotional dependency is definitely unhealthy [info] None [info] 1474292197
K8af48sTK [info] Cognitive:I was very worried about my cognitive symptoms - mostly forgetting words, losing focus, typing things that were utterly different than what I thought I was typing (wrong words and sentences, not gibberish (usually) or typos), and being very, very slow at things I used to be very good at (namely coding - which is my bloody profession!). The MS center arranged a cognitive evaluation, which showed that my actual abilities are pretty much untouched, but my processing speed is way, way down. In other words, it takes me longer to think - literally! - than it used to, and in fast-moving situations I get flustered and lose the thread entirely. On the one hand, it is very reassuring to know that I am not actually losing my abilities. On the other hand, I still get flustered and drop out of fast-moving conversation, and coding takes me so long that I don't feel very competent anymore.Psychological:I have a mood disorder. For most of my life it was pretty much sub-clinical, but about six years ago things got really bad  and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type II - hypomania). My MS-neuro suspects that the worsening may have been related to my MS - even though I was only diagnosed last year, there are symptoms that may well have been relapses going back for many years. Regardless of the cause, I'm receiving treatment from a psychiatrist (lamotrigine is a lifesaver for me) that ameliorates a lot of the mood symptoms.(And note that I divide cognitive and psychological for formatting purposes only. There is a lot of cross-over.) [info] RRMS - dx 8/15 - Copaxone (40mg) [info] 1474313255

stripesfordays [info] Okay, I am in this process now and it is absolutely a nightmare. First of all, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder but I never have been the type to believe in mental issues being "real" so guess how I handled the panic attacks and mania?! I drank! I drank a ton and it led to necrotized pancreatitis and I am still alive by some grace and now I really want to get my life together. When I was in the hospital, I applied for SSI, and that was almost two years ago, but I am still waiting on my lawyer to get a trial date set. I live in the middle of nowhere in Texas and before I was diagnosed I intentionally wrecked my truck into a tree in a fit of mania so I really have been far from a "good guy" but I *really* have been trying to make myself a different person now. I'm 29 years old as well, so I'm sure that doesn't help my chances but I plan on trying to find a job that works with this if I could just get out of the endless country in Texas and find an apartment in a town where I could be close to a better job. I even tried yard work for my neighbor but wound up passed out in his flower beds 3 times because of the type one diabetes that I got from this. So all I can say is try to work if you can, and if you can't, lmk and I'll let you know how my court date goes for this. Keep on trying, don't let the despair overcome you!

DarkStar851 [info] Certified crazy! I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II when I was 15, long before ever trying spice. I was well aware of the risks and was pretty hesitant to smoke, but I didn't guinea pig it. I didn't black out until (while pretty drunk) I ripped an entire bowl thinking it was actual weed.So no, I appreciate your concerns, but that stuff didn't fuck me up. Was it stupid to smoke it? Definitely. Did it cause lasting neurological damage? Not that I can tell. [info] None [info] 1475190663
MyLastNameIsWensday [info] &gt;I very clearly stated that a bad batch or an adverse reaction can end catastrophically. Where did you say that?- Same thing happened to me, but instead of music I just hallucinated the entire thing and blacked out. Woke up covered in vomit and blood after falling into a glass table. Fuck RCs if I don't know what I'm consuming, never again. Stay safe man. That shit will mess you up. Not in this one- ah it was a helluva trip. I mean, terrifying and physically quite unpleasant, but it kinda blew my mind. I don't mind doing RCs, but "synthetic weed" is just a random blend of whatever chemicals they had available. Totally inconsistent. Wouldn't take much to find a batch that causes long-term harm I'm sure. Shrooms don't really lend themselves to music for me, but YMMV. Either way they're pretty fun :)Or here either.- I went off my mood stabilizers a few months back, toking definitely makes it a bit easier when I'm feeling low. :)Lol I bet your doc would really like to hear this one.- Certified crazy!

It was a stupid move, we were all already pretty high when we bought and smoked it, and I didn't go first lol. I'm fine with taking well-known and documented RCs, but sketchy blends are sketchyYour fine with taking RC's. Does your doctor share this view?- RCs and "synthetic weed", not really the same thing. I'm totally fine taking a few caps of a 2C compound, after a reagent test, but no. Smoking China's latest blend is not my idea of a fun time. Read some of my other posts in here, we were high and dry when we did it. It was stupid. But my only lasting regret is breaking my friend's hookah. edit: and obviously the "either way they're pretty fun" was in reference to shrooms, lol. Fucking moron. I googled what are research chemicals. - A "Research chemical" (RC) is a psychoactive drug that is implicitly sold for use in scientific and medical research. Many research chemicals are structurally similar to scheduled chemicals, and could be considered to be analogues. Some of them produce effects similar to illegal drugs. A lab built compound that analogues a illegal drug. I.E. Weed, Lsd, any drug for that matter. So yes they are the same. - Known lab suppliers, reagent testing, allergy testing and dose ramping. If it doesn't feel right, stop. Obviously it's a lot riskier than weed, but if you're cautious and well connected, you can be pretty safe about it. And nobody said anything about being a law-abiding citizen. I know labs that'll whip you up a batch of Xanax if you want some. I'm talking about individual RCs in this post, I don't know any specific labs for spice, and I don't really want to.As for your new post. Your trusting a illegal lab not to break any laws. Trusting a illegal lab to not accidentally mix up a batch. Trusting **a illegal lab** not to think fuck safety. I'm selling whatever chemical I have as another. And finally your trusting a kid who can't get a job any else but a illegal lab to care.Also didn't see anywhere about saying anything about. - I very clearly stated that a bad batch or an adverse reaction can end catastrophically.Anywhere in your posts.Edit. As for the last part. My half sister is bi polar. I'm quite informed about that disease. I was referring to you finding a post about something you've done before. Getting caught up in telling your awesome story. Not caring about who could come after and see it. You portrayed it as no big deal. That would be impulse. [info]  [info] 1475195324
FromTheRavenFarm [info] I'm a few years older than you and I was diagnosed with bipolar II at 16. I went through some similar struggles... You know... It's not easy my dear but you DO have resources (therapist, psychiatrist) and you DO want to be happy. I'm sure you will find your way in the world; it's just tough to be that age and have to make so many major life decisions with almost no life experience - be patient and don't worry about school. School will be there when you're ready. I had to drop out twice due to medical issues. I kept at it and now I'm graduating in four months. I just didn't give up. I refused to let it go. You'll get there, and when you do, you'll really be able to help others in whatever career field you choose because you will have empathy and compassion for all kinds of  people - especially people like your brother, and your mom... You really seem sensitive, introspective, kind, and intelligent. Cherish those gifts and take things day by day. Tomorrow all you have to worry about is that one day. Be nice to yourself. Utilize those resources but remember it's also within you to overcome these fears. That's the main thing holding you back, perhaps? Be proud of who you are. You're becoming an adult. It's not easy. You're doing fine. Hugs from SoCal. [info]  [info] 1475206277

cmark88 [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar II and ADHD, so I know a little bit about what you're going through. People that haven't experienced how these medications make people feel can lack empathy. When I was on medication, I feel like I lost all drive to be empathetic, when normally I am extremely so. The lack of empathy made it so I didn't care at all that I was failing out of college my second semester and wasting my parents' money, when normally that would have caused me a great deal of stress and guilt and shame.Since that time, I've been able to complete college and a graduate degree thanks be to God. I haven't been on lamictal for 8+ years now, and off of adderol for 4+ years. Instead of continuing down a path of trying to medicate everything, my urge would be to seek help from a qualified professional counselor. One that won't jump to medication as the first option. Be honest with yourself though, you need help. You need prayer. You need wise counsel. You need friends/pastors/family that understand and empathize with you, but who also won't allow you to make excuses for poor behavior.Edit: also, I urge you brother to remember that our Holy Spirit is a Spirit of self-control. It will be tempting to be compulsive while you are manic. You will feel the urge surging through you like a train engine to be compulsive and explosive in some way. Pray. Resist. Call on trusted friends to pray with you. [info] Christian. Evangelical. Reformed. [info] 1475523655

squidteam6 [info] These were the same symptoms I was experiencing when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Not to say he's going through the same thing, but it sounds like he's dealing with some sort of struggle that does need medical intervention. That being said, it comes down to the individual actually agreeing to it unless they are actively threatening to harm themselves, in which case you can get a mandatory hold. Early 20s are when these things can start to come out in people. This may also be a huge leap, but it could also be drug related if he's getting nosebleeds and it's blowing through money, changing his eating habits etc.  [info] None [info] 1475712464

You're not a piece of shit for "not being able to handle the mental illness", she's a piece of shit for using her mental illness as an excuse to behave however she wants with no regard for how it affects other people.Also, sudden, unexplained accusations of cheating usual mean that the accuser is cheating.**TL;DR:** Dump this girl, she cray :P [info] 24, Boston [info] 1475954116
yeoldesarz [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a little over a year ago after a pretty bad manic episode. The signs were there for a long time, but most people (myself included) thought I was just depressed. Even today, I think the worst part is not knowing whether you're having a good day or you're a bit manic. I've been prescribed meds which I take most of the time, but every now and then I stop because I convince myself that I'm not bipolar. And that's when I realize that I most certainly am bipolar.

egglentine [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 I had the hardest time remembering to take my birth control. I was put on psych meds after a complete breakdown that landed me in a hospital. It magically became easier to remember to take my meds after that. I had such a strong desire to feel better. Sounds like you also have that desire!Now I take my meds right when I wake up. I keep them next to my bed with a glass of water. I also have a pouch with "e-z dose" bags so I can carry my meds with me at all times. I sing a little song to myself as I'm walking out the door. "Phone Keys Wallet Meds!" Carrying the pouch around means I can take my meds as soon as I remember instead of waiting until I'm home again. It's also more discrete than any other method I've tried.The meds won't make your symptoms disappear completely. They WILL take the edge off. They reduce severity and frequency of my episodes and that alone gives me enough clarity to keep my meds (and myself) in check. It took me a long time to find the right doses of the right meds but I'm so glad I stuck with it. I feel more stable now than ever before.  This may be an extreme statement but I truly believe that my meds saved my life.  [info] None [info] 1476673440
Lanuria [info] The Jedi have emotions. To think they don't is silly. They are human(oid) and, imo, they feel so much love that it's ridiculous. Maybe it's not a romantic or sexual love, but being able to put yourself in the middle of a fight to save people who may not even believe you exist is an act of love. To resist a tempting power so you don't hurt anyone is an act of love. Personal story time! I'm diagnosed with bipolar, so strong emotions have ruled my life for a long time. They have ruined relationships with friends and family. They have lead me dangerously close to suicide. They ruled me, they controlled me. It was so freeing to finally get on medications and not have my manics and depressive control how I thought. Sure, maniacs are kinda fun, but they are dangerous in the long run. It was liberating to finally be in control of what controlled me. I am able to hold down a great job, to have a great relationship with my husband, to find peace in my life. I still have manic or depressive episodes, it's normal. But I've learned they don't define me. I'm better than them. That's how I see the Jedi way of life. I can take my manics and do something good with them, like sewing, but I can also tell myself 'no, I don't need to buy a new sewing machine, no, I need to sleep, I'm not going to stay up forever.' The Jedi are like that. Manics aren't really an example of the dark side, but maybe they are a good example of what a force sensitive could go through. So much power, you can do so much, but if you let it control you instead of working with it, you can end up hurting yourself and others.  [info]  [info] 1476979819
Zerimas [info] I was worried about the thighs being too small. In the last 4 months I went from wearing N&amp;F Weird Guys in size 30 (which actually measures 32" and they were stretch) to needing a 36" waist. Now that I have pants that I can wear, my next step is some kind of exercise regimen. I dunno. I think they look OK. Upon reviewing this potato quality picture, I noticed that my ass fills out the  pants—but the thighs not so much. From the front I find it to look pretty satisfactory. Maybe the goal of filling out the thighs will give me something to shoot for?I am probably overly self-conscious. I have never struggled with my weight.

I recently found out that my bipolar 2 diagnosis never truly fit my symptoms and I was officially diagnosed schizoaffective. Im in between meds and the voices and shadows are all I can think about.

fakefreckles [info] I second this! I rapid cycle *a lot* so it's really difficult for me to commit to things, be it relationships or work or what-have-you. I feel like I live inside my head and external stimuli irritates the holy crap out of me, because it distracts me from all the important going ons inside my head. That being said, I love making new friends but I tend to overshare a lot, so when I feel like people aren't reciprocating and appreciating my efforts in getting to know them I flip *instantly* and boom, I'm knee deep in a depressive episode. As for OP, welcome to the club! I was diagnosed with bipolar II about two years ago and ever since then things have started to make more sense to me. As in, I now understand why I am the way I am. I'm extremely unpredictable with my moods and thoughts and wants, and I'm always lowkey irritated because my mind is just so *busy.* Most of the time I feel like I'm on a wild rollercoaster ride that I can't get off of and I'm often really tired because of it. I also have OCD tendencies like you, I'm very particular about my home and the placement of things. I get very upset if there's mess or things like that. Maybe I like order because my mind is so chaotic? It's a mystery. [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1477589884
wheelchairassassins [info] I love my story. I was in a manic phase, it was a long one with a lot of promiscuity and thievery and compulsions. He found me on MySpace and after a month of talking, invited me to his house for a movie. He had a cold, so I brought a can of soup and didn't even heat it up. Let's face it, I was planning on getting laid and that would probably be that. I ended up spending the night, and we watched Star Trek: Wrath of Khan (first brush with real sci fi I had ever had) and then the next day I watched him play video games all day. The next weekend we spent together and Sunday night, after I went home, he checked himself into a hospital for hallucinations, visual and auditory. He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and I felt like just bailing on him because he had a diagnosis of some kind. (This was before I was diagnosed with anything, I just thought I was generally fucked up.) In the ensuing months, he was kicked out of his house, had to move in with his terrible birth parents who he didn't have any contact with at the time, off and on all kinds of anti psychotics...it was a really hectic year and I didn't know what I was doing. I just knew that a) I was emotionally dependent and desperate for someone to love me and b) I really liked this guy a lot! He went on disability, things settled and we're now 11 years on. Since then, I've been diagnosed with bipolar, gone through ridiculous med changes and have also gone on disability, so now we live the life of two 30-something octogenarians. It's my favorite love story. [info] None [info] 1477612734
awakening-irl [info] Just going to put a TW on this, just to give you a heads up.TW// Self harmHi! I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 1 as of 4 years ago. I suffer from major manic/depressive episodes every year or two, and I deal with hypomania regularly. Hypomania for me is having grandiose ideas, wanting to fuck every one I meet, abusing drugs/alcohol daily, and wanting to "stand out". With mania, you assume the role of God. Anything you want can be yours, as long as you put on a pretty smile and do everything in your power to get it. You go from this: "Mixing lithium and whiskey? No big deal, you're gonna die in a few years anyway! Staying up for 36 hours straight?? Yes, I can do that!" to this: "Holy shit I am worthless. The entire world despises me. My mom wanted to abort me, that's what a family member told me when I was 12 so it must be true. I wish I could trade brains with someone"... All in one day. I'll never forget the time I was manic for 3 months and I did some crazy stuff. Driving on icy/dangerous roads at 100mph, having sex with someone on the first day I met them, hearing voices, cutting my arm because it felt tingly and nice... Moral of the story, hypomania is like the mosquito that buzzes in your ear all day, every day.... Mania is the mosquito that bites you and gives you a disease that you suffer greatly from (but only for brief periods of time, thankfully). BUT, I switched from lithium to weed over the course of the past year and it has improved my mood swings immensely. I still have my moments, but I have been doing extremely well as of lately.

msanonymous000 [info] I'm 19 and I was diagnosed with bipolar in high school. Here's the thing, bipolar is kind of medical. It's a chemical imbalance in your brain. It's the meds' job to stabilize that. I've tried going without medication and it didn't do me well. We have something out there that can help us feel better, take advantage of it. It's a bummer that we have to live like this but it'll make treatment easier and coping easier. You can try going without meds...but it can be more of a struggle. I encourage you, don't think you can do this all on your own. Sometimes admitting you need that crutch it's the greatest strength. [info] None [info] 1478527977
Kighla [info] I wonder if he has some major self confidence issues, thus the need to "appear busy/useful".This reminds me so so much of myself about two years ago. I had just moved in with my boyfriend, was unaware of the fact I was bipolar, and started to get depressed.As I got depressed getting work done was harder for me. Everything seemed like a challenge and I started to realize I was getting nothing done. I'm also very ADHD and I tend to not notice very obvious things wrong (like doors falling off hinges) because I'm too focused on some small insignificant thing. Anyway, I got more and more depressed and was doing less and less work. Every day I felt like a bigger disappointment to my boyfriend. He would practically beg me to help but I would sulk and say I was too tired or it was too much. Any task he'd try to give me, I'd get an excuse not to. If he tried to give me ANY sort of criticism, even something small (like buying the wrong brand of whatever) I would get hyper defensive.The more and more depressed and lazy I got, the more and more self conscious and defensive I felt. I got it in my head that I was so fucking lazy and when he was home I tried to prove I was doing stuff, so I would do weird insignificant tasks loudly to be noticed. But I only did things I felt comfortable with, and neglected actual chores.Months passed by and our relationship got really fucked. He ended up losing it and we almost broke up. Luckily we both decided to do couples counseling and individual counseling and our relationship is very strong. Last year I was diagnosed with bipolar and started on medications that have helped me immensely. So perhaps it could end up being very positive for him too to go through the therapy to find out what's wrong. [info] None [info] 1478809577

kuropixie21 [info] I felt this way too OP, honestly I wanted to give up on therapy but I needed a new doctor for continuing my klonopin prescription (the old one was just an awful man) and when she did my initial intake that was when I was diagnosed with bipolar. Therapy can definitely be taxing, but having gone without it for months now, it's also very helpful. Just be honest, start slow, and maybe only start with appointments once a month if you still aren't sure. Therapy also isn't for everyone. It is never to late to get help though.

Tryinghere777 [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar for 2 or 3 years now and am just now starting to accept my diagnosis this past couple of months. I never liked to think of the possibility. I felt like it was just issues I was having in my life at the time and I needed to better control my emotions. My illness has effected every aspect of my life. I recently have had to stop going to college and am unable to have a job. It can be crippling at times. Believe it or not though there are positives that come out of it.  I don't believe I'd be the person I am today without my illness. I am much more understanding and motivated when it comes to people and life.  I didn't choose to be bipolar.  It's something that has decided to shove it's way into and rule my life.  But I look at it as a challenge.  Overcoming what seems to be impossible dilemmas that the everyday person couldn't dream of doing is what keeps me going. I also remember that life isn't ALWAYS hard.  I've had very good points in my life and know there are more to come. My illness has made me a stronger,  more motivated,  and more of an empathetic person.  I would rather go through life having a difficult time and be a good person rather than a shallow person who doesn't know what hardship is.  [info] None [info] 1479866037
scout_jem [info] Today I went to a psychiatrist for the first time since I was 17, (I'm now 30). At 21 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by my GP as I had a long standing mental health history. So today during my initial assessment with my psychiatrist I have been officially diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type II. I already knew this was my diagnosis after a lot of research when I was 21. My psychiatrist is suggesting I go back on an anti-psychotic, (I have been off mine for about a month). She suggests Abilify. She will be sending that recommendation to my GP and he will eat it in about a month so now I have some time to consider that recommendation.  [info] None [info] 1480052852

victorbonhart [info] also hey. I am diagnosed with bipolar ii and I also have uncontrollable anger which hurt others but my psychiatrist told it's self defense mechanism for me.But it's unhealthy so I am not going to defend this kind of mechanism.I tried several stuffs that considered helpful but unfortunately it full of bullshit.I also being prescribed with ability and diazepam which help me a lot. I don't have a full rage anymore but I have trouble with the side effects. I also need to talk to my current psychiatrist about my hallucination delusion and also the voices.After I took the meds I no longer hallucinate and delusion including the voices become lessen.My own helpful to approach with the anger problems are to embrace it.Not accepting it as a good thing but it is part of you. Usually when we are angry it is because something bothered us and that the person who makes you angry you feel hurt that you need to hurt the person back. I don't want to offend you or anything but that is how I see things and it works for me.That not being angry meaning you don't care.It's like seeing thing as "I have no purpose in life" but I will make my own purpose in life kind of way.

Pineygirl13 [info] I was just diagnosed with bipolar 1 this summer too. I've always had a pattern of self destructive behavior but it was scary out of control this time. I did not give a shit about anyone or anything but myself. I was going to do whatever made me happy at anyone's expense. Even my own. Sleeping around and all. All I cared about was looking my best, going out drinking and getting allll the attention. I was a fucking celebrity. Everyone look at me, I'm beautiful, smart, funny and successful. If you don't like me beat me up. Lol. I worked out like crazy. I spent money on fake eyelashes, hair extensions, clothes, facials. You name it. I'm still dealing with the path of destruction I left. Debt, fucked up marriage, I was an ass to my friends trying to help me. I haven't tried getting on meds yet. Not drinking alcohol and limiting caffeine has helped a lot more than I thought. Caffeine makes me manic as fuck, I'm all over the place talking a mile a minute. Plus I'm an Italian from New Jersey so hands are flying. It's a scary sight. All I know is I don't want that to ever happen again.  [info] None [info] 1480543192
i_have_a_semicolon [info] That's an interesting take on BPD, I must say I don't think "changing identities" is the only criterion. Bpd, like most metal disorder, is categorized by many different symptoms and in order to be diagnosed you must show a minimum of 5 or something like that. So even if you are not trying on different identities like clothes, you can still have BPD.Another thing is that although only ~1% of the pop are diagnosed, its possible the actual figure is somewhere around ~7%I have been researching this lately, because I was diagnosed with bipolar II many years ago, taking medication, and it's mostly "in remission", but despite this I still have emotional reactions that are not proportional to the stimuli. Someone on RP suggested I may have BPD, and after some reading I found bipolar and BPD can be comorbid. This new information has shown me there's still more i can do to "fix" myself - and thus I will be working harder on getting this under control. It's great that people like you are educating others - often times, even psychiatrist won't mention this. I hadn't heard about BPD until RP mentioned it - and after I did my own research I may bring my new self diagnosis back to my therapist/psych, and see if I could start doing CBT [info] None [info] 1480781260
mindaq [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about 4 years ago, but I've felt like there's something else going on, because even with great medication that helped tremendously, there were still unexplainable things going on. I was just diagnosed with BPD a few weeks ago, and it makes so much sense and fills in the gaps of how I feel on a regular basis. It's not uncommon to have both! Like someone else said, all it does is give you a guideline or a place to start understanding what you experience and how you feel. Meds won't change much, but therapy is ultimately the way to help treat BPD. I'm now in therapy, and after only a few sessions, it's helped a ton. [info] None [info] 1480793961
schatzebriest [info] It's just like I used to be suicidal since I was 10 and two years ago and always treated with anti-depressants until finally three years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (I'm 20 btw) and, here you go, bpd, npd and hpd. Then I started doing drugs, quit uni and finally i ended in a psych ward. I felt like a brand new person when I went out and shortly after I met the guy. Back then I was finally taking proper medication and therapy let me cure the cluster B personality disorders, I found a job that I was satisfied with, with the plan I'll continue studying when I move in to my beloved. The relationship was an idyll. Unlikely with my previous relationships, I never gave him the impression I'm mentally ill. It was like that for almost two years, I felt like a whole person and, finally, happy for the first time in my life. And I thought I wouldn't depend my happiness on him, even though what I've been always looking for was a sense of security - I could never rely on any of my parents, basically my family is shit (after my suicidal attempt when I was 16 I was left by my mother on a toxicology ward for three days with no book telephone or shit and when she picked my up from the hospital she got angry about some tiny thing and kicked me out of the car and told to get home by myself). I thought to love and to be loved is just another beautiful thing and I don't need anyone to validate me as a person. God how I was wrong. I've been in this place, considering suicide 15 times a day so many times before and I was so convinced I won't be there anymore. Now I haven't been sober in a month and I have no idea what had happened or who am I or how can I trust anyone or why the fuck am I making this thread about me, Raizerback45, I'm sorry, I love you, it's just there's no Tom, or Mary, or Vlad or Percy for me.

driedtentacles [info] It helps. I was diagnosed with bipolar II so I take anti-psychotics along with therapy. I went the direct approach and just had a walk in appointment straight to the psychiatrist that was available the first time I went.I guess you could go to a family doctor first so they could refer you to the appropriate professional once they have an idea of what you might have. Just explain whatever it is your feeling and what you fear it might be.Otherwise, follow the other guys' advice. [info] ang patis na may uri [info] 1481035456

Pineygirl13 [info] Your story reminded me so much of my childhood. My father was bipolar and I kid you not raged out in his underwear with a shotgun once. I have so many stories like this because it was the norm at my house. My dad was an alcoholic and we didn't know he was bipolar schizophrenic until he was 50! We just thought he was an alcoholic. Now that I've been diagnosed with bipolar and had my first manic episode recently I completely understand what my dad was going through. The saying you never truly understand until it happens to you is so true. I wish my father was still alive so I can help him.

I can tell you from my perspective that the only thing that troubled about his diagnosis is that he was in denial and still remains to be.

HeathenMama541 [info] I can't comment on the bread so I'm going to reply to you directly. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar and medicated, my cycles were so drastic that it affected every aspect of my life. My job, my parenting, my relationship. I went on a very emotionally violent downward spiral over the summer and finally brought it all up to my psychiatrist who put me on 20 mg of celexa (citalopram) a day, and my life has been significantly better ever since. I'm calmer, more rational and level headed, and the paranoia has completely been eliminated from my psyche. I strongly suggest taking the steps towards medication. Mental health is just as important as physical health. We wouldn't expect a diabetic to go without insulin, why would we expect ourselves to go without medications that help us with our mental health?  [info] None [info] 1482023888

katerosetyler [info] my mother couldn't deal with teenage me so she conned a psychiatrist into prescribing me heavy doses of antipsychotic meds that made me so stoned I nearly flunked out of high school.little backstory: I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, and I am really, really smart. I got straight A's up until 8th grade. honor roll, teacher's pet, did extra credit for fun and ended every semester with 100%+ in every class. my teachers recommended me for honors classes. during the summer before high school, my mother brainwashed me into thinking "these meds will make you happy" (but what preteen isn't fucked up). I took them. I slept 18 hours a day. my memory is wiped.  I remember very little of high school. I was nearly expelled from public school for being a poor student. I transferred to an independent study school. I was doing middle-school level work but still doped up on very high doses of drugs intended for paranoid schizophrenics deemed dangerous to society (5'4, 120 lbs). I was a zombie. I don't even remember graduating. I have photos, and looking at them is kind of creepy. I'm smiling but I'm not all there.the entire time, she couldn't figure out why I wasn't excelling in high school. somehow this was my fault. I wasn't trying hard enough, stop sleeping so much. (my mother is a god damn doctor, a very good one. she should know better)I'm 22 now, on a very low dose of the same meds and I recently pulled out all my old high school work and I realized I did this, all of this, harder than this, in middle school. off the top of my head. I never learned how to study cause I never needed to. I'm seeing my psychiatrist in January to tell her I'm stopping these meds, cause I'm still stoned, to the point of not being motivated to do anything. I still sleep 14 hours a day. However, I can remember things better. I am so furious at my mother for basically forcing these drugs down my throat and cheating me out of what could have been an Ivy League education. I KNOW I'm smart. my parents, their siblings, every fucking person I have been blood related to for generations has masters' degrees or above. doctors, professors, scientists. google Christopher Austin MD. that's my uncle. I remember as a child, before I was medicated, I read books like I needed them to live. I wanted to know everything. Words were like crack to me, reading news stories, I lived for that. I'd get yelled at in class for reading books under my desk. at the end of the year my teachers would give my parents back an entire stack of books they confiscated from me. I got yelled at for working ahead (education is weird). I was 8, 9 years old and completing the new york times crossword puzzle in 15 minutes. I stole my parents' medical textbooks and studied the gross pictures and read about them. I wanted to BE somebody. I had so, so many dreams and aspirations and these drugs just...wiped me. imagine the most stoned or drunk you have ever been, then being incredibly exhausted on top of that. that's like my entire high school life was like. no wonder they put severely mentally ill people on these drugs, they turn you into a compliant zombie. I never said no to anything cause I didn't have the mental capacity to be aware that I could. all I wanted to do was get them to stop talking to me so I could sleep.I learned, this year, that my parents are not always right. psychiatrists are not always right. don't take pills just cause somebody tells you they'll make you feel better. I'm 22 with barely an associate's degree. everyone I went to high school with graduated with BA's this year cause they didn't spend high school fried to the point of retardation. I hate it. I hate it knowing that could have been me. I KNOW that's me. I'm still in here...somewhere. I can't wait for detox. I can't wait to see life in color again. I want to feel alive, and I want to live like a normal person. I want to want to do things. I want to want to learn again. I WANT to be motivated. it's a weird feeling.I think I got off topic. TL;DR your parents aren't always right. your doctors aren't always right. people older than you are not always right. if something doesn't feel right to you, you fucking fight tooth and nail to get out of it. I'm gonna be a doctor someday. and I'm gonna be a good one. [info] None [info] 1482209992
scout_jem [info] My dear friend. You are not alone in this. I am 30 years old and my starting weight was 368 pounds. I had a full blown meltdown when I saw that number, because in my had I was fat but I wasn't THAT fat. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 16 years ago and I used that as an excuse to balloon in weight. After all, my meds make me gain weight so clearly I wasn't the reason I got fat. I'm so happy(?) that you have been able to admit that you need to change. The important thing to note is that you have said to yourself that you are ready to change. The truth is if somebody doesn't want to change, then it won't work. I suggest researching lifestyle plans. There are many ways to lose weight. It may take some trial and error but you will be able to find something that works for you!Do not give up! I know that sounds silly but losing weight when you are as addicted to food as I was is so hard! It's the hardest thing I have ever done. For the first two months I thought about food 24/7. I always had before but this was different. Worse. Sometimes it was hard to stay motivated, but once you get in the habit it gets a lot easier. Once you start to see the scale move it keeps you going. My current weight is now 262lbs. I lost 106lbs since August. It can be done. You can do this. And now you have an entire community here to back you up. Keep coming back here. We support you.  [info] 110lbs lost [info] 1482279492
redundantunicron [info] Bipolar disorder is not a biological disease, it is a mood disorder. One of the main causes for manic and depressive episodes is stress, which can be helped by books. Medication isn't the end all, be all, that most make it out to be. I know because I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and have read several books about buddhism and they have helped me more than any medication has. Specifically, "The Art of Happiness", "When Things Fall Apart", and "What The Buddha Taught". [info] None [info] 1482340042
HiddenSecrets [info] Good on you!!It must be such a relief to get out all those feelings. I know where you are coming from when you say you don't feel alive. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 28. It was so bad that I was hospitalized on and off for two years straight. ImIf you add up the time I believe it would have been a good 9 months. During that time my parents visited me maybe four or five times. It was a rehab place so they told me it was like a day spa, I didn't need visitors. It was nothing like a day spa!! I was struggling to see the point in living, I didn't feel like I was alive. I was only existing.  Upon meeting my parents my psychiatrist found the root of my problem, my mother had asked him "when will she snap out of it". Since that day he gently brought my attention to the way they treated me. Over time he was the one to suggest low contact. He never once spoke bad about them, or called them narcissists. Just said "as a parent this is how I believe you should be treated" and often gave me stories on his parenting. So called "family lunches" would happen at their place and I was always the one they would target about some bullshit. My GC sister would happily join in. When those moments happened I decided to leave on the spot. I thanked them for their time and just left. That started happening more and more. I wasn't even making it to lunch being served. One day I decided I didn't want to go to lunch and I didn't. That's how my no contact started. I blocked them all on social media. I'd get abusive texts, so unblocked them from my phone too. They aren't blocked from my home phone or my husband's so if something was really important they could still get in touch. They have never tried, not even once. It's been almost 4 years and my psychiatrist says I am in remission from my bipolar. I have been off meds for two years (dr's orders) and have not had one episode. I am happy all the way to my soul. My marriage is wonderful, but when they were around it was falling apart. No contact is deeply sad, yet so fucking rewarding!!! As for my bipolar remission, I worked hard to get past all that shit. I wasn't misdiagnosed like I've been told by keyboard doctors. It was triggered by a certain traumatic event and sustained because of narcissistic assholes. I did intense therapy. I wanted control, I fought for it and I won!! Intense therapy and medication does help, if you really want it.Op, I wish you all the very best. It may take a while to gain your love of life back, but you will get it. You will find happiness!!  [info] None [info] 1482442458

Officeprisoner [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar (but I'm not convinced it isn't just my character rather than an illness).

I also suffer extreme constipation which means I have to take a lot of medication which seriously effects my life.

jamie_jamie_jamie [info] TL;DR- A horrible hallucination and a dead guy under a train.Most terrifying would be one of my hallucinations. I was diagnosed with bipolar type II and a symptom is hallucinations. I was living out of home with my boyfriend, we were laying in bed and I was trying to sleep but the streetlights were bright and we had shitty blinds. Our bed is parallel to the wardrobe which had mirrors for the doors and at the end of our bed was the TV. I was facing the wardrobe with my head on his chest, and I kid you not, there was a pale woman behind me just sitting there staring at the TV in the reflection. She was in a white torn up nightgown kind of thing with long stringy, oily black hair, and her skin looked like she was covered in bruises. I turned around to look behind me and I couldn't see her but when I turned to look at the mirror again I saw her again. It scared the fuck out of me. My boyfriend who has hallucinations as well helped me get through the fear. Now I know that it's all in my head and can't hurt me, but having my first one was horrible.The other thing was that I mum and I saw cop cars hanging around the train station near our place, so being the sticky beaks that we were, we drove down to have a look, as we were driving past I looked under the train because curiosity, and for about 10 metres there were human remains. Turns out the guy was walking on the tracks with headphones in and didn't hear the freight train that killed him. [info] None [info] 1482921327

M3cha [info] Good!I too recently started seeing a professional for my issues. I had a bad later-half-of-the-year, what with failure to find a good job, financial issues, and relationship woes (3 year relationship ended mostly on the grounds on my instability). I went to a really dark place and after a particularly crushing refusal for a second interview, I tried to commit suicide.During this dark time (and after my relationship ended), I started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist in tandem. Got medicated. Am doing better; not as great as I was in the summer, but comparatively better than the last couple months.Your doctor will most likely suggest therapy. If you have anything akin to suicidal ideation, self harm, or anything in that vein, a psychiatrist will most likely be suggested to go in tandem with the therapy. Don't be scared and let your doctor help you find a therapist and a psychiatrist. Be thoroughly honest with the medical professionals; lying or misleading them only hurts you.I tried to do the whole "willpower" thing for years. Leaned on my ex for too much and she was scared to the point of being terrified of complaining to me, lest it make me depressed. Now... now I'm diagnosed with bipolar II and am getting treated for it.If you're like me, you'll think you're a burden, damaged, not normal, or an amalgamation of all those. While I still feel those issues, do as I say and not as I do (in this particular facet): Don't worry about all of that.You'll get better! [info]  [info] 1483040424

Unless I think about these ticks, I do them very sporadically (and most people don't notice them, unless they are family, good friendss or dating me) BUT if I think about them I have to do them because otherwise I can't stop thinking about them and it disrupts my daily activities. Doing them makes me 'feel good'. These ticks are worse drunk, on low sleep, or on drugs. I have been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder with psychotic episodes but I think this may be related to Tourette's due to an abusive and troubling upbringing. [info] None [info] 1483272066
ricctp6 [info] You can totally do it! I appreciate your honest answer and I understand. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago. I kept telling every internist that I had a thyroid problem. Took me 17 years to get someone to listen to me. Got my thyroid under ultrasound, turns out it was basically dead. A lot of things I thought were normal were symptoms of my autoimmune. Now, just dealing with it is tough as things can change at the drop of a hat. I hope your medical stuff gets better and hang in there! [info] http://a.co/9PZlrDL [info] 1483561667
elllephant [info] I'm a mess :')Mid twenties, living with my husband and my cat. Paying my rent, trying to finish my arts degree - I was diagnosed with bipolar type II in 2011, and it makes it so hard to stay consistent and focused in class. I aced high school without any effort but I'm six years into a three year degree because I can only do a couple of subjects at a time and I burn out easily. I'm consistently torn between being hugely disappointed in myself for not graduating yet or giving myself small pats on the back for being financially self sufficient and holding down a job that I'm good at, even if it's entry level.

Perkinz [info] Eh, from where I am you're all eastern ;)And to be honest, I'm not sure why.I doubt it's insomnia, though it's definitely easiest to describe it like that.It happens maybe once every month or two though.For a couple of days I'll be... definitely not amped or energetic, but well, "normal"---Like a short rest would be nice but can be done without----And when I do go to sleep it's for short periods of time (3~5 hours) and I wake up feeling groggy but otherwise still good to go-----And then for a couple days I go to sleep early and sleep for long periods of time (9~12 hours).Typically the whole cycle is over in less than a week, though a couple years back I remember one time where just the first phase lasted 2 weeks.Last night was the first night this time and I was able to get to sleep decently ish, and I assume this coming night or the one after will be the last of the first phase.I know back in high school I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and when I was on the pills for that it was much, much worse---But, then, my mother was going doctor shopping for someone who'd believe everything she said, so who knows whether or not I actually have bipolar disorder and if its even related to this at all.All that said, apart from a small handful of times it's not debilitating or hindering and I function well despite it.I've definitely come to like the second part, though.I get the best sleep then----When I'll lay down in bed it'll just feel like I'm melting into my bed and it's just so damned comfortable and I wake up feeling real nice.Definitely have to thank this, though, as those nights where I'm unable to sleep gave me a chance to woo my current girlfriend and she's absolutely wonderful.

BaltsDeep [info] This is actually the reason I smoke.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 7 years old, and spent the years from 7-23 heavily medicated.  In the process I became hypothyroid, went from slim and on a swim team to a morbidly obese compulsive eater whose metabolism was basically switched off by anti-depressants.  When I was 14 I decided that I wanted to have such a level of self-control that I could stop myself from going into a manic rage.  Didn't start smoking until I was 21, and I instantly found that it was a substitute for just about every medication I was on.  Feeling stressed/manic?  Take a puff and level out.  Feeling depressed/anxious?  Take a puff and level out.  At 23 I stopped the last of my medication cold turkey, a mood stabillizer.  And at the time I wasn't really smoking much because I had become a dad and didn't want to smoke around my child.  But I found very quickly that moderation is key.  A quick puff before I go into work makes my fuse 30x longer.  A bowl after a hard day when I'm feeling depressed helps me see the light that paints my life, not just the darkness.  And aside from the ever-looming possibility of a random drug test at work, there are no side-effects that cause it to even come close to what those prescription pills did to me.  I'm healthier than I've ever been, weigh what I did as a fat 8th grader, and love my life.  Big pharma be damned, this herb is a lifesaver! [info] None [info] 1483649849

However, it still affects my life from time to time blah blah blah. And see what she says if she says nothing then move on or answer any of her questions. You could then say that you are glad that you finally told her because some people find it a deal breaker and you wanted to make it known before it got more serious.

anonfapstronaut8 [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar.Never in my life have I been violent or had violent tendencies and never once have I planned to hurt anyone, not even myself. The only times I've used physical force have been in self defense.According to most people who support the idea that we need to take guns away from the 'mentally ill', I should not be allowed to own a gun.Fuck that.I also think it's important to keep a sense of perspective. The amount of people killed by gun violence is dwarfed in comparison by the amount of people killed by vehicles, smoking, obesity, etc. Don't get me wrong, all lives lost are a tragedy and all of these mass shootings are horrendous, but we need to ask if we are willing to trade our individual liberty for any amount of security. And in this case, I'd say the evidence is shoddy that stricter gun laws lead to a reduction in violent crime anyways.Bad people are bad, regardless of their so-called 'mental health'. I've seen the most straight-laced, by the book people do the most horrendous things, and then there are people like [this](https://youtu.be/Y1aOnK-vSvs) , who if we were to meet on the street, would immediately be labeled mentally ill, who wouldn't hurt a fly.Also, I think it's a dangerous path to go down allowing ANY government to decide who is considered mentally capable of owning a gun or keeping any other rights they may have.The potential for abuse of that power is uncomfortable, to say the least.

btn1136 [info] I think part of me lost hope and stopped dreaming when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I really lost my sense of self; I kind of just resigned myself because I didn't feel in control. I handled this by becoming a teacher that works with students that experience emotional and learning barriers in schools. It's really been my only way to cope and provide meaning. However, I'm learning that I need to help myself first-- I'm transitioning to a new career as I finish a MBA program. I've spent a lot of time stuck in helpless victimhood due to the confusion and challenges that come with mental illness; however, I'm learning that I don't have to be defined by this. It's kind of become like flossing. Daily maintenance and trusting that Im makingthe best choices for myself.  In truth though, retrieving my authentic identity will still be my life's work.

Kaizerina [info] There are a lot of online resources. As for stars? I think Daryl Hannah has it. I'm not really "into" celebrity culture though so I don't know who else. There's an Aussie psych called Tony Attwood who specialises in female Asperger's symptoms, and he has a bunch of books floating around that you will want to take a look at. There's this: http://help4aspergers.com/pb/wp_a58d4f6a/wp_a58d4f6a.htmlJust google "female aspergers symptoms" and you'll find loads. For me, the physical symptoms that were salient were the ultra-sensitive hearing/ears, vision/eyesight, and touch, and the dyspraxia. Also, I can learn languages at the drop of a hat, and my co-morbid is ADHD. My hyperactivity mimicked  mania so I was diagnosed with bipolar first, but by a doctor who was not a specialist, didn't know what she was talking about, and it was at the same time Britney Spears shaved hear head so BPD was the trendy diagnosis.

airveil [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder w/ psychotic features, OCD, ptsd and an eating disorder. Without medication and weekly therapy, I get too sick to function. There was a period of my life where I thought it was okay to stop my medications on my own without telling anyone and within six months, I lost my ability to tell reality from paranoid thinking and had to be hospitalized again. Before insurance, I spent seven years believing.....strange and delusional things and lost a great deal of my life to those illnesses. If I lose my insurance, then yeah, I'd definitely have to pay out of pocket but wouldn't be able to afford it. I don't want to go back to being that person. I don't know if I could survive it again. It's been over a year and I'm still having issues recovering from my last breakdown. Even talking about it rn is starting to cause some problems, so I'm not going to go into much more detail.It's easy for people to say "Just keep your spirits up/With enough effort and will power, I'm sure you'll be fine/I'm sure it's not as bad as you think it is/etc". I may not have a physical illness, but I'll be damned if anyone tries to tell me I don't need these medications to live. If I lose this, I have no idea what the future has in store for me or my loved ones and I'm scared shitless to find out. [info] None [info] 1484518946

EmilyKaldwins [info] Sorry, I'm not quite sure what TTC means?My main priority was to ease my symptoms and thus hoping to have the cause and effect of helping the weight come off easier because everything's connected. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder but through research and understanding more, there is a very, very VERY good chance that my bipolar symptoms are actually caused by my PCOS (mainly the highs and lows and the extreme mood swings).I tried doing my own Inositol first but was too anxious/frustrated about trying to get the dose right on my own. I hated taking metformin and how it made me feel and that's how I ended up looking for alternatives.I guess Right off the bat my cycle started to regulate. Before I'd be skipping periods (honestly no complaints there) or go on for a full seven-eight days. On Ovasitol, my period would be about three-four days with spotting through a couple days after. I also had issues with thick uterine lining and this went away too. In order to make my ovasitol last (because it's pricey) I was only doing 1 packet a day and had those effects.In addition, I noticed my mood swings weren't as bad. They would center primarily in the week before my period, not through the entire month like they used to. I had more good days than bad.Blood sugar wise, well, I wasn't monitoring my diet very closely but I noticed that my spikes and drops weren't as bad either.I do have some obnoxious facial hair on either side of my chin that I try to pluck and didn't notice too much of a difference HOWEVER I was not specifically targeting that issue. Inositol supplements are not a All Over Curative. This focused mainly on my ovarian health.Once I ran out of supplement (and honestly like I was still really bad at taking it. I would forget some days) My period became a nightmare. In November it started normally and it was heavy, there was a ton of clotting, and it lasted for 20 days. The same thing happened in December.Inositol didn't make me sick, give me diarrhea, headaches, make me sleepy, make my stomach hurt like metformin. I tried metformin. I tried so hard and slowly tried to build myself up to it but I could never do anything with the side effects I experianced and I really wanted to get off pills.In addition to Ovasitol 2x, I'm taking 500mg of magnesium, 6000IUs of D-3, a women's multi-vitamin, fish oil, B-complex and now I'm starting Saw Palmetto which targets will target the excessive 5-alpha reductase. What that does is it's converting my overproduction of testosterone into DHT. Don't want that. So this should hopefully target the hirsutism and basically hair issues. Making sure you're getting your B-vitmains should help balance the fact that Biotin is in everything for women. I also plan on starting collagen peptides in Feb.I hope this helps???

Didie_Gnagnides [info] Blaze Silver,I am not in your place right now but I have been. I was the weird kid for most of my teens, I actually wanted to have been born male for a long period of my life, and the biggest reason I felt this way was because my mother was anorexic\bulimic and in rejecting the female curves that naturally landed on her by constantly dieting or binging she also unconsciously made me think that being female-shaped was BAD. I realized much later that my mother had actually never been fat like she believed, she just compared herself to the white anglo model standard of beauty which nowadays approximates a lanky teen boy with fake breasts, while she was and is a true hourglass-shaped woman in our best italic tradition. She never could love what she was given but I don't want to make her same mistake. And even if your beauty might be totally different from hers or mine...wear it because it's yours. And aside from beauty...there's just so much more in this world than what people think of it. I am lucky enough to live in a pretty wild place, I love taking walks in the woods, and I love growing my own vegetables. Having contact with nature and animals can be life-saving.Also...while I have made comments insulting autistic males in the past...I believe that sometimes autistic people have traits that make them better than neurotypicals. They are usually the ones to point out that the emperor has no clothes. Many of them are curious and very honest. I was involved in STEM before switching majors (I've tried basically everything in life lol) and to tell the truth personally I found myself way better socially with the more autistic-leaning (or sometimes just aspergers) STEM crowd than the typical people you find in humanities (though generally the humanities have gone to shit haha). I am not neurotypical myself as I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a nervous breakdown; funnily most people would never suspect that because I am very level-headed (they think being bipolar means having crazy mood swings or even having multiple personalities...). I have to take lithium salts, which have made me hypothiroidal and more easily fatigued, but I still live on; every time my doctor diminishes my doses it's a victory to me, I hear halleluia choirs lol. Even so, it would have been very hard for me to live without them, so I trust my doctor and wait for the day I won't have to take them or just a minimal dose. Find a good psychotherapist to talk with, there's stigma against using mental health services but your health is more important in the end.Good luck to you, if you have reached out to us though it means you still have the will to live - EDIT: sorry I thought you had autism at first not ADHD. Have you tried following a specific diet to calm down your symptoms? Apparently it works on some people (though I can't say...). I don't believe we 'mutants' have to be fixed chemically anyways unless it really gets in the way of your life. I prefer softer approaches when possible.

tawmolsh [info] In my case, mental illness and alcoholism are two separate conditions, but they are a great team to make your life a living hell.I was lucky enough to address my mental problems before my alcoholism showed up, and I did it without taking meds. Even if you don't want to take meds, **please go see a doctor to have your mental health assessed** because mental illness can wreck havok on you and your family. If you don't want to take meds, please make this decision knowing all the potential consequences.Back to me: I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder 18 years ago. I chose not to take meds, but I designed my life accordingly: I have to avoid situations triggering manic (or depressive) episodes, and have mental tools to keep things in check. This attitude helped me containing alcoholism for a long time, because avoiding triggers was part of my everyday life.That said, bipolar disorder and alcoholism is a deathly team, and sometimes I can't cope with it.

Bright_Eyes10 [info] This is the most relevant one I've seen. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I experienced extreme bouts of psychosis, especially when intoxicated. And I don't mean I'd experience weird things when I'd be crossfaded to hell. I mean I'd have a few drinks and instantly become paranoid and start having very very real auditory hallucinations and delusions that people were coming to get me. Oftentimes I would hear sirens approaching, or many people running towards me but there would never be anyone there. My friends and I used to hike on very low-traffic trails that we knew very well. However, a few times I'd have ideas that we were on a secret government base and we were investigating heavy conspiracies. Like aliens and such. What really fucked it up though was when I was at a small get together with my friends and had a complete breakdown. It was terrifying, disorienting and humiliating. The ambulance DID get called so suddenly the psychosis was even more terrifying because everything I had been afraid of and trying to convince myself wasn't true was Actually happening. I didn't hurt anyone, or myself, but after people I'd been friends with for years thought I was crazy as hell. Mental illness sucks man [info] None [info] 1485275341

Winter-bells [info] Not that I know very much about it but there are certainly different paradigms that you can see your symptoms through. My friend has acute psychotic depressive episodes and prefers to see their experiences through a more shamanistic lens. Schizophrenia isn't at all shameful. My mother has schizoaffective disorder and I am diagnosed with bipolar 2, though I have hallucinations and delusions as well. I used to cry and feel a lot of shame, but now I just see it as the same as any 'disorder'. Some of my friends have fibromyalgia, some have diabetes, and I have bipolar.   That my brain sometimes glitches isn't at all shameful, it's just what happens sometimes. You're special for sure. You have a rich inner world, and the subjective experiences you had as a child are just as colourful as they ever were. Just because you now have the label of 'schizophrenia' doesn't invalidate your experiences a jot. Stigma is terrible -- but do you have one person who can understand? Who will listen?Your medicine is important to take, but can always be adjusted. Your colourful world isn't gone forever, you're just getting your dosages right to be able to function as best you can.

I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 late 2015 and I've been trying to recover ever since.Personally I wouldn't write off going to the government psychologist. A couple of months ago I was going to clinical psychology regularly at RIPAS after my manic episode till she basically said that I was okay. It helped me a bit with coming down from mania. I saw her roughly once a month for about ten months. It didn't feel like it was enough initially, but after a while as I got progressively better i didn't feel like I needed to see her that much.  Personally I take medication to control my bipolar and for me it has helped immensely in controlling my moods, I wouldn't be able to live my life fully without it. I see a psychiatrist at RIPAS on regular basis for my bipolar which helps me a lot.  [info] None [info] 1485952829
terriyakipterodactyl [info] I enrolled and dropped out more than 5 or 6 times and I am 24 years old. I am very sad about it. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder just before I graduated high school. I barely graduated high school because I missed weeks of school just sobbing in bed. I went from having tons of friends to zero and just eating at the end of the hallway on the ground alone. I just couldn't connect anymore and it was miserable. I was a near straight A student, too. I even received a scholarship to study abroad in Japan in grade 10 for a whole year. I was friendly, active, happy and hard working. Then I fucking became this. :(  [info] None [info] 1485982434

summersnow__21 [info] I'm sorry you were raped, it is a hard thing to go through. It's interesting to me that you were diagnosed roughly a year after. Same as me. And I'm so sorry you lost a child, that is an unimaginable loss. You have my sympathy.And this, the DSM 5! I really have wondered about the correlation between trauma &amp; BP diagnoses because I have read about it.. it's part of why I asked this question to be honest. I also read that a predisposition to it and going through trauma can kinda lead to it.. I believe that too. I had problems growing up, but in 2014 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and after a couple years of denial I realize I do have the disorder. I don't think I would be as crazy either.

ezekrialase [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar for about 4 years now, I had my first manic episode at 19(went psychotic, police were involved, got sent to the hospital the whole works) and spent around 2 years recovering from the fallout of that. At that time I had no idea what was going on until it was too late.  The second time was sometime in the winter of my 3rd year and it appeared so fast that by the time my mom noticed something was wrong I was completely out of it and went to the hospital again.  Those have been my only major episodes so far, so I don't have much experience.  I haven't been on medication for around a year or so, so there's nothing I could take if one happened suddenly.

hetaeran [info] This makes me so happy! I have the same feelings about this community. It's wonderful to hear from women who have had similar experiences, and to know you're not alone. I also felt so much confusion before I found this group. I was diagnosed with bipolar, even though I know it's not right. In this world where there can be so many unkind people, it's nice to find such an accepting group.I hope that you are able to find clarity and self understanding. I'm glad you found this group too!

breathe25 [info] Does your mother need to know that you're seeking help?? As in do you live with her, need her to drive you etc.My family does not know that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder - mostly because I don't have the best relationship with my mother. I have discussed this decision with my psychiatrist and counsellor separately and they both agree that it's best for now.I can keep my diagnosis a secret quite easily. I am 26, I haven't lived with my parents for over 8 years now and I'm financially independent so I don't rely on them for health insurance or anything. I realize this isn't the case for everyone especially if you are much younger or use your parents health insurance. In that case, my experience might not be helpful.Another thing to keep in mind, support from friends and family is extremely helpful. I have very minimal support. I moved right before being diagnosed, the many friends I had and the few I have told are out of reach and I am not able to see them. I have no support system in my new city and I can not reach out to family for help. Although this makes me sad I am also aware that even if they knew they wouldn't really support me, if anything my mother would make me feel worse.You should definitely see a doctor and if you have any access to counselling services, talk to a counsellor about this exact issue with your mother.You are important and you shouldn't have to forgo help because your mother might find it difficult. Perhaps you could suggest to her to see a counsellor as well. [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1486269024

Fuck politicians or public figures who think people like you are worthless (whatever "people like you" may mean). Fuck them all.EDIT: Some personal background. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, type 1, several years ago. I've attempted suicide more than once. Almost everyone with my diagnosis will attempt suicide at least once. Roughly 20% will succeed. Those statistics are what I live to spite. I live to spite my abusive ex. I survived domestic violence, I'm not going to die by my own hand.I live to spite my father, who thinks I'm a failure.I live to spite everyone who has ever insulted me or looked down on me.I live because fuck you.

edmdusty [info] This sounds like me. I was a binge drinker like this.  I was using booze as a coping mechanism to quash negative emotional states. Used a.a. to quit drinking. Some people say that addiction has to be actual physical dependency. Others say it's wanting to quit and can't. I think binge drinkers are not physically dependent but emotionally dependent. If it's causing trouble in your life then it's probably time to think about quitting. A couple years after I quit, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. Now that I'm managing that and using healthy coping skill I don't need a.a. to stay sober. It would be worth checking out a meeting with an open mind. Also go see a shrink. Getting sober and diagnosed hasanged my life from choas to something i can manage.  [info] None [info] 1486394083
georgemitch [info] "Do you like him?"Excellent question. I'm surprised that I've never asked myself this before. I can say with certainty: No I don't like him. You're absolutely right. I want to talk to a friend, not someone that pretends to be sympathetic, but actually cares about the money I pay him more than me.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and he's already giving me the pills I need. My other problems cannot be treated with meds, and I don't like him, so there's no need to talk to him at all. You're absolutely right. Excellent question you've posed. You've cleared all my doubts at once. Thank you. [info] None [info] 1486403901

EchoNone43 [info] I have worked on several large projects. More than most. I hold a PhD in English Literature and teach at a major university in Ohio. I get there is time slippage, other projects come up, and timeframes need to be adjusted. However, (like I said) I only started reading these books books because they were 'apparently finished' and merely needed to be revised/edited. Why am I considered in such low regard because I believed what he said at the beginning? But it's been 6 years with no foreseeable release date. I feel as though I was swindled. This is the typical response everyone gets when they voice their dismay. I'm very familiar with mental health issues, I've been diagnosed with bipolar since 2003. I have my ups and downs, but I've always done my job. I just question the fact that he can come out with multiple novellas, but can't finish the main course. Maybe he doesn't have the talent to finish the book properly. He does interact with his fans, but to no regard. I watched his Q&amp;A last week and he gave us nothing but how to pronounce words in the book.  [info] None [info] 1486670426
Kighla [info] This same thing happened with my boyfriend about a year and a half ago. Shit got rocky, I saw stuff on his phone that made me feel like shit, and he literally said the same thing... that we felt like roommates and not lovers. We argued too much. Etc etc. He ended up saying he needed to think about things and left for a while.I was so mad at him and in my mind blamed him and thought he was a total asshole. But then I really, really reflected on myself and realized that I had been a total bitch for a long time. I was always instigating arguments for no reason. If he talked about something I wasn't interested I wouldn't pretend to care even a little bit. I took him for granted all the time and assumed that no matter what he'd never leave me so I didn't try that hard. Every once in a while I'd try to do nice stuff but it wasn't a *real* effort. I went to therapy for myself, and after a few months I was diagnosed with bipolar and have been taking medications, and it has done wonders. It helps my own feelings about myself but it controls how I react to situations better. It doesn't fix everything, and I have to work so fucking hard to make sure I basically don't turn into a bitch. When I worked hard on me, he worked hard on him. We also went to therapy together which helped. It was not easy, but we made it and are really, really happy now. But that cannot happen unless you both are on board to totally work on yourselves separately *and* together. You can't force him to want to work on this.. maybe he's felt this way for too long. For now I'd say give him space and try to decide if you feel you need to work on yourself and what you can do for the relationship. But be prepared for the possibility he won't be as dedicated as you. Don't waste your time if this is the case. [info] None [info] 1486748543
Tastycrustacean [info] I have a couple of issues with my history that I feel might hurt my chances of getting a job with the forces. I have a history of drug use but have been totally clean for about a year. Used marijuana regularly for most of my teenage and young adult life and tried other drugs a few times. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 21 and was hospitalized on and off and on heavy medication for about 2 years. The diagnosis and prescribing was done by a doctor with a reputation for misdiagnosis and overprescribing and I got much worse on the medication. As soon as I stopped taking the meds, about 2 years ago I got my life back on track quickly and have not had any mental health issues since. I'm now 26 years old, happy, healthy, and drug-free.How hard do you think it will be for me to convince the doctor doing my medical that I've really changed and was misdiagnosed? My family and I are absolutely convinced that most of my problems were caused by the medication that I didn't need and I am certain that I do not or have never had bipolar disorder.

PsychoSheWolf [info] I've come here to ask help from outsiders perspective because the only help I receive is from family support which is good, but they have no real advice to offer. Very lucky and fortunate to have the wonderful encouragement and unconditional love from my husband which keeps me going through it all... It's the best thing I have to help me get through and hopefully past all of this someday. After this very severe manic episode I lost a lot of people in my life, and a lot of people actually gave up on me. Can't blame them though they don't understand that being manic turns you into a completely different person. Currently I'm starting therapy -DBT therapy which I hope to continue throughout the years. My husband is my biggest supporter, my biggest fan, and he is my rock. There have been two psychotic breaks in my life, both of which have left me hospitalized in a psych ward, and have landed me on meds. For nearly 10 years I had managed naturally with a strict regimen, but still ended up having a bad manic psychosis. Currently I was diagnosed with bipolar, borderline personality disorder, panic attack disorder and PTSD from a miscarriag I had it 19, but that's besides the point. Having Bi Polar is a costant struggle in your head everyday. The only way to describe it is having a wild wolf in a cage barking out at you to run free (having actually had a wolf dog I know first hand from experience how they need to run free) and keeping it caged up. When you start getting manic it's like putting a leash on it to run, and it's actually a lot of fun. Then they start pulling, and dragging you around. All of a sudden... there is no longer you and a wild wolf, you become an uncontrollable vicious werewolf who's tearing up the town, and you're no longer the person you once were. Once you are stable you can't believe the destruction and damage you've caused, and you hate yourself for it. The only place I feel I could function is in a freakshow honestly. On top of this I have Boderline personality disorder. Seemingly to people I am an awesome person. Upbeat and happy I am a joy to be around. People love working with me and I always make them laugh.When I lost my job people were really bummed. Not even trying I draw them in like a magnet, and then without warning I push them away. Once they are pushed away and confused I quickly beg for them to come back. I've literally messed up every relationship I have had. In my marriage I have caused what feels like irreversible damage although he forgives me. It's such inner turmoil. Can't find it in me to forgive myself although I try. Like I said currently I am working with a therapist to do DBT therapy (dialectical behavioral therapy) to try to reverse my borderline to have a functioning relationship within my family, and to co exist within society. Having Boderline is like having severe burns all over your body. Every little touch hurts you, and you're constantly Moody. At times you think the whole world is against you and sometimes you're right because you've messed up every relationship you've ever had. You struggle with homicidal and suicidal thoughts-mostly suicidal though because you feel there is no way out. Therapy to try and reverse can take years, and sometimes I'm selfish and don't want to do the work and feel my husband will be better off without me anyways. He is such a great man I feel he can do better, but I know with hard work and determination I know someday I can be that better for him and our daughter. Some days are better than others and I feel like I'm going to get better, and things will be peachy. Then there's other days like today where I just feel like I'd love to live on an island on my own, and people would just be better off without me. There was a time where suicide was a near success. Most borderlines do it for attention- a cry out for help. The times I've done it I don't even reach out for help because I feel if I succeed in it great, and if I don't I'll just look like a big wuss. The times I've tried and thought about it around my husband was because he just was around and I couldn't fight the urge. Is there anyone here who has overcome borderline with success and can help me out? How have you changed your self-sabotaging thoughts? Do you know some one with these mental problems and how has it affected you or how have you helped them overcome it? How have you when you thought negatively changed your mind? This is for the sake of my family, and my own sanity. The first step is reaching out. I try no matter how bad of a day I'm having to say I will not be a victim to it, and that I will someday say that I overcame it. Thanks in advance, and I hope you guys have an awesome day.

NoCreativeInput [info] Hey, I have bpd and borderline. I was diagnosed with bipolar, 6 years ago, when I was 22. Bipolar used to run my life. I was constantly on am emotional roller coaster, going from happy to depressed and constantly having suicidal ideation.Now the focus in my life is how to treat my bpd symptoms as I have really bad fears of abandonment and I have started cutting. I am also on lamictal, I used to be on saphris. My life has drastically changed since I have been on meds that were prescribed for my bipolar. However, I am still depressed, feel lonely and empty- apparently that part can't be fixed for me. I just want to let you know, you aren't alone. [info] None [info] 1487023141

throwawaybeginner [info] lol its okay its a legitimate question. It does all the same things for me but also makes me feel euphoric. I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder so (apparently according to the doctor) the high is much more intense for me (and the crash is also much more intense). It never started like this, but it got up to the point where I would abuse it by taking a month long prescription over 3 days straight not sleeping, not eating the entire period only to crash extremely hard. I would have multiple dealers and a prescription to it but it was never enough. I would go through like 600mg without thinking. I kept doing this like 2-3 times a month whenever I could get my hands on it. My final stint came when I did it for 8 days straight no food or no sleep. It was insane. That's when I came out to my parents and sought help. So there's a high that's associated with it that most people who are prescribed it stop feeling (because their tolerance goes up) and so they are just left with the focus boosting effects. That's what doctors want. They want the high to go away and for patients just to feel the focus. That's why ever since I got it prescribed two years ago I never took it as prescribed.

HiddenSecrets [info] What the fuck?!? I'm sorry! I am so sorry you have to endure a father that is so convinced he's a saint that has saved your life. It makes me sick. Now that's a narcissist. This book isn't really about you, it's about him. Him being  his wonderful father. Doing everything he can to help is sick daughter. It sounds like it's all about him. It's to make people tell him how strong and supportive he is having to watch his daughter being tormented by illnesses. This book is totally all about him and his delusions. I was diagnosed with bipolar. My episodes got so bad that my physiatrist checked me into a rehab clinic. He wanted me out of the situation I was in. He actually did it to see the interaction with my nfamily. My first day of being there my nmother asked him "when will she snap out of it?" My Dr was horrified. My family told all their friends I had been admitted because I was crazy. Their friends showered them in flowers, chocolates and attention. It made me sick to see how they used me to gain all this attention. I wasn't crazy, it was my environment that had the impact on my episodes. The more negative my Nfamily was towards me, the more depressed I got. On my doctor's advice I went no contact. It has been three years. For two years I haven't needed medication or frequent dr visits (again on his advice). I haven't had any episodes. Not one. I'm not depressed. He says that I am in remission and I have never in my whole life, been this happy. If it were me, I'd delete his book. I'm not saying it's the right thing to do. But with all the fucked up shit that N's do, I'd say it's fair! And go no contact because using you like that is bullshit. I wish you all the best!  [info] None [info] 1487370295

starflashfairy [info] I have been hospitalized three times. The first time I was fourteen. I was cutting myself because I was super depressed. They put me on Prozac, which was a terrible mistake...The second time I was trying to kill myself after a very traumatic event. I was on Topamax for headaches and I had just gotten a new refill. I was on an extremely high dose twice a day, so there were 60 pills in the bottle at 200 mg each. I swallowed the whole bottle and went to lie down and sleep myself to death. My dad found the bottle empty on the counter and came up and called an ambulance. I wound up in the ICU. They couldn't pump my stomach without killing me, so they put me on a saline drip and then took me to the psych ward. There I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. They started regulating my meds, though I went through a few very manic years.The third time, I was only considering suicide, but my new therapist at the time decided to 302 me for safety due to my history. I went to the hospital and was given a second diagnosis, borderline personality disorder, which when paired with bipolar disorder is extremely difficult to manage. They've finally got me slightly stabilized on the correct meds now though, because of this diagnosis.Each time I went, I stayed for a week, and each time the experiences were not fun, but overall it's helped in ways I never expected. But I want to avoid ever going back.   [info] None [info] 1487484013
AffableJoker [info] It's been so long since I played the med merry-go-round, it's hard to remember what did what.Before I was diagnosed with bipolar I was diagnosed with psychotic disorder NOS. So I basically had a psychotic episode seemingly on its own, but I'm pretty sure I was depressed at the time and was just withholding that information as it was viewed as a sign of weakness in my family (at the time).So my first round of medication was antipsychotics on their own.Zyprexa was first, but it caused a huge amount of weight gain. It did stop the psychosis, but I went from very underweight to overweight very fast. I was also tired all the time, pretty much spent the year sleeping.I stayed on that for a year or so, then ended up back in the hospital multiple times for mood symptoms and got rediagnosed as bipolar and was moved to a different psychiatrist.So then I was put on Depakote, didn't do much. No side effects but didn't really help.Lamictal, didn't helpTegretol, didn't helpSo then we decided to try other kinds of stuffLithium, did help but I was right at the cusp of the toxicity level so we kept trying.Abilify, helped but made me tired all the time.Risperdal, helped but a ton of weight gainSeroquel, helped but made me a little tired. Not as tired as the others though.Geodon, absolutely terrible side effects. I don't even want to think about it.Saphris, terrible.Gabapentin, absolutely nothing, no side effects or anything.Citalopram, made me manicLatuda, made me super tiredWellburtin, made me super manic.

raining_boatsnhoes [info] To much haha When I was 14 I was 5'9 and 140 lbs. I just got off suicide watch and put on antidepressants. My Dr told me I needed to lose weight and put me on a no carb diet. I went to a dr a couple years ago with stomach problems and he ran a lot of tests. Said nothing was wrong. And that he couldn't help me. I went to. Different Dr and she said it just sounds like a have a gluten allergen and to cut out some foods. Haven't had problems since. I'm diagnosed with bipolar and went to talk to my Dr about donating my eggs. She gave me a place to call and said good luck, they probably won't take them because of your illness.

kandlestiiick [info] Im constantly questioning my diagnosis. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about 3 1/2 years ago when I was 19. Before that, I had no idea what was wrong with me. I was abusive to my boyfriend (I still beat myself up for that). I would get into these bouts of rage and I was like a totally different person. It was like my brain was having a war within itself. I didn't want to be angry and I tried to calm down, but then it would get worse because I had to "go there" before I could calm down. Scary as fuck. Then I would go spend almost all of my money on clothes or food or anything. To this day, I've only managed to save $300. One time I tried to go off my meds because I felt fine and was convinced my therapist was overreacting. I was staying at my new boyfriend's house and I purposely planned to do it then so I wasn't alone in case I couldn't handle it. It was one of the worst depressive episodes I've ever had. That was a couple years ago, but I'm getting to that point again where I want to go off my meds. I'm sick of relying on medication to keep me stable. Fuck.  [info] None [info] 1487731919
Mushkita [info] Can she see her psychiatrist? She should be allowed leave of absence. I think everyone who suffers from bipolar should apply for it.I'm sorry that you are going through this. My mother is bipolar I and I was just diagnosed with bipolar II. There is unfortunately not a lot you can do besides the cliche, but it's worth reiterating. Be there for her. She may not care right now, but I promise she will. Make sure you keep up with your life, if you let it get to you she will only feel more guilty. I would suggest finding a therapist yourself, as dealing with a bipolar parent is not easy. If her company allows LOA--she could go to the mental institution and get it retroactively. That is the first avenue I'd look into. Bipolar is an unfortunate illness that most of society doesn't understand. If getting help and living means losing her job, so be it. Take care of yourself, that is what she would tell you if she was healthy enough to do so.Sending love to you. [info] None [info] 1487738855

He has a degree in psychology and knows more about it than I do, and still hasn't run for the hills. His patience and calmness are so, so important.You remind me of him a lot.

Elisebruni [info] You sound like you are dealing with real issues that are probably separate from ADHD. I don't think the average inferiority complex fully explains the feelings of worthlessness and self-hatred you are having. Please get some help, and don't listen to people who tell you to stop being dramatic/ suck it up/ get over it. I used to hate myself for having ADHD, but then I was diagnosed with bipolar and realized the feelings I was having were due to that (but I misattributed them to ADHD).When I was diagnosed bipolar, my father gave me some really good advice- "You have to play the cards you're dealt in life." It really doesn't matter what we were born with, because someone else always has it worse, and you can either obsess over your shortcomings or focus on living a good life. --&gt; I don't write that as a means of saying "suck it up," but because it was personally inspirational for me to hear.Good luck, and I hope you get to a better place.

destroying_maps [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar and complex PTSD, and I don't take meds for it. I do, however, go to therapy every week, and have to arrange my life carefully to allow for management of my symptoms. When I started T, we had to be careful about making sure my levels stayed stable as my body adjusted. This meant, in my case, breaking up my weekly dose of T into two shots per week. Did it suck sometimes having to stick myself every few days? Kinda. I also experimented with daily micro-doses, and that sucked too (and was thankfully unnecessary because it didn't differ much from the twice a week for me). But being on T has improved my ability to cope with symptoms and has removed an added level of stress that often triggered episodes, so being careful was worth it. [info] T - 10/'14. top - 07/'15.

It was like four years of my life became a blur. My handwriting started to deteriorate and I lost a lot of my ability to express my thoughts verbally.

Tsauce70 [info] Hey guys so I was diagnosed with bipolar II last week and given oxcarbazepine to start for treatment. It's an anti-seizure medication called Trileptal that is also prescribed for bipolar. My brief research so far shows it might have some interaction with exemestane, possibly reducing the effectiveness of one or both? I use aromasin as my AI so I'm just curious. Also any interactions with caber? My next blast will likely include NPP and therefore caber. I haven't started the Trileptal yet as I've been waiting to research it fully. I am also curious if Trileptal would have any interactions with recreational substances like MDMA, LSD, or ketamine? I intend on staying away from most everything like that for awhile anyways while I deal with this, but I am curious if I will eventually be able to indulge while still on this medication. Just asking here because I know there's a few of you with some extensive pharmacological knowledge. Thanks guys. [info] tren &amp; molly [info] 1489190753

alejandrofrankenheim [info] That's absolutely true. I was diagnosed with bipolar I a while ago, and still hide it from everyone except my close friends. Work has no idea. It's embarrassing to me, and I don't want anyone to judge me for it. I'm on meds, go to the doc regularly, all that stuff... and it really helps me function, something which I thought I could do before, but I wound up in a severe manic episode jumpstarted by drinking a shitload and very nearly fucked up my entire life. I'd always suspected there was something wrong with me, but that episode cemented it, and the doctor immediately recognized it for what it was.People judge others for their problems, sometimes on purpose or sometimes subconsciously. That's why it tends to be hidden. But, worse than that, are people who glamorize it. I've met people who think after I tell them that there's something about it that makes me a tortured genius. I'm not. I'm the guy who wakes up at two in the morning and decide to abandon my life and go live in the forest, driving for hours to get there, and then losing all interest. It's not fun, or glamorous. I talk about it on Reddit sometimes, particularly in messages, as it helps. But yeah... us nuts are hidden all over the place. [info] None [info] 1489364390

glitterybugs [info] Hey triforce! I know this reply is a couple days late, but hopefully you'll still see it. I just wanted to say I appreciate your comment thread on this post. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 8 years ago in a mental hospital, and I am stable now and have been for about five or so years, with only minor medicine/psychiatry tweaks needed since "stabilizing".    I really appreciate you saying some of the things you did further on in this chain. People love to casually say, "Oh I was freezing cold but now I'm hot, my body must be bipolar!" Or "I was sad and now I'm laughing, I'm bipolar." And at first, it was really hard for me to take jokes like that, because they're making light of a very real, crippling disorder that I will have to treat my entire life. I've gotten better at laughing it off, but it can still be really frustrating when people are flippant. Especially given the mental stigma around these disorders.   So thank you for not just scrolling past, but for saying something, despite the risk. A lot of people wouldn't do that. Even if it only impacted one person, it really meant so much to me. Thank you.    [info] None [info] 1489808136
ogre_cute [info] This is exactly what's happening to me right now! Lol. I was diagnosed with bipolar and then re diagnosed as BPD. I always knew something with that was fishy because I related to almost none of the symptoms, but I figured since a "professional" told me that I was, so it must be true!!! Thinking back on it I wonder how many "professionals" (therapists, psychiatrists, doctors, teachers etc.) have completely missed the mark with me entirely. I also can't help but hold a little bit of resentment towards them for not taking ADD into consideration when helping me, it could've saved a lot of confusion and self doubt on my end.

king-of-bunz [info] For me personally, it's two main reasons. The first is I used to be really fat when I was a little kid and I got bullied and got quite a lot of shit for it so I just tried to avoid everyone as much as I could (including my own family) but in junior  year my dad made me join the football team and at first it was alright, but I loved lifting weights and running so I dropped a whole bunch of weight  and got in pretty damn good shape but I still avoided people because I still don't really know how to deal with in a personal  manner because I really just don't like face to face interaction and try to avoid it when I can but I can manage in a professional way. The second reason is that I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder sometimes I have way to much energy and way to intense for people to handle and other times I can barely find the energy to get out of bed in the morning honestly, it's not as severee as it could be and most days I can always deal with the highs and lows by putting on a mask and taking medication helps quite a bit but it make it really hard to be close and intimate with someone your trying to be friends with or someone you want to date because your either watooto sad or way to hyper for anyone to want to deal with. I live a fairly active lifestyle for the most part I like to hike and exercise and mountain bike and all that I just like to do it myself. I do most (if not all) of my shopping online and I just try to stay away from everyone as much as I can. Honestly, I'm just more comfortable that way. I get invited to do things quite a bit by classmates acoworkers, butbut I just try to be as polite as I can and tell them no. And honestly I prefer talking to people on the internet because people on the internet don't know, you just went on a useless 500 dollar shoppin spree on pets, you don't have and climbed a mountain at 3 in the morning at -10 and people on the internet doesn't judge you for still not leaving your house or wearing pants for 48 hours haha [info] None [info] 1490402475

Bearosol [info] GET A SECOND OPINION. See another optometrist, because stray floaters are one thing, but your worsening condition sounds like something else. Get help! Regarding your brother, I'd tell him everything you just told us. If your siblings love you and looked up to you, they just want you to be happy, and it probably kills them to see you like this, knowing they can't help. I'm diagnosed with bipolar 1, and 10 years ago I did something a whole lot like this. I was so fucked up, I was unmedicated and had been hallucinating and there was a lot of extremely shitty things going on in my life at the time. I had lost all of my friends to my little sister and I just lost it. It took a long time for things to really get better between the two of us (exacerbated by the fact that it took me a long time to get properly medicated and get help). We're closer than ever now, and it still boggles my mind sometimes that the coolest, most decent human being I know loves me as much as she does, and holds me in as high regard as she does. A lot of that is because I ended up letting her in my head, letting her see how fucked up I was and how sorry I was. I was 17, she was only 15 or 16, there was no way either of us could've helped me with the resources we had back then, and that killed her. Understanding that and making peace with it took me years; don't let this rob you of as much time as I did, if you can help it. Get help. Open yourself up, to a new optometrist, a therapist, your brother. You're loved, and you're not alone. ❤️ [info] None [info] 1490684507
minkabun [info] I do not have Asperper's so I will not pretend to fully comprehend your struggles but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder ten years ago and the best advice I got regarding work was to fill out an ADA form (Americans with Disabilities Act). It can feel degrading at first but many employers—at least the good ones—are empathetic and willing to work with you to find a balance for managing work life. I had a manic episode within a month of starting a new job. My employer graciously told me to take off as much time as I needed to recuperate and ensured that my position would be there waiting for me when I was ready. If you go in being completely open with your employer, you may find that they are able to help accommodate your needs. Many are willing to work with you to find the best possible ways to be effective and help you determine your strengths and the best way to apply them.  [info] None [info] 1490793372

StereoClock [info] Thanks for the reply, Scurius.Yeah. I have already lost a lot of weight. My parents have been divorced since I was like 7. My mom had custody of me and my sister. I was diagnosed with bipolar like when I was 15. My dad offered me to go live with him for a while. He helped me A LOT. Like, materially and motivating me. He always thought I shouldn't think less of myself because of my disorder, that I could have a 99% normal life, as long as I did the right things. I was quite depressed at the time. I was weighting 105,700kg. The most heavy I have recorded. I went on to 92kg or so. I exercized every single day, ate salads before lunch and soup before diner. I was still in high school, and when I was living with my mom I skipped classes. When I was living with my dad, he drove me every day to the door of the school and waited until I got in. He woke me up in the mornings so I didn't miss my morning brisk walk. I lost weight. My grades went up (I normally am a good student, people call me smart, but I'm just good at paying attention when I want to). I got more in touch with my friends. I stayed with him about during a year. In my class photos in the year before and after the difference is astounding. I look much more healthy, energetic, and hopeful, close to my friends and stuff.I know life is hard, but in the end the work we put into it pays off a lot more than it seems like.Right now I'm having trouble getting enough sleep. I wake up 6h after going to bed, without an alarm clock. I've been "here" before, and I know I can find my way back into the good side of life.Thanks about the comment on football.

littlelivethings [info] I would get some protein bars or Lara bars if you're more in need of carbs than protein for energy and eat them around the time you normally have breakfast/lunch. You will be less likely to binge in the evening, will have more energy, and will eventually start to realize when your body needs food even if you don't feel hungry. I was on Wellbutrin for a while and would constantly forget to eat and not feel hungry, just faint/exhausted/nauseous.

I tried microgynon and then the progesterone only pill the summer before I was diagnosed with bipolar, though they both gave me a constant headache, twitchy right eye and worse mood swings.I really wanted to try spironolactone though the NHS won't prescribe it off label and claim it's too dangerous. They wouldn't give me metformin either because I'm in the 'normal' weight range.I'll definitely think about asking for Yasmin again. I'm glad they work for you!Update - googled and the NHS stopped doing Yasmine years ago:https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=3128301Supposedly due to blood clots.

coffeebuzzbuzzz [info] Autism hasn't been widely known or accepted(as in socially) until the past decade or so. More adults are being diagnosed as well, since parents regarded children who are higher on the spectrum as just awkward or difficult. I wasn't diagnosed until age 27. I was diagnosed with bipolar before that though. Growing up, my mom just thought I was smart and shy. I didn't have bad meltdowns until my teens. That was viewed as me being an overly dramatic teen. :/ [info] None [info] 1492306794

prettyboredd [info] When I hear all this talk about revealing your mental illness, I don't get it. I'm diagnosed with bipolar but I'm on meds and I've been stable for a long time so it's not my identity and I don't talk about it. Actually I don't even think about it much unless I have a doctors appointment. Maybe it depends on your level of functioning.... [info] 23/F/San Diego [info] 1492387136
Nidsan [info] It was an offer from a startup that I was working with remotely. But as startups go, they're not stable and perhaps it might not exist by the time I graduate. It's only an option. The director was talking between the figures of 12-15k since they got funding recently of 30m rm. Then again, you're right that it's just a dream, only ifs that the startup survives then the offer stands. As a consultant with a poly diploma then (4-5 years ago), I was making $2.5k a month.I have about 1 year of experience as a consultant(sometimes remote) which I did while in poly and *within* the 7-month break after poly, 1.5 years in engineering incl intern *( During poly, after poly and + the intern in uni)*. Then here and there toying around in the startup scene remotely during my NS(army) of 2 years till now in uni. I will then continue to work 3 years after I graduate. &gt;If I may ask, why do you want to work in Brunei tho? The benefits/experience in Singapore would be much better.It's the thought of a more calmer life that pulls me out of Singapore. Singapore is a hectic place. I've been diagnosed with bipolar amongst other stuff from the psychiatrist and needless to stay, I need to be somewhere calmer. The western countries are a no-go for now because of the current Muslim situation, not to mention expensive and tax-unfriendly. [info] SG'ean [info] 1492396569
HighnessOfCats [info] First off: I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and bpd, and I want to share some insights that I've come to learn about myself and the expectations I have of my partners. I also have a little bit of a different perspective on this than others might have because I'm studying psychology in university. This might not work perfectly with what you and your SO are going through, but hopefully, it'll give you some help. Medications/therapy is important. As much as you love your partner and want to help him, you cannot do anything unless he's helping himself. It's extremely important for him to realize the strain and stress that he puts on you if he is not even trying to help himself. The on and off again cycle of medication is a really big warning sign that he believes that after a while that he's "cured" or "fine" once he starts feeling better, which is not the case. Bipolar is a lifelong mental illness that requires medication the majority of the time, and the only exception is when discussing with a psychiatrist. Hypersexuality is a thing, but people can control it. This is a sad point to make known, but if he truly did not want to cheat on you, he would not have. If you are completely monogamous this should be a warning sign to you because even in a hypersexual state people are able to direct it towards someone or something. The manias can make it difficult to rationally think about doing so, but it's still possible. But this leads back to proper medication and therapy. For this particular case, it's therapy and how to work through bouts of irrationality and hypersexuality. Next, blaming it on his mental illness is never a good sign. Mental illness a reason for difficulty within one's life, but it, and never should be, considered *the* reason someone does or doesn't do something.  There are exceptions to this, but him using it as a manipulation tactic is wrong. If he cannot see that, you have a problemI understand that you want to be a supportive partner and, in all ways, it seems like you really have been but there is only so much you can do. My SO likes to say "There is only so much warmth you can provide a person before setting yourself on fire for them". From my perspective, you've done everything that you've can and it is now up to him to do the rest. If he is consistently resisting and doing the opposite, you might want to re-think your relationship. It's not fair to you.  [info] None [info] 1492446605

LucyLover78 [info] My advice to you is to try to take it slow so you can enjoy the ride. There's something special to have someone that makes you laugh or recognizes your swings. I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 while my boyfriend is like a mix between 2 and cyclothymia. We have a habit of slutting it up when we're manic so our relationship is kept open at all times. It's really nice to have someone who I love and know is a good person and he understands all of my different sides. Idk it's awesome! I was really hesitant when we first got together because you don't really hear about people suffering from the same thing living happily ever after... It's totally a thing 😊 just need to trust yourself.  [info] Manic-depressed-confused [info] 1492520564
CaptainSteelmeat69 [info] **Recently single people, read this:**About a year and a half ago my ex left me for someone else and I was diagnosed with bipolar II around the same time. These two events set off a chain reaction of addiction, abuse, brief homelessness, joblessness, and overall a shitty life situation. I was left legitimately wondering if I had any purpose in life or if I should just end it.It's been a rough 18-20 months, but my boss (at a job that I love) asked me today if I wanted to move to full-time during the summer, I went on a date with a wonderful girl and we're meeting up tomorrow, and I registered for classes in the fall.When you're recently single, it can feel like nobody wants you, or that you're not of value without your other. I can tell you that, after many months of undoing a lifetime of self-hatred and learning to know my own value, that is a load of bullshit. You are worth more than what you'll ever know to a whole magnitude of people. Life gets better, you just have to stick with the lows to appreciate the highs.This came out unusually sappy and new-age-y, but you get my point.

amareevita [info] Not sure if this is quite what you're looking for, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I've been with my SO for two years, and I was diagnosed a few months before I started dating him. It was really rough at the start. I was still figuring it out and he didn't know any triggers... but to be fair, neither did I. Now, it's easier. I'm on medication for it and I am *strict* about taking them daily. I go to cognitive behavioral therapy once a week. We live together, so I know it's harder for him in that way. I try very hard to not show him the very worst moments, like the panic attacks, for example. I have them daily, but we're away from each other for most of the day, and see each other at night at home. He knows I have them, but he's never had one (I'm happy for him about that), so he won't exactly understand. It would stress him out greatly to see me in panic attack mode. He has before, because I wake up from sleep with them (when I can sleep, that is). He'll wake up right along with me and stay up with me for hours, talk to me, rub my back, and help me breathe. He is incredibly patient and understanding for being 21 (sounds bad, but I hope you understand what I mean).I don't want to lose him because of this. At the same time, I know it's incredibly difficult to be in a relationship with me. I try my hardest to be fair, but sometimes, some days, it just wins out. It's like dating two people at once, depressed me and then manic me. I am as open as I can be with him, but I don't lean every aspect of this diagnosis on him. Some days are better than others. It's incredibly difficult sometimes, but I really think how you approach it, attitude wise, is what matters. If you take your meds, go to therapy, and communicate, hopefully you can find someone who loves you despite your mental stability. Someone who doesn't see it as the thing that defines you, but rather something that is just another part of you.  [info] None [info] 1492746057

XxBlackWolfxX22 [info] What I want to say is this, I was diagnosed with bipolar in about October, first weeks actually. I was taking medications and was starting to feel a difference from before of course I was not "myself" according to my family and was told to stop taking my medication. Now I have to add as well that my family are people who don't believe that this can actually happen.... Unless it affects or is happening to them. They generally disregard what I feel or say, but none the less they took me to get my medications. Now back on track the medication at first doesn't cure you right away it just helps you become balanced in emotions and become consistent. As of recently I stopped taking the medication and now I am back to square 1. It takes about 2 or 3 months for these effects to kick in and do something.Now in the present I am back to square one because I thought I was gonna be perfectly fine and because I let people with no doctorates​ tell me that it's a bunch of bs and that I do not need it. I stopped taking it and am back with my rampant mood swings i get where either I am depressed or infuriated and take it out on the woman I love. So if anything just seek help and see what's going on with you. I can tell you those with no experience in the matter can give an opinion but as I said it's an opinion, not an educated evaluation on the matter.  [info] None [info] 1492897595

kitty07s [info] &gt;  fat after being on antipsychotics for a few years.That is one of the mysteries to me, because that is what happened to me as well. I was gaining and losing weight normally ranging between 125-150 since high school due to hormonal changes, appetite changes, eating and activity then I was diagnosed with bipolar. I was 145 lb and due to manic espisode and incredible energy I worked out like crazy and lost again to 123-125 lb, then I was diagnosed and I was put on antispychotics. I gained 10 lb immediately in one week just in the hospital. Then I gained exponentially to 160 lb in 2 months! I was definitely not eating an extra 2000 cal over my TDEE which is the amount needed to gain this much in 2 months. I stopped gaining immediately after I could come off the antipsychotics but without meds it was hard to lose the extra weight. I gave up and over 5 years after I gained an additional 20 lb since I stopped caring anymore and gave up on weight loss. I am now able to lose since I am not on meds anymore. I am almost losing the extra 20 lb I gained post medication (so I am totally accountable for that) and hopefully I could lose 30 lb of the medication induced fat as well. People do have varying metabolisms but unless they have certain medical conditions, the variations is not that high. But being teenagers the growth hormones and other hormones can make you be thinner or heavier than normal because they are all wacked up and your body still changing. People's natural weight based on their diet and activity usually settles after teenage years.  For me I think my natural activity level and diet  set me around 135-145 lb in adult life. Other than that men and women who have thinner body structure are more prone to move and are more naturally active and less hungry, add the height and gender and you get even more burn, so they move around a lot more and burn a lot of calories and they don't realize it, so even if they eat crap food, they are are still not eating over their TDEEs so they don't gain. Sudden life changes that decreases those activity levels, messes up their hormones or their eating will make them gain more weight.  [info] 20lbs lost [info] 1492975624

I'm 19, going to a local state school, living at home, with a boyfriend who lives a little bit away, shy af, and irritatingly gaining weight from all the delicious food in the house. I'd just leave her be, she's finding herself and becoming more "adult" which is hard to do living with mom and sis away and away from her new "life" of college, boys, etc. Maybe do an occasional check to make sure she's not depressed or anything, I was just diagnosed with bipolar and these things tend to pop up around our age, but otherwise let her know that you're there for her if she needs you and cut the umbilical cord.

exulansis- [info] The payoff for an accurate diagnosis is greater than the cost of its impact on self-image. Self-image will adapt. The same cannot be easily said for the repeated scarring and open wounds from years of untreated bipolar.I was diagnosed with bipolar and OCD roughly 15 years after they first emerged. The bipolar is treated. An enterprising pdoc decided to go after the OCD with high-dose Zoloft. The OCD is only now being treated, more than 20 years after onset.

heimlichverliebt [info] I'm sure I'll be okay. I'm going to ask to be retested. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder because of those stupid written tests that psychiatrists give you. And like I said, once you've earned the label of being bipolar, nobody questions it. But I was also diagnosed with (at the same time):1. Borderline Personality Disorder (which upon further review seems VERY likely)2. Schizoid Personality Disorder (which seems very UNLIKE me)3. Chronic Depression4. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (which I had been diagnosed with before)5. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (which, once again, I had been diagnosed with before)6. General Anxiety Disorder (seems totally likely)7. Panic DisorderSo who knows what clusterfuck is going on with my mind. I don't think that anybody really knew what was wrong with me, so the treated the most severe diagnosis in hopes of fixing the problem.

jellybean_11 [info] I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was diagnosed with bipolar but I didn't actually find out about that diagnosis until eight years later because my doctor didn't think it was important if I was already receiving treatment for bipolar. I was kind of in the same boat by then, figuring that I had dealt with it in my own way and didn't want to stir things up by seeking help for said trauma. I was referred to a counselor (mostly for bipolar follow up things), who is wonderful and amazing in every way, and she kind of dragged it out of me a couple months ago.Is it worth it? Ehhh... in the long run, yes, absolutely. It will feel like shit for a while, I can basically guarantee that. But I think the thing to remember is that you don't have to deal with those feelings alone because, even if they're buried way deep down right now, you are dealing with them.So... my vote is yes, but you're ultimately the one who has to find the strength to speak up.Best of luck to you, seriously.

amphib5 [info] I feel the same way, the same thing happened to me this week with full on actual acceptance and clear vision of who I have been for the last two years. What I did was apologise to everyone I have hurt, tell them I've been diagnosed with bipolar (and BPD, but most don't know what it is so it's easier to leave it out) and that I'm really sorry for my behaviour. I've told them it was brought on by a mental illness, not that it excuses me, but I am truly sorry and trying to change. I also asked people who had cut me off why they had cut me off (at the time I assumed everyone was jealous, ironic) and they told me that I was behaving erratically and that I was actually the one who cut them off. It sucks, viewing it back in person but actually it's for the best. It's the only way you can grow and change. I committed myself to apologising and moving forward when before I would just edit the facts in line with my emotions and manipulate my own beliefs. The online community, don't worry about it. They are people on the internet, not people you need to encounter everyday. Everyone I apologised to forgave me, even my poor ex who I have put through the pits of hell this last year and made everyone think he is crazy. Try it, it'll help.

nina00i [info] I don't classify myself as sociopath because I still do have a lot of empathy and a desire to please others, which I stated in my post. My communication abilities are stunted/immature so I assumed this severity related to aspergers more so than autism. Am I wrong? The ADHD thing I didn't know about so that's a possibility.**Edit:** in regard to mind-blindness and language disorder - I do posses some of both in a limited manner. I thought that aspie women found ways to cope or adapt with these symptoms. I'm reading up on both now and it appears that 1) high functioning autists can use logic as a tool for moral reasoning and, 2) aspie children have less pronounced language issues, can show lack of empathy and still have the desire to fit in with other kids. Given I have been diagnosed with bipolar I'm not sure what symptoms overlap with aspergers. [info] None [info] 1494132523
Sarahkubar [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 15 (by a regular GP, who I later found out didn't have the experience or education to even diagnose or prescribe anything for those types of issues) and put on some heavy medication. I took myself off it as I couldn't function at school and it was damn near impossible to wake up of a morning. When I was around 16 and a half I did some googling in photography class one morning and stumbled across Borderline Personality Disorder. The symptoms were so identical with mine and resonated so much within me that I printed the info out and held onto it. Few months later I went and saw a psychiatrist for the first time for an official diagnosis. Low and behold, she diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder.

jrob1235789 [info] I think only 2 things should change in terms of requirements for future candidates. One is that they should be required to release their tax returns. The second one is that they should have to have a psychiatric or neuropsychological evaluation. And I'm saying that as someone who has a mental illness. Having a mental illness should not disqualify someone from being president, but being mentally unstable should. For example, from 2011-2012 I was mentally unstable before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and treated for it. Now I have been stable for over 4 years. I am a mental health professional, though not one who is legally allowed to diagnose people, but Donald Trump is clearly not mentally stable. That should disqualify you from being president.

colby-klaus [info] Three things:1. Voter fraud has never been widespread. It just hasn't. In the last decade, the total number of fraudulent votes that Voter ID laws would have stopped is in the hundreds. *Hundreds.* Out of, what, nearly a billion total votes? 99% of the votes people point at as fraud aren't things that Voter ID would stop, and aren't actually fraud. Someone who is registered in two places, because they forgot to void it after they moved? Not fraud, and it turns out people don't vote twice even when registered in two places. A felon who isn't legally allowed to vote, but does anyway? Incredibly rare, and those votes get caught. So, Voter ID proposals, as they are, have been a solution looking for a problem. 2. We both agree that access to the required ID is inconsistent and leaves some people without the reasonable ability to exercise their fundamental right to vote, correct? **Voter ID doesn't fix this.** IF a Voter ID law was introduced in my state and would introduce mechanisms to ensure that people like my grandpa could have the means to meet the requirements? I'd support it! But I haven't seen one yet. Know why? Because that would need tax dollars, and (in my state at least) the sheer mention of spending is akin to being told your favorite sports team is garbage. Literally, in Nebraska, our republican governor has rejected proposals to lower property taxes **for the very people who elected him** because the only solutions involve increasing or introducing a different tax that spreads the burden more fairly. Why? Well, he signed a pledge to not raise or create taxes. 3. Undermining democracy. Have you heard of CrossCheck? It's a program that was introduced in Kansas about a decade ago, and has spread into other states. It purges people from voter rolls if they have similar names. These people aren't notified, they may have no idea they've been purged until the day they go to vote. Is your name John Smith? There's probably 100 of you in Kansas. All of you just got purged, without knowing. Is your last name Gonzalez? Well, there's 15 other people with that last name, and even though your first or middle names may be different, it still seems suspicious. So, you're purged. Now, with Voter ID, you've been purged, you don't know you've been purged, and you show up to the voting booth to be told you're not registered and must present your birth certificate, your photo ID, and some other document. Do you have your birth certificate at home? I know I don't. The one time I needed it for anything, I had to wait a week to get a copy because I lived in a different state than where I was born. And I've moved so many times since then, I couldn't tell you where it ended up. So you just got purged, you can't provide every item needed to cast a ballot, and **if you're absolutely lucky** you might get to cast a provisional ballot that will never get counted. Does that not sound like it undermines democracy more than the possibility of 1 person in your entire state committing voter fraud? Because, remember, the only known cases so far of actual voter fraud **nationwide** in the presidential election totaled 5 out of 120,000,000 votes. Yes, there have been cases in the past where local elections have been rigged, but again, **Voter. ID. Wouldn't. Stop. That.** Ballot stuffing, intimidation, paying for votes, that's stuff that Voter ID will never fix, and has nothing to do with individual voters like the people in this article. The thing is, I can't point to anyone in my group of friends and acquaintances who is opposed to the idea of an ID for voting. What they're opposed to is the **implementation** presented by proponents of Voter ID laws. And the reasons I've listed are exactly why. But our concerns are dismissed if they're ever even heard. We're told we want to bus people from Mexico to make Trump lose California, that we want to drive people from poll to poll to poll to poll and fill out a dozen ballots, that we don't care about democracy and hate America. All we really want is for people to look at the long-standing facts and guarantee that any law they introduce will address these concerns. That's it! That's all we want! And thank you for your kind words. We have our struggles, because I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, ADHD, and PTSD, our farm doesn't make enough for me to afford insurance, meds, and therapy, and after four years of living with him he still has trouble understanding what any of it means.

-A-Unique-User-Name- [info] Speaking from personal experience only... the first medication I took was a SNRI and it triggered a manic episode. I had the same question about whether it was only a s/e of the medication but I was diagnosed with bipolar anyways. About a year later I experienced another manic episode while I wasn't taking any medication. Maybe you have to wait it out to be sure which it is?I think I remember reading somewhere that if it was just a s/e, the manic episode will end pretty quickly after discontinuing the drug, while if it was BP the manic episode may last longer.

Catfishers [info] Carrie Fisher. I was diagnosed with bipolar around the same time that she was getting a lot of press for Force Awakens, and her fearlessness in talking about bipolar and the way the media talked about it in reference to her gave me so much confidence. Seeing her being her hilarious and sassy self helped me come to terms with my diagnosis and accept that my life wasn't over. She was like the wacky absent aunt I never had.Her death was devastating.

driedtentacles [info] No problem! I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Whether what I was experiencing was depersonalization, I'm not 100% sure because I wasn't able to talk fully about it with my psychiatrist. Basically, I had a very stressful final year in college, and I coped with it by being apathetic and going with the flow. I kind of put on a mask to sort of 'hide' myself from what I was feeling, so to speak. Needless to say, turns out that's not really healthy. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I think that happened on and off for about a year. At the time, I didn't really know what it was, but I suspect now that it could've been depersonalization. And yeah, it kind of sucks.There is a bit of stigma, but that's fortunately lessening now.I took medication (anti-psychotic for my bipolar disorder) daily when I was going through therapy. But that really depends on your condition. The psychiatrist is going to be the one to decide whether you need it or not. Everybody's different.There's also a difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists can prescribe medicine, psychologists can't. But they can both provide therapy as far as I know.I guess my personal advice is to try to understand yourself and your feelings as much as possible, but avoid self-diagnosing yourself, I guess? Because, at least for me, that made me look into too much of the symptoms of other illnesses, you know? I was trying too hard to find an answer by myself. Then I realized that I didn't really know the subtleties in diagnosis, and figured that I'd rather just understand myself as much as possible and try not to put a strict label on it. It made it easier on me a bit, and put the actual diagnosing part to the professionals.But yeah, definitely go to a mental health professional whenever you can. It's really helpful. 😊 [info] a product of the philippines [info] 1495172017
nearlynoon [info] Hey brother,I'm going to give you two inputs: one religious and one more clinical.On the religious side, we all experience these moment of doubt, sometimes very severe like it sounds you are going through now. The Fathers called them 'aridities' after the desert they lived in. I have experienced them. Your brothers and sisters here on the sub have experienced them. Your pastor has had them. The Pope has had them. The important part is to stay strong, survive this temptation to fear and falling away, and you will be restored. St. John of the Cross wrote the famous book 'The Dark Night of the Soul' on this matter, although it's a little hard to read. I would recommend Thomas Moore's similarly-titled book 'Dark Nights of the Soul' as a easier-to-digest primer. Moore works as a therapist, and he has a gentle hand in his writings.On the more clinical side, I have experience with anxieties like this, severe ones that kept me from sleeping and left me feeling like I was about to pitch head-first into a deep void. I had these throughout the period when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and they made normal life extremely difficult. It sounds like your anxieties are reaching a sort of stage where they are impacting your life maybe, and if so, please see a doctor and ask for a referral to a therapist. There's no shame in it, and it may nip it in the bud before it has a chance to get worse. Remember, God will be by your side.My prayers are for your quick return to the fullness of your faith and lack of fear. God bless. [info] Roman Catholic [info] 1495235888
davidm89 [info] Wishful Drinking by Carrie Fisher. It was recommended to me after I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I loved it. I love her honesty and writing style.

Added bonus is that it's under 200 pages and can be read in a couple days.Now we need to get going on the Bipolar Pride Parade...except everything is always in the planning stages when you're manic.

HexTriplet_F400A1 [info] Have you talked to your pdoc about your sleep problems? I've been taking Trazodone for sleep about 6 months now and it's been going pretty well. I've done 4 other meds to help with sleep and this is by far the best experience.Also you mention kids... do you already have kids now? If not, maybe consider the option of deciding not to. Please don't misunderstand, I'm not trying to say, "you're bipolar, don't have kids!" Just to think about it, if you haven't really done so before, since this seems to be a big stressor for you. Most of my life the plan had been get married and have kids. Then I married the wrong person, fortunately didn't have kids with them, and got divorced. After the divorce I was in my early 30s and I suddenly thought "huh. What would/could my life look like without kids?" After a lot of contemplation, I decided perhaps kids weren't in my future. Two years later I was diagnosed with bipolar, and I'll admit that solidified the decision.I hate this disorder too. But I think we can all do our best to fight it when we make the decisions that are right for us, even if other people don't always like them. Hang in there and don't lose hope.

colby-klaus [info] Reminder that this man had previous convictions for robbery, kidnapping and illegal possession of a firearm. But this attack is being spun as a result of mental illness and a head injury. Hi, America. I fell off a moving truck in my teens and sustained a serious head injury that nearly killed me. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD. There are millions with histories similar to mine. It turns out, we don't go out and kill people because of it. White people, we need to deradicalize our own communities. That this man could be a known supremacist, out in public spewing his hate, for so long and nothing was done about him, is a major indicator we aren't doing enough to keep up the checks and balances in our own communities. That two men died standing up to him is an atrocity, because he could've been placed somewhere with proper care and rehabilitation long before this tragedy happened. And this isn't an isolated incident. Only a week ago, a black student visiting a college campus in Maryland was killed by another white male, one who was part of a Facebook group called Alt-Right: Nation. In Kansas, a white man shot three people in a bar, killing one, because two of those three people originated from foreign countries. Last year, just before the election, three white men were arrested in Kansas for plotting to set off car bombs next to an apartment complex where refugees lived, and even said they would slit the throats of any muslim children who survived. These are just the ones that come to mind right now, but I know there are more. Reveal has a weekly round up of hate crimes across America, because this keeps happening with nothing done to prevent the next one. And make no mistake that the Trump administration is enabling all of this. They've cut funding for the Countering Violent Extremism programs, which includes reducing the funding for organizations that seek to deradicalize Nazis, like Life After Hate. Trump has spent more time talking about his electoral map than he has speaking to his supporters about confronting racism, and has no intention to ever direct the Department of Justice to put an increased focus on these hateful acts. So we do not have any institutional support. That means it is on each and every one of us to confront racism within our own communities. Without a doubt, every white person reading this has at least one family member, family friend, or someone they know nearby who has engaged in hate speech and blatant bigotry. Every moment we stay silent, it makes people like that feel their communities support whatever hateful shit they believe. Speak up. Speak out. Resist. That's the only method we have right now to prevent the next tragedy.  [info] None [info] 1495921790

BornOn8thOfJuly [info] We're not nice. We're mean. &gt;:)I have very limited experience, so I am hoping someone else who knows more will post. I can only tell you my experience. I immigrated to the United States to do a Ph.D. I was diagnosed with bipolar II back home. I have the insurance plan that employees of the university has (as a ph.d student you are paid a living wage and teach, and it came with insurance). They did not ask for any pre-existing conditions when I enrolled. And so, I had a pre-existing condition and was not denied insurance. I can't say if that is the norm with employee health insurance plans. This was just my experience. Granted, this was also with Kaiser Permanente who are, from what I understand, probably one of the most compassionate insurance providers. [info] None [info] 1496065063

Another thing that really bothered me was that the last time my parents took me to a dentist, I was twelve years old. I went six years without seeing a dentist even though my parents could afford it. In addition to that, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at thirteen, and my parents only bothered with my medications for *a single year.* [info] None [info] 1496203152

It could be that he's just still acting like a toddler and hoping to get his way, but that seems the least likely at this age.I'm sorry your mom won't take you/it seriously. I hope he gets the help he needs. My parents denied my mental illness even when I begged to go to therapy at 14 (seriously, what 14 year old does that?) I was diagnosed with bipolar in my 20s when I finally got some help. That was a lot of years of pain because my parents refused to accept I needed help.

Dr_Beardsley [info] I used to be uber religious. As I got older I read the Bible more objectively, found some things that all but debunked it for me. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar 1, which would explain why I had thought in the past that God had chosen me to save the world/given me powers to feel other people's emotions. As it has been said here, I would claim agnosticism with atheist leanings as well. If God is ok with me having bipolar disorder and potentially believing He doesn't exist, then who's at fault? No way to know. Best as I can figure, someone did this passing through and just kept going. [info] None [info] 1496242426

haraya [info] Coming from a different country, but I get what you mean. I spent my high school days in competitions and trying to get high grades and stuff. Got into a top university with a full scholarship. Needless to say, the university is great but the pressure is high. In my sophomore year in uni, I was diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD. I used to be really type A. I would do 2 internships while studying, I never had summer break because of my double degree, I had grades to maintain because of the scholarship. But over the years, I learned how to be kind to myself. It wasn't an easy process.If you are not happy, then something's wrong. Where you will go, people will be better and smarter than you. Some will have more resources and will have none of the stress of student loans and having to balance work with school. If your value is in your work and being the best, when you lose that, where will you go?There should be a balance in things. Spend time with people whose company you enjoy but would also help you grow. Go for activities that you enjoy (but if you're being type A abt it, something that you can write on your resume as well).Most of all, don't be afraid to miss out.

yeslekkkk [info] My time in law school is more marked by my struggle with mental health. Law school is a very stressful experience, as you probably have never worked so hard in your life. I also did law review which is a shit load of work. Law school pushes people over the edge. For me, it brought out mental health aspects that I didn't even know existed. In a way, I'm thankful because it made my bipolar disorder come out and be so undeniable that I had to seek help. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder halfway through. Like many other people on this site, it led me to behave in ways that I'm not proud of. I ended up hurting people and feeling ostracized. I would wake up everyday and have to face what I had done to people while still continuing to do my work. It was incredibly hard.I like the material of law school, and I'm really glad that I'm going into law.

EchoInTheRoom [info] Actually, I am 32. I worked a good job for 5 years and saved 0 dollars. I should also note I suffer from bipolar disorder. Spending money is one of those things that gives me immediate gratification. If I made $1800 I spent $2000. I wound up burying myself in a couple thousand dollars worth of debt. I have been back working and have saved a couple thousand dollars. But I've been working very, very hard on cleaning up my debt. It is a big life lesson. Now I can swipe my card without fear of it being declined. Creditors have all stopped harassing me for money. Learning how to save money and be financially responsible is one of the harder things I have ever done. Lately when I want to spend money I do something productive like putting gas in my tank or go get a $2 coffee. Money has always been a mystery as well, I never learned how to save, then once I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder things went REALLY downhill. I wish I could say I was 18, but no, I am not. A buddy of mine told me a couple weeks ago to look into NYAB. I didn't, then he again recommended it to me. Now I look forward to getting my paycheck and budgeting everything. I check NYAB daily and if I plan on going out to buy something I check my spending money envelope.

LittleOne_ [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 20. I'm 24 now and busting my ass at a shitty dead end job because my medication is so fucking expensive that I absolutely cannot afford it without insurance. My job gives me that. It still sets me back hundreds of dollars a month to buy my fucking antipsychotics. I'm used to the apologetic and stunned looks from the pharmacist when I go to pay.I also had an awful experience at the psych ward at Jubilee. They insisted I was an alcoholic because I had drank some wine along with a bottle of pills and refused to discuss anything else. I also had to sleep in a chair in the corner of the main area because there wasnt any free beds. Whoohoo.  [info] None [info] 1497458752

HiddenSecrets [info] I am so sorry that you have to deal with an ignorant jerk for a mother. I can sympathize with you. I was diagnosed with bipolar. Thankfully I was fortunate enough to get the right help. My Doctor is amazing and supportive. It took a long time to find the right medication for me. I was hospitalized a few times. The first time I was in for six weeks. My Nmother asked my doctor "when is she going to snap out of it?"  My doctor was horrified. I never spoke the word "abuse", mainly because I didn't understand narcissism and what they were doing was abuse. But I would often tell my Doctor of the heartache my parents caused. I would ask him for his advice in regards to my reaction. I'd ask him if I truly was the ungrateful, horrible child they told me I always was. He noticed that every event would impact my mental state. On occasions my doctor's reaction was frustration with what I was dealing with and once told me "that's not how real parents treat their children". He encouraged low contact, not in so many words but told me to go a week without contacting them. Let them reach out to me. The very low contact, to eventually no contact. I received the most horrible text messages, phone calls and letters from them. But I stood my ground. My Nsister has never been diagnosed, but I strongly believe she also has bpd. She use to take over the counter herbal medication. When she stopped them my Nmother would stress her concern for her withdrawals. Meanwhile when I was changing medications to find the right one, my withdrawals were that of a drug addict and I was treated as such. I have been NC for four years. I haven't needed medication (doctor's advice) or frequent Doctor visits for over two years. My Doctor treated me for a narcissistic family without ever saying the word. It wasn't u too I came across RBN on Reddit that everything clicked into place. No one would criticize someone with cancer. But a mental illness is judged and ridiculed. I've never understood it and I never will. It's nothing to be ashamed about, it's difficult and hard work but with determination, a good Doctor and medication it can be managed. I wish you all the best.  [info] None [info] 1497480601
angrysadish [info] yep, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my doc suspected it based on me having short periods of hypersexual behavior or risky behavior such as speeding in my car - it's just a clinical term, and applies to men also.I didn't mean it in a shameful way - my friend was more sexual than average, and she was sexual at a much younger age than is typical for most people - nothing shamefull about that - some people are wired to have a high sex drive.  But it's also a known symptom of child sexual abuse and rape for example.  Her doc didn't shame her for her sexuality or try to 'treat' it, but she was treated for her PTSD from being molested as a child and sexualized at a young age.  She told me that she used drugs at a young age to escape from the flashbacks of her sexual abuse and to escape her feelings when her step dad talked ot her in  a sexual way.    She went to rehab for the drugs too. [info] None [info] 1497619423
weirdpancake [info] I used to be a night owl, before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  Mania made me not sleep. Depression made me not sleep. Crazy stuff. Now, I'm a morning person. I wake up at 5:45, go running for about 40 min with my dog, drink some coffee, eat some cereal, pet the dog for half an hour on the couch, then head off to work. Don't forget to throw a shower in there.In order to be a morning person, I have to have everything set and ready for myself in the morning. Running clothes and shoes set out. Headphones and music ready. Coffee on a timer to be ready when I get home from my run. I need all this so I don't 'overthink' my morning and become overwhelmed and give up on getting up and moving. "Don't think. Just move" is my morning motto. Also, I go to bed at like 10pm. On the weekends I kinda have to be a morning person. My meds are on a schedule, and I have to take them at about 7am every morning with food or else I'll start hallucinating if I'm late on taking them. Sometimes I go back to bed on the weekend afterward, but most of those mornings are spent pretending to sleep while petting the dog and being all snuggly in the blankets.Sorry for the huge paragraph. :P [info] http://www.wlsearch.com/u/weirdpancake [info] 1497650456
emnm47 [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 and panic disorder. My service dog is not an instant fix or miracle, but is as part of my treatment plan as my medicine and therapy are. One year ago, I moved across the country to a new place, far away from friends and family. Without my SD, I don't think I could have made it here, found and job, and handled the change. There are a lot of scary aspects to moving away, especially when you are dependent on doctors and medicine. My SD comes to all my appointments as they can really stress me out. I still haven't found a match for a therapist but I am in a good enough place that it's not super urgent. We ended up adopting another dog (as a pet, not another SD) and the dogs' support of each other really make us a happy family. I hope one day we can afford a little place with a backyard. But for now, we are doing well. I have been through a lot and it is good knowing I made it.  [info] Service Dog [info] 1497675285

megaweb [info] There is a lot of negative talk here about how you will never get over it. I was diagnosed with bipolar 12 years ago and have spent time in hospitals and had all sorts of medications. While the meds never cured it, I found meditation did. It took many years and a lot of suffering, but I now don't consider myself as having a mental illness and have found genuine peace. I see the meds as a vital support, but not a means to an end. I also never had therapy as none was offered and like you, I couldn't afford it. Good luck on your journey and remember it doesn't have to be a life sentence. Also I should add, all that pain and suffering eventually made me a more compassionate, loving and patient person, than I could ever have been without it. [info] None [info] 1497821187
yellowslashred [info] I can't say I've ever had to deal with anything even remotely close to this situation, in any of my relationships. I do know that that losing someone you love to circumstances beyond either of your control is awful though, and I'm sorry that this is something you have to go through.I will say this: I got out of a relationship that tore my heart apart in the end. I was pretty much dropped without a word, when I had put so much into being there for her. It was miserable. In addition to dealing the revelation that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I also had this failed relationship looming overhead. I emotionally shut down. I didn't talk to really anyone about it. I didn't... feel for a while. Things seemed kind of bleak.I spent no time trying to talk to or court other girls. I spent a lot of time with my friends, and had this sort of resentment about relationships, half due to the fact my heart was broken, half due to the fact at least half of my friends were in decent relationships. When I finally did give love a shot again, it was scary. The first girl I tried dating ended up catching on quick that I was becoming attached to her. We decided against dating because we were too good of friends, and she was a little emotionally unavailable. The next girl kind of pushed and pulled me away constantly, and I never knew where I stood with her. Eventually, it came to a head and I gave up on her.About three weeks later, I started seeing my current girlfriend, who I have been dating for four years now and plan on spending the rest of my life with.Love is confusing. Love is painful. Love is the most beautiful feeling in the world. Talk to this girl you love. Don't wait until the last minute to try and find closure or understanding. If things don't work out, it'll be okay. Things will be rough for a while, but you'll come out of it as a stronger and more knowledgeable person. Don't give up on love. Here's a [song for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEYWK5HQPf4). It might catch you in the feels, but it might help. [info] the devil and god are fidget spinning inside me [info] 1497860670
Effin_Throwaway [info] I go back and forth on whether I am on the spectrum. I had a therapist suggest I had asperger's, but I was never officially diagnosed. A lot of my autism symptoms are a lot of things I can connect back to a shitty upbringing, so it's hard for me to see it as a condition instead of just really poor social/life skills. At any rate, it's one of those things that I would NEVER be able to tell my nMom if I were officially diagnosed. The three houses surrounding ours all have a son that is on the spectrum (weird, right?) and she judges all of them and makes fun of them (obviously never in public). If I were to tell her I was on the spectrum, I would never hear the end of it. She already makes fun of me when I make a mistake, so it would become even worse. "Look at the retard that can't do [task]!"She already uses mental illnesses against us. My sister and I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and if we show ANY emotion that she doesn't like (positive or negative), she shit talks about the person and says things like, "It's because she's SO bipolar!"Haha sorry. I didn't mean to turn your post into a rant! I just identified with it :) [info] None [info] 1497975948
78456123123456 [info] I was in psychiatric care three times, twice for suicide attempts and once for a psychotic break down.My experience was really good all three times! I went to the same place. Everyone listened, the other patients were friendly, except one, who would scream and throw things and had to be sedated a few times and would constantly threaten to sue the hospital if they didn't do x.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychosis as well as insomnia, so I'm now medicated for both of those things and am in therapy.I still have my days/weeks, where I wonder if I belong back in psych care because I get bad, other days, I'm fine.

GroovyEFS [info] &gt; Bi polar, not BPD. Ah [you said BPD before](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/57y45z/do_you_even_know_the_red_pill_bpd_thing/d8wq49e) but I guess you just used the wrong acronym.I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 before but they then reversed that diagnosis. I'm pretty sure I've had hypomanic episodes in the past too hence getting it in the first place. They can't agree on what I have, every bloody doctor slaps a different label on me. But currently I'm functioning well and am relatively stable so fuck labels.I'm glad your meds keep your condition under control and you've learned to utilise the hypomania for productivity. For me when I had those episodes the delusions of grandeur stopped me from actually using the energy to do useful stuff. I just talked a lot and didn't sleep much.As for being a good or bad partner I obviously don't know you personally so I can't comment either way. I can only speak for myself, and I do think my (relatively minor in the grand scheme of things) issues get dragged into romantic relationships because it's something that affects who I am as a person and while I have better control now it's always there and always will be.But again that's just me, I'm in no place to speak for others.

glitterybugs [info] I was told this when I was diagnosed with bipolar 8 years ago, so I don't have a source, but bipolar can be seen as a genetic marker that is on the X chromosome. So if a woman who has it and a man who has it have a daughter, she will absolutely have it, because it's on the only X chromosome she received from the father. Which went a step further to say if a man has it and has a daughter, she will always have it because she will always receive the X chromosome from him. I have no data or source to back this up, it's just what I was told. I'd love to have some sources for it or even know if it's true.  [info] None [info] 1498088823

ByePolarCoordinates [info] You're so much stronger than you give yourself credit for. And you're not failing. You've picked yourself up in the face of crisis and adversity and while you don't like where you find yourself and as much as it pains you to see the timelines all shift - you are making progress. You've talked to administration and figured out roughly what needs to be done. Those are huge accomplishments. Huge. Look at yourself as if you were talking to a dear friend who has been through hell and back. You know what I'd see? Pride. Not shame. Keep using the strengths you have harnessed so far. Keep communicating with you program to move forward as efficiently as possible. Get the support you need. Is there a counseling center at your school? Mine had processing groups just for students in grad programs. It was hugely helpful. Talk to you Disability Office if you need to about making sure you get better hour scheduled at the teaching hospital if possible. They won't know why and it may go a long way towards helping your mental health. I was working on my PhD in biomedical engineering when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It was a shit show and my advisor was almost abusive towards me. I disclosed my illness to him myself after a bad episode and during the following crash. He was pissed because he didn't understand my behavior- the strange productivity cycles and lack thereof. I was eventually almost hospitalized for mixed episode and did a PHP program (the first of more to come). It took me nearly 7 years. I saw every I knew leave and I felt utterly powerless. It felt like the journey was tarnished, ruined. But that thinking does one no good. In fact - I did get well enough to eventually complete my PhD. Have things been perfect since? Of course not. Life is always a work in progress. I lost my job 6 months ago. Have been in the hospital 4 times. Things have been a little wild. And yet - I do still think it's possible to be (and has been) moving in a direction that brings us closer to the things we value. Figuring out what they are is a good place to start. Be kind to yourself. Journeys and progress are rarely linear. Expectations do little for us but lead to disappointment. Possibility is a different story. It means we are open to alternatives and are more adaptable in our thinking - which generally leads fewer instances of feeling stuck.  [info] Bipolar 1 - Rapid Cycling, PTSD [info] 1498226567
IcarianSkies [info] My daily emotional state was just empty sadness. I thought a lot about killing myself, I planned to off myself before 25, no point in living through adulthood. I self-harmed. I slept all day and found very little joy in anything. I was prone to fits of violent rage, and periods of random crying. But there were random periods of time where everything was sunshine and rainbows and I had to do all the things. Omg my room is dirty clean the room ahh somebody left dishes in the sink wash the dishes I don't like the furniture arrangement rearrange the living room. A million miles an hour. I'd sleep 3 hours a night versus my normal depressed 14 hours. And then I'd just crash and go right back to the empty sadness. It took me a while to realise it, but I did eventually come to the conclusion that this mania was nowhere near normal, and I'd grown up seeing it in my mother and recognised the symptoms. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder last year and I'm a completely different person now that I'm medicated. [info] None [info] 1498356323
But_Im_A_CheerLeader [info] When I was thirteen. My emotions were all over the place and people told me they were just teenage mood swings but I knew something was wrong, I knew the severity of them wasn't normal. I wound up self harming and entertaining incredibly dark thoughts. I tried desperately to get help but coming from an abusive home my parent was no help at all and I suffered alone. Then I started cycling. Up down up down uuuuuup dooooooown. But the first time I experienced a mixed state was it. I was wired and felt like I had electricity running through my veins yet this foreboding sense of doom was digging a deep pit inside my chest. I legitimately thought I was going insane, I felt like I was losing my mind.Wasn't until I was 19 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. [info] None [info] 1498366082

bluebeau7 [info] Might be worth at least seeing someone about. What you just described is my life, and I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Reformed0852 [info] Yes. I was in South-3-A, the locked down controlled psych block of our county jail. I was facing charges because the police officer charged me with battery on a police officer and resistance with violence when he tackled me even though I actually didn't do anything at all. I never committed a crime, and I was in my house when the officer arrived. I ended up beating the case on an insanity plea, and was transferred from jail to a psych ward. They released me to my mother and then I admitted myself to the in-patient mental health facility where I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 at the age of 17. It was there that I recovered, and to an extent I am still recovering to this day, but overall I am doing much better and live a happy life. [info] None [info] 1498693109

hablaga [info] Saved Post. I have been following your journey for the past 3 post doing no actions and just sitting around thinking "that could be me."Now I did a 3 day fast and things are looking up.I will keep it short with my personal story. I am 22 and  for the past 3 years I have been 280 pounds. Life has been a miserable up and down deja vu process. I would feel motivated after eating 5000+ calories every night saying tomorrow is the day. I would get count down apps, print out contracts and whole lot more just saying XX/XX/XXXX date is the DAY I CHANGE MY LIFE. 3 Years and nothing to show for it. Then I recently found fasting. It just all clicked to me and made sense at that point. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder and before that I was at a solid 210 - 220 pounds. Not too fat but a good size since I played water polo. I am going for a 7 day fast now and nothing is stopping me. After I hit the 7 I will either keep going or take another break and up it to 10 or 14. Progress not perfection is it for me. Thanks for being an inspiration. [info] None [info] 1499702688

Clarice_Ferguson [info] Bipolar is a major struggle- people just assume your depressive episodes are just sadness because they mistake (hypo)manic episode for being happy again.

Literally every human going through sanctification experiences this at some point or another.&gt; I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, specially the one with mania. This does not *sound* like a diagnosis from a licensed mental health doctor. A doctor would not assign a vagary like *"the one with mania"*, etc. This sounds like the blabbering of some random churchgoer that maybe read a book about mental health and then thinks he/she can diagnose everyone.  You are probably fine...&gt; in the morning I woke up and thought that there were microscope microphones recording my thoughts and transmuting them across the globe, especially to the Chinese, thus we would go to war with them.Ok, maybe that last statement of mine was brash.

Yes they are out to get us, but that doesn't mean the voices are trustworthy.  Also, you probably meant "transmitting", as "transmuting" would mean that the signals are getting converted to something other than signals, and that would be a huge waste of time for the Chinese Mindreading Department.&gt;This is how the church reacted: First they told me I need to prey, which I found very insulting...Don't be insulted.  Just don't be.  Jesus really, really loves His fanclub - calls it "His Beloved", but that doesn't mean that the entire fanclub knows how to love and guide and teach in all things.

One door, only One.  Don't question that, but instead question where this has led *you*.  God said "*I came that you might have life, and have it abundantly*", so hearing Him state "*go kill yourself*" sounds like one of the following may be happening:* Your neural net is broken - thoughts like *"yay Jesus is good"* jump multiple synapses in less than desirable ways, fail to self-correct, and lead to something like *"kill self"*, and each time this happens the new path gets reinforced further.* Someone is impersonating God.I am not qualified to state which is which in your case, but anyone telling you to ignore one or both of these is doing you a disservice.

72690 [info] Personally I've taken Prozac, Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan, Abilify, Seroquel, Risperdol, Lamictal, Trileptal, Thorazine, Trazodone, Gabapentin, and Celexa in my life, at different times/combinations, since 2001. I was diagnosed with bipolar II, OCD, panic disorder, and PTSD. Also borderline personality disorder. I am off of my medication now. I also exercise 3-5x week with cardio, I spend time in nature throughout the week, I supplement and take vitamins, and take 1 teaspoon of Kratom 1-2x a day (8:30 am and 5:30 pm)I find that I am able to go without Klonopin, although I will take a .5mg if I truly need it. This is down from taking it daily or every other day. My prescription medications never worked for me, ever. I would go on and off of them all the time, but everyone around me believed in the pills so much I felt like I owed it to them. Thorazine helped me a lot, but it made me exhausted and has some serious potential side effects. I feel great. I am still figuring out which days are going to be my off days, but overall this is the most relief I've ever had in my entire life. I'm 26 years old. [info] None [info] 1500477679

fictionorstranger [info] I used to be a lot more social, was married to a man who was very social and we live in his hometown.  I was diagnosed with bipolar and had a really tough few years, in and out of hospitals, then he divorced me. The divorce was amicable, but i lost a lot of 'friends.'  He died last year after a difficult 3 year illness.  There are a lot of people who are kind to me now when i see him, but they aren't really friends. The few people i was really close to in my old life have moved away.  My fiancee is my best friend, but also not too social..  I wish i connected with people, but feel too busy, and too different.  We are happy at home, but I worry about being a bad example to the kids.  [info] None [info] 1500727654

MelsWhitePubes [info] After my dad died, I got put on a high dose of antidepressants that fucked with my head majorly, for two reasons that I didn't understand for years later.  First, I find out through genetic testing that certain SSRIs are 7 times as effective on me than the average person...I was on the maximum recommended dose of Effexor.  Then, some time after that, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and was told that ANY dose of SSRI could cause my otherwise mild manic episodes to be much worse...I didn't know either of these things when I experienced the following...I had found my old livejournal page from the really 2000s, and reading it I saw lots of things I had no memory of.  This scared me and I did some research, and found that my antidepressants could cause memory loss.  One of the most disturbing lost memories was an auto collision I had in a Taco Bell drive through, because I described it in great detail...I was rear-ended, pushed into the brand new car in front of me, and all the cars had to pull into the parking lot and wait for the police to come work out what happened, spent almost two hours there making sure I would not be found at fault.  I had specific times recorded, and had 0 memory of any of it.  Over time, fragments of the memory came back to me - filling out a description of the accident under the yellow parking lot lights, being administered a breathalyzer, calling my insurance company and giving my phone to the cop because I didn't have my proof of insurance in the car... It was still fragmentary and like a dream, though.Years after that, after my mother died, an old ex girlfriend got in touch with me for the first time in years.  I asked her why she cut off all contact with me back in the day, and she asked "Did you break into my apartment?"  "Of course not, why did you think it was me?" "You had been texting me all day to give you back the laptop you gave me, so that night I took it to work with me, when I got home my apartment was broken into but nothing was taken, I assumed it was you because you were acting crazy after your dad died."  I told her it wasn't me and said she really should have asked me at the time.  Then, for no apparent reason, I asked if there was a footprint on the door, as that would show whether it was me (I have unusually large feet).  She didn't remember a footprint, and I was so obviously surprised and offended by the accusation that she apologized for thinking it was me.Afterwards, I kept thinking about that time, and the memory came back to me... Going to her apartment at night... Taking one of my mother's shoes and using it to put a muddy footprint on her door, then pushing it in with my shoulder... Looking for the laptop, then leaving without it.And, some time after that, I realized that the livejournal entry about the accident in the Taco Bell drive through was a fabrication to give me an alibi for where I was at the time I broke in, in case her neighbors reported something.  All the memories related to the accident were false, and created years after the fact when I completely forgot why I made up that story. [info] None [info] 1500915250

moosiemae [info] For a while I used to think that I was only as sick as I wanted to be - when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, the one thing my therapist kept coming back to was the fact that I seemed to blame it on myself. Whenever I felt a particular extreme on one end of the spectrum or the other, a little part of me would look back on that incident and kinda scold myself for "acting crazy". I genuinely believed that all of it was in some way rooted in how I wanted to behave.Thankfully, I have learned these past few years to get over the prejudice I had against my own illness. When I start acting manic, or when things are really bad on the depressive end of the spectrum and I can barely function, I know that's not me. It's my illness.  [info] None [info] 1501217191

scoffwoofer [info] "When I'm not on meds, I'm a mess. I bounce back and forth between forgetful and unfocused to hyperfocused and freaking out. On meds I have moments like that, but they pass."This is exactly what I've just realized. I was diagnosed with bipolar comorbid ADHD last year at 35 years old. On the days I don't take my ADHD meds, I'm in a dazed and confused bubble where nothing gets done; I have no explanation for how I got where I am today other than my brain switching to focus gear when under pressure. That's probably why those close to me tag me as someone who does everything last minute.I'm fortunate enough that I get extensive vacation time from my job which means I began dealing with the diagnosis during such a time. As my bipolar diagnosis came first and therefore those particular meds, I pretty much spent six weeks sitting on my sofa and staring at the TV; some days I didn't even switch the damn thing on. And walking 50 meters to my local convenience store was a daily triumph. The ADHD meds have - as you said - mellowed the symptoms. [info] None [info] 1501344007
throwaway_kabcd [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar by my shrink and prescripted olanzapine for that. Obviously it didn't work at all, just made me unresistably drowsy and dumb all the time. Stopped taking that fast since it made me want to kill myself even more.I've been on 15 mg of aripiprazole for a half a year or so, which was supposed to increase my motivation. Not a chance, just made me sleepy for the first 2 weeks and no effect at all since. I got 1200 mg of piracetam in addition, which didn't do anything either.Since I'm supposedly bipolar, I have no chance of getting any antidepressants I'm afraid. I'd really like to try tianeptine, not the usual SSRI stuff. I'm having a visit every 3 months or so, so there's some time before the big one to fix myself. Every time a drug doesn't work, my doctor just increases the dose to the max, so I wouldn't count on that.I stopped taking both aripiprazole and piracetam 2 weeks before drinking.

calypsocasino [info] And I’ll gloss over this part for sake of time (and would like to devote more time to it), but from roughly August 2014 to August 2016, I nosedived like a Japanese kamikaze pilot trying to honor his famiree.I’ll fill it in later, but I had gained 67 lbs, was addicted to clonazepam that was prescribed immediately after my sibling’s suicide to numb the existential terror that became my life, I couldn’t hold a part time minimum wage job, I used substances around the clock, I never exercised, I blamed everyone, I manipulated everyone, I victimized myself, I became suicidal, I moved home with my parents at age 26 (600 miles from a social life and my girlfriend), I was diagnosed with bipolar and clinical OCD (“severe;” one step below hospitalization), I had no prospect for the future, and I wrote myself off as “well, it was a good run.” Last week I was dumped by girlfriend of 4 years - and I can’t blame her. She was the candle that got me through the midnight hurricane that was my life for 3 years, all while sacrificing her last year of college - throwing away time despite being in her 20’s,  gorgeous, and an intelligent young woman. And for that, I am forever indebted. I stopped all substances when I moved home - not that I had a choice, my parents weren’t exactly going to let me rip a bong and vape all day if I couldn’t hold a job. They didn’t mind, however, if I had a couple beers on a friday night - as long as I was exercising and dieting all week, working hard at my therapy sessions (and nightly journals I had to write), and putting effort into taking care of myself and my image. And when I mean a couple beers, I mean 2, MAYBE 3. In college I knew when I could and couldn’t party, because the pre med grind was insane. Let’s visit that. Alcohol is terrible for me. In college, after two weeks of hitting the gym, the books, and everything else hard as fuck, I’d relax and go out for a night. And I’d go out HARD. My friends loved the nights I had off - “Is this is a Tommy night?! It is!” They were stuff of legend. And other stuff I can’t talk about because of statutes of limitations, but we’ll forget about that and look through rose colored welding masks. When I’d drink, the first feeling I would get is “everything is going to be ok,” not “Time to enjoy a weekend with my friends, life is beautiful.”  Which never raised a flag to me at the time - I had always got that feeling. And it wasn’t a feeling reassuring me that I was going to get into medical school - just that life in general would be okay. But even then, that wasn’t in a good way, like a drink on a plane just to calm someone down. It was buffering internal problems. And then holy fuck, the hangovers. Physically it wasn’t all that horrific - sure I’d have a headache and jet black diarrhea. My shits would be role play: me acting as BP, and my toilet the Gulf of Mexico. My asshole connected to the Gulf by a solid column of greasy black biohazard filth that had the consistency of refried beans mixed with motor oil, and killed any aquatic life in the sewage system, their demise brought on by an onslaught of organic diesel death, which I can only imagine visually mushroomed and swirled like death's cloak through the water, like watching printer ink dropped in an aquarium tank full of water so crystal clear that Water Boy would have an aneurysm.

aurortonks [info] Oh yeah, of course. I used to regularly smash dishes in the kitchen when I got mad, before I was diagnosed with bipolar. Now, I get urges to smash stuff which ends up me usually punching myself in the leg or slapping myself in the face (these instances are very rare nowadays). I've come close to smashing things like my pc, laptop, phone, kindle, etc as well but haven't done so yet. I try to back off the ledge when the urges hit because I really like my things and damaging them would be heartbreaking once the anger or frustration subside. To do this, I use thought-changing techniques my therapist taught me such as reframing my thoughts into positives, writing down why I'm upset, and holding ice cubes until they get too cold over and over again. I also talk with my spouse when I'm feeling that upset and he helps talk through the thoughts and feelings so that I can calm down gradually while still having my emotions and thoughts validated.

induslink [info] Thank you for your response, always appreciate when somebody replied in detail. You have given me a lot to work with, can you suggest a good read?To expand on my issue ...I've had various situations, really complex situations, which I have handled really well in past, on my own, but for some reason I have a negative bias programmed in me.  I'm more likely to believe the inner critic. If I make some progress it doesn't last,  so my personality keeps changing to extremes,  from easy going extrovert who can go as far manipulating complex situations in his favor to this ball of fear who is mortally afraid of people and confrontation.  Because of this drastic change in personalities in past I was diagnosed with bipolar,  but it is definitely cptsd.  With me it's a very delicate balance which works when everything is balanced,  but the inner critic is constantly trying to gain power,  if only somehow I could be more charitable towards myself.  Though it's very hard,  as I had an extremely strict upbringing,  complete with physical,  emotional and sexual abuse ... It's very hard to beat that inner programming to gain control in tough situations.  I swing from being the most resourceful dependable intuitive person to suicidal over literally nothing,  an imaginary threat.  [info] None [info] 1501789314
fairspectre [info] I tell people that the purpose for mental illness diagnosis is to create an action plan since diagnosing it is not at all scientific, yet. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder but I'm not a classic case. I'm prescribed medicine that is for the classic case and it works. Do I have bipolar disorder? Is it something else? Doesnt matter. The meds work. The diagnosis is otherwise irrelevant. Some people don't like me saying that because it might insinuate that people who carry a diagnosis (legit or not) and have no action plan in controlling it (whether it's meds, therapy, both, or freaking anything) only use it to absolve themselves of shitty behavior. And they're right because it's exactly what I'm insinuating.  [info] None [info] 1501892919

spacelord_rasputin [info] By definition a mental illness is a pattern of thought and/or behavior that negatively impacts ones life. If any pattern of thought or behavior does not negatively impact someones life, then they do not have a mental illness. Someone could literally have full-on hallucinations, but if it does not have a negative effect, they by definition are not mentally ill.      Do you accept the possibility of physical illness like diabetes? If so, why not the possibility of mental illness? The brain is an organ like any other, and can malfunction.      I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a psychiatrist and it perfectly explained my own thoughts and actions that were detrimental to my life.

floweriscool6969 [info] I've had almost an identical experience w/ hypomania in that I was diagnosed with bipolar after having taken zoloft and didn't sleep for 3 days and then felt like absolute hell but was on an anti depressant at the same time so couldn't actually even "feel it" it's terrible it was like the feeling of trying to punch through elastic. Anyway I've been off of pharmaceuticals for a while and have worked with specialists the last few years to treat my bipolar. Most times that I drink and party and it's fine but every like month and a half or two months I binge drink and essentially go off the rails. If i'm manic at all and get to a point of inebriation I just stop caring about any notion of consequence and meet a bunch of people, I pursue random sex, I'll take harder drugs if offered, I've driven, stolen random shit or withdrawn my bank account on purchases I don't need, called people out for something they did that hurt me so long ago it's no longer relevant, openly scream cried and yelled at people, any kind of typical "crazy" drinking behavior It doesn't feel like it is at the time because I've normalized my behavior. The other annoying aspect of this is that it gives me a reputation so people jump to the conclusion of alcoholism which is attached to a whole other set of stigmas and lack of understanding but people are going to be shitty to you if you can't keep your cool either way and at this point I'm so fucking tired of trying to appease them it just doesn't matter anymore. That being said, I do try very hard to stay away from alcohol as my manic behavior is hyperbolized after drinking which is ultimately pretty damaging. Hypomania is tricky too because usually the moment I realize I am in an up swing is after one of these nights that lead me to evaluate my behavior in the last few weeks before. Hypomania is fun though like ya you're a little wacky but usually in a way that's fun and charming and you get a lot done. You're super creative and feel on top of the world. My biggest advice is to stay away from drugs and alcohol, or at least be cautious and aware, and also if you think about having sex or making a purchase give it a considerable amount more thought than you would normally. Also as much sleep as you can get is a very good thing! Other than that ride the waaaaave hypomania is a fun ass time go explore new places and meet new people and kick ass doin you  [info] None [info] 1502216598
LocationBot [info] Title: Getting firearm rights reinstated after being committed to a psychiatric hospital with misdiagnoses of bipolar disorder(turned out to be brain tumor)(CA)Original Post: &gt; A year ago a family member thought I was acting strange and brought me to a mental hospital. IMO I wasn't acting violent or in any way that could hurt myself or others, but a court ruled that I was a danger to myself and had me committed. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was at the mental hospital for a month. I was then released on a probate order and was forced to take medication for bipolar disorder as well as other requirements for a year, otherwise I would be sent back to the hospital.  The year probate order ended a few months ago and I am no longer legally required to take medication or do any other things. About a month ago I randomly suffered from aphasia and went to the hospital. I was given an MRI and found out that I had a brain tumor(non cancerous) that had probably been there for around 2 years and as it grew over the past year the pressure caused the aphasia. I got surgery for it which was successful and I feel perfectly fine now and my psychiatrist and doctor have said my mental health is fine now. &gt; &gt; I owned some rifles before all of this happened, but they were taken away as I cannot legally own firearms after being committed to a psychiatric facility. Is there any way I can get my gun rights reinstated, seeing as I am not actually bipolar and have been treated for the tumor which caused my strange behavior in the first place?---LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot) [info] You have subscribed to cat facts [info] 1502556191

BuggyAnneGrl [info] Hey there! I hope you're doing okay today! I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder II so I know where you're coming from. To an extent. It's definitely not easy. I think a lot of us go through just wanting meds to work right this instant. Having to wait and go through everything with no relief is sucky. But see, even with meds working, they don't fix all. It's best to have a plan of sorts. Like a treatment plan they like to call it. I've been diagnosed with bipolar II and I've been reading through this book by Julie A. Fast titled "Take Charge of Bipolar Disorder". It's a 4-step treatment plan book that teaches you a lot about the ins and outs of the illness as well as ways of managing it. I highly recommend it.

egretregrets [info] Yes, that's how I was for years; just absolutely depressed, and then as years went by, hypomanic features started showing up as irritability and anger. They eventually became frequent, which is how I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. The more I think about how I was before diagnosed, the more I realize I may have been BP instead of unipolar depressed. This is why bipolar2 is so difficult to diagnose. Then there's mixed episodes, too, to further confuse diagnosis. In a nutshell, it's quite possible. Hypomania is much more subtle, too, than the mania of BP 1. [info] None [info] 1503177809

Like, I knew she thought I was stupid, but fuck, even my goddamn cat knows better than that shit. [info] None [info] 1503382324
cieluv [info] I was the fourth accident of a poor bipolar mother in Fort Worth, Texas in 1997. I was molested at 3 years old by a babysitter's boyfriend. My biological father bounced early, but I'm not sure exactly when. When I was 7, my mother hanged herself in a closet on Christmas Eve. I was then adopted by my biodad's well off parents, which was nice, but I was split up from my siblings. I was also homeschooled, since my new father builds hospitals for a living and we had to move to a new state every couple years. It was good to see the country. I've been all over the southern United States.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was about 13 or 14. I was medicated for a couple years, but it didn't work all that well. My psychologist was kind of an idiot. My mental health issues strained my relationship with my parents. They were, however, fine with me being a lesbian.At 16 I entered public high school and my first real social interactions made me realize I didn't want to be a girl. I told my parents, who were totally fine with it once again, but said they didn't have the money to help me transition. That was fair enough, but they didn't make any effort to look into insurance or loan options or anything. I'm a little salty about that. I was surrounded by supportive friends on all sides, though. I found the right group.I got my first girlfriend at 16 as well. This really only made me realize my mental problems effect everybody around me. I was controlling, quick to anger, and emotionally abusive. She saw right through it, thankfully, and got out of there ASAP. I quickly met another girl, the next school year, and dated her as well. We both ended up being abusive, but even looking back I can tell she was worse. I have scars on my arms from where she scratched me. She also choked me, held me down, slapped me, coerced me into sex I didn't want, etc. I was forced to live with her for a while, since I got kicked out by my parents, I would have been homeless otherwise. She taught me a valuable lesson about what I could become if I didn't get my mental issues under control.After high school, I moved a city over from what I consider my hometown, El Paso, Texas. I lived with my first ex and her best friend for a while in a small apartment. I slept on the couch, and couldn't get a job for months. I wasn't doing it right, obviously. Eventually, they both got tired of me and abandoned the apartment for other ventures. I was alone paying rent I couldn't afford. My biodad offered me a place to live in Arizona, so I packed up and left. The experience at that apartment gave me plenty of knowledge about leasing and renting.In Arizona, I realized my biodad is an absolute moron. He was addicted to meth for 16 years. I moved out of his place and into a hotel my adoptive father paid for. I did have a job at this point, but it wasn't great.I met someone online, a non-binary individual in California. We dated for about 3 months before I decided Arizona sucked and I wanted to live in California. So I made the worst mistake of my life and took my $1000 savings and moved to California. I lived illegally on my partner's campus until the summer. During this time, I was once again an abusive partner. I also still couldn't get a job. I wonder why. However, I took the first step in my medical transition and started hormones. It was easy and affordable, and I was so surprised and happy.Once summer came, I had to live in my car. I got a parking permit for the campus, so all was good, except I was finally officially homeless. My partner also broke up with me by completely cutting off contact with no warning. That stung a lot, but I brought it on myself. I finally started to get serious about getting help.I found a great job with tons of overtime hours and high pay, and started to look for roommates. Then I crashed my car and had to move into a hotel again. Luckily, I could pay for it myself this time.Currently, I'm still in the hotel. I have a future housemate, and we are looking at promising apartments and another roommate to lower rent even more. I'm enjoying Southern California for what it is. I'm enjoying life for what it is. Things are looking up again, and this time I'm determined and hopefully mature enough to keep them that way for as long as possible. I am 20 years old and I deserve a good life, finally. I deserve a good job and a good relationship. I realized I will have to fight myself and my own vices to make them happen, and I'm doing it. Medication and therapy will help, once I'm in a position to afford them. Until then, I'm using all the energy I have to stay stable. So far, it's working, and I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of myself for making it this far. I'm proud of myself for looking at my own actions critically instead of blaming everyone else. I'm proud of myself for being okay.I know it looks like a total shitshow, but I put something positive in every single paragraph. My life has probably been worse than most people, but at least it's been worth it. It has been interesting, if nothing else. [info] None [info] 1503396431
ask_a_rat [info] Hey friend, I just wanted to say. Get treatment for your bipolar disorder and stick with it. I'm 38 now and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 22. When I was 16, all I wanted was to die. I stuck it out and eventually found the right set of meds.  I now lead a mostly happy, pretty fulfilling life. There are ups and downs, but the years of therapy and medication have made it so that I can usually deal with anything my brain throws at me. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it.

2Turnt4MySwag [info] No, I was a straight A, dean's list student and did really well my freshman year of college. Sophomore year it started to go downhill, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, and was abusing drugs because nothing seemed to help. I had to get a medical withdrawal from an entire semester. I took off last spring to work and let my brain heal from the drugs (even ones I was prescribed, they screwed me up). I started using kratom as a replacement for stimulants and used lions mane and fish oil to help speed up the recovery process. I would say it worked well enough that over 6 months I finally feel somewhat normal again. The biggest improvement is my memory, which the difference is night and day. It was really bad.

joshman108 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar I but that diagnosis doesn't fit in the sense that my manic episodes are quite short, never more than minutes of extreme-ness (though a less extreme episode lasts much longer). Of course I wouldn't automatically discredit being bipolar for two reasons. The first of which is that it's nice to have an explanation for why you feel the way that you do. The second is that if you ARE bipolar then there is a real chance that having that understand would help mitigate some potentially dangerous choices you may otherwise make because you wouldn't be aware that anything unusual was happening in your body (which basically happens to every bipolar person until they gain a sense of awareness).

DieselHammer [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar before university. Was treated with sertraline and respiridrone. Was pretty heavy stuff.I was at university studying chemistry and got all the way to second year. My money ran out. The loan stretched 3/4 of my rent, and I had to work for food, clothes, books, etc. Was working Sat and Sun 10hours each day, and then doing pretty close to 9-5 lectures/labs etc four days a week. All my free time I tried to study but with the psychoactive retardants I was on I found myself tired all the time...It all got a bit much, my family, lovely as they are, weren't there and had to fund and raise my newborn neice. All my uni friends were getting distant because I had no time for them. I became very anxious in just about every situation. Thought my housemates spoke about me in the living room, and when I jumped the fence of the garden to leave without them seeing, turned out no one was in the house. Many other things happened and I got worse. I tried to kill myself twice. First one my ex found me and took me in, second one I just overdosed, passed out in the shower after puking, came to, and slept for a couple of days. Woke up to missed calls, messages, etc. The only person to come and see what was happening was a friend (now my girlfriend). I had to drop out.I work and study part time now, its a better balance and I seemingly do not require the chemicals either. [info] None [info] 1504390172
zemorah [info] I think part of the reason, unlike other illnesses, is because you can't "see" it most of the time. Also, people with mental illness might go long stretches of time without visible symptoms so maybe people think they were exaggerating before or aren't as ill as they claim to be. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago and my illness was quite obvious then. I've been off meds for awhile and function fairly well these days too. But there are still times I feel it creeping up on me. I think my long stretch of "normal" makes people think it isn't that serious. It's just as serious though but I've learned to recognize it and be proactive about it.I hope that makes sense.  [info] None [info] 1504415800

Loony4Life [info] Hey! I don't want to barge in on anyone's convo's but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder a year ago after doing something very extreme. I was given meds that made me sleep 12-14 hours a day. I would get up, so not happy about it, and functioning was so difficult. They switched my meds because of the horrible side effects. Now I'm more present mentally but with that comes frequent manic episodes. Before diagnosis, rules and laws did not matter to me whatsoever. Now I'm battling with myself like the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other shoulder and they are constantly arguing about reality and logic versus impulse and "fun" stuff.

twandar [info] I was diagnosed with ADHD years ago and blamed my impulsivity on that. I also drank heavily in my mid 20's and blamed a lot of my bad behavior on that. But even for a drunk my behaviors were extreme and when I sobered up I sought excitement more through risky sex. I didn't think anything of it in this day and age of Tinder. My behaviors just never seemed out of the ordinary to me because they were my norm. Just recently, I've been diagnosed with bipolar rapid cycling and it has been hard to believe at first. It's helped me a lot to track my moods, consult my journals, and ask others for their observations. By tracking my moods I can see that they change every few days and sometimes even within a day, just like a switch was flipped. My memory and perception is so fucked up that I honestly just think I'm always angry and depressed. But tracking my moods proves differently. Reading back through years and years of journals as an observer of my behavior was mind blowing. I didn't think I was ever happy, but there were lots of manic entries where I thought I was destined to be a super hero with my special powers. Or that I understood the world and everyone better than others. There were also these weird delusional relationships with men I was crushing on. I don't remember any of that because those moods have passed. Asking others their observations about my "craziest behaviors" got interesting results as well. My brother reports a seemingly normal brunch on mother's day. He thought I was totally out of control and ruining everything. I thought it was a normal outing. My drunk friend who still drinks like we did in college reports a few very disturbing nights in college. I was extreme even amongst our group of friends who all prided ourselves on drinking more than others. I think that's why I clung to them. My insane behavior was more often seen as amusing rather than disturbing to a room full of binge drinkers. I agree with others above that if 3 different doctors suggest it, it's most likely pretty obvious. I don't think there's anything to gain by denying the diagnosis. My life only got harder, not easier. I waited way too long to believe I really needed help, until I was at my breaking point and desperate. So, I think a diagnosis is powerful. Knowledge can help you better understand and manage the disorder. I've learned so much about myself in this last month. I regret not slowing down to figure this shit out 20 years ago. Live and learn I suppose. Good luck on your journey of discovery. [info] None [info] 1505441509

Doctor_Oceanblue [info] There's actually even more to this story. I have a friend I've known since high school who has bipolar. I did a bit of research on what bipolar people experience so I could understand him better. Well, whenever I went off to college, I noticed that I'd been behaving strangely. I thought to myself, "hmmm, this really feels like hypomania, I think I could potentially be bipolar." Sure enough, I was diagnosed with bipolar just a few weeks ago and have started taking new meds to help.  I think people underestimate how much you can help yourself by doing good research and being informed on the conditions that you have risk factors for. It might annoy your doctor, but it will save all the involved parties so much time if you're informed of why the problems you're having may be happening. Emphasis on GOOD research, though- don't base your convictions solely on blogs, New Age websites, or WebMD. I recommend reading medical textbooks at the library, using government websites like NIH, or using nonprofit sites like Mayo Clinic. Even if it turns out you *don't* have what you think you have (for a while, I thought I had Narcissistic Personality Disorder), it's good to know these things so you can better understand the people who have these illnesses if you encounter them.

trollfairy [info] Hey buddy, First I applaud the courage thus far we are all so unique and what your dealing with is nothing to be ashamed of. It is the way you were born. I honestly recommend owning it. God if you believe in him or if not let's say the universe has a way of presenting us each with situations we need to face that allow us to grow as human beings. Don't take that opportunity away from your parents. When I was diagnosed with bipolar I never wanted to tell anyone and I still hide it to some extent because our Indian community is judgemental. But that's selfish we should talk about such things openly because 1. We have no reason to be ashamed and 2. It gives others an opportunity to grow. Talk to them about it-- I think you'll be surprised with how supportive they are. It'll be awkward but it'll bring you closer together.Sincerely,A friend of Trollfairy [info] None [info] 1506288828

antisocialmedic [info] I had mental problems from pretty early. Started self harming in, like, first grade. Lots of anger issues, too. At 14 I got diagnosed with PTSD but I got that treated, so I thought it was all over, even though the self loathing and anger and self harm continued. Didn't realize until I got fired from a job at the age of 23 (for mental instability following the birth of my child) and had a mental breakdown and hospitalized (for the fifth time in my life) that I actually had something more going on than that. For me, PTSD was an easier diagnosis to stomach because it was the fault of some external source. And while it was awful, it was *their* fault and not something inherently flawed with me. Later I was diagnosed with bipolar and OCD and PTSD became BPD (and then went back to C-PTSD after a year of treatment) and suddenly it seemed that I was just a really flawed, fucked up person. Suddenly I had people telling me I should have aborted my babies because I was so fucked up and defective. Not sure where I'm going with this. I've been drinking so perhaps nowhere good. In any case, each diagnosis came from real doctors. So I'm not just picking them out of a hat. If I was picking my own mental status, I would go with perfectly healthy and sound of mind- which I really am these days, usually. But that's with a lot of work and medication. It's like if I went around telling everyone I have some kind of horrible chronic illness for funsies and cool points. Like "Hey, I have  chrons disease, isn't that *cool*!?"

LocationBot [info] Title: Mother does not realize that I am over 18 years of age. Continually threatens to pursue guardianship/conservatorship over me.Original Post: &gt; (TX, USA)&gt; &gt; Was diagnosed with developmental delay as a child. Parents never wanted to acknowledge said delay (which I've been getting help for), but mother never hesitated in making up symptoms to doctors and guidance counselors during my preteen and teen years. At age 16, I spent some time in a psychiatric hospital, and doctors disregarded my earlier diagnosis and treated me for bipolar disorder. My mother often used this diagnosis to get pity from coworkers and people at church. &gt; &gt; Senior year of undergrad, I got accepted to law school. Parents have always been unsupportive of my doing well academically. Mother only has a 6th grade education, believes in "marrying well," and father was in the military and openly brags about triple dipping into retirement, VA disability, and SSDI. Parents filed a lawsuit against me for a separate CPS matter (they tried to sue me for defamation/slander because of a report that was made). Lawsuit was dropped. Their counsel told my lawyer that this was a necessary step to show the courts that I'm "not stable nor able to attend law school." &gt; &gt; I chose to work instead of continuing my studies, although someday I'd like to go back to school. I know that my parents regularly look me up on the Internet, and they contacted 2 of my past employers to make false claims about my stability. When I was in college, they contacted the counseling center to demand my records and told the staff that I was planning to shoot up the school. The college counseling center advocated for me. &gt; &gt; I made a foolish decision around a month ago and got back in contact with my parents, hoping they had changed. My mother is really the more vocal one, and they haven't changed. She tries to slip in personal questions about "my plans" in conversations, while my dad threatens to claim me as a dependent next year for taxes for reasons I can't pinpoint. The last conversation we had, my mother threatened to hire an attorney again so that I could be "kept in a hospital" because I'm "not stable." The last time I visited my mother, I noticed that she had books on bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and schizophrenia on her night stand. I know that she is still reading those books and lying about my behaviors to people. She has also threatened to contact the police and report me as a missing and unstable person if I choose to ignore her phone calls and emails. &gt; &gt; While I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 16, I've had 2 psychiatrists treat me for depressive-related issues, and they both say that I do not have bipolar disorder. One psychiatrist actually wrote me a letter detailing that this was not a proper diagnosis, and that I was capable of handling my own affairs and was not a threat to myself and/or others. &gt; &gt; I've been told that the most I can do, being in my twenties, is to cut off contact completely at this point (since there's really no hope of truly reconciling), but I'm still worried, given how my mother speaks to me and how she still tells me that I'm not "smart enough," or "mentally competent" enough to do certain things, like hold a job or pursue an advanced degree. I've explained to attorneys that legally, I want a way to establish to them that I don't want to be contacted, and that I am not in need of any kind of conservatorship. My mother has often voiced that I am obligated to give her a portion of my check, and that a conservatorship would ensure that I meet my "obligation." I also am worried about my parents' outstanding debts and how I would be responsible for them if they were to pass away.&gt; &gt; It's an outrageous situation, but my mother is truly quite manipulative. Even my past employers she contacted in the past almost believed her, because after all, why would someone call about their adult child unless things were really bad? I just want to be left alone, and when I tried to pursue a name change, I learned that's pretty much fruitless as you have to provide notification of the name change, along with your former name. My parents would quickly find that out. &gt; &gt; Any feedback is very much appreciated.

mudgts [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and I can tell you the thing that helps me the most is running.  Exercise just releases endorphins that seem to help a lot.

pikupr [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and bpd! Definitely possible. It's very frustrating, though proper management helps. Sometimes splitting can look like hypomania, but I've learned to tell the difference. One of the big ones is that the bipolar symptoms are generally apropro of nothing (unlike most bpd symptoms which are triggered) , and self comfort does not calm me down (whereas it can be easier to deal with during bpd symptoms). Definitely talk to your pdoc about it!  [info] None [info] 1507166233
ssnakeggirl [info] I had a healthy weight (on the heavier side, but not "overweight") until I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on a bunch of sedating meds that *actually can lower your metabolism and fuck with your insulin response*. I gained 20lbs in 6 months due to one of these medications (it was Saphris, if you're curious) and when I realized I was tipping over into the "obese" category that was what it finally took to get me to do something about it. I honestly had no idea that so many people counted calories and I felt really discouraged when I didn't see results from "jus eating less" or "just eating healthier" without counting. Stumbling into the sub was so good for me, realizing that *this can be done* changed my life. So I started counting and now I've lost half the Saphris weight!! Honestly it's been way easier than I thought it would be. Plus I cook more and easy most of my meals at home so I'm even saving money. I'm also walking a lot more - not sure what my  "goal" is but I get about 1.5-2 hrs a day. My mom has a restrictive/binge/purge eating disorder and my dad is obese so I had 0 positive weight role models growing up. My mom still feels the need to obsessively comment on my weight /appearance and ask how many calories I'm eating. I'm an adult though, so I can deal with it - but it was so bad when I was a kid. I'm slowly working my way into having a positive relationship with food. I think counting helps too, since it shows me that no food is "bad" as long as you're eating a sustainable, healthy amount of it. [info] F, 5', SW: 153, CW: 137, GW: 125 [info] 1507224832

Krazygrunt249 [info] I'm 25 now, but since I was about 13 I knew something felt off but I was able to go about my life. Joined the military at 17, and about halfway through my brain just took a nosedive and I just started failing everywhere. My leaders pushed me to try to get help and I did a few times while in, but stigma got me and I didn't seek the help I needed while I was in. I got out after 6 years without too many hiccups, but December of 2016 I was at my lowest. My girlfriend at the time was always working. I was struggling at my job because of what was happening mentally and was just feeling beyond alone. A bit after new years, I was driving behind a car and it got t-boned hard. I carry a few first aid kits in my car for times like this because I have the training and you just never know. I grab a kit and run for the car that got t-boned. The car was flipped but from the outside it didn't look too bad. The driver was far from ok. Nothing I could do. The other driver is out and already calling 911. I get home eventually very shooken up and I ask my gf to come over and help. She doesn't reply. Next morning she comes over and long story short she leaves me. I lost it. After a few days of self destruction, I knew where I was headed if I didn't get help. I ask my employer for leave and immediately drive myself to the ER because i didn't trust myself alone. After 2 days of waiting I was in a inpatient facility, and was there for 2 weeks. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I finally told myself fuck the stigma and started being very open about my mental health and about therapy. People I've known for years sent me messages about how they have gotten help because of how easy i made it seem. And although some days are very hard to be open, I am so glad I got help. Sorry for the rant.  [info] None [info] 1507258224
Birch2011 [info] When I was 20, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. For over 20 years, I just said, "I am bipolar," and it was totally fine.

TheKindDictator [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  It is possible to be both awake and have bipolar disorder just as it is possible to be both awake and have arthritis.  It's just a bit more challenging with bipolar disorder because people with arthritis that have awakening experiences have less trouble distinguishing between the two.  I've had two manic episodes that were both peak experiences.  It was an odd mix of intense spiritual experiences with lasting positive effects and dangerous delusions.  Manic awakenings are similar to awakenings while on drugs.  The main difference is that with mania the person did not choose the time, they do not know the expected duration, and they may not realize their decision making is impaired.  Mania is therefore more likely to be dangerous and disruptive.So in addition to everything that is included with awakening you may have a medical problem that you should seek help for.  There is a stigma even in spiritual communities around mental illness.  Some believe seeking medical help is abandoning the spiritual path. But, if you do have a mental illness getting treatment can actually make your spiritual path much easier. [info] None [info] 1507592787

Rhynovirus [info] People with ADHD are very often misdiagnosed as Bipolar. Consider rejecting that diagnosis and get away from the lithium if it's making you a zombie.  Caveat: **dont stop cold, you must change psych meds in a controlled fashion under doctor supervision.** Why do you have two psychiatrists? You should be working with a therapist trained in CBT who has experience with trauma for your PTSD. I recommend you try to find a psychiatrist who also does psychotherapy or at least works closely with an experienced therapist. Ideally they should be in the same group.You should also strongly consider shutting down the promiscuous sex for a while, at least until the bipolar diagnosis is confirmed. There's something deeper going on with you and your altered brain chemistry is just a symptom of it. Drugs are not going to solve your problem, serious prolonged therapy might.You may benefit from a third opinion. Confirmation bias in psych diagnosis is huge. Consider asking to be evaluated for the right diagnoses as opposed to saying "I've been diagnosed with bipolar". Could go a long way. [info] Physician [info] 1507844993
Birch2011 [info] In some cases, there are other factors. I was a dancer in my youth. I played sports. I was pretty thin. Then, at age 20, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Lithium, anti-depressants, and anti-psychotics have caused me to gain a lot of weight. This was exacerbated by rheumatoid arthritis, which makes it difficult to exercise. I got up to 260 for a while.

eroticmarxist [info] I’ve been on both Prozac and Lexipro before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. For me, both drugs were fast acting: I’d say around 2-3 weeks before I noticed the therapeutic effects. I’ve noticed faster changes on Prozac (5 days). Both helped immensely with my OCD and related intrusive thoughts, and suicidal ideation. Ultimately lithium worked best (turns out I’m bipolar and SSRI’s are contraindicated). The worst side effects I experienced were the sexual ones. Both drugs killed my sex drive. That was a massive disappointment for me and my relationship. But bear in mind that everyone responds differently to these drugs: there is no definitive answer. The fact that I’m bipolar completely changed how I metabolise and respond to certain drugs. It varies person to person: it’s possible that you may not have any side effects.  [info] None [info] 1508260016

GuardianBell [info] Thankyou for sharing your story and clarifying points!I am not on the spectrum, but I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 as well as GAD and panic disorder and ADHD in my childhood. I was also addicted to codeine and other opiates for over one year. It came to a point where I couldn't feel good if I wasn't doing drugs or thinking about doing drugs. I didn't know I was bipolar, and my mother did not allow me to be admitted into intensive day therapy, even though I was legally an adult. So I pushed. I quit the drugs cold-turkey and withdrew. With proper medications, I managed my bipolar. I am drug sober since August 2015 and alcohol sober since January 2017. I pushed and kept on pushing until I felt something again. It took me three years to learn how to feel again. To genuinely feel happiness and curiosity.What I didn't realize before was that I didn't need to love myself to do things to benefit me. Other people have always taken control...of the way I dressed or of the things I ate or the company I kept. The act of self-care is foreign to us, because we're so used to having others berate us and tell us the 'right' way to do things that we don't develop our own interests or allow ourselves to make mistakes. Whether beaten by words or by fists, the things we experienced in childhood stuck with us. So we search for what we were deprived of: a sense of self, identity, purpose. Love.Keep pushing until you can't. Get a skateboard or another hobby you might like, learn things about topics that you enjoy just because you enjoy them. Lastly, in regards to people...questions can often be seen as accusations. An observational statement can be interpreted as a slight against them or their morals, and it is difficult to navigate those types of conversations without the ability to interpret social cues. When people become defensive, it can be impossible to get close to them. Then of course, there are those occasional narcissists who we all want to avoid!Keep on pushing yourself forward. Ask for help if you are able to. Learn and re-learn. Exhaust all options before catching the bus. [info] None [info] 1508478683

Cat-penis [info] Welcome to my nightmare. I got in a car wreck before just before I was planning to attend college, $50k in medical bills and that was after insurance. So taking out student loans was no longer an option and the wreck caused a head injury which fucked up my memory, so I probably would have flunked out of school anyway. This was in 2008 the beginning of the Great Recession so I couldn't afford insurance and couldn't find a job with benefits without a degree. A few years later I got into a fight, self defense (well technically I was stopping this dude from pouring a pot of boiling water on someone) and got thrown down a flight of stairs, another $5k which would have been over twenty but I was legally deemed a victim of domestic violence so got some help from victims services, however they were only willing to cover 15. that's right, I was for all intents and purposes assaulted and still left to saddle $5000 of my hospital bill. Another year passed and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and executive functioning deficiencies , probably due to the multiple head injuries. Eventually I was put into an inpatient treatment program for a year. That whole thing set me back another 20kI can't find a job due to my huge gap in employment and already spotty work history before that. I can't get on Medicaid for some reason and obviously can't afford insurance. My credit is abysmal and I have to pay for my meds out pocket. I contemplate suicide on a daily basis.

_AquaFractalyne_ [info] LSD has been studied in highly controlled clinical settings with professional psychiatric researchers. Doing LSD at your house is completely different (I'm speaking from experience). Psychedelics are not going to help you cure yourself, and it took me years to realize that self-medicating was only making things worse for me. 7 years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I never saw that coming!

gaylor_swift [info] Anything is potent to me, it's craziness. Hahaha. I'm such an oversensitive pansy (I'm kidding, I love myself, I swear), even at 6'1"!! It seems my body cannot tolerate many substances at all, even if they're meant to help me!! It's unfortunate for me. Anyway, I imagine my neurologist &amp; I will be back to the drawing board for this one. This isn't unsurprising to me, though. See... I've struggled with mental health in the past as I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder too &amp; I never responded to typical medical treatment for that either. My neurologist was excited to try Topamax for me because it's sometimes prescribed for bipolar as well, so she was like, "Wow, wouldn't it be great if it worked for you?? Knock out two issues with one medication." Clearly, I'm not lucky enough for that, though. Haha.Also, I know you might not do this, but if anyone hops in this thread to lecture me... I know, it's "bad" to go around unmedicated as a bipolar person, but it wasn't even fully my choice. This was a decision made by my doctors because of how harshly I've reacted to many classes of drugs used to treat it in most patients. I'm monitored by a team of doctors &amp; therapists, but they're not worried about me at the moment. I've honestly learned to cope with my highs &amp; lows with therapy. I wish that therapy was a super effective treatment for the type of migraines I'm having, but I don't think positive affirmations is going to stop me from stumbling &amp; nearly falling over because of vision loss from a sudden onset of a migraine. Haha. This sucks.Thanks again to everyone for their continued support, though!! I've been in touch with professionals &amp; I will be seeing my doctor this week, so I hope something good comes up. In the meantime, I've been obsessively Googling migraine treatments that have the least amount of side effects and/or side effects I might be able to actually live with. [info] None [info] 1509325000

invah [info] **I am a faithful person.**God isn't supposed to give you more than you can handle, but sometimes I feel like he may think too highly of me. I may be alive right now but I am definitely not handling it. It may seem childish but I always have these thought that life owes me something because of how much crap it has put me through. I am here to vent. **I was born to two drug addicted and alcoholic parents.**They were very good people but they just made stupid decisions. In my whole life I had never felt more loved then when I was with them... and my 3 others sisters and I were neglected and starved. I helped raise my younger sister until she was about 4. Why is it that I felt so loved and was so happy in such a dangerous situation? **My parents were barely there but I felt loved.**At about 6 years old my sisters and I were taken away from our parents and put into foster care. We were in the program guardian and kinship so we were still with family. My older sisters moved in with my mothers parents and my younger sister and I moved in with my fathers sister. My aunt and uncle.**I care so much for my aunt and uncle but growing up here was hell.**We had just moved into our new home when police found my dads body was found in a parking lot from an apparent overdose. People abandoned his body in a parking lot Why do I always become attached to the people that abuse me? My uncle sexually abused me at 6-8. One night it was next to my sister and his own daughter who were soundly asleep. My aunt knew and did nothing, and years later she would beat me for it. **I guess I am glad it was me instead of my sister.**He would leave me notes to come up to his room..and what disgusts me is that I liked the attention. He told me not to tell anyone, as did my aunt. They both beat me into silence and threatened to send me to a mental hospital or into foster care with strangers where I would have nothing, and never see my family again... So i would scream... the littlest things I would throw tantrums for hours and hours and would be beaten off an on. I have had makeup put on my face to cover bruises when I went to school. **My aunt took me to a therapist but told me not to say anything and I didn't.**I hid under a coat for 45 minute sessions for weeks. Then she sent me into in-patient at 7 years old. I was with a bunch of older people in their late teens and 20's. There was one girl named T. t who befriended me and made me key chains. My first true friend even though I barely talked. **Growing up through middle school and high school was just as rough.**Although the physical sexual abuse stopped, the lewd stares never stopped at home. I wasn't allowed to dress myself. I couldn't wear anything tight or any types of shorts without my uncle calling me a whore. I remember going out one night at 17 and came home at 4am. It was the only time I ever did that but as I came in my uncle came down in nothing but underwear and got real close to me almost touching. He told me I was a whore that slept around. He blocked any boys number on my phone that I got in 8th grade. He had given everyone else in my family a phone but me. **He thinks I am his possession.**I never told anybody anything. Through school I physically would shake around guys. I would stutter and freeze. **Of course I was bullied because I was so shy.**I remember a few guys who would take advantage of me being so shy and would touch me. I wasn't the only one they did this to. This life tore me down for years until I started cutting in high school. I didn't cut deep but just enough to feel pain. I became violent and would fight because they were still beating me. **Then sophomore year I tried to O.D but I regretted it the moment it happened.**I wanted to experience happiness.. I went to an out patient program and was in and out of school until I was sent to an alternative school. It was the best thing that could of happened to me. **I went to a therapist again after I turned 18 and finally opened up about what happened.**It felt good. I graduated with straight A's and two small scholarships after taking an extra year.. I ended up going to an equestrian school where unfortunately I only lasted a year. Depression set in again and I took a short break. As I was about to go back to school I was raped by a "friend" of 11 years. **I had never been with a guy because of before.**I have never dated and after that happened I freeze around men. I know it isn't all men but I just have never had a good experience with one. I went back to school but started having PTSD and had to drop out. **Now I am working, but I feel like I am going nowhere.**I am trying to go back to school in the spring but I am not sure how it will go. I hate money I hate it so much. I am so happy with all the knowledge I acquired when I was at this equestrian school. Horses are everything to me. Unfortunately since coming back I haven't been able to afford being around them. I hate money so much. **I want to get away from this house but I need to fake wanting to stay in this house so I can raise enough money to leave.**I gained weight from a medication I was put on in high school and my body has never been the same. My self esteem is at it's lowest and my motivation is basically gone..**I want to die but I really want to live.**Thinking of getting out of this situation and being happy.. I want it so bad. I want to be a mom in the future and make my own family. I want to pay off my debts and go back to school and learn as much as I can. I want to work with animals. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in high school. I stopped cutting almost two years ago but when I hit a low I almost relapse. I totally shut down. I don't want to die. **My own thoughts scare me**...when I am in that low I am scared I will do something impulsive. I definitely want to live but I also live with the constant thought of wanting to die. I think there are probably so many people like me. How many of those smiling people I pass by every day feel exactly like me. Here is to hoping all of us who feel this way can find that light at the end of the tunnel they all talk about.

h4baine [info] You're not alone. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 18 and have been through some scary periods where meds didn't seem to be the right fit and it felt like it would never get better. It always does though. Sometimes it takes time to find the right meds for you but it does get better. You know when you need help and you're getting it. That's a huge step many people don't take.You said you were going to urgent care and I hope you have a good experience but know that not all family doctors have the best grip on psychiatry. If one of them says something stupid, it's not because of you. I've heard some ignorant ass comments from general practitioners, don't let their ignorance derail you if that happens.It gets better but it's okay to have days when things aren't okay.

searchin6 [info] I'm 22. I recently graduated university with majors in English and Sociology. But I've had multiple breakdowns and after graduating I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Now I don't think I could handle or be a good fit for the careers I can get with this degree and post-undergraduate programs I was going to apply to (education and social work). I've realized I can't work full time or in a high stress type of job. Or an office job. I get suicidal. So now I'm stuck with a useless degree and no idea where to go from here. I've thought a lot about working in daycares. Early Childhood Educators are actually in demand in my city. I'd need to go back to school for a 1 year community college E.C.E. program to be qualified, but that's not too bad. But of course when I express this wish to my mom, she says "Why would you wanna do that? I wouldn't do that." Thanks, but you're not the one dealing with my brain. I need to choose something to do with my life that I think I could handle. I HATE knowing I have a degree but won't use it, but I need to move on with my life... I've heard that daycare work is stressful too, so I have no freaking clue what to do.  [info] None [info] 1509626094
autonomous_foxfire [info] I think it would make sense for him to be caught off guard by me responding positively to his compliment if it happened once or twice. However, it happened at least a few times we would see each other in person. This happened once or twice a week (we live about an hour and a half away from each other). Him and I had a lot of issues dealing with communication, and I don’t think I am out of line for shifting that blame to him. The relationships prior to the one with him, I did struggle to communicate my feelings and problems. I never wanted to step on any feet or create waves for the other person. Going into that relationship I laid everything out for him, I was an open book. If there was an issue I would bring it to his attention so we could work on it. If something was bothering me I would confide in him.  I opened up about my past, a history of abuse and mental illness. It started with my mental illness. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder four years ago. I had told him in great detail how that was for me. He would start by making passive aggressive comments here and there about my diagnosis. Then followed hours of cryptic texts. He would allude to something being wrong but refused to explain what had been bothering him. It became a stressful guessing game. He had told me that he knows I am going to cheat on him because he read somewhere that it was “impossible” for someone with bipolar to remain faithful. It was only a matter of time. It seemed fine when we together in person. At least it felt fine at first. When we would talk about more in depth subjects and beliefs he would question my understanding but phrase it in a “nice” way. Like it was “cute” that I thought I understood the topics. He would ask me loaded questions about my ideals, personal beliefs, and personal experiences. I could feel that I had to really think about how to answer these questions because if I remotely eluded to something that would upset him I knew he would use it against me. There is a long list of experiences with him that felt like he wanted us to be doomed. It was one dragged out conversation after another that kept planting thoughts in my head that he never wanted this to happen to begin with. One of the things that bothered me the most was when he asked me what traits are important to me. I told him I value loyalty, autonomy, honesty, and sincerity. He responded by telling me he thought I was vain and fickle. I hope this sort of explains why I feel his response seemed more calculated. It felt like each new day was a new chance for him to test me and see how far I could be pushed before I broke. It felt like the beginning of a very toxic, abusive relationship. I think if he had come into my life when I was younger, I would be in a worse situation right now.  [info] None [info] 1509638400
namesak [info] Most psychiatric diagnoses are based on self-reporting. How you answer the very subjective questions will effect how you get diagnosed.

fe_ursus [info] 27 female here too. Was tentatively diagnosed last December and put on cymbalta. My autoimmune tests and Lyme all came back normal/negative and MRI didn't show any damage to my joints. Cymbalta helped for a bit, but then I was diagnosed with bipolar after it put me in the hospital. Once I've been treated for the bipolar, a lot of the symptoms have lessened tremendously. I would recommend seeing a therapist, even if no mental illness is in your family. Fibromyalgia is so isolating bc it's so poorly understood and it takes a toll on you mentally as well. I'm so happy that you're getting relief with the new meds!! This group is fantastic and everyone is so accepting and understanding.Other things that have helped are yoga and low impact exercises. My husband got me an exercise bike and I've been able to regularly work out and my joint pain and back pain are getting better and I'm getting strength back. I also take CBD oil for pain and cramping (also have PCOS) and it's wonderful. There's no high, just relief.  [info] None [info] 1509804741
couragehelpme [info] Here's a weird question for you: do you have mental illness in your family?When I was in high school I was also accused of being on drugs, and it always hurt my feelings because I couldn't understand why people thought that about me.  Many years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and suddenly it all clicked.  The times that people thought I was on something, it was because my behavior was different--I was experiencing hypomania and not realizing it.  Other people also didnt know what was going on, but because my behavior was "off" I gave them an uncanny valley feeling, which led them to think "it must be drugs".I'm sorry you're dealing with this.  It's unfair of people to be treating you this way. [info] None [info] 1509835584

l33ser [info] I don’t feel like my anitpsychotics block my stimulant.  In fact vyvanse is a great combatant of the seroquel lethargy /hangover it tends to give me as a side effect. I take seroquel at night. It could be bc of  the way vyvanse is released into the body which I believe is through the digestive tract? Have you talked to your doctor about maybe trying a different stimulant? It doesn’t sound good that you have to stop taking your anti psychotics for your adhd meds to work. You might have to have some med adjustments. I couldn’t forgo my antipsychotics to be just on stimulants even for much needed studying: Before I was diagnosed with bipolar I was only on adderall and klonopin and that combo without a mood stabilizer (like seroquel) definitely was hard to deal with as it drove me straight into hypomania.

woobwoobzoob [info] I agree that an artist couldn't possible understand what it's like to have a serious mental illness, unless they've experienced it themselves.  I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I have other issues though, and possible cluster B personality traits.  I find that art, like music, and even fictional characters sometimes helps me understand myself.  I mean, obviously, it's all fiction, so it's not going to be a perfect representation of my problems, but for me it helps. I think a really good therapist can somehow fuse the human condition, including art, and the science, and present it to you in a way you understand. [info] None [info] 1510262590
aquatictherapy [info] I remember finally asking for help and joking with my therapist, “Just as long as I don’t have bipolar or schizophrenia.” Guess what? I was diagnosed with bipolar rapid cycling with manic episodes mimicking paranoid schizophrenia. Sucked big time because I always thought of those two like the “big” mental disorders. No way did I want to be “crazy” like those people.The thing holding her back might be her own prejudices and fear. She has a mom and aunts with this so she might be projecting their experiences into her own life. She might be afraid of getting the official diagnosis. She might assume that life as she knows it is over. In a way it is. I have a recognized disability. One that’s hidden. One that I listen to people use all the time as an adjective. Could you imagine hearing someone say, “OMG! I feel so diabetic today! I ate two pieces of cake!”? I’ve had more than one person say, “OMG! I’m so bipolar! I can’t decide what dress to wear!” It hurts because they’re using something I struggle with every stinking day to describe a problem so trivial that it’s embarrassing. As if not knowing what to wear is tantamount to a major mental illness.I’ll be honest; medication sucks balls. I’ve never found a medication that didn’t have shitty side effects. I’m tired and groggy every morning. At any point in the day I feel like taking a nap. I’m so freaking hungry all the time, especially at night while taking medication. But the alternative is feeling like I want to peel off my skin because my nerve endings are electrifying and I’m hearing and seeing shit that isn’t there. So I suck it up and take the damn medication knowing that so many people think I’m addicted to it. I’m not and would love to chuck the lot of them into the toilet and flush that shit goodbye. I’ve been through ten med changes in fifteen years. Ten. And finally have found the right dosage. But guess what? In a year or six months that “right dosage” could change and become not effective or the FDA might approve another medication my psychiatrist wants to try and were back at square one.And take the way we’re portrayed in the media. The bipolar ones are always on a psychotic break. They’re the homeless man down the street taking to himself. I’m a thirty something woman with a full time job, two beautiful daughters, and two degrees. But when people hear that they either think that I’m A) faking the mental illness because no way would someone like me be able to accomplish anything or B) take everything I do and turn it into a huge deal and praise the shit out of it because of all I’ve “overcome.” So yeah, she might be looking at all these things and thinking (rightly so) that it sucks. And she might not want to go through it all. But I truly believe everyone has that breaking point where they say, “I’m not feeling right and I am sick of it.” If her therapy didn’t work the first few times, she needs to switch therapists. If her medication doesn’t work the first few times, she needs to change it. Sucks but there you have it. As a husband all you can do is support her through it all as best you can.BUT, if she’s thinking about hurting herself or someone else, you MUST call emergency services immediately. Period. No questions asked. She’s your wife and you need to protect her even if it’s from herself.Tl;dr: bipolar sucks. She might be afraid or prejudice about it. If she’s a danger to herself or others, call 9-1-1 or whatever emergency services are in your area. [info] None [info] 1510470862
iamthe_girl [info] Good for you, for kicking the drugs! Street drugs (sans marijuana), when paired with bipolar just makes your symptoms worse. Self-medicating is EXTREMELY normal, however. All you want is to escape the madness inside your brain, I get that. The flip side to that, is to develop a routine like you have! I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago, and was recently diagnosed with schizoaffected disorder: bipolar type. For years, I self-medicated with meth, coke, acid, etc. Once I got on the right meds as a young adult, my drug habits changed. And now that I am older, I try to have routines too. If I don't stick to my routines, I feel "off" and depressed. I find myself feeling like a loser, and incapable of daily activities. In short, I absolutely think you are on the right track in having a routine. The routine keeps your mind healthy and functioning. Keep up the great work!  [info] None [info] 1510496472

bob_the_bandaid [info] Well, I have been diagnosed with bipolar, and I identify strongly with what you've described here. I have gotten to a point where I don't see the point in starting anything because I am going to lose interest and any motivation to continue will go away eventually. My therapist has a lot of experience working with individuals suffering with bipolar and says this is common: starting something, loving it for a time, getting bored, stopping abruptly.I also struggle to see what is me and what is my facade (best term?). People love me, great personality, everyone thinks I'm outgoing, but I am so insecure about literally everything it's absurd. I once had a friend come to me asking me how I was so emotionally strong and holding myself together. It was hard in tha moment to keep a straight face since I would spend every night in a depressed fit unable to find joy in anything.I don't have any answer lol, I don't even think there is more to this comment than "hey, you're not alone." Maybe that gives some comfort. I do know all we can do is move forward and continue growing by learning from each new experience. So there's that? [info] None [info] 1510552051

cultofvader [info] Crime is what made me want to learn more about the brain and how it works physically and socially, but I was diagnosed with bipolar I and II within the last year and it's been a terrible struggle to get the medical help that I need, so I started doing a bunch of research on my own time about it and it interests me to the point I think I could do it as a career. I would love to focus on research and development of the knowledge around mental health but I know that the process of doing that is very jaded and messed up, so I probably won't be able to do that, I've always wanted to help people and in doing that I've found things that make people happy (like theatre for some). Things have been a very long and hard journey for me as far as mental health goes and in my opinion mental health is more important than physical in a lot of cases and I want people to know that someone actually understands what they're going through and wants to help them. I'm caught in the middle of doing two things I love which I guess isn't the worst struggle to have but oh well.  [info] None [info] 1510857953

Smokesalottapottamus [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder many years ago, long before I awoke to what my nmom &amp; nbro are.  Several times over the years, my medication was working so well that I managed to convince myself that I was now (then) cured and I didn't need my meds any more.  I'd go off them for while until it became clear once again that I'm still mentally ill and require medication.  Maybe No Contact is like that.  The longer my family ignores the narcs, the stronger and better I feel, making me feel like I might even be able to handle a conversation with them.  But my experience with the bipolar meds lets me know that the only reason I feel so much better is that No Contact is working and I shouldn't ruin a good thing just because nmom conditioned me from birth to always love her and feel guilty for not loving her even more.  If No Contact is working for you, keep it up :) [info] None [info] 1510994090

bob_the_bandaid [info] Could be something, I share some of those experiences and I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 years ago. Your GP and/or a mental health professional you are referred to will ask about experiences over time to look for a recurring pattern. However there could be other relavent symptoms that you dont even think of that point to another diagnosis or none at all.  [info] None [info] 1511483805
twandar [info] Yes, in that sense this article made a lot of sense to me. Still they didn't really differentiate why a struggle with regulating your sexual behavior is different than the reward seeking of addiction. Wouldn't you say that drug addicts have a problem regulating their consumption? Perhaps their point is that unlike drug or alcohol addiction where the solution is complete avoidance, the hypersexual person's sex drive or urges may not be a problem in and of themselves so avoidance is not the soluton but rather sorting out the underlying psychological issue. Makes sense to me but just kind of seems like it's merely semantics to avoid the social stigma. I found the discussion around the sexhavior cycle more interesting. That the issues may arise more from either a rapid cycling though these stages or getting stuck in a loop of just the first two stages (urge and behavior). I relate a lot to the latter and it helps explain my frustration even when I am having sufficient quantities of sex. I just never feel satisfied; I'm right back to the urge.  Impulsivity and lack of control definitely. Yet, that feels like the same issues I had with partying too. I could never get enough. I was always seeking some grand adventure, some crazy high that rarely came. So, to me hypersexuality feels similar to my issues with substance abuse. Perhaps I was never a true addict. But then again this article states that this change in designation in DSM would not include hypersexuality due to other conditions; thus since I've been diagnosed with bipolar none of this really relates to me which seems a little off too. Perhaps we should stop diagnosing issues based on symptoms alone and look at the underlying cause. I suppose a shift like this article proposes is a good first step to that though. Thanks for sharing. [info] None [info] 1511494220
blackdog6621 [info] Yup. It's been 6 months since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I spent the first 3 months trying to get back on Adderall, had to switch psychiatrists and I'm still begging them (unsuccessfully) to give me more than one dose per day.

twandar [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar I and ADHD. I have been on Adderall for years and have just started lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer. My pdoc did not want me coming off Adderall first. Maybe after mood stabilizes we'll see. I think what the docs use to differentiate between ADHD and bipolar symptoms is age of onset. I never had the attention to listen to a story read aloud. I was always super active, I wouldn't say hyperactive. Still I wonder because I do know a few people who are truly and severely ADHD, like my friend who seriously could not sit in a seat in school and was always hurting himself because he was so impulsive. I could sit still, I did well in school. So, I have my doubts still but Adderall has helped me. So, I am trusting my pdoc right now and will wait to see how things change over time. Good luck!

Birch2011 [info] I’ve gotten a lot of shit from fellow redditors when I say that it’s not always as easy as calories in, calories out. I was a dancer and athlete, and then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 20 and RA at 30. I’ve been on psych meds for 26 years. I gained 130lbs, lost 110, gained 50, and now lost 25. Meds change, they have different side effects. My shrink told me that certain ones have been found to increase carb cravings. Others mess with your metabolism or appetite. When my RA is bad, I can’t exercise. I’m really tired of people who have no experience with this telling me I’m just lazy and have no self control. Please take my diseases and meds.

McCandace [info] What was the extent of your psychosis? Are you sure it was the weed? I had a psychotic episode (mania) literally on 4/20. Horrible coincidence, but all the docs said it was NOT caused by the weed-one even said it might have HELPED it! I had had a depressive episode in the past as well, so I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1(long story short). This is just my experience, but also a caution to you because the brain is a strange thing. I take meds, but if I DON’T, psychosis (mania), *could* happen again. If you have something going on, it’s not a big deal, but it is if you don’t know. I would recommend getting checked out if you haven’t already. But I’m just a gal over the internet.

twandar [info] I've had years of therapy. DBT helped a lot. I was just diagnosed with bipolar this summer at the age of 39. I'm on meds now that are finally starting to help. Also, to be honest, a lot of this raging, uncontrollable anger has dissipated with just being diagnosed. I used to feel so misunderstood. Why wouldn't anyone listen. Why couldn't anyone understand my feelings. Now I realize it's because I wasn't making sense. My emotions, reactions and ideas were irrational. I really wasn't making sense so no wonder people weren't understanding me. Still it makes me really sad that I've suffered with this for so long and so few people offered me help. I think our society teaches us to ignore issues instead of offering a hand. The good ole bystander effect. [info] None [info] 1511831502
ayakushina91 [info] When I was diagnosed with bipolar II (along with preexisting ADHD) I struggled with it, too... The label of it, what it meant, knowing that it was a lifelong sentence essentially... But as time went on and I noticed how much the medication helped me a lot more than just a regular antidepressant or antidepressant + adhd medication ever did. Anyway, long story short because I don't have a lot of time but, years have passed and I have had time to come to terms with the diagnosis in my own way and I'm now a psychotherapist myself and would be happy to answer any questions you may have about it later :)  [info] None [info] 1511909369
vondahl [info] it’s so hard to go get help in the first place but it’s great that you did! I have BP2 and have been on lamictal for almost a year now, and it’s really helped me out overall. sleepless nights are farther and fewer between (I say, at 3am hahah) and the horrible irritability and rage has improved significantly. I still struggle with binging but I’ve found it’s more like an addiction than an emotional thing. my appetite has evened out more tho. as fucked up as it is, I sometimes miss when I was more manic because of the huge decrease in appetite. my lw was right before I was diagnosed with bipolar /:even more fucked up that I briefly considered not taking my meds for a bit for that reason but then remembered that I almost lost an amazing job because of bipolar radio static brain,anyway sorry I talked about myself so much but I hope you find more peace. mood stabilizers literally saved my life and I hope that it can help you too :)  [info] 5’6 | cw: 115 | gw: 105 | 25F [info] 1512037504
Pamela_Poovey [info] &gt;I think if you try to cutaway at yourself trying to define what is and is not apart of you, you end up with nothing left of yourself.  Descartes takes this tack in his *First Philosophy* and ended up caught in a dualistic construct that required the mind (consciousness) to exist separate from the body.  Then there's the question about whether our properties define who we are, or if who we are defines these properties. And, which of these properties is essential or accidental.  Is water wet because it is water, and could it be water without being wet.  Are you bipolar because of who you are, and could you be who you are without having bipolar?I never thought about it like this before. I was diagnosed with bipolar II mid-year and although between Zoloft, Lamictal and a ton of therapy, I am in a relatively good place, I still struggle with trying to differentiate between what I can attribute to my personality and what I can attribute to the chemical imbalance in my brain. I try to be the best person I can be and not blame any shitty behaviour that I demonstrate on my illness but I still sometimes wonder.As silly as it sounds, it never occurred to me that the effects of my illness could be *a part of* my personality. That doesn’t give me the right, of course, to behave like an asshole and say “bipolar made me do it” but I think it would be a lot more productive in terms of addressing my mental health if I were to consider the impact that my illness has on my personality rather than trying to separate the two. This is a great insight. [info] None [info] 1512046094
Celany [info] Yeeeeeeeeears of therapy. Seriously. First talk therapy, then CBT combined with talk therapy. Then more talk therapy. Most recently, talk therapy and doing The DBT Skills Workbook (found on amazon), because I figured hey, why the hell not?I am both hopeful and wary about the medical issue part. On one hand, hopeful because (like I keep saying) this is just *so* out of character for her, and a big part of my stress was trying to figure out why on earth my aunt would behave that way. OTOH, wary to pin things on mental health that aren't on mental health. And really, I'll probably never know 100% if it's mental health. And also, keeping full awareness that even if it is mental health, she doens't get a free pass. One of the hardest (but most helpful) things that I was told when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder was that I should never assume or even consider that having bipolar meant that special allowances should be made for my mood problems. I was told that I could always *ask* for extra help, but that I was not owed a smidgen of forgiveness or understanding, if I hurt someone. And that it was my responsibility, first and foremost, to work on keeping myself under control. For me, hearing that was the first step in holding not just myself, but everybody around me accountable for their own shit. So if my aunt sincerely apologizes, then fine, we can move on for this weekend. Though I will expect to talk to her or my mom at some point about how her moods seem to be going poorly now, and that she needs to look into that. If she can't do that, then...that sucks, but I'm not going to get myself hurt because someone else won't take care of their problems.All that said, it is heart-breaking. I know other people with family members who kept their mental illness in check for many years, but eventually, it got bad. It's scary to think I could lose another loved one due to mental illness going out of control. Scarier still to think that someday, I could be the person lost to mental illness. On that note, I think one of my errands on the way home is going to be to pick up some comforting chocolate. Today could use a little comfort.  [info] None [info] 1512173449

meedliemao [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was in my early 20s. I think it was a misdiagnosis though because bipolar is super easy to treat with medication, and I responded poorly to everything that was prescribed for me. Followed doctor's orders for a number of years, desperately seeking relief, and then I weaned myself off of the meds and discovered that yeah my moods are still unstable, but they're a heck of a lot better without the medications.I'm in my late 50s now. In the last couple of decades of dealing with these symptoms - periods of intense activity and productivity followed by periods during which I am barely able to function, and the emotional roller coaster ride through those times - I came to realize that these are my natural cycles. When I'm 'up', I'm super productive and have to fight the urge to take too many things on at once, but otherwise I just get a lot accomplished, talk a little too much, things like that, and when I'm 'down', it's simply time for me to rest, to be less social, and minimize my physical activities. These cycles now only become dysfunctional when there are other complicating factors in my external circumstances (things that cause stress). Well, and they also become dysfunctional when I start thinking that I 'shouldn't' be this way, that I really 'must' change things right now and then use those thoughts to rile myself up. I am learning not to do that. Whew! If only I weren't such a slow learner. =-)Anyway, I mention this in part to say that yeah I can relate, but also because I want to ask: Have you been treated for bipolar disorder, and if so how did you respond to the medications?

SincerelySasquatch [info] Yeah, man. And all psych meds should cease production and everyone should just smoke pot. When I was a teenager I was a typical moody teenager and my parents didn't want to deal with me so they send me to the psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and now that I grew up I am pretty much fine except occasional moodiness, (that's bipolar, right?) I don't take meds, I don't want that poison in my body, I just inhale all the chemicals from combustion of marijuana and it helps because I am high all the time so I don't know what's going on and I am not sad anymore!

IceCreamforLunch [info] &gt; I don't even know where to start. I can barely breathe. I keep trying to fix things and everything keeps getting worse to the point where I really don't particularly even care about being alive any more...but I have two little ones that need me. I just don't know what to do at this point and I'm tired of crying all day every day and the panic attacks.You need to get help for this. Find a counselor/therapist/psychologist/etc. and sit down and talk to them regularly until you know that you don't need to anymore.&gt; The problem is, that through bad business and personal decisions made while I was extremely manic (before I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder this year), I have acquired about $48,000 in debt. I managed to pay down about $5000 of that (purely credit card debt) over the summer - leaving me with $43,000. That number is so astronomically huge I don't even know where to start. That sounds like a lot, but you paid over 10% of it off over the summer. If you can pay $5k off in half a year, you'll have it all paid off in &lt;4.5 years in your current state. Much less time when you finish school and find more gainful employment. Your situation isn't really that dire.&gt; My credit is bad, approximately 520, even though I've paid off all majority of the medical bills that were listed on it in 2015 - they're all marked as settled for less than full amount. I have one credit card now, with a $1500 limit, that is utilized and completely paid off by the due date, but it's only 2 months old. All other credit cards have been paid off. My student loans are deferred but currently total $5500. Derogatory marks on my credit are listed as age of accounts, number of accounts, accounts settled for less than full balance, and a lien that has been paid off (ex-husband intentionally didn't pay the taxes on the house so I would be liable as well - deed was in both of our names but mortgage was in his name only, and we had moved 6 hours away so I wasn't notified of the lien until it showed up on my credit. It's been released and I've attempted to submit the release to have it taken off, but it's still there.)Your credit score is secondary. When you get your finances under control then your credit score will improve on its own. Don't worry about your credit score anymore and just focus on your plan to get out of debt. The good news is that none of your debt is super high interest CC debt.&gt; Breakdown: $32,000 to a contractor - have already paid him $20,000 of the original $52,000, have been served with papers demanding payment of the remainder. $8,000 - Title Loan taken out at the insistence of the contractor to "tide him over" until I could get a loan for the full amount I owed him, which hasn't happened due to my credit score. $3,000 - Medical bills from an abuse incident in April, the hospital forgave all of my abuser's medical bills but said I made too much for mine to be forgiven, even though he was formally charged and tried and is supposed to pay them...he hasn't. One just showed up on my credit this morning...plummeting my score 51 points.or &gt; You should consider the medical bill "your debt" and work on paying it off just like you are the rest of your debt, but in the meantime, you should look into suing him for damages (the amount of the bills, any interest/penalties, and anything it costs you to collect from him). &gt; All of this wouldn't be so bad if I had any positive income coming in..but currently I'm barely breaking even with the bills as it is with the income from working at the store. I haven't paid November's rent yet, and now December's is due today. ($1000 each month). This is after I downsized our housing into the cheapest available space in our area, traded in my car for one without payments, canceled the babysitter and bring my youngest to work, and took my oldest out of private school. The store was originally making ~$20,000 a month before expenses (net profit ~$6k), my then-fiance was making ~$40k a year, and I had child support ($850/month) and royalties ($300/month). Now the store is making ~$3-4k a month, no secondary income, child support has been cut to $650/month, and royalties (oil/gas) have gone down to about $130/month. I'm desperately looking for a second job that's flexible enough for me to still be able to pick up my oldest from school as she's not old enough to be home alone and to either keep my youngest with me or pay someone to watch her. It just seems like an all around impossible situation to climb out of, and I don't know what to do. I've tried making plans and discussing them with my parents and structuring repayment plans, etc...but all of that hinges on them agreeing to be cosignors - which they refuse to do. They've been telling me to just file bankruptcy and get it over with, but I also don't want to lose everything I've built up...as little as it is. I just don't know what to do or where to turn.What is your anticipated salary when you graduate? You're only five months away from that. Your focus should be on finishing school strong and finding the best job you can after you graduate. What is your plan for the boutique when you finish your degree? If you plan to sell it, then maybe you should start pursuing that option right now. If the store makes a net profit, then it should have some value. Especially if there's inventory, fixtures, customers/branding, etc. involved. The proceeds could take some pressure off while you finish your degree.Also, your parents aren't willing to cosign, but are they willing to babysit? Free babysitting would be hugely valuable to you right now. It's a way they could be a great help without putting themselves at significant financial risk (I agree with them that they shouldn't cosign for you). [info] None [info] 1512517272

Skrowtom [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar this year so I get that. But my wife died and we have two kids. It gets worse before it gets better and doing nothing is worse than trying something. Just from personal experience. If I lay around and just wasted away, someone ( rightfully so) would take my kids. I know you don't have a lot riding on your shoulders like that, but you don't have kids, you just have each other. And not contributing to the house hold hurts the relationship you are supposed to be building. If she is seeing someone, make sure they are getting the dosage right for her meds.

molly_bl00m [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II a little over a decade ago (I’m 27 now) and have been smoking dope for the past 3-4 years (with a whole year clean thrown in there from 2016 til this May). While the substances change, I’ve always had some sort of addiction since 15 (when I tried my first drug, which was meth yay). While I obviously still struggle a bit, and two fucked life events beyond my control are what finally pushed me toward heroin, I do feel like I am in a much better place now than I ever have been - partly due to the way medication has helped me since I found my angel of a doctor, but dope has also positively affected me in two ways I didn’t expect:At first, as you’ve mentioned, it killed the pain and made me feel OKAY, for once in my life. And feeling okay gave me the strength to quit my cycle of shitty jobs and finally go back to community college. I’m now about to finish my first semester at one of the best universities in the world studying something I have loved literally for as long as I can remember. But second, and most surprisingly to me, the negative aspects of use (from having to worry about avoiding withdrawal to hating being at the mercy of dealers to feeling shitty about being the junkie in the lives of everyone I love, etc etc) have shown me that not only do I actually love myself, but I love myself and my dreams even more than I love drugs. I can’t say I’ll never go back, but when I go home this weekend for winter break I am going to kick and come back to school in January a clean machine. Without dope, I wouldn’t have had that chemical confidence to start accomplishing my goals, and without dope I wouldn’t have experienced the depths of desperation and degradation that it’s put me through which have helped me realize that I deserve my full agency back - and that I want it more than I want that next ping pong ball of black.I know this probably sounds stupid and idealistic and whatever else, but I really don’t regret my dope use cuz I’m finally learning who I am and who I want to be.

sandsnatchqueen [info] 2 opinions are better than one imo if you have decent insurance or have the money. There's always the chance of other issues that may be more serious than adhd and one may find something else. Then you can decide from there. From my personal experience I was diagnosed with bipolar and adhd (lamictal+seroquel +adderall for treatment)  and only my second psych diagnosed me correctly. The first one put me on meds that exasperated my bipolar manic episodes (ssri's + adderall aren't a great combo for most) . So I'm all for second opinions.  [info] None [info] 1513306731
MrObject [info] No idea, attention?  Help?I'm diagnosed with bipolar, that's it.  It allows me to get benzos for sleep issues, which I have, but probably not from the bipolar.I know what goes on in my mind and I know I've done a fair share of illegal deviant behavior.  I figure as long as I'm not an actual harm to society imo then why do I need to ask some guy, who thinks he's smarter than me, for help?Until that day, I'm sure I can handle myself.

annielovesbacon [info] Janet Snakehole is right, if you are in university there is almost definitely a free or low-cost clinic on campus. I go to therapy at my school, and I did so out of pocket without my parents knowing for a year and a half (but then when I was diagnosed with bipolar, I had to start taking medicine, and it was too expensive for me without insurance)You could also x-post this question on /r/talktherapy!

babyforks [info] We just seem like good friends now. He asks about my day, how I felt when I was diagnosed with bipolar, how’d the break up go. No one else asked me how my diagnosis has affected me before. I think he may just want to travel because he wants to see more. It’s only been a few days since we’ve reconnected, but they have been nice. I don’t think we could do long distance though. That would be selfish. He also has one semester left of college and I have three. We’re both design majors so it feels so good to have common ground with someone. When we dated in high school we went to different high schools and neither of us drove. We never really had a chance. We were both immature. Now we’ve had our own experiences, and I wish there was a chance. He probably just sees me as a friend rather than an ex. [info] None [info] 1513627815
DopeyOpi92 [info] Hi, sorry I took so long to respond. I've been feeling very strange lately. Since we last talked I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it's the worse one, bipolar 1. I'm not sure why I'm telling you this. I saw your username and I remembered that I talk to you and it was normally about my pain and my chronic pain conditions mostly dealing with my spine. I still have these ailments and my spine is still degrading. My neck is really really bad it feels like very tight and hurts a lot. My lower back still bothers me quite a bit. A lot of spasms and pain and some weakness and some numbness.I feel like I need to reach out to someone and I'm sorry but I think you're it. I apologize for unloading all of this on you but I need to tell someone. My mental illness is getting worse and I may be losing my job soon. I got my dream job working IT at a hospital and I thought it was going great until my manager put me on a performance Improvement plan and things started going downhill. I try my best and I find out on Friday if I'm keeping my job. I don't have a good feeling about it though. If I happen to lose my job I may end up hurting myself. I used to say that a lot that I would hurt myself but I never really meant it. This time is different though I feel numb. I don't have enough money to see my psychiatrist he is quite expensive and doesn't accept my insurance. I hope this doesn't overwhelm you and I'm not exactly sure what I want you to say or what I'm looking for. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest with someone as I can't really tell my parents or anyone else in my family. Thanks for listening goat I hope you have something wise to tell me.

ChilliBlaster [info] What are the chances that I can get in if I was diagnosed with bipolar over 10 years ago? I havent taken meds since then and recently went to a doctor for a psych eval who agrees that I do NOT have bipolar and that i'm totally normal.

Hdw333333 [info] Yep, and I'm 30, and yet I still can't get my tubes tied because I haven't had any kids yet/ aren't old enough. I decided I don't want kids 10 years ago when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but I'm not allowed to make that choice until I'm "mature enough to know I won't change my mind". Fucking teenagers have more control over their bodies than me, a 30 year old fucking woman. It's infuriating.  [info] None [info] 1513749210
Claireheart [info] Ok, before this gets too crazy, a bipolar diagnosis doesn't mean he is incapable to be a father.Just like with anyone else, a bipolar person can be irresponsible and unreliable, but that DOES NOT MEAN THEY HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. Obviously, some things may be from bipolar, but bipolar doesn't magically erase someone's personality. If a person is a piece of crap human being who is irresponsible then after the bipolar diagnosis, the person will -still- be a piece of crap human being who is irresponsible.I was diagnosed with bipolar at 13 (early onset caused by trauma), and I have been with my husband nearly 15 years (married since 2009), have a successful career (until I had to stay at home for baby, will get back to it in 6 months to a year depending on baby), graduated college with a 3.8 GPA, etc... etc... just like everyone else....because I am not too different than anyone else. I still have my own personality, I just experience highs and lows. That is the only difference. A lot of people use bipolar as a crutch though, and they always justify their behavior with 'I can't help it, it is my bipolar'. So nothing gets better because they have a built-in excuse to never better themselves. Anyone can work to better themselves and suppress impulse, control energy, force themselves out of bed, etc... That being said, to answer your question, it depends on what kind of person he is. If he doesn't even see a problem with his actions, then he won't change. As a result, he is a danger to your kids as he can't just leave them like you said. As a result, you have to try to protect your children - but this doesn't have to be permanent - he just needs to see a problem and learn how to manage it (most people need professional help to do so).

bookstorekiller [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in my early twenties.

I grew up on Star Wars and still am obsessed, but Carrie Fisher became a real hero to me as I grew up and dealt with similar issues.

myotherguy [info] I’m sorry you’re having this experience, as I’m sure it’s fairly disconcerting. It also does sound pretty fascinating, though. Upon first reading, I thought these sounded like petit mal seizures, but I’m not a doctor and I don’t have epilepsy myself.I used to have a similar experience pretty regularly, albeit a bit different, so maybe I can help a little? Idk. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar II, often late at night while I was getting ready for bed, I would have some phrase from a song lyric or a line from the Mass that would get stuck in my head. I would start repeating the line to myself over and over again, and it would produce that “tip of the tongue” sensation that you describe— I would feel like I was just on the edge of having a break through and that phrase or memory was somehow the key to unlocking another memory or some secret that would help me understand something intensely profound. It would be this overwhelming sense of foreboding, but like, a *positive* foreboding, if that makes any sense. After I was diagnosed with bipolar and started taking medication, these episodes stopped. This was before I had ever smoked weed, though, so it was unrelated to that. I’m sorry if that’s not much help. TL;DR: used to have similar experiences when I was unmedicated bipolar. Went on medication and they stopped. Not weed related for me.  [info] None [info] 1514307383
meradorm [info] She's not a psychiatrist but a psychiatric nurse. Insurance just will not pay for the prescription unless it comes with a diagnosis code, presumably for ADHD. The nurse wants me to have this medicine, but I can't have it until I've been diagnosed with a condition that Medicaid believes that the medication can treat. I don't know if the facility I go to would let my nurse diagnosis me herself, or if she has to wait for the guy with the doctorate (my psychologist) to do it.The inventory is a weird one that matches you up to statistics to see how bad you have it compared to the bell curve. You need a key to use it and can't really make heads or tails of it otherwise. It's possible for anyone to see just by how many boxes I check and how often the symptoms I report affect me that I have an issue, but I don't know if to make a formal diagnosis at this facility they need to sit down and say that according to assessment I'm in 88th percentile of being shit at life. Or whatever. Again, I don't know what red tape they have to go through where I'm getting care at. (I know they have some very specific criteria at the facility about prescribing benzodiazapenes like Xanax, under what circumstances they can be prescribed, and for how long the shrinks can keep the patients on them, as only short-term prescriptions are allowed. I don't know what their criteria are for ADHD diagnosis and treatment or even if they have any at all.)Being a Medicaid patient my options are also limited and this is the best treatment I've gotten anywhere by far. I can't really leave. Essentially I just want to know if Medicaid will fill a scrip for Vyvanse if my psychiatric nurse tells them I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, or if they want the diagnosis to be specifically ADHD. Hoping someone who's been in the same situation might know.  [info] None [info] 1514530050

hippiehen54 [info] Three doctors have said bipolar pretty much means you have bipolar disorder. Think about bipolar just like you would if they said you have diabetes. Take the meds=controlling the disorder. Stop the meds=the disorder will control you. I've had b/p disorder since I was in my teens. No one diagnosed anything until I was in my late twenties when they put me on a tricyclic med. It wasn't until I was in my early 50s that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I never talked to the doctor when I was ecstatic or full of energy. Only when I was depressed. Now we know the anti depressants triggered mania. A lot of the meds today weren't developed back in my early years of treatment.I still have times where I decide to do something that later doesn't make sense And I still can't forgive myself for choices I made even when I can clearly see the influence of the disorder. I can't cut myself any slack.  [info] None [info] 1514602781
BufufterWallace [info] Although it’s not food, I’ve been down a similar road. In high school I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and one of the major struggles was cutting. It lasted well into my college years and I ended up working harder and harder to hide fresh wounds. In the mix of things I became Catholic and started slowly piecing together what faith is amid mental illness. A year or two ago I’d run into something about the cilice and it instantly appealed to me. I was half way through the order form on an online store (another bipolar issue) when I realized that because of my history and disordered desires regarding physical pain, I’d never be able to separate the psychological pleasure of self-harm from the spiritual practice of mortification. I didn’t get it and highly doubt I ever will attempt something like that. I’m mentally incapable of some pious mortifications. For me and for many with mental illness, otherwise innocent or laudable penitential practices can be triggers for psychosis. My advice is that since there has been a history of eating disorders, find a mortification which is unrelated to food and never attempt any mortification regarding food apart from the required minimum fasts. I would even take those as optional due to illness for a few years until you’re certain and comfortable that you’re doing things with sincere intent. That’s the treatment I’ve given myself and it’s spared me from some of the danger of mental illness.  [info] None [info] 1514677108
slaughteredlamb1986 [info] Here in the UK I know people have been saying since long before I was a kid and still use it this way today. I had a manic day, or my job had been really manic. It's the correct usage of the word is the only use of the word I have ever heard before I was diagnosed with bipolar. Now if people where going around saying I had a full manic episode at work today , then I would question what the fuck they are talking about. But if they said I've just been so manic today been so busy rushing here and there. I wouldn't question it and nobody I know with bipolar or not would question it because it's a common usage of the word and had been for a very long time. I think your holding on to that word as special to your situation for some reason when it's actually a word that been in common usage to mean something non clinical for a long time and is still used that way. No if they said I'm so bipolar I'm my moods are just so up and down and they weren't diagnosed. Or they started saying I've been so hypomanic today then I would take offense to it because it's never been in common usage .

No_Ellie [info] Interestingly I was diagnosed with bipolar but the mood stablisers I was put on (seroquel, then latuda) messed me up way more. I'm not a huge fan of my doctor since he brushed this off like he does most things and just put me back on my regular cymbalta. I'm on wait lists for a new psychiatrist but it's a long process. I still sometimes get episodes of hypomania but they're usually characterized by excitement and ambition and carefreeness, so I never considered this could be some extension of that.

SeaHam92 [info] I don’t have ADHD, but this sadly reminds me a lot of how my own parents operate. I don’t understand the need that N’s have to completely deny valid medical diagnoses, but that seems to be a common theme and this thread is giving me some relief that my parents weren’t the only ones who did this.For as long as I can remember, probably starting at age 3 or 4, people have been suggesting to my parents that my brother is possibly autistic. He was never given the opportunity to see a specialist for diagnosis and just a year or so ago my mom (not sure if she’s an N or an E?) admitted that she cut off friendships with other parents who suggested to my mom that he was autistic. It’s important to note, my mom is/was an RN and later became a medical malpractice attorney and my father is an MD (they used their degrees to control my brother and I and make us feel like we couldn’t understand our own bodies/symptoms, but that could be an entirely different story in another post haha). All of their friends are MD’s and many are pediatricians, so it’s not like these suggestions were coming from people who were ignorant of autism or of medical issues in general. As an adult my brother sought out counseling and was told he’s autistic. Go figure. My first inclination that my parents are full of shit despite their fancy degrees was when it took me 3 years to convince them I had a tumor growing in my throat that needed to be removed. I could feel it any time I swallowed, and other people could even see it while I was speaking and would ask me about that “weird lump” in my throat. I begged and cried for them to check it out and believe me but I was constantly told that I’m “histrionic”, to “stop being dramatic” and that they’ve always know that I’m “a little bit of a hypochondriac” (PS I apologize if I’m spelling some of these words wrong). Sure enough, senior year of high school the tumor got so large it hurt whenever I swallowed and it was impossible to ignore (their doctor friends were commenting on it lol). So they took me to an ENT specialist and I finally got it removed! It was a relief to be validated and finally have tangible proof that I’m not histrionic like my parents always tell me, but it also made me very wary of taking any medical advice from them. A few years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my mom said “well, I’ve never seen you go buy a house on impulse so that’s obviously wrong”. My dad was diagnosed with dementia roughly a year after that, and my mom started saying things like “well, my memory is worse than his and he’s the one with a diagnosis! My memory is fine, so obviously the diagnosis is wrong”.  I figured if there was anyone in my family my mom would be fine with getting sick, it was my dad. But she followed her pattern and denied it. That sealed it for me and I realized that my parents’ N tendencies will ALWAYS overrule the knowledge they gained from nursing school, medical school, and law school, respectively.

ama_compiler_bot [info] Table of Questions and Answers. Original answer linked - Please upvote the original questions and answers.***Question | Answer | Link---------|----------|----------|What's your greatest challenge since your diagnosis?|I’d say honestly just keeping my day to day life coherent, there are quite a few memory gaps.  I was only diagnosed recently but it’s been present for at least 6 years now, so I’d say my greatest challenge was actually prior to diagnosis. And that would be trying not to be in denial and trust that there is actually something wrong and that I’m not faking. Even now that weird feeling of being a fake exists. It tends to gnaw away at my rationality.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/7nlz4d/i_have_dissociative_identity_disorder_previously/ds2qzaz/)I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 but I have had d.i.d. suggested as well, can you explained what happens when you enter a dissociative state please?|I guess there are two separate things I’d describe as a dissociative state.  The one is switching which personality is fronting, that normally doesn’t feel like much, sometimes I feel like I’m suddenly watching myself externally or that it’s not me who’s in control, but normally I just experience a hole in that space of memory.  The other feeling is what happens in most dissociative conditions. It’s just feeling like your body isn’t yours, it always feels like everything is too real, so real that it feels like it has to be fake. I either get flat affect or start panicking. In those moments I just get really disconnected from everything.  For the host it doesn’t happen as much anymore but for some alters it does quite a bit.  Bipolar 2 and BPD have been considered for me, too. They don’t overlap with DID in what they do, but rather are just common in patients with it. Hopefully it’s a milder dissociative disorder if you do have one, it gets rough having to live through amnesia. |[Here](/r/AMA/comments/7nlz4d/i_have_dissociative_identity_disorder_previously/ds2r357/)Have you seen the movie Split?|I have, and I actually liked it. A lot of people in the DID community absolutely positively hate it because it’s as is advertised, a horror movie surrounding the disorder.  I get that it might be increasing stigma and the interviews of people with DID weren’t considered much for the way he film was done, but it had a lot of truth in it. There was obvious other research put in.  It was a horror movie, there’s gonna be some element of horror to it, in this case a scary mutant thing, yeah I guess that has caused stigma in other movies because of the murderer thing, but no other movie made it obvious that it was a monster.  The things that trigger out the original personality, and the other alters pretending to be each other with some fail, even the silencing of other alters, that movie was accurate. That was the first big movie about the disorder to mention those certain physical changes that can happen to different alters, like Frankie(?) needing insulin, and the idea at least of increased strength.  I just feel like I need to explain how I felt because so many people ignored it entirely because horror + mental disorder. The average person will see those other things more than spiderman cannibal monster climbing the walls.  Sorry for the long reply, I just get really really heated with this subject.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/7nlz4d/i_have_dissociative_identity_disorder_previously/ds2s55l/)Have you ever used drugs or alcohol? If so how does this affect your condition?|Alcohol doesn’t do too much for me, I don’t like drinking so I haven’t been anywhere near inebriated though. The only thing alcohol does is tend to trigger out certain personalities if I’m stressed while in the presence of it, that has to do with some past traumas.  Drugs are very different for us. A lot of the alters here are at that prime drugs/rock and roll/sex age, their twenties and early thirties, they try to seek out certain substances but we’ve found that with depressants, it’s hard to keep the front. This might be because others want control, but if you don’t find focus, someone else will take your place. If we do a lot or a certain alter does it though, it can lead to just a total blackout, even if the average person wouldn’t get that.  With hallucinogens most of us just panic, our handle on what’s real and what’s not is delicate since our host personality struggles with hallucinations. If a certain alter is out on hallucinogens we function just as a regular person would.  Drugs just don’t do too much extra to us, just a little more fluidity in who’s out or who we are.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/7nlz4d/i_have_dissociative_identity_disorder_previously/ds2v912/)Is there any communication between alters? Like, are you aware of the other alters wants/needs/desires if you're not in that alter? Like say you are alter A, are you concerned about what B, C, D, etc. Have to say? Do they have anything to say?  ( I'm sorry if alter isn't the right word- I watched united states of Tara and that's what they use, correct me if I've offended you!) |Alter is the right word, no worries. (And I haven’t seen that before, is it decent?)  So because our system has healed so much in the past few years, there’s communication between pretty much every alter. That’s been our primary focus on how to improve ourselves and get better, since open communication leads to better compromise.  Our system has a pretty large inner world, it’s mostly an area for alters not near the front, the ones that aren’t really going to take control in the near future. We don’t generally hear each other’s thoughts from that area, but really strong personalities (like the host or caretaker) can tend to peek through on occasion. Some alters have more connection and hear each other and are aware of their inner feelings more. And some alters are so separated we don’t even know of their existence.  We co-con and co-front a lot because of the way our system developed, that means that the alters that are fronting together or conscious of one another are normally entirely aware of what the other(s) is thinking, saying, doing, etc.  With the caring about what others have to say, we’re kind of all a little rude to each other but it’s like a weird big family so yeah, we are concerned about what we all have to say, and generally we all have something to say.  The only ones that don’t have something to say are generally new alters or the prosecutor. Our main prosecutor just sort of watches us all from a distance and occasionally reprimands us.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/7nlz4d/i_have_dissociative_identity_disorder_previously/ds34t0z/)Do your alters look different then you?|Externally, not so much as one would expect. We sometimes do our hair differently, we have different postures and express ourselves differently, voice pitch is used differently too. Our partner can determine which alter is out based only on how we hold ourselves.  Internally we all look a lot different from each other. All besides the current host and the original personality. The host has taken on a sense of being the original and therefore is only slightly different internally, this causes a lot of self hate though.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/7nlz4d/i_have_dissociative_identity_disorder_previously/ds433jm/)What do you do for a living? Do you all have different friends? How many of you are in a relationship? Thank you for a fascinating AMA!|The body is relatively young still (I hate it), so I currently only work in a Papa Johns, but I’ve worked in kennels and adoption agencies before.  We don’t really have different friends, systems that are able to maintain various friend groups are generally not prone to rapid switching, which we are. The alters tend to stay speaking to each other rather than external people if it can be helped, but recently they’ve branched out and are introducing themselves to friends the host had.  The host’s significant other has established a relationship with a few of us, others date within the system as well. Another alter and I are dating for instance, and it’s an open relationship between us. I’d say a lot of us are in a relationship, and if not there’s obvious attempts. We can’t date outside of the system (besides their partner) because the host said so which is sorta disappointing.  Thank you for asking, I appreciate it greatly|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/7nlz4d/i_have_dissociative_identity_disorder_previously/ds5964a/)---[Source] (https://github.com/johnsliao/ama_compiler) [info] None [info] 1515098408
WindUpToys [info] Only my closest friends really know because they either deal with a similar situation or are very understanding. You can't really tell other people because they'll either think you're just bullshitting for attention or so mentally ill that anything you say is not valuable to listen to. I told my mom and doctor and my mom said it was my psychotic features because I'm diagnosed with bipolar and that but not osdd or DID. And my psych kinda just brushed off what I said and said "everyone has a certain way of acting in different situations" when I told him I had at least one other non dormant alter and the two of us switch when he can't deal with stuff that I can. Certain things that people call him make him suicidal and those things happen fairly commonly so I go into public and family events and work for him. But the only people who actually believe me are my closest friends.  [info] None [info] 1515165707

potatoe_666 [info] really enjoyed your comment and glad i’m not the only one who these don’t work for! it sucks having your psychiatrist not understand why these medications aren’t working and it’s also frustrating putting so much time and money into medications and appointments and nothing seem to work. I was diagnosed with bipolar II first but i never had mania or anything similar so BPD is current diagnoses. i was on Latuda when I was diagnosed as bipolar and it actually worked very well except insurance wouldn’t cover it so onto abilify! hopefully it works like the latuda did!

SophiaYiasemi [info] I had very mild depressive symptoms from the age of 12 or 13, and an actual depressive episode at 14. My parents and GP forced me to see a psychologist who was largely unhelpful. At 15 I had my first hypomanic episode that lasted ~5 months. I had lots of problems at school and was accused of taking drugs. And then it went away and I only had mild symptoms for the next year or so. When I was 17 I had a bad depressive episode and serious suicide attempt - so I was prescribed fluoxetine which triggered a mixed episode, and I became psychotic. After another hospital admission I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder aged 17. I was medicated and stable for a year and a half. And then was unmediated and incredibly unwell between the ages of 19 and 21. I’m now 23, and have been medicated and mostly stable for the last two years.  [info] None [info] 1515456738
albatross95 [info] This hits home. I was diagnosed with bipolar I because according to the psychiatrist I have psychotic feature... which he said he noticed because I was talking to someone while I was with him (I talk to my alter a lot and I didn't realise he noticed). After that session where he diagnosed me with bipolar, he said he'll prescribe me with antipsychotic because I was having a psychotic episode in front of him. EDIT: It's kinda interesting (?) to see that most people with DID have been diagnosed with bipolar at some point in their life. Guess that's what comes to people's minds when they see us.

heroicdoberman [info] Hello. It seems difficult to find the right person that complements your ideas and personality. Let alone the right psychiatrist! If it seems that he/she is not focusing his/her attention to the point of the matter, then maybe that doctor is not suited for you. Evaluate first if you are comfortable with your doctor, his/her body language, the way he/she listens and answers your thoughts, and the specificity of his/her prescriptions. Allow yourself to ask your doctor questions that make you gauge on his/her answers. Write your questions down. Make a list. For example, ask your doctor how do these meds interact with your system.When I got an episode of mania and psychosis in 2015, My family and I searched all over our city for the right psychiatrist, most of those doctors were unavailable at that time and we were scheduled an appointment during nighttime already after a long day's search.I am diagnosed with bipolar fairly recently. I am relearning the way I focus on things. My concentration decreased as I had to drop out of college due to my condition. I can't seem to do one task for sometime, trying to do tasks so hard but eventually end up failing to finish it. I fell many times, trying to be positive yet dwindling as I lose focus. Today I can assure you that my willpower (though how weak it may seem), along with my meds and talk therapy, fairly increased my focus (a bit). So don't give up!Keep on questioning and keep on looking for the one that fits. Maybe the change could put your mind into a new perspective. [info] None [info] 1515583041

stopmillion [info] Hello ! When I was 17 I was so depressed and suicidal I knew I had to get help but I did not want to tell my parents myself. I gathered up the courage to go to a guidance counselor at my high school.... I'm not going to lie it was hard to do. I felt like I was choking. Keep in mind if you do this they're required by law to call ur parents... And if you say ur suicidal they might send you to the hospital... Be careful what you tell them. If you do this I would say "I'm extremely depressed can you please call my parents and tell them I need professional help". That's basically what I did. It was awkward af with my parents after for a while but to be frank I needed them to pay for the help I desperately needed. I was diagnosed with bipolar maybe 2 years later. Good luck... I would really recommend just gathering up the courage and telling someone. If you don't things could get worse. Good luck and I really do know how hard it is  [info] None [info] 1515639536

IStoleTheSweetrolls [info] Sometimes, but not always.  Most people with mental illnesses are not violent, and they're more likely to be victims of abuse than people who are mentally healthy.  Not all mental illnesses are the same, and even people with the same diagnosis often behave very differently from each other.  And people recover.  I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was involuntarily committed for attempting suicide years ago, but I've worked very hard to get better.

I really wish I could help more people with problems like this because I was such a basketcase for sooo long, and even though I'm diagnosed with bipolar, I still think that doesn't solve the puzzle...saying things like "Don't do drugs, idiot!" isn't going to help...I self medicated with alcohol, mdma, coke, and other things for so long to deal with my problems, as a recovering addict I know that ridiculing somebody isn't the answer, especially if they don't even have an addiction...The only thing that helped me was getting sober and then reminding myself every day that I was in the right reality, my reality wasn't broken, and things were normal as much as my mind told me they weren't. And in OP's case it seems to be an abstract way.Sounds to me that the unfinished thought problem is only a crumb of the whole problem...I remember during my trip feeling like I was being reborn or "rebooted". My mind felt like a newborn baby's mind, I still remembered everything but that feeling of everything being unfamiliar was overwhelming. Maybe this is the case, /u/Neutrinosandgluons?

Edit: and they went into a lot of detail on the MH side of things.Bipolar is a chronic mental illness that tends to get worse the longer it goes untreated, so please go to a doctor asap.

However, the only other thing that is going to determine it is your life, lifestyle, and behavior. You won't know until you see a professional. But please do it because you've got to trust your gut too when it comes to your mental health.  [info] None [info] 1516315992

ILYW617 [info] I was initially diagnosed with BPD before I was diagnosed with bipolar. Now my psychologist says I'm bipolar with traits of BPD. She puts it is a good way though. "It's a defense mechanism for the trauma you've suffered. It's not necessarily a bad thing. You developed what you had to in order to survive." This saved me from suicidal thoughts over the stigma of all this. [info] None [info] 1516592454

StillAders83 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II in my early 20’s, but my manic type episodes sound like yours- irritated, twitchy, anxious, like a mixed episode.I would get really into my projects though and had a lot of hyper energy. Shut downs are more like I’m a mechanical doll that stops working. I cry all the time or sleep and can’t articulate anything beyond “I just want to die so I can rest.” When I melt down it’s when frustration overloads me and I yell or scream (if possible) and just kinda freak out, throw things. These mostly happen in the car because driving is really draining for me. [info] None [info] 1516733317
paperclip1213 [info] Saville is nothing new. The BBC covering up a paedophile's offences is as common as an acne-prone teenager covering his/her spots. It's common knowledge in the UK for anyone who paid attention to the news in 2015. After the "VIP paedophile ring" was first exposed, I spent about a month studying it along with a few too many child abuse cases for the Early Childhood Studies course I was taking at the time. Every waking hour, every single day, it's all I thought about because it was personal to me because I have a history of sex abuse. I ended up losing a lot of sleep and experiencing persecutory delusions as a result. (I was diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder so I should have seen it coming.) The majority of people didn't pay as much attention as I did to it though. It was treated like backyard gossip. If it entered the spotlight today it would definitely garner as much attention as the Weinstein thing.The BBC, the royal family, and many, many, many officials in the government covered up Saville's case as well as their own, their colleagues', their friends', etc. People reacted in as much outrage as they could possibly react in, but ultimately we know we're "the little people" so there's not much we can do about it, hence why it didn't really get far. The fact that it didn't get as much attention or support as the whole Weinstein thing is what pisses me off more than anything. [info] None [info] 1516796468

Moonbaby313 [info] Well I was diagnosed with bipolar after a break down. I pushed everyone out of my life and then mentally I just...snapped. When I reached out for help and I was diagnosed it kinda mind-screwed me. I went from this sense of superiority and feeling like I wasn't getting what I deserved to feeling like something was wrong with me. Now I guess Im scared to deal with people because I don't know which part is actually me. So it's easier to just keep my distance I guess. I am in therapy and I do have 2 people in my life who know my diagnosis. They are very supportive so I've learned not to take them for granted. because the self inflated ego was part of the mania, it's easier to identify and not get caught up in. In some ways I'm more relatable...but now I don't feel comfortable letting people get close to me. Such is life. [info] None [info] 1516921615
CygnusTheDuck [info] I have a similar experience. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder but I have serious doubts; I never responded well to the medications and all my episodes coincided with marijuana abuse and dysphoria.I’ve been clean for over a year and I’m transitioning. Haven’t touched any medication but so far no crippling episodes sending me to the ER.Unfortunately my family thinks bipolar made me trans, nevermind wanting to be a girl during early childhood which predates the bipolar diagnosis. I think it would be easier for them if I was just a drug addict rather than trans. I have given up on convincing them that my transition really is addressing the core issues in my life I just hope I will become a productive person and to conquer the mental illness the way you have.

jacfearsome [info] I've found it is important to judge and analyze the person you plan to tell.  Practice telling them other secrets and see if others find out.  If the can't keep your confidence with small things, you certainly can't trust them with big things.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 4 years ago and have since then learned how to tell people.  I have slowly created a circle of friends that allow me to reveal my "crazy" (not the best word) self and not scare them away or get hurt by them.  From what I've seen people generally have a couple responses.1. They acknowledge it and are polite/nice to your face but then badmouth you to others.2. They acknowledge it and are polite/nice but then judge you or look down on you.3. They understand that they don't understand and listen with an open mind, and are gracious.

I was diagnosed with bipolar and was put on meds. Through the years I've seen about 3 therapists and over 4 psychiatrists. I went through the countless medications and just a bunch of shit. It wasn't until now that I was informed by my current psych that I was misdiagnosed. He changed my meds and I've finally been feeling better in what's felt like an eternity. I guess what I'm trying to say is, for me happiness comes with a lot of work and perseverance and surrounding yourself with people who will help you get there.  [info] None [info] 1517383735

adltchickadee [info] This is just what I've been feeling about this hashtag and I haven't been able to nail it down until you put it into words. Yes, nothing is ever said about hypomania! I used to teach, and I clearly remember a few students who I had to kick out of class for monopolizing conversation and making random sexual comments. That was years ago, and now that I've been diagnosed with bipolar, I realize that they were likely hypomanic and probably undiagnosed or off their meds. If I had know what was going on (i.e., if there  was a movement to "raise awareness" about hypomanic symptoms), I could have talked to them outside of class and referred them to the counseling center instead of telling them to gtfo of my classroom.Praising people for coming out with mental illness sounds wonderful, too, but I worry that people in high school and young college students getting comfortable with being "out" in high school and college will run into some cruel realities when they hit the workforce. Depending on their workplace, being "out" can possibly risk them their jobs. The rest of the world is not as progressive as some parts of the internet and most colleges. Leaving the security of school is terrifying for most students; building your self-concept around your mental health diagnosis will only make that transition worse.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few months ago and have not yet been able to get proper treatment and help. Because of this, I have fallen hard off my schedule. My school work is not good, I’m sleeping 16 hours a day, I haven’t been to the gym in a few days and I’ve been eating whatever is convenient. I need to get it under control and it’s scary because on one hand, I don’t want to acknowledge it but on the other, I feel like it’s causing me to ruin myself.

l-appel_du_vide- [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 in high school, but before they would give me the diagnosis, they ran some blood work to check out my thyroid, because apparently thyroid issues can manifest with symptoms strikingly similar to bipolar disorder.I had a number of extremely crazy, extremely horrible years before and after then until I finally found the pharmaceutical cocktail that works for me, but the root cause being neurochemical fuckery made sense to me. The fact that somebody's thyroid can do that same shit to them seemed so wild and awful.As somebody who's been down that road as well, even if for different reasons, you have my sincere empathy. I hope getting to the bottom of it helped you find a cocktail that worked for you, too. [info] None [info] 1517776165
iRoastaJWhenIWakeUp [info] Philosophy. Medication is all about differing responsibility for yourself to a drug. Therapy is about expecting someone else to make your life better. It's all about taking responsibility for yourself.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and took medication and received therapy. First, how do you even diagnose someone with a mental illness? With physical illness, there's a clearly defined norm to point to i.e. 98.6 degree Fahrenheit, x many ccs of mucous coming out of their nose, etc. With mental illness, what's the norm? You'll quickly realize that there isn't one. It's all arbitrary. And yet they'll prescribe hard drugs like amphetamines and antidepressants (in my case, "mood stabilizers") to people who they can't even definitively say have something wrong with them. In my opinion, you're better off learning how to live and fixing your own problems in living rather than relying on someone or something to make your life better for you [info] None [info] 1517812949
KitsuneGeisha [info]   I’m almost 30 with Bipolar I. I have 2 boys ages 7 and almost 2. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after having my first child. I have experienced severe mood episodes both times postpartum, so that is something to keep in mind. Depending on what you take medication wise, you may have to add or remove meds for pregnancy and afterwards.   Because of my mental state, I know now that I cannot handle having anymore children. My mania after my second was bad enough I should have been hospitalized. Because I have my two boys, I work really hard to never miss my meds. I struggle internally being the Mom I want to be but it’s the most important job I have. I think people with bipolar disorder can have children but I think it does make things harder.

Giddy_pig [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar (not so sure about the validity of that now but anyway) when i was about 20 but leading up to that, life was a bit rough. Around 18 years old i developed quite aggressive plaque psoriasis. I was on and off several SSRIs during this time. Stress was a factor too.I feel like the mental duress and it's affects on the immune system were likely factors that also required SSRIs treatment. In other words there might be a correlation but the link is the stress.This is all just spit balling though, I'm definitely qualified to make such statements. [info] None [info] 1518258400
prufrockbabe666 [info] I'm a sex addict (10 months sober yesterday). Even most of the people in my 12 step group ( which is AA, because SAA/ SLAA/ SA in my town feels very unsafe) don't know. Even though my obsession about / compulsion toward sex got a lot better when I was diagnosed with bipolar and got on meds, as a woman it is horrible to try to tell people you're a sex addict because people either think you're trying to get attention or that it's hot. I'm really worried that my friends or family member will find pictures of me on the internet because I sent them to so many people when I was acting out. My other really big secret is that while I was manic and sleeping around with a lot of people (because mania / manic hypersexuality + compulsive sexuality is like the worst combination, ever), I was raped by a stranger, as I was hooking up with his girlfriend. The only people who know this are one of my sisters, one close cousin, my therapist and my current partner. And only my therapist and my partner knows the circumstances. Being bipolar is also a pretty big secret (Mom knows but I haven't told Dad and I told her not to tell him as well). Beyond my partner, my one sibling, my AA home meeting, and my therapist, only my graduate advisor, who struggles with her own chronic invisible illnesses knows.  [info] None [info] 1518442811

iamamountaingoat [info] The diagnosis is largely based on your personal experiences and family history. If possible, your psychiatrist will talk to your immediate family members or close friends as well. There aren’t any “tests” or special medical equipment to diagnose you; the process is all discussion-based. When I was diagnosed with bipolar, my parents and I each talked to the psychiatrist separately, and as a group. I’d say it was maybe a one or two hour discussion that ended with, “Yup, you’re definitely bipolar. Now let’s talk treatment.”Getting the right medication, on the other hand, is *not* easy. Lithium, the most common drug to treat bipolar, is toxic, and has to be gradually built up to therapeutic levels in your body. The effective dosage varies from person to person, and you have to get regular blood tests to check the toxicity. Further, you have to meet with a psychiatrist to make sure the medication is working, and there’s a good chance you’ll have to experiment with different drugs before you find the winning combination. **TL;DR** Diagnosis is usually relatively quick and easy, but treatment is much more complicated.

hufflepoofs [info] When I went to seek therapy as a teenager, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder because of the meltdowns that come with autism. My psychologist never bothered to ask me any questions about my sensory issues that I told her about, especially involving food, and just instantly prescribed me anti-psychotics which made my Asperger's even worse honestly. I haven't been formally diagnosed but I have all of the characteristics to a T and any advice I read on combating issues involved with Asperger's has helped me out immensely. Plus the people who are close to me tell me they are 100% certain I have Asperger's.

I already always feel guilty but she said some stuff that really drove that home. I tried to go out to be with friends this weekend but I ended up getting a really bad fever and possibly tonsillitis so I had to take a four hour train ride back home by myself. I don't know if I can bring up other illnesses here but my OCD has been worsening recently and the lamictal I've been taking for two months now isn't doing anything for me. I'm a complete mess and I don't have anyone in my life who understands what I'm going through.My mom tells me that there are worse things to have than OCD and got angry when I told her I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My ex was the only beacon of support I had and I know she'll be better off without me so that doesn't help at all either. I constantly feel like no one I know actually likes me which puts strains on relationships with family/friends and ruined the one with my gf.I recently started giving in to my compulsions of smashing my head against walls/doors and it brings some relief because even though I know it's not right, I feel like I deserve it. I fucking hate myself and I'm getting really tired of being alive.Thanks for posting this, I've had to keep all of that to myself for a while and seeing it all in front of me made my problems feel valid, something I struggle with because of my mom.

PH-96 [info] We’re not married, so I don’t have as much right to comment this as everyone else. I’ve know my partner for over 3 years now, we’ve been dating for 9 months, it’s a semi long distant relationship and neither of us see each other as much as we like. The past 6 months of my life have been rough, but she’s always been at my side. My dad was diagnosed with cancer and I put a brave face on and acted tough for dad, but when I was in her arms again I broke down like a baby and sobbed, she held me tight and stroked my hair and never said a word. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2, was at a low point and feeling suicidal, had to go through counselling, she would wake up at 3am, do the early shift in work, and then take a train and travel to see me just so when I finished counselling, if I was upset because of it, she would be there for me. Just this month my mum had a stroke, and it was horrifyingly scary, as soon as she read my message she walked out of work (she’s always in work it seems) got on a train, and came to the hospital, gave me a hug, and stayed until midnight with me, she helped my mum into pyjamas, and again held me at night while I was upset. These are just examples of how amazing she is, but the moment I knew I wanted to marry her was seeing her sing “Part of your world” on karaoke night. She shined, and I knew right then my greatest achievement in life would be marrying her. [info] None [info] 1519085331

yaosio [info] I used to yell and scream and threaten to kill myself as a little yaosio. I had no problem physically attacking my parents, but I never damaged anything because I would feel bad knowing somebody would have to clean up the mess. I think I hated my parents as much as a little kid could hate their parents because I was an angel at school and around everybody else. My parents changed nothing and I grew out of it. A child psychologist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder, but then it turned out he wasn't actually licensed. Later in life I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a licensed psychologist.How it presents is completely different today than as a little me. I would cry at the slightest frustration and become very angry but only directed at my parents. Now I am depressed all the time and get very anxious when I am frusturated. Very particular frustrations make me angry instantly, like bad UI design.So now you know what that dude does can be an innate trait regardless of parenting. [info] 💩 poster [info] 1519295665

thomson_ashley [info] Thanks for sharing your story. I know he misdiagnosed me because I’ve had MDD for the last 11 years and within the last 6 I was diagnosed with bipolar. I was just trying to see if maybe a second opinion would be needed. I’ve also been seeing a psychologist outside of campus who is 100% certain I don’t have BPD so this experience made me laugh about the lack of professionalism with this doctor.

smalldoggobigpupper [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 after I was hospitalized for a manic episode with psychosis.

Ohthewillowwisp [info] I had a very good friend of mine in high school. I knew he was in love with me but I never thought of him in that way. He was always super supportive and kind to me and I treated him like shit because I knew he wouldnt leave. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and got on medication and it was like a lightbulb lit up. I saw just how shitty I was treating him. So I cut ties. He was too kind to ever leave and or stand up for himself. I couldn't risk going back to that so we arent friends anymore.

Shivoe [info] Holy crap! I have had issues with my bipolar and dr' s, as well as not being taken seriously about complications when I got the paregard as well.I was diagnosed with bipolar at 12, and they thought the best course of action was to rapid cycle me through meds every 2-3 weeks to see what worked instead of 6-12 weeks. They resulted in me being either extremely manic or completely suicidal and never finding a middle ground. That went on from age 12 to 16 until my parents divorced and I moved in with my father.After my second was born I got the paregard and about a week later my entire body, neck to the bottoms of my feet, was covered in massive hives and no one would believe me that it was the paregard! It took me 3 months before I found a doctor willing to remove it to see if the reaction stopped. Some even told me it was mental and they would go away if I stopped worrying about it (wtf?)After it was removed my hives went away in about 4 days. [info] None [info] 1520452978
Donutsareagirlsbff [info] When I decided I needed to see a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with bipolar and she helped me see that the abusive situation in my childhood was worse than I'd ever allowed myself to believe due to guilt and shame. I took a break from my mum for six months, went through a grieving process, got my strength and told her some things I needed to say. Long story short she was sexually abused as a child and it created a chain reaction of terrible relationships. I always knew she loved me but she put me in some very dangerous situations and neglect. She took it very well, cried a lot and apologised. I love her more for the way she handled it as well.I'm still in the process of completely being in my AD. I need to talk to my father who I haven't for six or seven years but I'm much happier and more stable now. I'm also ready after a year of being with my psych to stop seeing her and manage my medication with a GP. It's been a difficult journey but easier than the ten years of turmoil I was in before I saw someone. There's still things I need to work on in myself but I feel like a different me, a better more solid me.  [info] None [info] 1520634002
smallest_ellie [info] Totally. I'm diagnosed with bipolar as well and have never been able to have a healthy relationship very much because of me (which is something I've realised in retrospect).I feel like a sane person trapped in an insane person's body.My advice? Don't stress looking for love until you figure out how you can live with your diagnosis and be stable (as stable as is possible for you, I know it varies). Do it for you and not for a potential relationship in the future.Your relationship to yourself is the most important one you'll ever have.When you do find love - make sure to COMMUNICATE. And find someone who's willing to communicate with you.I recommend watching Lady Dynamite on Netflix if you haven't already. A crazy, absurd comedy series made by Maria Bamford who's also bipolar. It helped me a lot and it also touches on healthy relationships.Hugs! [info] Yuhua Hamasaki [info] 1520710158

KryptoTek [info] I'm the same way.  I've been diagnosed with bipolar and so experience extreme highs and lows intermittently.

Philip-Jeffries [info] I love this. It’s so accurate. I’m 35 and when I was diagnosed with bipolar at 20 I played with my meds all the time like a lot of us. One of the main reasons was I thought I wouldn’t be “me” anymore. I was afraid I’d have no sense of humor and just simply be present. That didn’t happen once I finally started finally listening to my doctor and got the right meds that worked for me. That’s the toughest part. It’s so damn hard to figure which ones and what combo will work bc everyone is different.  [info] None [info] 1520971106
mattsulli [info] I had a fiancée before I married my wife. During an alcohol withdrawal stint at a hospital I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I never sought treatment and let my behavior get worse and worse until she finally left me. I beat myself up over and over again, cutting, lashing out, drinking, spending days crying and other days going out trying to get myself killed on the streets of Baltimore. When I spent a couple of years dealing with this and getting a little better, I met my now wife. I was honest with her about my disorder but lied pretty heavily about my past. When I eventually got on some insurance plan I started seeking treatment. I became more honest with my wife about my past because I began to understand that as long as I got better I could unload the truth and she would understand. She has. Past that, getting on meds and understanding the nature of my old behaviors has allowed me to come to terms with losing a woman whom I loved dearly. I don’t know why I’m typing all of this out. I’m just saying that this will pass like ever other terrible thing that’s happened to you and you will find someone who loves and supports you for who you are. Stay strong.

sub-dural [info] I wouldn't guilt yourself so much over weed, meaning the guilt is going to contribute harder to your downward cycle than anything.  I take a lamictal and a shit load of other meds for another chronic illness.  I also use marijuana daily from the pain of inflammatory arthritis.  Marijuana has strong anti-depressant affects as well (for me).  I'm not here to say everyone with bipolar and on medication should smoke weed, it's not going to matter, but you know your body first and foremost, if weed is contributing to your downward spiral try to cut down a bit maybe?  I smoked weed all through college, a few years before I was diagnosed with bipolar, and I don't know how I would have slept without it! [info] None [info] 1521019649
Need2ventnow18 [info] I feel the same way although some days I feel like I can make it through anything. It's really up or down for me. If I'm up I'm all the way up but if I'm down I'm all the way down rock bottom. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder hence the extreme mood swings but I go to 2 types of therapy and take meds. I recently lost my 2 closest friends and my grandpa died. Also suffering from a back injury which has taken my gym life away from me. No one gets it. Hell I don't even get it, I have a "good life". Permanent job that I'm good at, my own apartment, new vehicle and am independent. I still hate myself. You are not alone. We all have problems and in this shitty world it tends to be a common occurrence for everyone but even with all the darkness there is light. Even the tiniest peak of light but I've learnt to appreciate the tiniest things. If I didn't I would be dead already. Trust me I've tried to end my life, recently too but the little peak of light lets get out of bed to work. I know everything I have just said will probably not make you feel any better because if you're down you're down, I know I am too but seek help. mental health line. doctors. whatever you feel will help because in the end no can help you if you don't want to help yourself. And I may just be a stranger online who you'll never meet and means nothing to you but I care. I care about other humans especially if I know what they're experiencing. Don't give up! Find your silver lining. Good luck I wish you all the best! Xo [info] None [info] 1521057192

pmqjune [info] Okay so for the other two people in the comments: suck my fucking ass, all he/she did was state realistic things. They're gamers, and they're often greasy. Like fries. They're fries... and they're often greasy. And just because he/she said they're probably twice as autistic, doesn't mean he/she was saying anything bad about Autism. Suck it up buttercup, you don't always have to be so sensitive about pointless shit. And to comment on this post: Thank you. I relate to this a lot. I'm a relatively intelligent person, I'm very good at communicating. I too take care of my appearance and care about myself. I'm positive, I'm not depressing to be around, and I enjoy entertaining people and conversing. However, I don't have any friends... at all. Most people would have a go-to group of close friends or something, where do I find that? I got sent to a mental hospital during the summer, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD. I had just moved to this city after visiting multiple times. I lived in its neighboring city. I know it well, so warming up to the area isn't a problem. My way of socializing is basically the same as it was before medication, just now it's a little more organized. But like I said, I'm really actually good at communicating. So it shouldn't be an issue. I know I'm not a terrible person to be around, but I never hang out with anyone. My self-esteem would be great, but because of this it isn't too good. I feel like an insider in an outsider's body... I guess. Except the body isn't really an outsider, I don't really know. It's just annoying. This isn't me being full of myself. People point out their bad traits all the time, everyone supports them. But when someone points out their good ones, suddenly they're an asshole.  [info] None [info] 1521361239

NotTheSharpestCacti [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in December 2016. To clarify, bipolar disorder is not what you see in media where I would switch moods super quick or change from angry to crying to loving in five minutes. Not that that CAN'T happen, however rapid-cycling still doesn't look very much like the media presents it. I've been on and off medication since my diagnosis, trying to find the one that works. Currently off meds, so honestly life hasn't changed that much. I get depressed for periods of time, lay in bed, don't go to class, don't eat, have no motivation to exist. And then I get manic, and spend too much money, go out and drink a little too much, sleep 2-4 hours a night, start projects I'll never finish. Not that I'm trying to down play the severity of being diagnosed with bpd, however getting a diagnosis doesn't change who I am, it just gives me an explanation for my behavior. Edit: r/bipolar exists, in case anyone ever needs any resources or understand it a little better. [info] None [info] 1521427207

unstablebitch [info] I was on Amitriptyline for migraines as well. This was about 6 months before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. I noticed I started getting WAY more depressed than usual on the Amitriptyline and then had a manic episode that lasted months..then finally after suicide attempt number 2 of the year I was hospitalized and diagnosed with Bipolar 2. The doctors at the mental hospital told me nobody with Bipolar should ever take Amitriptyline.

Pingumask [info] As a grown up man with chronic night terrors, I have many choices here. I usually wake up screaming once or twice a week. I'm so lucky to have a comprehensive and supporting wife. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, post traumatic disorder and hypnophobia (fear of sleeping). I've had many different nightmare, but the worst to me is also the one I had the most with a few variations to it :Be in my bed trying to sleep, don't see transition to sleep and thinking I'm having insomnia again, turning over and over in my bed or playing a boring game on my phone. Then I notice a figure by the door. I switch on the light and see a guy with a knife in hand. He shouts at me "Why didn't you protect us ?". He then throws the knife at a random piece of furniture and jumps at me to strangle me. As I'm struggling to push him back, I scratch his face and see he has my face. I scream in my dream and IRL too and my scream awakes me. Sometimes I scratched my own face while having this nightmare, and I now have a vertical scar in plain middle of my forehead because of it. I've been following medical and psychological therapy for a year. The meds help me alot to fall asleep and they probably helped fighting suicidal thoughts (had nightmares and insomnia for years when i finally seeked help, and what eventually got me to see a doc was when I felt a urge to crash my car for no particular reason out of general tiredness on the way back from work), but off course the drugs don't prevent nightmares. I'm at a point where hospitalisation is heavily considered cause I'm getting too many meds and my doc is afraid of getting me addicted to the meds if this goes on. This particular nightmare stopped but I'm still getting frequent less vivid nightmares. I've stopped scratching off my skin while sleeping but I still do it while awake without noticing when I'm overstressed (much less often). If you're interrested I could tell you some other of my nightmares. [info] None [info] 1521482423
abswank [info] Thanks~  Canceling the wedding was the hardest thing I've ever done.  I knew something was 'off' when we were dress searching and I just couldn't/wouldn't get excited.  (And it wasn't just my contrary nature kicking in.  I wanted to be excited, I just couldn't.)  I had to have multiple people tell me it was okay to cancel the wedding, that it didn't matter how much time and money we'd put in or how many people we'd disappoint, I had to do what was right for me.  So first I delayed it a year and then I cancelled it and used the money we'd put towards reservations to pay for a deposit on a new place.  I don't think I've ever been my best friend - it's always been easier to care about other people more than myself.  Probably how I got in to a situation like this, lol.  A lot of this was made more difficult because I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last year.  (Which of course was used against me later.  See his comment about mood swings.  Never used words like that until after the diagnosis.)  For the first time I ever I feel like I have something to talk about in therapy without being asked.  Trying to think of all of this as a blessing in disguise.  I just don't know how I'll get over the knowledge that 6 years of 'true love' was a lie.  Like, how do you even begin to trust again after something like that?  We had so many mutual friends.  He was the roommate of my best friend and her now husband.  Never knowing which parts were genuine and which parts were his illness is probably what will always get me.  Thanks for taking the time to read/listen.  It really means a lot.  My own mother, a self professed 'empath', somehow has no clue about what I'm going through and even asked, "What do you have to be stressed about?" When I mentioned how I was losing my hair because of stress.  Like, WTF?? [info] A work in progress :)  [info] 1521554654
xviriditasx [info] Antipsychotics can help a lot, but if your psychosis is caused by a mood episode, as it is with a lot of people with bipolar disorder, treating the mood episode will alleviate symptoms of psychosis. This can include medications like mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and some various meds prescribed off label. I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder before later being diagnosed as schizoaffective bipolar type. I struggled to find a therapist who understood psychosis well and could actually help me. I had to learn how to be my own therapist, teaching myself how to do reality checks and manage psychotic symptoms. I’ve set some hard rules for myself - for example, any time I hear a disembodied voice, I remind myself that it is my own thoughts that I am perceiving inaccurately. Under no circumstances will a disembodied voice actually talk to me. It’s all me.  [info] None [info] 1521565547
kissablyliterate [info] I recommend calling and speaking with your potential schools' mental health services department; most colleges have one. They can tell you about the services they offer, which usually include free therapy and granting accommodations. Accomodations could include things like a single room, or having a reserved seat at the very back of the room, and so on.I was diagnosed with bipolar during my fourth year. I absolutely failed every class my fall semester before I was diagnosed in December. I reached out to my program director and the campus mental health center. I was retroactively withdrawn from the entire fall semester, so it did not affect my GPA. I was able to maintain my status as a full time student while taking only three classes. My fifth year I lived in a single. I went to therapy at the MHC every week for a year and a half and never paid a dime. Without these accommodations and support, I absolutely would have flunked out. Having support from the college itself can be the key :) [info] None [info] 1522101643

MarionCotesworthHaye [info] So true. When I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 at age 24, I was in the height of my manic state. I was also at my most creative, hard-working, and productive. The meds saved my life, but I’ve never gotten that spark back. There’s this aspect of bipolar called hypomania (not to be confused with the manic state, hypermania) which many of us strive for. It’s a state where you’re just elevated enough to do amazing things, but not so elevated that you turn manic. It’s a delicate balance and hard to achieve. You feel so good when you’re hypomanic because you’re essentially riding a natural high, but it can snap into a manic state out of nowhere if you don’t monitor your emotions. Carrie is hypomanic 60% of the time, depressed 20% of the time (when she drinks, for example) and manic 20% of the time (when she’s saving the world, but also sleeping with terrorists and harming Frannie.)

macnsleaze [info] You assumed I was here for the generalized reasons that the stigma taught you....because I need conflict...because I've been diagnosed with bipolar?? If you didn't have my medical information, you couldn't jump to that conclusion (in order to use my diagnosis against me, and discredit what I'm saying). That's a cheap shot tbh. You may not personally create stigma by sharing your experience, but think about the bigger picture. The problem when you contribute to a community cesspool of negative bipolar associations--on a media site which is accessed by thousands of people reinforcing the association between "bipolar" and "hard to deal with," marketed not toward actual people with bipolar, but for their neurotypical SOs to chit chat and crowdsource whiny stories between strangers online (if they're all "begging for help" as they claim, they need professional help rather than advice from faceless amateur internet users). It is a fact that enumerated in the name of the sub is the term "bipolar," containing a thread full of miserable stories. Widening the trench between "us and them." That is where the stigma comes from. It shouldn't be taken personally, but like every social movement, bipolar stigma can be muted (but it seems all of them secretly enjoy the superiority *not being the one with stigma* gives them in the relationship. Usually under the guise: *i love them so much, I'm such a good SO, look at everything I do for them, and I'm sure they're a good person inside but their crazy ass sucks, they always yell at me and break up with me*). But within the bipolar population, there is an average ratio of normal functioning/low functioning individuals, but everyone here refuses to believe it. But believing the truth is hard when you belong to and habitually scroll through again, a community cesspool of negativity (under the guise of good intentions). You all seem to agree that *everyone* who is bipolar is crazy, when that is far from reality. I mourn for everyone like me who will continue to be prejudiced against until this is finally understood.EDIT: Soon this kind of sub will be as frowned upon as racist ones. Imagine a sub of parents complaining that their daughter is dating a black guy. The excuses are similar, they sound right and are accepted by those giving them, but to the ones they victimize, they are flimsy, creepy and wrong. Don't contribute to what essentially is propaganda, no matter how well you convince yourself it's innocuous, let alone beneficial. [info] None [info] 1522260079

kattbug989 [info] 20.I was very musically proficient in high school. It earned me a shot at a statewide recognized concerto spot (i was a finalist), a professional gig in a community band, and a whole bunch of miscellaneous prestige as a high schooler. When i got to college, i got a combined $36,000 scholarship due in part to that talent. I ultimately gave it up/simply couldn’t handle college in my mental state. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a hospital stay that caused me to drop out. I’m starting from scratch at a community college, still unsure of what I want to do. I would say my biggest accomplishment is getting through these two years of hell. I went from an apartment i simply couldn’t afford (i was working 26 hours a week with an unemployed boyfriend), using drugs to cope, and having mental break down after breakdown... to a steady full time job, paying for college classes for the summer out of pocket, and a wedding date on the horizon. I’m currently moving into a 2 bedroom apartment with my fiancé and our best friend, and i couldn’t be happier. My job is good, there’s money in the bank, food on the table, and none of those drugs in sight (aside from my bipolar meds, which are also part of my accomplishment). I’ve reached my first point of stability in my adult life, and i couldn’t be happier with myself and my life. [info] None [info] 1522291181
divermom74 [info] This is my Face Book coming-out post from March 10.“Here goes, humor me and hang in till the end…A few months ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The decision to share has been tough, scary. Blythewood is a small town with a BIG baseball park. But a couple years ago, I posted about how desperately our country needs to take mental illness seriously. So here I am shaking, heart pounding, fighting tears, so afraid of the stigma yet driven by that stigma. People post on FB all the time about their diagnoses to ask for prayers, raise awareness, vent, tell their stories (or those of family members), celebrate. Cancer, Alzheimer’s, autoimmune disorders, lupus, MS, epilepsy, diabetes, major surgeries, treatments, successes, resignation, acceptance. Now it’s my turn. Toward the end of the summer, I began to suspect that something wasn’t right, so Davis and I talked with my doctor. Fast forward through many appts, a complete psych eval, and BAM I have bipolar 1 disorder. It's pretty scary to learn that you have an illness that’s life-altering, life-long, life-threatening. One that by society’s standards means you’re crazy. I became super dependent on Davis. I didn’t trust myself. I found myself clinging to him to make me feel safe. My doctor started treatment with meds, making gradual additions and dosage tweaks since then. There’ve been numerous ups and downs and I’ve ruined many things that should have been great fun with friends. But now we know why. I’m in a good place with my meds. I feel like me again. I have the best hubby and friends ever. They’ve seen me at my worst and have never judged me. Instead they protected me, loved me when I was unlovable. I know it’ll rear its ugly head again, but we’ll handle it. I don’t want pity, I don’t want anyone on eggshells around me, afraid they’re going to “set me off.” What I want is awareness and understanding as opposed to fear and labels. So I’ll take this diagnosis as part of me, I’ll educate anyone who’ll listen or read my posts, I’ll be myself because I have a purpose and I remember that now. I’ll take this bipolar thing and run with it.” [info] None [info] 1522440878

eilletane [info] Really like this question. You've started a very interesting conversation. Especially at this time when most of the working adults were raised by traditional and conservation parents.   &amp;nbsp;  For myself, I don't intend to have kids. And I do think this is due to my upbringing.   &amp;nbsp;  Quick life story:   Divorced parents, father was emotionally and physically abusive to my sister, my mom and me. Lived with my mother for most of my life. She's very calculative and paranoid. Being the younger and "surprise" child, I always had to work to get attention from my mom. Sis was book smart, I was street smart. But we all know that doesn't matter in Singapore.  &amp;nbsp;  Mother adopted some emotional and physical abuse parenting from dad. I was rebellious because I wanted attention and I was bad at school. Mom and I had a really abusive relationship till i was 17 when I was diagnosed with bipolar after a psychotic episode. After that, things calmed down a bit and we understood each other much more.  I moved out, with much reluctance from my mother. (Again another violent argument) and after things died down, everything soared real high up. We became friends.   &amp;nbsp;  On the other side is my elder sister. Brought up by the same parent, she was a very obedient and smart child. However, she never got to the rebellious stage, till she was an adult. And as of currently, her r/s with mom is quite terrible.   &amp;nbsp;  I'm grateful for all that has happened. It made me a better person. All that ugliness and violence bonded my mother and I in a way I never thought existed. However, I would never want that to ever happen between myself and my children.  [info] None [info] 1522668991
Affectionate_Leading [info] Yes, absolutely. Not that all happenings of mental illnesses are caused by demons, but I'm sure some are. Also, I'm not religious myself, but angels, demons, psychics, Intuition, Twin Flames, the Divine, are all Spiritual things, which is way different because they all contribute to the Truth which is unwritten, but witnessed. With religion, it seems the paradigm is often that it's written, but rarely witnessed, if ever. Anyway, the demon, or demons, that I'm dealing with, keep causing me to feel sad. I was diagnosed with bipolar, I think 5 years ago, maybe 6, and at this point it's not even a problem anymore. I know the demonic influence is what's causing my sadness at this juncture of my life. The only thing I don't know exactly is why it was put on me in the first place. [info] Claircognizance [info] 1522686970
IzThisMyLife [info] Ok this is a long one...... ready?TLDR at bottom. Hello I just want to say I'm so sorry you are going through this. I cannot imagine what it is like. Just remember you are doing the best you can and you're doing it for her father. It takes a strong woman to stick with someone after all of that most women would not be able to handle so many years with these issues from his daughter. I for one would be furious but I know what it's like for someone to leave because you have a problem child. So if nobody has told you or if he has not yet thanked you for the sacrifice and the effort that you are making I just want to say that I've noticed it and you should be proud of yourself for even trying. Reading this makes my step daughters look like angels. Even though they are truly good girls they are 18 years old and 21 so it's only a matter of time before they start being a little reckless. But this is okay with me and I especially don't want their father to think that I don't want them around.You guys are good parents and you're doing what you can. I also grew up with good parents although my father died when I was 14 my mother did her very best and I can truly say that she raised us very well. However that didn't stop my older sister from being a stripper and it didn't stop me from leaving the house at 15 because I wanted to party all night with my friends and take pills. I'm sure this is not what you want to hear and maybe I'll be singing a different tune when my little girls become teenagers. My youngest is 7 and my oldest is 9. My 9 year old is a hell-raiser she's been since she was a toddler and she is exactly like me and I am expecting the worse. I love my mother and I got arrested I used drugs I tried to kill myself the whole 9. She did what she could I've been in the psych ward like 11 times. But nothing seemed to help. I think when a girl gets a certain age she wants to have sex with boys and party and experiment with drugs as I did. There was no reason for me to do such a thing although I was diagnosed with bipolar Mania. I can say even after I got clean which was many years later I was still sort of crazy. Definitely emotionally unstable. I saw a psychiatrist and I tried medication and sometimes that's necessary. However I decided that I did not want to be a slave to another drug just because it was acceptable in the eyes of society. But that is my experience. What I'm just trying to tell you is that sometimes no matter what efforts you make or how hard you try you need to understand that it's not a mistake that you made especially since she's only been living with you since she's 9. I know this is tough for you guys but I think for your own sanity you guys need to let her be and I promise you she will come to her senses you just need to be there for her when she truly needs you. But at her age she's an Unstoppable Force. At least that is what I was and that is what I believe because I truly felt that nothing could stop me. No matter who I hurt. I was young and stupid.The issues with her lying though concern me also the incidents with the bloody sheets and pads in her room those are definitely signs that something is wrong. I suspect she has some type of mental illness.  but I'm not a doctor so I shouldn't comment. I think if you're truly desperate your last resort should try a psychiatrist which I think you may have reached that point. But if not, you need to just let her be she will go out and party and then she will struggle to find a place to live she will be hungry and only then will she appreciate all that you guys have given her. And then she will probably come back and try to be the good girl that you have been trying to raise her to be however there's going to be many f*** ups more lies and definitely stealing if she doesn't have a job and she's broke and hungry and living couch to couch. I know it sucks to worry and wonder where your child is but you have to remember she's not a child anymore and sometimes you have to let them learn the hard way which is the only way that I learned it sucks and I went through a lot and I feel sometimes that I could have been killed from being on my own at such a young age but what's important is that I learned from it and I'm an amazing daughter and I help my mother with everything that I can and it surely never thought that I would be the person that I am today I would even call myself emotionally stable and everything. But it took a long road I'm 33 years old and I can finally say that my mom is probably no longer worrying about me or what I'm doing. Now it's my turn to worry about her. Her time will come unfortunately nobody knows when. This may be bad advice but in my opinion you have two other girls that you have to raise and you and your husband cannot be at your wit's end because it's going to affect the lives of your other girls. Talk to your husband and either do the psychiatrist or stop pushing a girl who doesn't want to be pushed and will eventually push back and even ruin your lives possibly. Like I said be there for her when she truly needs you she will reach out to you when she's in trouble I promise you that. But until then it's going to be tough but you have to let her go.TLDR: the girls going to do whatever she wants anyways no matter if she's 15 or 19. She's got recklessness on her agenda and nobody's going to stop her. Let her go now and let her learn her lesson the hard way in order to save your sanity. [info] None [info] 1522714262
Wallaby_Way_Sydney [info] I was diagnosed with BPD a few years before I ever got addicted to hard drugs. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar in rehab. It's likely that I have both, unfortunately. [info] Why I Do Dis? [info] 1522773549
crazyrhythm [info] I've got both. I'm 36 now and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 11 years old. About a year-and-a-half ago, I was diagnosed with Lyme disease because I kept having upper respiratory infections.It's obnoxious because sometimes I have energy with my bipolar disorder but the Lyme disease makes me completely exhausted so I don't want to do anything. And vice versa. It's so cyclical and predictable and yet each time it happens it really sucks! [info] None [info] 1522843807
MySpinMove95 [info] I honestly don't think they were doing it for the good of my child. I have no criminal record, no drug issues...they flat out said I was depressed and that makes me unable to care for my toddler, and I don't deserve him. Mind you....none of this is true. They went through my old Facebook messages with my ex (and sadface reacted to me saying how much i miss my son at like 3 in the morning.. on my dead exes account, like a week after he died) and found out that I had an abortion (my own and my exes desires, nobody was forced and we were both totally okay with it). They tried to say that makes me an unfit mother. They also used the fact that I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a couple years back, and was anorexic when I was a *teenager* against me. Mind you, I go to a therapist, and am on medication for my bipolar 2, and they knew this. Being depressed doesn't mean you deserve to have your son taken from you. Also, another thing that makes me think the "best interests" argument is bullshit. A few days before my ex died, he sent me a message saying he's doing fine for the time being, but if anything happens to him, he knows he'll be well taken care of with my boyfriend and i. He sent a 3 paragraph message to me on Facebook thanking me for giving him a son, loving him so much, and being a kind mother to him. I KNOW his parents saw that bc of the random 3 am sadface reaction. I have never done anything but love my son and try to give him a "normal" life. I'm not perfect, but they made up lies and tried to put my life under a microscope to take him away from me. Shit, the courts even try to reunite crackheads with their parents...yet I'M unfit and THEY'RE the best when all they do is park him in front of an ipad... ok. I've lost a sister, and when she died, my own father tried to take her kids from their biological dad. You'd be surprised at how common this bullshit is. It's all centered around selfishness.

SBabybearBB [info] Ohh the jobs I've lost. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar I would randomly quit jobs. Suddenly stop caring and show up an hour late everyday just because I was laying in bed, and eventually get fired. When the stress hits me, shit hits the fan. So I've just learned to be more self aware and when things are becoming overwhelming, take a time out. I've taken 'mental health days' at work, gone for a long drive, gone to a beach or walk a trail at a park. The struggle is real. Its weird hearing people talk about this issue, I've always felt so alone. Thanks for sharing everyone!  [info] None [info] 1522979506

princessentropy [info] Welcome!! That's awesome! You should be so proud of yourself for rescuing, well, you! :DI was diagnosed with bipolar II, and honestly, the best advice I have is write down your feelings. It really took down my emotional spirals because it felt like I was able to experience it and release it. It's been a few months since I've had a major episode, and that means a lot considering it'd be daily and for hours. I find writing also helps you hone in on your wants and needs, little by little you'll be able say I want comfort or the feeling of security or whatever you're desiring. Good luck and welcome again!

miss-septimus [info] I don't mean to sound as if I'm excusing my behavior entirely, but I was diagnosed with bipolar II and OCD. One of the symptoms which make it difficult for me not to try and buy anything for skin care is hypomania (and also, the hoarding with my OCD). One of the minor things which occurs is impulsive buying (and consequently, hoarding) skin care products. For instance, this week, I bought a Mamonde toner, the Mizon watery cream jumbo jar, CosRX patches, and a sonic brush. Two weeks ago, I bought Niacinamide from The Ordinary and the CosRX Gentle Salicylic Wash. What helps me, apart from therapy and medication, of course, is to constantly ask myself why I do this. I noticed that I only use 70% of what I buy. The rest just makes me feel 'safe.' I also write down every monetary transaction that I make, and remind myself that I've been making progress since being diagnosed six years ago. [info] 26 | Oily/Acne-prone | NC30 [info] 1523130208
crazyrhythm [info] Adults who understand mental illness. That's who you go to. They will help you find what you need to take care of YOU. Besides that, wouldn't you like to vent to someone who will listen and provide useful feedback?I'm telling you this because I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 11. I'm 36 now and I had very few friends because they couldn't relate to me and were never sure how to respond to me. We tend to think that all adults are bad, but most of us are willing to help.I'm an adult. It's weird. [info] None [info] 1523214476
0aabceh [info] Relationships and pursuing relationships leave us vulnerable and sometimes feeling stupid comes with the territory. It happens to most people, it's definitely happened to me. I am sorry your "friend" or her friend "set you up" but it sounds like you made the right move steering clear of them. The "shy" guy sounds like a good one to have dodged as well. Any guy who is going to interrogate you and then ask for a secret relationship is a hard pass and has some weird complex or something. How would you explain that to someone? Well in a way you kind of just explained it to me (us) and it doesn't sound all that bizarre or out of the ordinary. Sometimes it takes a long time for us to meet the people we are supposed to, maybe some of us won't meet them. Maybe there are no people we're "meant" to meet and it's just dumb luck you come across someone you connect with. Maybe we can influence our luck by changing our scenario or actions. It's hard to say, it would be awesome if there was a guide with procedures and we could just follow that and BOOM Boyfriend! or BOOM Girlfriend! I think the best we can try to do is be honest with ourselves (you are) and try to look forward to the next opportunity and be prepared.I can empathize with the idea of feeling undesirable because of mental health issues. My dad killed himself, I am diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, "insanity" is rife in my family. So firstly, how the hell could anyone ever be attracted or find something so damaged appealing or desirable? Two, even if I was in that situation how could I in good conscience have a biological child knowing how fucking insane I have been? Those questions still really bother me now and I don't have answers. Most of my relationships now are brief because if I find someone who seems attracted to me I lose attraction to them because I hate myself, why would they like me?  [info] None [info] 1523335790
weirdosansthebeardo [info] Wow! I didn’t realize how this is not so uncommon! I’m sorry you had to go through all that. I lived through a similar situation. I’m in my 30s now and have my own almost pre-teen daughter. She’s the reason I don’t date and I try to raise her to know the joy and hope in life. She’s had her own troubles with her dad and myself but we’re far from that now :) I wonder if mental disorders amplify these occurrences. I have been diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD. Usually, when I can’t explain something scientifically, I end up blaming it on the disorder and calling it a night on the subject. Maybe I should embrace it...? [info] None [info] 1523394671
mjb8989 [info] StrawberryBlondeHaze I really can relate. I lost a lot of my friends to drugs after I decided to finally walk away from that life. It kills me to see where some of them are at now. But that’s where you just have to remember to care for yourself before anythingIt doesn’t matter how hard your goal is, you can 100% do it :) just take it slow and go day by day in the right direction to get you there. As long as you continue to progress, you will get to where you need to be. And if it’s not where you WANT, that just means you set yourself for something better that you never even expected, and I’m saying that from experience.Okay just a heads up StrawberryBlonde, what I just typed is long as f$¢€, but I did it because I just have this gut feeling I needed to share this story with you. So, you’ve been warned!I was in retail for 10 years in the wireless industry. Started at WalMart, went to work at some cell phone kiosk in a Sam’s Club, left there to work for Sprint, then AT&amp;T and then Best Buy. I stayed at Best Buy for 5 years and moved up to assistant manager of a small wireless store in the mall (I was previously a supervisor in a regular store) through the years, retail has just consistently drained me. I’m a musician and have always been very creative when it came to writing music. I always wanted to either be in a band and just tour all over, or work somewhere in the media. Well, I got in a band. One day, I decided to call my local radio station and ask if my band could come in and do an interview on air lol I mean, why not? Well holy shit the guy actually told me he would do it. So we did this really funny interview on air promoting a show coming up and even had a song played. The host of the radio show and I kept in touch. Come to find out, we had a whole lot in common. Networking, networking, networking.So eventually, he knew how much I loved music and media. Couple years later, the band broke up and I decided not to give it up and do my own solo stuff. Well sh!t, long story short I had my music regularly played on that same radio station on a weekend night show, did an interview with a station based out of Florida (I live in Virginia) had articles written up about my music, so an underground musician making and producing his own music in his apartment, things blew up way more than I thought. Let word, “producing”.My buddy from the radio station ended up getting fired (he was getting sick of the corporate attitude his bosses had and uh, had an episode) he took a job at a different broadcast station in the area and he was given his own morning show on a classic rock station. People in the area love this guy, so they followed him wherever he went. Bam, the show is a hit. Well one day we are talking (my solo stuff has kind of slowed down at this point, I started recording just for the fun of it) he asked what I had been doing lately and I had just finished recording a cover of Come Together from The Beatles, but it was like a way heavier version lol. I sent it over to him, and he loved it. Apparently, he didn’t know I produced my own stuff too. So he told me tomorrow morning, meet him at the studio at 4am and that we’re about to have some fun. Say whaaaaat.So for a few months, I produced different plugs for his show and occasionally would be on air with him taking calls for listeners whenever there was a fun, debatable topic (like where’s the weirdest place you ever threw up.. yeah lol) it was so much fun.. but then he got offered to move to Seattle and work on The Delilah Show.. womp.This whole time I was an assistant manager at Best Buy lol as much fun I was having, i was EXHAUSTED. Until I another guy from the old station my band interviewed at contacted me, “hey, I heard you’re in sales and have been wanting to work in the media?” The following month, I quit my job and started working for iHeartMedia.“Holy sh!t, my dream just came true! This is amazing! I have the job I’ve always wanted!”***3 months later***“Oh my god, I hate this job and my entire life.”The job I thought I always wanted turned out to be the job I hated more than any other job I ever had. Guess what happened? I lost my job, during the same time I was trying to plan my wedding, during the same time I was diagnosed with bipolar II and taking different meds every two weeks. I wanted to die. I wanted to die so bad, that I ended up staying in a mental hospital for 5 days after coming close to attempting suicide until I talked to my wife.I ended up back at Best Buy, but not a manager. I was a part time sales associate because they had no other available positions. My pay had almost been cut in half. I loved Best Buy, but I ended up hating it while I was there because management changed and they knew my experience, so they would take advantage of me to do work that I wasn’t getting paid to do. I felt like the biggest waste of life. I truly, 100% hated myself.Then one day, my old boss from Sprint calls me, who I haven’t talked to in years. “Hey man, I hope things are going well. I’m working for a new company and one of our partners are hiring for a position that I thought you’d really fit into.” Well okay, that sounded cool. I tightened my resume up and sent it to the email address he gave me. The next day I had an interview over the phone. The next week I had an interview over Skype, a few days later, one more phone interview that lead to an offer. Today, I’m working the most unexpected job I never thought I’d be able to have. I’m a territory manager for a company called Mosaic, who has a contract with a cell phone brand called tracfone, who’s accounts I manage are all in Wal-Marts. Talk about a vicious circle. I manage 54 stores across Virginia, drive around all day, visit stores for about an hour each and be on my way. They pay for my gas, they pay for my food if I’m staying out of town and they pay for my hotel. Once every month, I get to stay at VA Beach for 3 days in an oceanfront hotel. And financially, I’m making double the amount I made at iHeart. The best job I could ever ask for at this time in my life was the last thing I ever expected.This is in NO one way me trying to brag about anything. The only reason I’m telling you this and so much in detail is because I believe this can happen to anyone and everyone. Things connect together in the most strangest ways, we just have to keep our eyes and ears open so we don’t miss it. StrawberryBlonde (if that is your real name ;) ) you can be anything you want, and if not, you’re going to become the best version of yourself that you never even knew was possible. Trust me, it’ll will fall into place. Just know there will always be a struggle. I know this job I have now wont last forever. I also know eventually, I will struggle again. But I will survive, and just like I thought the band was my dream, and then working on radio as my dream, and then iHeartMedia was my dream... at some point, you realize it’s not worth wanting the “dream” when you’re always going to wake up eventually. Appreciate today, have faith in tomorrow. Alright, that’s all I got lol   [info] None [info] 1523399819

More than anything, I would like to confide in my best friend that I pushed away a long time ago, because I miss them and they didn't deserve that. I have a feeling there's a certain etiquette to letting someone in on the condition of your mental health (and probably the sooner the better) but I just haven't figured out a way to tell them without coming across as *wanting* to be a victim.

SmellsLikeLemons [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 20 years ago. You never get over it. Cognitive behaviour therapy worked for me but took many years to realise what I was doing.I don't take drugs for it anymore but I still smoke weed. It's my down time and it helps me sleep. Better sleep means I'm better able to be aware of and moderate my behaviour. I do not and won't take uppers and I never get drunk.I hated the drugs. Especially anti-psychotics. I felt like a zombie.Despite this (or maybe because of this!), I'm married, have kids and have a high powered job. I threw myself into cycling and I'm insanely fit and still compete.

BloomingNebula [info] ...I won’t. I understand your point [pulls arm away from your neck] it was *very* wrong of him to not help.Lee: I thought you two could handle it by yourselves. [glares at king]Nebula: But, it doesn’t mean he deserves death. Something inside of me snapped when you threatened him. It was because I grew up in an octarian household. I was in the same place when that attack happened. I ran, and ran away from inkopolis to just escape... until I collapsed. I woke up in a cabin, one with a male octoling named Gabriel Picaro. I tried to run but he told me that I might get killed again... Years later he protected me from multiple shots.. he told me that “you should always be willing to listen to the other side of the story”... he died on the spot. The soldiers pitied me and left... Gabriel was a very kind man, similar to Ika. After that incident, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder due to my tendency to become a completely different person every time someone was racist towards the octolings... I never forgave the inklings for what they did to Gabriel... hell, I still have that side today... I’m truly sorry that you were the receiving end on one of my personality switches. That’s why I ordered a soldier to send a letter to you about your racism when you proclaimed that “octolings were bitches”. I didn’t want to lash out... What is wrong with me..?

neuroticweasel [info] AS a kid, I suffered quite a bit from mental illness. A lot of messed up stuff happened, and it generally affected my entire family. As the oldest child, I was pretty out of control, and had several behavioral problems. I ended up being hospitalized at a children's hospital.Going back to what I realized now, my family is closer because of how we had to deal with me, we can see the same patterns in my siblings. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. My brother also had bipolar, but it helped that I went through it first.Back to the matter at hand with you, talk to your parents, as they are the ones who can get you the help you need. If you can't do that right away there are hotlines out there for you to call if you need anonymous help, even if you are a minor. If you are in the States, Crisis Hotline should be able to help you quite a bit. EDIT: Read your post to my wife, she recommended if you talk to your parents, they can reach out to the local Children &amp; Youth agency for help with aid, financial services, and counselling programs.TL;DR if you need help gathering courage to talk to your parents, anonymous hotlines will help, even if you are a minor.

burawura [info] Hi Shane my name is Joe and I'm 39 I was diagnosed with bipolar around age 22 and haven't ever been diagnosed with ASD although I am fairly certain I should be.  The mood changes you have sound like what I go through too.  I think alot of it is loneliness and although it is hard for people like us to find others to talk to it is also imperative that we do so.  So keep it up! Glad you posted here.

Oakland_Raiders [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and ADHD 8 years ago. I have done ADA paperwork for accommodation in college and I have received treatment consistently since my diagnoses maintaining a record of my disability and my belonging to a protected group.I am a teacher, my principal and vice-principal are egotistical, control freaks who have been trying to make my life hell and push me out since October. The way they have gone about this has left a trail of inconsistency, contract violations, and unjustifiable treatment. Had I submitted ADA paperwork in August, I would have more than sufficient evidence to prove I was harassed. However, up until I turn in my paperwork on Monday, I have been nothing but a white male in their eyes, but that doesn't mean I haven't had protected status the entire time, they just didn't know about it.I want to know if I can claim I was harassed while having protected status, not necessarily because of it.

off10high [info] I'm sure this will get burried. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 23. The constant stirring thoughts have long caused me troubles with sleeping and insomnia. Sleep deprivation can cause hallucinations after about 3 days of no sleep. I decided to seek out help and admitted myself to a local hospital for treatment. It had been so long since I had slept that during a session with a nurse her skin began to sink into her face until it became a skull. At which point she addressed me and asked if I was ok. It sounds metal but I  would have been much better off with out that mental image. [info] None [info] 1524495722
Call_me_Cassius [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (among other things) in college and my psych ordered a bunch of different scans and shit because it was so weird to have it without any family history.

two__sheds [info] I started taking responsibility for my actions and how they affect other people.I have a long history of shitty behaviour.  When I was in my early 20s, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and BPD, among other things.  I fell into a trap that I see many people with mental illnesses or personality disorders fall into.  All of a sudden there was a reason for everything!  If I hurt those around me, it wasn't my fault, it was my illness. What I really needed was for everyone to understand why I was acting the way I was. If they were upset with me it was their fault for not researching my illnesses and understanding my behaviour.Unsurprisingly, that didn't work out so well. My family stopped taking to me, I lost most of my friends and my then-fiancé started threatening to leave me if I didn't at least try to sort my shit out.  At some point, something clicked: my brain might be broken, and that's not my fault, but I don't get a pass on shitty behaviour because of it.  It wasn't up to everyone else to put up with my bullshit, it was up to me to minimize how much my disorders affected everyone around me.  That was the big turning point for my life.Tips for doing it yourself: recognize that explanations are not excuses. When something goes wrong, take steps to try to keep it from happening again.  You might not be perfect, but with practice you can keep the slip ups to a minimum.  People are much more willing to forgive you if they see real effort being put forth. [info] None [info] 1524537132
alexandria819 [info] There are different types of bipolar disorders. I am diagnosed with bipolar type 2, manic depressive. Which means I have the highs and lows that are part of bipolar, but they aren't as extreme. I have more lows than highs, but you might not notice as easily unless you were around me all the time. Tyler may be the same way, I'm not sure. It seems like Jenelle and Amber have the more manic high side of bipolar, which is telltale for the outbursts, anger and such. [info] None [info] 1524578822

smalldoggobigpupper [info] I was staying up until 5AM writing in my Google Docs thinking I had uncovered the mysteries of life. I thought I was psychic and so were several people around me, and I shared my revelations with my dad. He thought my behavior was bizarre and decided to take me into the psychiatric assessment office for an evaluation. When I was in the ER, my heart was beating at a rate of 115 beats a minute and my EKG was abnormal. I was in the hospital for two weeks and put on various meds, and that was when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  [info] Bipolar 1 [info] 1524680526
asocialwarrior [info] Hi there! I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15, but my symptoms had been visible a year earlier. Uni wasn't difficult until my very last year (this academic year), and my downward spiral started last semester when I was dealing with a sad break up. Towards the end of last semester, I was very bad and decided to stop taking my meds because I felt like they weren't "curing" me after all these years (which was a huge lie that my illness persuaded me into swallowing because I had been stabilised since being on meds). I was well-surrounded and always have been, but gosh I was a pain in the arse to deal with. I was hurt and had a hard time trusting people, even my closest friends and my family. I refused to be fished out of the abyss. I started drinking just so I could pass out instead of sobbing myself to sleep. I started smoking so that I could just feel something. I stopped booking and going to my psychiatric appointments. And guess what? It was the dumbest decision my whole life! I realised how much it was affecting me and my trust circle. Everything was shit. My depressive episode was way longer than my hypomanic phase and I couldn't bear it. I wanted so badly to feel joy again, even if it was just two seconds. This semester has been shitty and my marks have suffered because of my stubbornness. I ended up being transported to Montreal Gen for suicidal ideationat some point. I have however recently resumed my meds (switched from Seroquel XR to IR) and seeing my psychiatrist, in addition to seeing a therapist for the first time my entire life. I have never been better honestly, but I have just realised that I started recovering at the very last moment of my BA. Somehow I have stopped caring about my grades and academic performance. I don't know why. Grades used to matter a lot to me and I would just fight until my last breath to get the grade I wanted/thought I deserved. But somewhere in my struggle, I lost my interest in everything and got on my way to recovery land at the very end. I don't regret the late realisation/recovery though. I know right now I'm standing in a war zone, but I'm happy to finish my degree and I'm happy with myself. I'm happy to have learnt to take care of myself, even though it's just very simple things. Just remember that you have the agency to choose to get out of the mess. It's okay to make baby steps and it's okay to fall the first few times. I know McGill can be ruthless and unhelpful and sometimes you have to seek outside help (Suicide Action saved my life, but you can also call crisis centres like Le Transit or Tracom - Le Transit has been particularly great in my experience). Free group therapies at Revivre or Maison St Jacques are also great resources if you speak French, or if you're on Blue Cross insurance, you could use Empower Me which is a free 24/7 counselling resource (http://studentcare.ca/rte/en/McGillUniversityundergraduatestudentsSSMU_EmpowerMe_EmpowerMe).

garbagetrain [info] The mixing up words thing is really weird and I still haven’t completely figured it out, but I think it mostly happens during psychotic episodes. It happens other times too, but much more subtly.I was diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD at the same time when I was 22 and started taking Lamictal. Then I started taking Adderall about two months later. The insomnia should go away after you get used to taking it regularly. When I’m not taking it regularly I have to make sure that I take it early enough in the day that it won’t keep me up. One bad night of sleep is enough to trigger mania for me so sleep is extremely important for me.I also felt that my brain was “frozen” and this continued for over a year after starting medication. For me, we think it is psychosis. One of my doctors thinks I have schizoaffective, instead of Bipolar 1 w/psychosis which is my official diagnosis.I have also noticed that certain foods make my brain scrambled. Like I have to be really careful what I eat before I go to work or do anything important because I literally cannot function sometimes because of it.Don’t end it. I have been soooo close so many times and the manic episode that got me diagnosed was the worst thing that I have ever experienced in my life, but medication really helped. I still want to die sometimes but it’s nowhere near as bad as it used to be. My life improved so much since getting on medication. I’m like a completely different person now.Stick it out until you can get medication :\) [info] None [info] 1524964066

FusRoDontdothat [info] I've never been on adderal, I do have some kind of add, but not diagnosed. My family just thought I was a forgetful child. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder though.Well anyways, back when I was struggling with BPD, what money I didn't spend on rent went to beer and weed. I was always with a bad crowd. One day, were all hanging out at my place, and this guy whips out a big bag of meth. we're all partying, and I just want to get fucked up, so when he offered me some, I said sure.Now the point here is, I was expecting a high, I was expecting a burst of energy, I was expecting to get fucked up. Everyone else was tweaking, but not me, the effects I got from it are the same that I've heard of adderall.My brain slowed down which is rare for me, I had perfect concentration, I didn't even feel like partying anymore. I saw my keyboard(piano) across the room, plugged it in, threw my headphones on and went at it. That was around 11pm. The next time I looked at the clock, it was 7:30am and everyone had left. I was just in the zone playing piano, so concentrated on it that nothing else existed.Basically what I'm saying is, when you have add or ADHD and do amphetamines, you're going to get the same kind of effects whether its meth or adderall(which contains amphetamines). So essentially, they are the same thing. They may be two different substances, but they both affect the body in a similar fashion. Adderall is made to help people with add or ADHD concentrate, but if you do meth with add, you're going to get that same concentration adderall would give you.Now, I don't condone drug abuse(unless its pot), but have you ever done meth or adderall?

boxer21 [info] I have boxed for 20 years, competed for 7.  I competed at the National Golden Gloves in 2004 losing in the second round to Shawn Porter’s older brother.  I always struggled with competition.  The pressure I put on myself would lead me into a dark downward spiral.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple of years ago.  I still box nearly everyday (I’m 36).  I’m a good fighter and it’s heartbreaking to feel like my talent is going to waste, but mental illness fucks you very hard.  I’ve learned to just box for fun but I still take it very seriously.  I think I’m actually a better fighter simply because I don’t have that pressure on me and feel I can be more creative with my style.  I fly out to LA three to four times a year to workout at the Wildcard.  I spar frequently with top caliber fighters and I get my fill.  I love boxing.  It now helps me manage my mental health issues rather than intensifying them.  It’s crazy because when I’m manic and on a high I can go 10 good rounds. When I’m in a depressive state I barely have the energy to go 2.  Bipolar Disorder doesn’t just make you feel like shit mentally, it manifests itself physically as well. [info] None [info] 1525214153

RoderickFarva [info] Yup. My Dad was diagnosed with bipolar when my brother was 11, I was 9, and my sister was 4.  His illness ruined our family and caused my parents to get divorced.  It really pissed me off when I was diagnosed with bipolar at 19 years old.  After 5 serious manic episodes, being hospitalized so many times I have lost count, losing countless friends, girlfriends, jobs, being homeless because of bipolar, and even getting arrested because of bipolar, I do my best to stay on my medicine and be well because I do not want to end up homeless or in jail again due to this illness.

oolitegrove [info] My longest relationship (9 years) started online in 2005 in a Web forum... Long before online dating had taken off in the UK. I messaged her to say hi, then we communicated by email or msn messenger for a few months. There were no smartphones or apps back then. We met and had a distance relationship for two years (I drove to her place at weekends). Then we moved in together and life mainly consisted of long, comfortable silences, staying indoors, and spending all of our time together. We both avoided making friends and we had a very good sex life. Things were good. Then I experienced hypomania, which changed my personality to that of a highly confident, sociable and hypersexual person, and I destroyed our relationship. I was diagnosed with bipolar, straightened out with meds, but it was too late to save us.  [info] None [info] 1526137324
AmyB848484 [info] I've been in your situation. I also take meds for bipolar that I can't stop because I'd be a danger to myself if I do. I had a similar situation where the guy disappeared and I wasn't working, and I didn't want to become a burden to my family. I was afraid I'd regret it for the rest of my life. I was raised to believe it was murder. When I had the procedure done, all I felt was a sense of relief. A few years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and if I had a child, there's no way I'd be mentally or financially stable enough to take care of it. The guy who was the father, I thought he'd disappeared because he wanted nothing to do with the baby, but he had gotten arrested and locked up in another state and had tried to contact me. He was upset about the abortion, but he just ended up going to prison and lost all the money he had fighting the case. So if I'd had that baby, I would have been on my own financially and dealing with the prison system 1000 miles away. I have no regrets. I dodged a major bullet. I'm unable to work due to my condition, and I would have been trying to raise a child when my symptoms started, and probably would have ended up losing custody due to my mental illness. It would have been cruel to bring a child into such a situation. I would definitely do it again (if I had it to do over again, I never would have been with that loser in the first place, but if I couldn't take that back, I'd definitely have the procedure again)   I wish you the best in whatever you do. Don't feel any guilt about doing what you have to do. As a fellow bipolar sufferer, raising a baby is a stress that you just shouldn't bring on yourself unless you 100% want to do it with all your heart. I also don't want children because mental illness runs in my family and I don't want to bring anyone into the world who might have my bipolar genes, because I don't wish this on anyone.

Unfortunately, my dad sends me text messages from time to time accusing me of hurting her out of anger (and just to guilt me in general), and because I'm mentally unstable, it sends me into a downward spiral.

iphoneoffmychest [info] I completely relate to this. I was diagnosed with bipolar-II almost exactly ten years ago to the day, and I am what you might call "high functioning." Though apparently, I am not high-functioning enough to write this damn paper due tomorrow...In the ten years since my diagnosis, I graduated high school and college (with highest honors), and then went straight into my dream job in an awesome city. During my post-college years, I built a wonderful and fulfilling life and last year I was admitted to all six graduate programs I applied to. Two weeks after accepting an offer at the best program in my field, I checked myself into a hospital delusional and suicidal. I'd run up $5k in credit card debt, was sleeping four hours a day, and was dating an abusive cokehead. He was the only person I could trust since the rest of my friends were conspiring to humiliate me...somehow (thanks, crazy!).Please don't hold it in. Don't let it get to that point. If you're thinking of checking yourself into a hospital, you're probably at the point when you should. Be honest with your doctors and with your support network; they want to help you live your best life *with* bipolar and not in spite of it. Ignoring it and powering through *is not sustainable*. Part of the reason I got so bad last year was that I wasn't honest with my psychiatrist and because to my support network, I seemed "okay" even when I was verbally saying I wasn't. I'm now working with a psychiatrist at my university who is very experienced at working with "high functioning" people living with mental illness. When you're in a mood episode, it can be very easy to lose sight of how severe things actually are and those around you may not pick up on it either because your life *looks* so together. Your friends, family, and coworkers love you. They want you happy and well. When you're depressed you can't tell how much they love you. [info] None [info] 1526361355
axon-axoff [info] I agree that OP may want to see a therapist/psychiatrist. I have always done the same thing, alternating between avoidance and hyper-productivity. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in my late teens but mood-stabilizing meds didn’t improve my quality of life on their own. More recently I was diagnosed with ADHD and a combo of low-dose mood stabilizers and ADHD medication (in addition to DBT once a week with a therapist I like) work for me. “Hyperfocus” is actually a characteristic of some varieties of ADHD. There’s so much overlap in definitions of mental conditions, the only thing that really matters is finding medication and therapy (I really believe in both) that work for you, not the label.

unwinding_cablecar [info] Hey! I have bipolar and I have been happily dating a girl for a few months :\) she is very understanding and helps me when things get rough. I was diagnosed about a year ago after multiple episodes and have worked through a DBT program and keep up to date with my meds; I've been stable since! A few dates in the past fizzled out once I told them I was a person with bipolar:/ I think it's key to keep managing your health and well\-being, first and foremost. I was married when my mental health issues started at the age of 25, and the person left me because I was diagnosed with bipolar. Probably for some it seems like something scary, maybe because they don't understand or have experience with someone with bipolar. My best advice would be to let people see who you are first, that you aren't really different than anyone else. You just have an illness that you are managing! Personally, I like to be upfront and honest as soon as possible, but everyone is different. For instance, I disclosed to an employer that I had bipolar and was fired a few weeks later... it is challenging, but know that there are people out there who support you and that you are still the same person! I'm still struggling with that, but things will and do get better with time! Wishing you the best :\)  [info] None [info] 1526482175

ecstasysnorter [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a little over a year ago, and basically there are periods in your life wherein you can't distinguish between reality and fantasy. I genuinely believed that I got possessed by a demon, that the government was transpiring against me, and that my life had become a reality show and every single thing i did was broadcasted live. This lead me to be afraid of taking showers or even pooping, and i had to do all my bathroom duties in pitch black with a single flashlight. I would also be alone in my room talking to mirrors and black tv screens with the perception that demons and God were talking to me through them. Very difficult and blurry times for me but I got through it, and it's made me stronger. After about 6 months of recovery, i'm in a much better place now and everything's pretty chill.

I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder two months ago, and I've gained about 10 lbs since then. I do think it's due to my medication, but I've always been a sedentary person. I've gone from a college freshman who never went to the campus rec center to a junior who went to group fitness classes twice a week \- no weights. This is the summer before my senior year, and I think it's about time I finally became a healthier, more balanced me. I've had problems with disordered eating behavior in the past, but I know it's not about the number on the scale. I'd love to become stronger overall, specifically at my core muscles due to having scoliosis. [info] None [info] 1527006926

gwenthrowaway [info] 1. My parents were IQ worshippers who taught me to feel superior and treat ordinary people with contempt.2. My father was a violent, abusive alcoholic who couldn't hold his liquor.3. My mother fled the house when I was about 12. We kids awoke and she was gone. Her clothes were still there, and her toothbrush was in the bathroom. But she was gone. We kids didn't dare ask what had happened. We figured he had finally killed her. He moved us 3,000 miles away and we didn't learn she was alive for more than a year.4. I had skipped two grades in elementary school. I arrived at 12 ready for puberty in the Deep South where I had to navigate social traditions and relationships having to do with subtleties of race and breeding and whether your grandpappy fought in the War Between the States. I was two years younger and less mature than my classmates, primed to treat them with disdain because of their sloppy Southern diction.5. I am half Asian and half Latina. In southern California that hadn't meant anything. In the South I learned for the first time that I was a colored girl - ostracized by both the white kids and the black kids, because clearly I belonged to neither group.6. I was courted by Ivy League schools. I wrote essays and filled out forms and got recommendations, but I caught my dad on a bad day between girlfriends and hangovers, and he declined to write checks to accompany my applications. He insisted I live at home and attend the small college in our town.7. I left home shortly after my high school graduation. I've been supporting myself since I was 16. I never saw or spoke to my father again.8. Before I was 18 I was robbed twice at gunpoint.9. Years later I found myself unhappy with my life, unable to feel optimistic or to take joy in anything. I left my life and my wonderful marriage because they were intolerable to me. 10. It was about a year later that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder II, which explained why I had been unable to tolerate my sweet life with my soul mate, and why I so readily threw it away forever.11. Drugs and counseling did nothing for me, so I sought electroconvulsive therapy - shock treatment - for my bipolar disorder. I had more than 50 treatments over six months.12. I went back to school and finally got my Ivy League degree in literature. Upon graduation I found myself with no marriage, no job, no classes to attend, no place to live. On a whim I flew to visit an online friend in a poor eastern European country. I have lived here ever since.There have been a lot of pluses to go along with these events, but you did ask what fucked me up. These are the major challenges I've faced.I am a positive, happy, healthy person today. But that's not what you asked about. [info] None [info] 1527092770

yourlastbreathofair [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar I about 20 years ago. I've been medication compliant for about the last 7 years. In my experience, those feelings of denial never go away. Sometimes it's quite a fight with myself to take my medication as prescribed, even to stay in treatment. Not because it doesn't help, but because I end up feeling like I shouldn't \*need\* it, that it should be something I can fix on my own. It's not, though. The 13 years of my life I spent not having bipolar treated proved that to me.  [info] None [info] 1527504964

OldSpentQueen [info] Man, I can relate to just about everything here! I was diagnosed with bipolar II at 16, and am just starting to get it under control in my 30's. A few things: GET MEDICATED! If you don't have insurance, look into applying for SSI or SSDI. This will automatically enroll you in medicare. If you are medicated, it's time to talk to your pdoc and switch things up. I've been on more meds than I can even remember, but all that trial and error was worth it once I found Lamictal. It's night and day! The suicidal ideation and crazy lows are all but gone, which is something I NEVER thought would happen. This is what I imagine "normal"(Sorry, only word I could think of) people feel day to day. This should be priority before going back to school or finding work, I can tell you from experience.  Don't feel guilty about being supported by your family. I had very similar feelings for a long time. I have an amazing support system, and I felt like I had every advantage and just squandered it. This is toxic thinking. I obviously don't know your whole situation, but I'll assume since your family supports you financially that they love you and want to do what they can to help. If this is the case, feel blessed.  Feeling like you're a loser going nowhere sucks, but I'm pretty confident that's not the case for you. Try to focus on improving yourself all around. Finding the right medication is a big part of that, things like developing daily routines and eating better honestly help quite a bit. This can be frustrating in the beginning because it honestly doesn't feel like you're really doing anything constructive, but the baby steps add up and you'll ultimately feel a bit better about yourself and gain confidence.  I'm sorry for rambling, I'm a tad manic tbh. The last thing I want to bring up is friends. Once things start clicking and you're feeling a bit more stable this won't be a problem, I promise. Don't feel bad about having few friends in the meantime though. Late 20's and early 30's isn't like high school or college. I'm lucky if I see my best friend once a year, and most of the people I associate with are work colleagues. It's just a crappy part of growing up  Aaaaanyway, really sorry for the wall of text. Like I said, I'm a bit manic. There's tons more I'd like to talk about, but I'll cut myself off here. Please feel free to pm me if you need to talk, I've been where you are and it's horrible, but things will get better. Fair fortune [info] None [info] 1527898749

pleg910 [info] Dude, I was diagnosed with bipolar around age 20 after a psychosis and am now living a super normal life 6 years later. Its been normal for 2, but could’ve been for longer if I hadn’t gone off my meds and had another psychosis at 22. I’m not exactly cured because what I have been through has changed me forever and I know that if I go off the meds, the ember that is there could very easily turn back into a fire, but for all intents and purposes I’m pretty unaffected by the diagnosis these days. The longer you go without treatment the less treatable it will get. I’m mostly familiar with bipolar, but I’m pretty sure drugs for symptoms like you’re having range from pretty benign, to totally brain frying. If you wait too long and the condition worsens you could get stuck with the brain fryers (even if you do get stuck with those there are other drugs and ways of coping that can help with the brain fry and it won’t be the end of the world). If you go early enough there’s a fair chance you’ll end up more than just functional, you could end up with it barely even affecting your life. You have very little to lose from seeking help, and everything to lose from avoiding it. Just figure out how to get treatment (where there’s a will there’s a way) and get it over with, you’ll thank yourself later. [info] None [info] 1527989922
tothebroccolifields [info] Everyone's experience is different, but I didn't notice real improvement until I moved off of the Lamictal/anti-depressant combination and tried just Lamictal. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I tried a few different anti-depressants that just exaggerated the depressive and hypo-manic episodes. I was on Lamictal along with an SSRI, and things didn't seem to get better. I've been on Lamictal only for over a year and things have been pretty steady even after my wife and I had our first baby, and a whole bunch of recent family drama. Again, this may not be the solution in your case, but if you haven't noticed a difference it might not hurt to discuss eliminating the anti-depressant with your psychiatrist. Either way I hope you can find something that works for you. [info] None [info] 1527998765
Squealymcnealy [info] During my time in university I was struggling mentally, having 50000 students to cater to you can often be forgen about so it’s important you have good friends. I was drinking a lot tontry to escape the feelings and on one night it all accumulated into a cluster fuck of a scenario and I argued with my ex (it was completely my fault I was never violent or agrresive or anything like that, just mentally I wasn’t really capable of showing love or appreciating her efforts to help I guess) so I grabbed pretty much everything we had under the sink and tried to ingest as much as possible. She saved my life that night. Sadly after that things didn’t really go as well as ou could probably expect. I finally got help etc and we both moved on our separate ways. I lost a good person that night but in a way it helped me realise that I needed to be a better me and deal with the issues I had. Five years on I have been diagnosed with bipolar but it hasn’t stopped me, I don’t medicate but I love my life a certain way and it’s truly never held me back, I have my dream job, my life’s in the right track and found somebody new. I will always regret putting that person through what I did that night though, it’s something I’ll always have to live with but I have learned so much from it. It’s not always easy getting help but it’s the first step to you new life. Stay safe people look after each other and remember you’re not alone.  [info] None [info] 1528024093

loliclown [info] Absolutely. In psychiatry, these are called "crying spells". I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder when I was 21 years old, and one of my bewildering symptoms were crying spells. It made so much sense when my psychiatrist told me about them. Just about anyone can experience them, especially during times of stress, feeling overwhelmed, or even exhaustion, especially mental and emotional exhaustion. They just happen more often for bipolar people like me, or depressed or anxious people. You're completely normal, and crying is actually good for your body and mental health. If you need to cry, let yourself cry. You'll feel a bit better afterwards. [info] None [info] 1528286268

pancakes904 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar before BPD, and then later realized I really do have both. I think with BPD, there are mood swings, but they last shorter than bipolar highs/lows do, and they are usually related to something situational, especially just the feeling of boredom or loneliness. It’s a personality issue, whereas bipolar is a brain chemical imbalance. BPD is totally manageable though and here’s a posi article about it!! Made me feel better.

IdreamtIwasa [info] I see theres like 13000 comments on here already. I dont think mine will reach many ears. And even if it does I doubt it will help any. I've been having a really bad week, not my first and hopefully not my last but I dont know. Earlier this year I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and got on meds and everything and they helped a bit, but it's still there. I'm sick of telling people when i feel suicidal, the last time i got sent to a terrible terrible psych ward for a few days and next time it'll be even longer. I really just feel like I'm beating a dead horse when it comes to living. It's extremely difficult for me to hold down a job, I've pretty much dropped out of college because I want going to classes... I have no money so I'm pretty much living on the goodwill of my parents but I hate it. I haven't been in a relationship in 5 years and that doesn't look to be changing anytime soon. I'm very lonely but my personality changes so often it's hard to establish many good relationships with people. This morning I looked at my brother and realized that even my family isn't enough to keep me going anymore, and they were always the thing in the back of my mind that kept me alive. I just keep having these thoughts that flash into my head about how now it's a good time to write that suicide note. It's easy for people who sit on the sideline to say things will get better, but for some of us it might not. The divorce rate for couples where one person is bipolar is 90%. Many people can't hold careers, or finish school. And it's very difficult because there are so many grand things I want to accomplish sometimes but then I have the realization that I might not ever be able to. Seeing all of these suicide posts has been making it a lot more prominent of an idea in my head recently. It's honestly the only direction I see my life heading, sort of like an "all roads lead to this" type thing. I dont know what do do anymore, I'm so tired of fighting it every other week.

lady_stardust_ [info] Myself. I was in a string of bad relationships with people who brought out the worst in me. I’ve had very low self esteem my entire life despite excelling in school and being (I’m told, but still sort of don’t believe) witty and fairly good-looking. I also struggled with undiagnosed bipolar disorder for ten years. This translated into accepting awful treatment from people who claimed to love me. Sexual and verbal abuse, cheating, alcoholics, run-of-the-mill jerks with stagnant lives. Don’t get me wrong, I was a shitty partner too. I was often emotionally unstable, selfish, and had bad habits of my own, like smoking weed and cigarettes constantly, drinking too much, and eating mostly junk food. I was a broken person and I fell in love with other broken people.After ending my last relationship in the midst of my first full-blown manic episode, I finally had time to be on my own. Being single for the first time in almost a decade allowed me to step back and look at the patterns in my life for what they were. I was diagnosed with bipolar and started treatment but I couldn’t come to terms with it and was struggling to figure out what my life would look like in this new reality. I also still couldn’t shake my unhealthy habits and didn’t really want to. My current partner helped me accept my mental illness, quit smoking cigarettes, and deepen my interest in healthy activities like writing, cooking, and exercise. He helped me change my relationship with alcohol and weed, which I now use in moderation rather than to numb myself from reality. He also provides thoughtful, nonjudgmental alternative perspectives that help me to reframe life challenges and work through them rather than avoiding them or feeling helpless. My personality hasn’t changed fundamentally; it’s more like I’ve finally been able to let the best parts of myself come to the surface. I feel stronger with him. He’s helped me shed the things in my life that I always knew were weighing me down.Plus the sex is ridiculous. [info] None [info] 1528572063
crypticcalamity [info] Thank you for this. My husband was diagnosed in 2013 and wanted to divorce because he didn't want to 'put me through' the uncertainty, the facets of disability that could prevent a 'normal' life, etc. I got mad and told him never to say that crap again. It's been hard, sure, especially after we had a child (turning 4 in August), but I cherish him in a way he still doesn't seem to quite believe or understand.I've been diagnosed with bipolar and a few other things recently, but my unmanaged condition caused a lot of trials and heartache for both of us. Even still, he persevered. He believes in me when I don't. He loves me even when I go off the deep end, and is there to cushion my fall when I leap off proverbial cliffs.I believe in him. He is intelligent, kind, gentle, willing to try whatever new adventure I've decided to start (or support and embrace the changes my illness can bring). I love him so deeply that it hurts when my actions cause him harm or when his condition makes him feel pain, feel like a burden, feel worthless and depressed. Honestly I am scared for both of us. Neither of us know what our different illnesses have in store for the future. However, knowing that I have a partner who will take me as I am, even when I was not taking meds and barreling down paths full of bad choices, he stays by me, loves me, and holds me when I inevitably shatter and make life altering decisions that are difficult to recover from.We didn't sign up for life to throw this crap at us, but it did. Instead of giving up or shutting down, we take things as they come and try to adjust as best we can. We communicate. We genuinely care about each others emotional and physical wellbeing. We also adjust and make the best of the situation. Instead of being disappointed/upset that the beach is not an option, we make plans to take our daughter to the aquarium. (He can get a wheelchair and it is in the ac, and when our little girl inevitably gets worn out walking, she can ride the daddy express!) I want to make sure that we still get out and enjoy our time as a family and to savor every minute we get to spend living and experiencing life. It may not be what I imagined it would be years ago, but there is always a way to find a fun compromise and use the illness as a means of enjoying life in a different way.I don't understand how he can weather through the storm that is me, and he doesn't understand why I want him to be my partner and lover for life, but your post put into words things that I didn't know how to verbalize. When he was hospitalized for 10 days, 5 hours from our home, on the journey to his diagnosis, I felt fortunate that I got to be there for him, sleeping in the armchair and curling up with him all tangled in cords to make sure he was not alone. I advocated his treatment and made decisions when he couldn't mentally cope. And he has done the equivalent for me.I shared this post with him and he is going to read this when I post.To anyone reading this, scared to be a burden or in a relationship or to have a family: you are worth it. You deserve any happiness you can find in life and you deserve to love and be loved and supported. If you want children, you deserve to have them and watch them grow, to teach them and in return savor the magic of life through their eyes.It isn't easy, but having my husband in my life makes it easier feel that living is worth it.Thank you, love. You will never be a burden to me.

Vasukki [info] There are certain stages in one's spiritual evolution that may look like mania in the sense of hightened energy and bizarre spiritual experience but my experience tells me they are not psychosis. I was diagnosed with bipolar too and I still had those spiritual experiences while being on a strong dosage of medication. Mania should be making you quite dysfunctional right? I think it is important to have enough self awareness to distinguish both things. Self awareness is key, but if things go out of hand, seek help ASAP. [info] None [info] 1528666747

divineintervention17 [info] Okay.   I don't think that my family was as rich as yours, but we were upper-middle class and my dad (and to a lesser extent my mum) did see people with extreme mental health issues, or homeless people, as inferior or forever damaged or lost causes- this extended to the homeless.

My parents had a shift of perspective when I was diagnosed with bipolar after doing a serious of erratic things that eventually landed me in a hospital (due to a drug overdose). I know that schizophrenia is harder to handle, after all one of my best friends from high school unfortunately suffers from it, but I believe they are stigmatised in a similar fashion.   Anyway, I am fairly stable now with a well paying job from my undergrad degree in writing and am also doing a masters of historical research. My parents were (happily) surprised that a person with bipolar could be accomplished in any way. People are not only their illness, they are nuanced and potentially capable and are not just write offs. I hate telling people that I have bipolar because often times they will start subtly studying me like I am an illness and not an individual. Don't make this mistake.  [info] None [info] 1529234034
fakenamebitch [info] Thanks for the support &lt;3 , I should have mentioned that I attempted it about 4-5 years ago and for the most part i have been improving since then. I have been diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD so i have my lows but i also have highs. People like you saved me on many days by reminding me that the pain is temporary and it will go away, so i want to say thanks again, please continue being a lovely person.

MiL_QaCoSo [info] It is your superpower. I was diagnosed with bipolar 7 years after my first full-on manic episode. But then I was able to keep it 'subdued' and stayed in a rather consistent hypomanic state, which is why it was largely undetected. So let's say when you hear an idea that you can work off of, the synaptic firings and establishment of new neural connections (inducing that "aha!" moment) could be hypomania, which may affect your normal cycle. I've had depressive episodes that last 6 months to 2 months...  [info] None [info] 1529344437
xthexdeadxonex [info] I'm sorry you lost someone to this. And I'm sorry you feel that way too.I have tried reaching out though. But its never gone well. My dad wouldn't let me see a professional as a kid because "they just make things up to con money from people." If he knew I was diagnosed with bipolar and was seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, he would flip out. My husband doesn't understand. He said that I use my illness as an excuse. "If you were REALLY manic..." As if he's suddenly an expert. A friend doesn't understand it either. I tried explaining some things to him, and he still didn't understand. To be honest, I'm kind of paranoid that he's using my illness to make me look bad to my husband. But then again, I'm probably just paranoid. Every time I reach out, it doesn't matter. I'm afraid to reach out anymore. Most people in my area don't understand mental illness. Most of them actually have bad attitudes towards mental illness. [info]  [info] 1529371766
kohays [info] Yeah smoking can bring out psychosis. Drinking is okay in moderation but it's best to stay away completely from substances when you are dealing with OCD. I have pure O too so I know what you mean, I have an obsession about developing schizophrenia and when something seems off I go into a mode where I start getting paranoid that I'm crazy, seeing things, hearing voices. But the thing is I know it's all in my head. Anyways, from what you described it sounds like it's just obsessive thoughts, are you diagnosed with ocd? Or on medications for it? I was on Luvox and it did help alot with the intrusive thoughts and conversations I get in my head from ocd. Unfortunately I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I can't take Ssri's anymore as they tend to bring out mania. But for intrusive thoughts the best thing is Luvox, exercise, staying sober, keeping busy, and eating healthy.Are you seeing a therapist for OCD as well? [info] None [info] 1529446860

firiel_the_gnome [info] Yes, especially with hyperactivity. I always was eager to please, so I behaved nicely and I worked really hard in school. However, it never explained how restless I was, how fast I talked, how emotional I was, how sensitive I was, how hard it was for me to maintain friendships. My academics were always fine, but my relationships were terrible. As I got older, the pattern of blowing up and burning bridges just continued into my 20s. At first I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder because I was so emotional but only in the last year has my diagnosis changed to ADHD because bipolar just doesn't fit and the way I've reacted to medication has indicated it's definitely not that. It's really interesting.I'm also a special education teacher and I'd say boys predominantly get referred in school for ADHD. I rarely see girls referred for ADHD. [info] None [info] 1529682473
CleanExpression [info] I’m not looking for posthumous fame or anything. I am writing for the story’s sake. It helps me feel better when I’m feeling low and it calms me down during manic episodes. Genre is realistic or literary fiction.I only care if somebody somewhere reads it and understands what I went through. I have one other published book, which I wrote after I was diagnosed with bipolar. I wrote it in an attempt to communicate how I feel through a short story about someone whose life is managed by an unpredictable and unpleasant force beyond her control, in the hopes that someone would resonate with my writing and find solace in it. Maybe it would even help them out of a rut. That’s what art is for in my opinion. The book I’m currently working on is more of a coming of age story. It’s very (and I mean REALLY) loosely based on a pretty traumatic event I went through in my mid teens (although there isn’t really a self-insert in it) that changed how I look at the world. my expectations are for its reception are low, but I hope somebody somewhere will find it entertaining or helpful or even say it has artistic merit. I don’t really care as long as I get the story down how I wanna tell it and there’s nothing left to say about it. I know that if I can do that it’ll speak volumes to people about what I live with everyday. It’s not just my experiences I wanna convey, its the reality of bipolar disorder. I’ve thought a lot about this, and there’s this quote from Virginia Woolf’s _To The Lighthouse_ that I think relates to this a lot. I debated even putting it in the back of certain editions of my first book:&gt; Now all the candles were lit up, and the faces on both sides of the table were brought nearer by the candle light, and composed, as they had not been in the twilight, into a party round a table, for the nightwas now shut off by panes of glass, which, far from giving any accurate view of the outside world, rippled it so strangely that here, inside the room, seemed to be order and dry land; there, outside, a reflection in which things waved and vanished, waterily.I want my writing to be like those candles.

Enyo81 [info] &gt; Mental healthcare is expensive and difficult to navigate.I find psychological healthcare to be expensive. My therapy sessions were $75 per session, and I was going once per week. My psychiatric care has never been costly, though. But I guess that's an issue of insurance. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 10 years ago and have never paid more than $30 for an office visit $65/every 3 months for brand drugs, and $10 for generic. I also didn't find it difficult to navigate. It was like any other doctor for me. Book and appointment, show up, talk, gets meds, repeat every 3 months. The only time it was 1-2 times a month was when I had recent psychosis. I feel like mental health in the black community deserves it's own thread. While it's natural to bring up people of color, this post was about a specific group (white people) and a very specific act (suicide). There was no request to compare other groups' experiences, so I didn't feel the need to do so.  [info] None [info] 1529693220
KogoDogo [info] Not so hot? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and due to a lack of funds, I can't afford my meds. So, some days I'm extremely happy to be here and think I have it all figured out. Then there's stretches of time that I actually have to be stopped from hurting myself. Since reaching adulthood, I've tried to kill myself a handful of other times and, like, nearly succeeded once.

spellellellogram [info] Yes! Before I was diagnosed with bipolar I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and the only antidepressant that even remotely helped was fluoxetine. It got me out of bed and functioning but those 3 or 4 years of my life are a haze because I wasn't actually living. I had no interest in anything or anyone and I was completely emotionless and brain dead. I gained around 80 lbs. and racked up tons of credit card debt because the only things that gave me any kind of pleasure were shopping and eating. Talk to your doctor about it and if you both decide that the medication isn't giving you a better quality of life then you might need to try some other medication. Keep in mind though that it takes a while for some medications to start working and depending on how long you've been taking it, it may just be a matter of waiting it out for now. Write down your side effects and take them with you when you see your doctor. I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you, even if it takes some trial and error.

AbyssalCrime [info] IDK. My buddy has a felony for selling counterfeit cocaine(powdered sugar) when he was a teenager and has tried on multiple occasions to purchase a firearm and has been denied. The laws are in place, and they work, however bad guys don't get their guns legally. They get them by stealing them, or buying them off the Mexican cartels. By the standards of the proposed mental health ban for gun buying, I technically fall under the category of mental health patient. I was diagnosed with bipolar at a young age. It does nothing to me but make me cry when I get upset. Yet, this would keep me from legally obtaining a firearm. I'm prior law enforcement and a us veteran.

bikiniwini [info] Yes, you are not alone! Bipolar can be SCARY AF! This one time I had a manic episode so bad I thought I could speak foreign languages fluently such as Spanish and sign language. (I can't. I can only speak English.)  I was so convinced I could though. It was embarrassing when I came to. When I get psychotic episodes I say and do things uncharacteristic of me. When it finally passes I'm so embarrassed of myself. It seriously sucks. Not all manias have to be psychotic like that either. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar I didn't know being bad with money (like excessive spending) could be a symptom! I often found myself in super risky situations too like having an overdrawn bank account stranded in a city I don't live in. Then there's the racing thoughts and euphoria where I take on tasks more than I can chew and so...much... more....A person without bipolar can't fully understand. It's hard. It's scary and it's hard. Depressive episodes can be just as bad. I actually just came out of the hospital a couple months ago for trying to down a bottle of my pills. I know if I said these things to someone who wasn't bipolar they would just label me as a crazy bitch. (Which has happened.) I often feel like I AM a crazy bitch and end up distancing myself from making friends because of this. It sucks. Some people just don't understand. I understand though. I understand the highs and the lows. My bipolar friend, if there's ever a time where you need to vent my inbox is open! You are not alone.  [info] None [info] 1530083409
guymayer [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder my second year of chiropractic school. I was devastated. I spent 4 years in undergrad and was still busting my ass to make it. As soon as I informed student services I needed services for my disability, the discrimination started big time. They eventually ran me out of school, I was told that someone with a mental disorder couldn’t be a doctor. I studied 30 plus credit hours a trimester and never received a failing grade even though at the time I was on tranquilizers and all the other garbage.

AmyB848484 [info] When I was younger I wanted children. F(39). As I went through my 20s, my friends started having kids, and I began to notice some things. A lot of things about having a child as a woman just aren't fair. If you're married or living with the father, you both work, but when you both get off work, the woman is expected to come home and continue doing the majority of the housework and childcare while the man usually relaxes. He may do yard work, but those things don't have to be done as often. Basically, now women are expected to do 2 jobs while men mainly just do one. If you're a single mom, the man probably pays child support, yes, and probably hates it. But guess what. You most likely work too, and you also have to spend money out of *your* paycheck to put a roof over the kids head and provide for the child as well. The child support alone isn't enough to live on. But you also get to come home every night and do all the work. If you want to go anywhere, you have to find a babysitter during the week. The father can come and go as he pleases. He probably gets the kid on the weekend and his mother probably watches the kid half of that time. If he pays his child support and gets the kid on weekends, he's praised for being a great dad. The woman has sacrificed a ton more, and it's just expected that she's obligated to do that. Again, the man mainly just works and provides money, but women are expected to work and provide money *and* do the vast majority of the child rearing work. Yes, I know there are some great dads who do more and that some dad's have full custody, but these are the exception. Once you have a kid, it can mess with your body and leave you with stretch marks, stretched out skin, and sagging breasts. Guess what. Your dude might leave you for someone who's body looks better, and now you're stuck with fewer options. Men with children have a much easier time finding someone than women with children. For men, having children doesn't affect their body or appearance. Then my sister had a baby. During labor she ripped open and they had to stitch her up. She went 2 days without peeing because the acidic urine on the wound was excruciating. I remember her crying uncontrollably because she had to pee but she couldn't stand the pain. The hospital told her there was nothing they could give her. Finally we took her to a different hospital and they gave her a numbing cream, so the first hospital lied.Then my friend went into labor and the baby started coming so fast they gave her an epesiotomy before the epidural. So they just basically took a scalpel and cut her from her vagina to her anus, making it all one big hole, with no warning, and she felt every bit of it. My mom has to wear diapers because after four kids she can't control her bladder. I said, "Oh, hell naw! I ain't doing this shit!"In my early 30s I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I absolutely can't come off my medication or I'm a danger to myself, and pregnancy would require that. I made the right choice, because I don't want to pass these genes on, because I wouldn't wish this illness on anyone. And if I had to come off my meds, I'd probably spend the pregnancy in a hospital and get the kid taken away when I delivered due to my mental health off the meds. So everything worked out as it should have.  [info] None [info] 1530492545

Well, I take hydroxyzine at night to try to sleep but it doesn't help my bladder at all. I'm debating whether or not I want to try amytriptaline.

pistachioxo [info] I was recently diagnosed with ADHD - I'm 22. Apparently it's easier to miss in girls because symptoms tend to present differently, and because I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago any attention or hyperactivity issues were kind of written off as hypomania. Nobody told me bipolar and ADHD have a really high co-morbidity rate. Additionally, ADHD is harder to diagnose when you're over the age of 18. So I kind of had a triple whammy lmao.In the end I sprung for the full panel of testing through my therapist's colleague who specializes in adult attention deficits. In total it cost me $900, and that was on the low end (in my area anyway) because I gave my therapist permission to collaborate with her, so she was able to help her complete the report faster. Luckily I screened positive for ADHD so it wasn't all for nothing, and my psychiatrist was able to prescribe me dexedrine.I'm not trying to discourage you at all though! It's done wonders for my attention span and combined with my other medications has honestly made me feel better than I have in years. I'm in university and literally went from dropping out of a semester and failing the semester I got back, to getting straight A's in my spring/summer courses because I could finally concentrate. If you can afford to get screened by a professional, I 100% recommend it. Just know that it's often costly - happily for me, the benefits outweighed that. [info] None [info] 1530945428
Brocktreee [info] I read both posts. The biggest thing that stuck out to me is that you have a relative with schizoaffective disorder. I don't know how much you know about that, so:Schizoaffective is a blend of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and when I'm manic, I get paranoid that I'm going to be attacked, I see things out of the corner of my eye, very anxious, agitated, it's bad. I don't hallucinate outside of mood states. Schizophrenic hallucinations and delusions/paranoia can happen outside of mood episodes. There's a lot more to mania than I'm getting into here, suffice to say that it's a very nasty combination.**Let me be absolutely clear:** I am not saying you have bipolar, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder.I am saying that because you have a relative, the risk of you developing one of these is higher. You have an underlying vulnerability that people unrelated to you don't have.**Let me be clear:** I am not a licensed mental health professional, just a psychology and drug education buff.That said, it is absolutely crucial that you seek emergency mental health assistance ASAP. You are not well psychologically, and you need help in getting stabilized. I'm glad you posted here.This constant drug induced derealization and paranoia is scary, for sure, and your local doctor's can help you start to get a handle on it. Big hugs. I hope you feel better soon. [info] None [info] 1531056839
LewdDudeThrowaway [info] Sometimes they care,but reaching out can be difficult.I was diagnosed with bipolar-1 when I was 8 y/o, and struggled hard socially until I turned 17(i’m 22 now). I had one friend in elementary school and he was the only person who’d talk to me. I had family my age,but I was often ostracized.I didnt understand that people need space,I just felt lonely and wanted to be around people. So, I bugged my family and my friend to hang out constantly....long story short,my only friend and relatives my age ceased contact with me because I bugged them too much.As a kid,that fucking destroyed me. I never wanted that to happen again. My solution? If I only talk to people who talk to me first,then I **know** they actually want to be around me.Now,I have a best friend who i’ve known for about 5 years. This man redefined what friendship means to me.I had never initiated contact until he talked to me about it 2-3 years into our friendship. He asked me why,and I told him the reasons for my behavior.He told me that I should never worry about bugging him,or talking too much,or losing him because I try to hang out all the time.He ended with “I’m not going anywhere unless you get rid of me.” and it finally clicked. I cried,not gonna lie. It was the first time someone told me they were bothered that I *didnt* talk to them.Ever since then I’ve tried my best to initiate contact at least as often as he does. Just saying “good morning” or “how was work?” and stuff like that. It scares me,but I trust him more than I fear the feelings associated with my past.If you have somebody who you are genuinely close to,I recommend you do what my friend did for me. It may not have “trauma” behind it like mine did,but they may have a roadblock and need your help to get past that. [info] None [info] 1531206256

pistachioxo [info] I don't have quite as much to offer as the other commenters here, but I felt like I had to let you know that I'm really happy you decided to reach out here. Having that self-awareness and desire to change is a tremendous first step and you're already there, that's awesome. :)I can at least relate to your toxic relationship with the internet. I grew up with both my parents but my mom's always been a bit of a mess (she's agoraphobic and an alcoholic) and my dad's a pilot so he was a bit absent. I made a bunch of internet friends, started a couple Tumblr pages (including a depressing black &amp; white one), stumbled into self harm and tried that for a few months because I thought it validated my mental illness. I met so many guys online and started up relationships, sent pictures, etc. When I was 16 I met someone on Omegle (don't know if that's even still a thing) and we "dated" long distance for a few months, he was 22 I think. I thought I was doing great because hey, at least I was socializing, but like I've told my therapist, I know now that the internet is an extremely toxic place for kids with mental illnesses. I'm glad you recognize some of that already.I'm also headed into my fifth year of university and there'll probably be a sixth. I dropped out for a semester and failed the semester I came back. So I get the graduation thing too. I know it's incredibly hard to look forward when you're dealing with shit, but I promise you there's a future for you here. I still don't know wtf I'm planning on doing with my degree after graduation, but three years ago when I was diagnosed with bipolar I didn't know I'd be sitting here in 2018 finally getting my shit together either. It's not a before and after success story yet but I'm getting there, and I don't want you to ever feel like you're not making progress. You are and you have.Also, quick sidenote: I'm 22 and I don't even know a person my age with a decent job, a car, and a house. Try not to put so much pressure on yourself, I promise none of us have that "wise adult" thing down either. It's a learning process for everyone. :)Feel free to PM me as well if you ever want to talk OP, I'm always willing to listen. I hope things get better for you soon. ❤️ [info] None [info] 1531554045

Apathetic_Doodles [info] Things are going to be very hard at times. I am 35 weeks pregnant and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14. I managed about six years ago to go off meds and until recently I had been fine. Make sure that she takes time for herself to relax and decompress. If she is like me she is fully aware of when things aren’t how they ought to be and she will probably be beating herself up about it already too, so just gently remind her that’s it’s okay to not be okay and that she isn’t broken, she just has an illness. I am certain since you guys are married you know her love language, so when she is struggling do what you can to make her feel loved. Some people need gifts, even small ones like a candy bar from the gas station. Some people appreciate service so do something nice like a chore she would normally do. If she wants to talk it out then do that, cuddle if she want/needs to cuddle. It’s going to be hard but you can do it. Also don’t be afraid to go back on meds if needed, there are options that are totally safe to take while pregnant. [info] Team Pink! EDD 8-18 [info] 1531764822

My manic spells were so frequent that I would be up feeing high almost for days and let's not forget the rage I had.. Anyway I checked into the hospital because I knew what was next. I have since stayed with treatment as hard as the medicine is on me because this time I know I have to do it or die.. Thank you so much and I wish u the very best. Please message me anytime.

Brocolli12345678 [info] I started taking Lamictal for my second time a couple months ago. I don't remember my experiences the first time but this time it's definitely positive. A day or two after I started the 25mg I went from 12 hours of sleep a night down to 8-10. That was huge for me. I didn't start feeling better til I got to the 150 dose, which I started I think two or three weeks ago and I started feeling better soon after. Lamictal is prescribed often for bipolar, and I've heard more good than bad about it, especially compared to other drugs.About antidepressants- after I was diagnosed with bipolar I was told I can't be on antidepressants anymore because it might make me manic. I have type 1 maybe that's why, idk. Ask your psychiatrist why some people with bipolar can't take antidepressants, maybe he/she'll know. [info] Schizoaffective [info] 1532107616
Beetzart [info] Yep, I know it is not a mental illness.  I should have said I have been diagnosed with bipolar and I take drugs for that.   And that is what I was talking to my brother about.  Interestingly I have just been prescribed Abilify and noticed that it has been used in certain small trials and shown to be helpful with autistic traits like irritability and stereotypical behaviour.    This might mean nothing and I am only going on what I read on a couple of sites.   I am sure there are others here with a better insight then I into this.  Sorry I was not totally clear in my original post.  [info] None [info] 1532115050
UbiDubiumIbiLibertas [info] I wanted to join the military.I actually still tried to, mainly because I forgot how bad my mental health history looked.After that I was diagnosed with bipolar 2.

DeepDee [info] I know that life. I was diagnosed with bipolar after I stopped drinking. I think the main thing to keep in mind is that happiness is the wrong goal. Life is about waking up every morning and working hard. Doing what need to be done and living a virtuous life.The main things that keep me from being down are nature, art (music), and philosophy. They're all impartial and can help you stay balance, especially emotionally. Life can be hard, but drinking only makes it harder. [info] None [info] 1532162091
SharpieScentedSoap [info] It does. Depression and addiction also runs in my family as well. I was diagnosed with bipolar at 15 but that was 8 years ago.

I work a 9-5 job so also finding a place open on the weekends is pretty hard.  [info] None [info] 1532203411

AGirlHasNoThrowaway [info] Hang in there. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2014, I understand the ups and downs.

AmyB848484 [info] I've been this way my entire life. Two things changed my life. When I got diagnosed and was prescribed Adderall I started using it to wake myself up in the morning. Then when I was diagnosed with bipolar, when I finally found the right antidepressants and medicine that helped me to sleep more soundly, I started waking up more refreshed, even before taking the Adderall. But I keep my bottle of Adderall on my night table with a glass of water so it's right there when I wake up. I set an extra alarm for an hour before I need to wake up, take the Adderall, then go back to sleep. By the time the alarm goes off for when I need to really get up, I'm usually already awake and alert because the Adderall has kicked in. Edit: one word [info] None [info] 1532404754
LusciousPubes [info] I'm just meaning that researchers haven't gone out of their way to be sexist. It was a product of the times.It's also my right to deal with the fact I have an iud that caused 3 months of hell. I got it for me, not anyone else, even though I was in a long-term relationship at the time. It may be a little different in my country as we have a public health system and so finances aren't really an issue. I've also never had a doctor take bc lightly - I was given information on all the options. When I was diagnosed with bipolar they were extremely careful about which bc I had - basically nothing hormonal. So they were extremely open about potential side-effects. I personally would feel a bit weird relying on someone else for bc, so either way I would have gotten it. It's my body so I see it as my responsibility. Not everyone feels like that, so male bc will be an amazing thing.Just had a thought - it's probably tied into the taboo of periods etc. and pms symptoms are potentially why it's side-effects have been played down. Amongst everything else. The reason I keep saying to read -wasn't meant to be patronising sorry - is partly because it's a bit of an echo chamber in this sub imo. The AMA was a fantastic insight into it, that's why I kept mentioning it.  [info] None [info] 1532431618
bullcrazyboy [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar at a young age then as time went by the diagnosis shifted to BPD/HPD then eventually, with an awareness of trauma, to CPTSD. r/CPTSD is super helpful. What I like about the CPTSD diagnosis is that while the symptoms are similar to the other two it is more about what is wrong with what has HAPPENED TO YOU as opposed to something being wrong WITH YOU. Psychiatric diagnosis have a may of encouraging people into this false idea that they themselves are faulty when more often than not its what has or hasn’t happened to them that is the problem. I know it doesn’t have much to do with MBTI but thought I would add my 2 cents. Best wishes on your journey.  [info] None [info] 1532486442
blablabla1984 [info] It really angers me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the Netherlands  from a specialist unit and received many hours of one on one carefully assessed treatment for over a year before they reached that conclusion. On my return to the UK the NHS decided  after a 20 minute appointment I was abused as a child and must have borderline personality disorder and I can't possibly have had my dna sequenced and I must be delusional and blocked my medicstion and therapy until they could convince me my upbringing is responsible.  Every month I saw them they asked about my "childhood abuse " They ignored clear evidence of seasonal changes and patterns and how my supplementation and lithium has stabalised my mood which would not happen with a personality disorder.This idea that upbringing is solely responsible for mental illness and people's problems is false it can happen but you have to be predisposed for that added stress to rock the boat enough to be diagnosed with an illness. Trauma and abuse can effect your brain chemistry and lead to mental illness but you mostly need to have defective genes to begin with and in my case certainly I was never abused as a child and didn't suffer childhood trauma. It is the preferred and chosen interpretation of mental illness in the UK unfortunstly so I did years of research and have successfully treated myself with targeted supplementation and self medicstion which isn't ideal but hopefully I will recieve much better treatment when i move to Berlin shortly. It is so easy for people to blame their problems on other people than accept responsibility for their own actions. Even with mental illness freewill exists but some are stronger than others.

blackbird_girl [info] Oh god, thank you. I'm so glad I found your post on r/happy. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well and was dealing with mental health issues since I was 13. I was the perpetual honor student, achiever of the family, until I wasn't able to go to school or focus on my studies anymore because of my mind and other students' bullying. One of my teachers was especially harsh, saying to the whole class that if we're to go on with what we're doing (absences, low grades), then we better not go to college as we'll only be a burden to our parents. Everyone knows that she was talking about me. She repeatedly humiliated me in class in subtle ways. It was crushing, being golden girl to garbage.Fast forward and I've dropped out of college twice, never finishing a semester. Most of my classmates already graduated from college, which is the ultimate goal where I'm from. I almost started believing that my teacher's right. Now, I'm about to start my second year in college (FINALLY, YAY!) studying something I love and slightly back to achiever status, but with a lot of struggles. Mental health treatment is expensive so I've been on and off of it, and I usually feel like I'll never get out of the cycle. So high up then crashing to the pits of hell. But seeing other people with bipolar disorder overcome and live life fully (Carrie Fisher, for example, RIP) really made me hope that I can, too. I root for them so much. And when those who know about me ask about famous people with bipolar, I usually say Demi Lovato, as people my age know her.Demi said that "it IS possible." It's been a tough few days with school stress and other life issues that the news about her really shook me. I found myself asking Demi (in my mind) to please tell me that it IS still possible. Even when bipolar turns me into someone I wouldn't want to be.You, mister, just told me that it IS possible. You don't know how much I needed this. I thank you so much for that.Love and light to you, bipolar brother!  [info] None [info] 1532707531
RyuNoah [info] I ride uber, and after 200 plus rides my score was 4.74. After just a few months it has jumped to 4.86. At Starbucks I have people so nice there that they sometimes give me free drinks and one lady when I was going to buy a rice crispy treat, went ahead and bought it for me using something that was only supposed to be used for herself and she said she could get in trouble using it on her customers.I get invited to more events, people at work are a lot nicer to me, people seem much more appreciative(and I just feed off this stuff... it makes me more compassionate).To be honest, I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and 6 and a half years ago I had my first episode because I was talking celexa and wanted to feel better so I asked my doctor if he could do anything to help me feel better so he prescribed be with remeron and I ended up turning bat sht manic. I thought I felt the best I did in my life. I regret after the experience soo much the way I acted and a lot of my nonsense that really destroyed a lot of relationships, but this may sound pretty crazy, I felt so good that I do not regret the way I felt. Still though I felt good, I never wanted to get that way again. It was a fake happinessI now have been taking Divalproex and no haven’t had an episode. If I was manic, I think I may have noticed ‘something’ by now. People are sure more talkative to me, I’ve been more civil than before and everything around me just seems more balanced.Though I was manic one time in my life so why does my opinion matter!? &gt;.&gt;Lol I’m kidding on that last part.

ChalenesEvilTwin [info] What really fucks with me is that it makes me question my own disability. I am diagnosed with bipolar, on disability and constantly struggling to reengage with society. But am I really sick, or am I just one of "those" people? Am I just blowing my own issues out of proportion or do I legitimately need and/or deserve (to the extent that anyone deserves anything, which is arguable...) the help that I'm getting? Am I jumping on the trendy bandwagon? I really don't want to believe that about myself, but I'm sure no one else does either.I think people with actual gender dysphoria must feel the same way. This "trend" is just diluting and taking away attention from their legitimate struggle, and turning it into a joke. It's awful.Edit because apparently I can't spell dysphoria.

evil-rick [info] I was taking it when I was about 16 and had the opposite reaction. Prozac made me severely depressed but a lot better at hiding it. Finally I got angry that I was depressed one night and took the whole bottle, then I started taking every pill in the cabinet. Just a few weeks ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder which explains why regular anti-depressants have an adverse reaction with me. But it also tells me that these facilities are playing a dangerous game with kids that they probably can’t even speak to. Forcing a child to take any sort of medication without knowing their current mental or physical health is pure American cruelty. [info] None [info] 1533053556

gimv [info] Exactly. It makes me really mad because I was eventually going to tell everyone, obviously. This is family I see on a semi-regular basis, I was OBVIOUSLY not going to ignore the huge scar across my neck, but come on?! Was it that hard to allow ME to break the news about my situation? I don't think so. So far I've been going to other doctors (cardiologists, radiologists) and she's asked how it went (despite the fact that I'm not talking to her), and I'm giving her the tl;dr of everything: "fine", "I might look for another doctor", "I'm on meds now", etc. I think it's funny though how some things are worthy of telling, but others are worthy of shame. I was diagnosed with bipolar over a year ago. NO ONE in my same extended family knows. Maybe because it's mental illness isn't cool or glamorizing and tragic as cancer can be and wouldn't bring her much sympathy. Never worth mentioning. [info] None [info] 1533074048

Universaling [info] When I was 3, my parents divorced and the reason why was very blurry to me. I knew my dad didn't take his meds for his bipolar and he did a lot of shit without them.They remarried each other when I was 15 because my dad was finally taking care of himself and was a lot of help. We were about to move 500 miles away so they got hitched fast When I was 17, I was hospitalized for a mental break where I was diagnosed with bipolar as well and this sent their tiffs into arguements. My mother started confining herself to two rooms of the house and my dad was smoking 4 packs a day and got aggressive if he didnt, so bills were getting behind. I had to kick my dad out of the house when I came home from college. My brother and I got $100 between us and told him to pack his shit and go.  Not long after that, I found out that he never wanted to have me and tried to kill me as a toddler. So I cut him off. We havent spoken since 12/29/15. Occasionally I'll look on his facebook. He recently had his leg amputated. He hasn't posted in almost 10 days so I think he's in the hospital again. I wish the pain of his death would happen already so I can move on.

twomillionfreckles [info] I was also misdiagnosed and told I had bipolar disorder and was put on a mood stabilizer. That was a couple of years ago when I was not in a very good place and I’m sure I exhibited depressive symptoms, but I always just felt something didn’t line up. While I could relate to some of the stuff I read online or the people I talked to about it, I just didn’t feel like that was what was wrong. I wasn’t diagnosed with ADHD until about a year and a half ago, when I went to a new psychiatrist after I moved. I just made the appointment so I could get my prescription for antidepressants refilled, but it ended up being so much more beneficial! I gave him the rundown of my mental history and he seemed very confused as to why I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He asked if I wanted to address my ADHD and talk about medication options for that and then it was my turn to be confused. I told him that wasn’t what I was there for and that he was mistaken because I don’t have ADHD. He just said, “Well, I’m pretty sure you do, so let’s talk about that!”It was like a whole new world once I started looking into ADHD and talking to people with it! I always thought that it was just what people called kids who couldn’t sit still or that adderall was only for helping with homework...oh my god, was I wrong! Just because you are a girl in her early 20s who did well in school and nobody thinks you are “annoying” doesn’t mean you can’t have ADHD and don’t let anybody tell you any different! It’s incredible what a correct diagnosis and a little research about it will do!

The_duke_of_hickster [info] I agree with this. When I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was placed on an SSRI and a ‘mild’ benzo. I became so manic that it was dangerous. I was then placed on an antipsych and wellbutrin, which was significantly better but I eventually still went into a manic phase.

FemaleScientist17 [info] So I just finished my third year of grad school in molecular biology and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder this past year even though things have been rough for the past two years and I didn’t know why. I have not taken a leave of absence but it has been on my mind a lot. For me work and education was the most important thing my entire life, but when my world fell apart I have learned that you have nothing if you don’t have your health. My PI doesn’t know about my diagnosis but he does know that I have health issues. He is understanding about me having to be at appts and sometimes even taking a day off. I work as hard as I can in lab, but I don’t overdo it because that can be chaotic for me. As for labmates, they don’t know my diagnosis either, but know I have health issues. If they were actually nicer and more understanding people I might tell them, but knowing them rather well I feel like they would be judgemental. Everyone’s situation is different so telling then or anyone is something you should think about and base on your experiences with those people, which can be really scary but also can be rewarding in the end. As for the leave of absence, if you feel that is what’s best and will help you find your footing then do it. Ultimately, taking care of your mental health will make your life better overall. Good luck and stay strong. Keep working on yourself and on your science!  [info] None [info] 1533703711
4OtherNothing [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar. Didnt believe that but I also didnt have a better answer. I stopped beating myself up about not seeing it though when it struck me that, hey, I've been this way my entire life!

icycascades [info] I was the same way. Completely fucking depressed out of my mind went into physics because lots of work. Picked up every other hobby. Then I finally went to the psychologist at my college. I got some antidepressants and did a semester of group. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 after the saddest worst summer of my life. This was a year after noticing major problems when I started college. If you don't have insurance many psychologists work on a sliding scale. I was diagnosed by my general practitioner so there are many outlets to finding out what's up. I took time off college to actually figure out what I wanted which I still don't know for sure. Even though I've had to cut most people out of my life, I'm the happiest I've been.Also I worried about getting behind in school but that's bullshit. Currently 21 and a sophmore. My grandma finished two bachelors degrees when she was 32 after having 2 kids and went on to get a masters by 35, and after that she changed career paths 7 times, so it's literally never too late to change your life. You aren't stuck at 19 by any means. Although if you want to go for surgery, then do but From personal experience I can say that once you start really looking into your desires for life and your motivations, everything can change.TLDR: Although maybe I've rambled, but basically your university has resources that allow you to go to therapy for free. Group and solo. Many therapists/psychologists work on a sliding scale. Your GP can prescribe antidepressants or refer you to a psychiatrist. Just don't get discouraged if things aren't perfect immediately, If I had I wouldn't be here to ramble off in your ear. [info] None [info] 1533744090
lobotomydave23 [info] February of 2017 I tried to kill myself, was doing drugs before that (cocaine, fentanyl, xanax). Stress of college was really getting to me and I realized I wasn't as smart as I thought I was and I was extremely average. I was in a mental hospital for a week, and barely passed most of my classes that semester. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the meds I was taking made me manic as fuck. I married a guy I knew for a month and a half, and a few months later moved to a random state with him I've never been before and had no resources. We both had no job and relied on my school for money. I flunked out because the stress of school was still too much. I got checked in to another mental hospital because I was a danger to myself again. We got evicted from our apartment and we had to move back home. He was abusive and controlling the entire time and accused me of cheating on him 24/7 (he and my mom were the only people I talked to) and he didn't want me to work because of that. I ended up leaving him and now live with my mom again. My mental illness fucks me up so much that the only job I can keep right now is a live in nanny for my brothers and step brothers. I don't get paid but I live there with no expenses. I have a shit ton of student debt that I have had deferred. I have other debt that I'm just ignoring right now because I can't afford to pay it. I have no money, no job, no car. I'm just living day to day trying to survive. I haven't gotten out of it yet. I'm lucky that I have a loving and supportive family or else I would be homeless.

thatsnotincense [info] I can relate (I’m 33). I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 16 and again at 24, but none of the mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics did anything positive for me (but thanks to lithium I have a fine tremor for the rest of my life, so that’s fun) As a last ditch effort my psych put me on Wellbutrin. Finally I showed improvement, (when Wellbutrin became my sole psych med I began to question my bipolar diagnosis, considering taking an SNRI is usually counter indicated due to risk of mania, which never happened), but I’m still having symptoms that are making my life difficult. I finally do some intense research and basically beg my psych to test me for ADHD and tad-a ADHD-PI like whoa.

EmptySighs66x [info] I've dealt with this place for too long that I think I'm just numb to the way they act. Ihad two appointments in one day at this place once. They were only 30 mins apart. I saw my psych at the time (the first one) first and my therapist (my second out of five) afterwards. Apparently the therapist wasn't swaping notes back and forth with the psych and she wasn't reading the ones the psych sent her. I was diagnosed with bipolar by the psych that day and when I mentioned it to my therapist, she went and googled statistics telling me chances of me being bipolar at 16, chances of it being hereditary (my grandmother, and mother are bipolar), and etc. She had me so upset by saying that there was no way that I was bipolar when my psych had diagnosed me less than twenty minutes prior. She had time to read that note as it put at the very top of my file as a new diagnoses. I told her that from then on, she needed to he informed about my file before I showed up and walked out of her office and left the appointment so early that my dad knew something was up.  I didn't see her again after that and the company continued screwing me over. I lost faith after being there a year and changing offices didn't change anything apparently.

I'm also deep in the closet about that, most people don't even know that I like men.I can't talk to people, I just assume everyone hates me, like I find it hard to imagine that anyone genuinely likes me, even if they tell me otherwiseI usually just want to die, like I hope some horrible accident happens and just kills me, I think about that on a daily basis. Every time a truck, bus, or train goes by, I fantasize about jumping under it I usually deal with my emotions by smoking weed and falling asleep, I can't sleep without it, I feel anxious 24/7 without itTherapists are expensive, so I vent on Reddit [info] None [info] 1534160209
trevmike [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar several years ago. I started meditating (not just concentration meditation like mindfulness, but transcending to the Unified Field) and my bipolar is completely managed. Without medication. The meditation brings in information from the Field that informs the cells (in this case neurons) how to properly function at a more optimal, desired level. Epigenetics. And I had Crohn’s disease and did the same for that. No more medication.  [info] None [info] 1534166032

ketothrowaway95 [info] Holy shit! When I was eating SAD, I couldn’t stay awake through an entire day, I couldn’t get my body out of bed in the morning. I was diagnosed with bipolar II as an adolescent and during my last semester I reached a point where my depressive spells would last much longer than they did before my weight gain. It was a vicious cycle of being addicted to sugar and carbs and using them to cope with feeling like shit. My first week of keto I woke up on my own before my alarm clock almost every day and I had so much energy it was hard to fall asleep. I’m more frequently manic than I am depressive now (4.5 months keto adapted with IF), and it’s so much better to have than energy and be able to channel it into school/art/exercise rather that not having the energy to do anything at all and coping with carbs/sugar. I wish I started keto last winter, I wouldn’t be retaking 2 classes if I had! I’ve heard of keto helping people with epilepsy as well. It’s so mind blowing how much better my life is now that I’m not making myself sick every day via the SAD Americans are indoctrinated with, and it pisses me off that there’s so much misinformation being spread about a WOE that’s helped me SO MUCH. After experiencing that change, I won’t eat any other way.  [info] None [info] 1534293298

CuriousQuill [info] Only love can hurt like this. Unrequited love, at seventeen, will affect your brain chemistry just as much as the roll call of substances you've taken for the pain. When your heart gets emptied out like that, you do what you need to fill it up. A broken heart leaks though, so you keep on pouring the shit in... and your heart doesn't heal. I hope you can keep up your sobriety. You have a lot of insight. I was suicidal when I was 30, after I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I thought my life was over. The next 10 years were a struggle. And life still is a struggle. But those 10 years were also filled with life and love and genuine happiness at times, and although they were hard to live I am glad I lived them - even the really shitty parts. Bad experiences make for good stories: today's catastrophe is tomorrow's amusing anecdote. And remember: you are only a truly rounded human being if you have had your heart broken. Good luck in your future. IWNDWYT [info] 9 days [info] 1534501971
PM_me_punanis [info] This is basically me except I have no affinity to certain noises, textures and smells. I thought I was just an angsty teenager. Or it was just a phase. Or just stress from school. At age 27, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I thought I was just depressed from the stress of medical school. But no. I graduated, moved to another country for a fresh start, got married, now a housewife that supposedly should have zero stress... And I still feel the highs and lows. I get anxious and can feel my heart rate going up in social situations. It is crazy and it's been getting worse. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have wasted the best years of my life in nursing school and medical school, aggravating my symptoms even further with so much physical and emotional stress. (We had 36 hour shifts for 2 yrs, no holidays, exams all the time, plus the fact that I see so much suffering every day, with the very real feeling that you have zero capacity to help someone because you aren't god.) Working in that field would kill me. Also, if I had known how much the medications would ruin my brain, I probably wouldn't have taken them. Yes, I stopped trying to kill myself after the 3rd time with the help of meds, but my entire life, I was the "smart one" and now my memory is shit.What am I if I wasn't the smart one? It's been a struggle but I shifted my focus on being the best wife. If my purpose in life is to support my husband, then that is what I am doing. I will always do my best in whatever I do, within the bounds of reason and within my limited capacity. I still feel so useless, from being so productive, I just spend my days doing housewife things.. But I'm proud to say I have made a bit of progress. [info] None [info] 1534593428
MadTheologian [info] Hi!Before we approach the contraception question, the bigger question must be asked: What is the true Church?  My Lutheran background informed me that I can identify Church by two tenets: whether Christ is preached via the Word, and whether the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper are administered.  If a congregation preaches Christ as described in the Bible-- the Son of God, our Savior, if the congregation can say that their teaching comes from the passing down from generation to generation and not merely pulled out of thin air, if the congregation offers the Sacraments, that is a good indicator that you belong there.  And you know, you belong to the true Church because you are baptised in the name of the Triune God.  The fact you care about belonging to Christ means that you \*do\* belong to Him.  My late husband and I opted for sterilization prior to marriage for medical and genetic reasons.  It was not an easy decision.  I thought we were selfish until events later in life unfolded.  I was diagnosed with bipolar I (which means I must take medicine that will affect fetal development) and my husband later suffered from dementia.  It was not an act of selfishness that we decided but it was instead an act of prudence.  Consider: your wife has a disease that requires her to take medicine.  You know her more than some guy who only has an encyclical in his hand.  Prudence is when you realise your wife would not be OK in various ways if she got pregnant.  I say that you are NOT selfish.  Ultimately, we all make decisions out of our limited finite minds.  God gave you reason to make sure you and your wife's wellbeing are intact.  We all will make error, but be comforted as we do live under the shadow of the Cross.  I hope this helps.Yours,Carol   [info] Smalcald Anglican (ACNA) [info] 1534600824
-prideandfight- [info] I don’t think I “fried my brain,” but I definitely will not be the same person after taking certain drugs... I was taking Zoloft at the time and I did ecstasy/Molly a couple times and ever since that my moods have been incredibly unstable, I got so much more emotional and began cycling through emotions quickly, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and currently take lithium. I was big on psychs for a while as well which ended up making me very paranoid and disconnected from myself and my surroundings, at one point I would occasionally hallucinate while sober. I can still function as a human being but I am in far worse shape mentally and emotionally than I was before drugs. [info] None [info] 1534604910

dollski- [info] It is weird how the cards work out, and how well they reflect our experiences. I have no experience in psychology, I'm diagnosed with bipolar II with psychotic features (but pretty sure I am schizoaffective, I've been experiencing psychotic episodes since childhood). These are just my personal reflections and experiences; Nine of Swords really just screams out scattered paranoid thoughts &amp; mental anguish to me (also the figure reminds me of my many nights up in bed trying to block out voices). The Moon; luna, lunatic, crazy. Secret shadows in the mind. I've seen the lunar effect when I worked in the nursing homes. In some shamanic cultures the mentally ill are seen as healers and their experiences as spiritual emergence, which is why I associate The High Priestess with mental illness when she is reversed.

The old, push harder when you're down, steady on the break when you're up. I was diagnosed with bipolar before I left school (turned out that it wasn't a correct diagnosis and that it was drugs causing the mania etc) but from my own experiences of mania and deep valleys a lot of things can go wrong where you might trigger something else due to lack of sleep/food etc or thought patterns and suspicions can lead to some delusions etc. &amp;#x200B;Trust your doctor, if he/she says it's temporary then just follow the right path and you should be in the clear.

sketchypudding [info] This is literally me. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 14 years old and I felt the same way like I was just faking it. IDK why I would fake it it's not like being bipolar is a desirable thing. But unfortunately, almost 10 years later, I still feel the same way. However, after years and years of trial and error I have finally found a cocktail of meds that would only work on someone who is bipolar, so that kind of reassures me that this is who I am and it's not all in my head.

purplelion324 [info] I'll tell you a recent story, even though this isn't my main account lol. About a year ago I became severely depressed and suicidal. Even attempted once (with pills). This went on for months. Then one day a switch went off and I was happy. Too happy. Did a lot of dumb things I normally wouldn't (sex/ONSs, spending money etc). I didn't sleep for days on end. I was diagnosed with bipolar. It took months to figure out medications. I'm still not completely happy with it. I'm still picking up the pieces. I lost 6 months of productivity in my PhD work and I can't forgive myself for that. I'm disgusted by the stuff I did at that time. I feel like I have to carry this secret around and nobody will ever truly understand how much I hate myself for the things I did or the derailing of my PhD for months. I have told a few people I'm bipolar and they are understanding for the most part but they don't know the things I did. I feel like a walking lie and the burden of carrying this around is incredible.Now the positive part. I'm back at it with my PhD. I won't quit. Because literally nothing can be worse than I felt over that year and I still stayed in the program and did my best to work during that time. I've experienced something way worse than &gt;95% of grad students and I didn't quit.If I can do that, I can do anything. [info] None [info] 1535564873
MinorArcanaMonk [info] &gt;Why are you repeatedly referring to fair criticism of your recent posting history as a "witch-hunt" against you? Because that's what I believe it to be. I'm sorry if my point of view isn't understood. &gt;As far as I remember, you returned to this sub with an apology for many of the things you had said to others, including encouraging potentially dangerous psychic links with yourself and other potentially malevolent consciousnesses. So which is it? Are you sorry for what happened, or were you unfairly and unjustly the target of a witch hunt? I am both sorry and was unfairly/unjustly the target of a witch hunt. Let me go deeper into what happened to me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Being bipolar means you have high highs and low lows. I was in the high high state a few weeks ago. In this high high state I felt on top of the world and very male, but also still respectful of people. If I came across as scary to some, that is their decision. It was not my intention to be scary. Like I said, high highs. Didn't take any drugs. Havent taken any non prescription drugs since February. Meaning: I haven't smoked weed since end of February.  [info] None [info] 1535633601
ACoN12217 [info] Oh my God. I thought I was the only one.I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 9 or so (my parents constantly reminded me that they paid an expert, who literally wrote the book on bipolar children, $1000 to diagnose me) and was on about 1500 mg of anti-psych and anti-depressants from the time I was 8 till I was about 25. I am also adopted, and the only one on the family who was abused in this way. By calling me crazy and telling me I was lucky my parents kept me with my supposed condition, it kept me subservient to them and worshipping my family for doing me such a charity and "accepting" me.I went off the pills cold turkey about a year and a half ago, and my parents did not approve. The therapist and psychiatric nurse I was seeing though, did approve and tell me there is absolutely nothing wrong with me mentally other than panic disorder I developed from the trauma.It really bothers me that the doctor my parents took me to (as well as the therapist I saw from age 7-14) went along with this and kept perscribing me more pills.  My parents believe the doctors I see must just be going along with my story because they feel bad for me or some such, and my whole family truly believes I still have bipolar and need to be on a sedating level of medications for the rest of my life. It is the biggest impetus I had to go NC.I have recently gone no contact and began exploring and trying to accept the fact that this was abuse. The kicker is that this was only the tip of the iceberg, and there was also physical and verbal abuse beyond the medical stuff. While I don't wish harm on anyone, there is some comfort in knowing I wasn't alone. [info] None [info] 1535809240
summerrainchain [info] This is going to be a bit long.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder few years into my undergrad. By the time I was sufficiently well, I had bombed my undergrad average and been rejected from the grad program that I had been stalking for years. I had to stop working too, and I'm only just starting to look for a job, knowing that it will be part time because I cant go hard like I used to. I was a computer science major and I wanted to be a data scientist, I worked multiple jobs, did all the internships, worked for my department...and here I am!I feel like a chronic work in progress, like I have to work harder than everyone else just to be well and frankly I'm not so sure that is well understood. It really sucks to have to be the one to step  back to "recover" from difficult feelings, or that dread when I feel myself sinking. You know how everyone looks super put together (whether or not its true?) I found out recently that my peers felt that I appeared to have something seriously wrong, but they didn't know what to do. So I feel pretty transparent, too. I have gone through resenting my diagnosis, asking "why me?" trying to ponder the idea that it was wrong and that I'm actually fine. As my mindset has evolved through the years, I've realized that a lot of what I'm going through as residual of my experiences (so far) are kind of a matter of perspective. I thought the whole thing was pretty ugly, which is fair, but it doesn't have to be the entire story.It took my diagnosis to help me realize that I really was not doing a good job taking care of myself, and whether or not it had manifested as a condition, in the end I was dooming myself to crash and I would not have been happy, even if I had accomplished all the things I set out to do. Don't get me wrong, it is cripplingly painful to realize that (imo) there are new limitations to my life and they do not afford me the path that I had preferred, but there are many different ways to achieve a goal, and there are different ways to essentially satellite around the same idea. It is okay to take time to grieve where you were, and I'm sure you will continue to feel some suffering and failure about where you actually are. But give some consideration to the idea that you are doing such a great service to yourself by trying to be well-- it scares me to think of how much suffering would be possible without the interventions that occured, and to imagine moving on in life in a way that would be painful every second, fighting so hard to be who I want to be when it didn't need to be that way. You are an intelligent, capable person still, and when you go forward you are doing it with a new set of skills and insight that is unique to your experiences, and I think you will be doing it with a great deal of devotion. Taking the time to build yourself up and learn how to cope is an investment that will bring you closer to where you want to be.You came out of a difficult situation with a high degree of certainty, and I think you should be proud that it lives within you. In terms of feeling unprepared and worried you'll fail-- I get that too, so much. Especially with academics. But there are a few things to consider with that-- first of all, you are allowed to ask for help. I'll tell you most people mentally ill or not could stand to learn this. It is possible that your school offers resources to help you if you find that you are struggling. This could mean tutoring, but it also means accessibility services (assignment extensions, different testing circumstances, and so on) and talking to your professors. Getting to these points is sort of like dipping your toes in the water. I set up a meeting with the head of the grad program I wanted to be in to run over how we could work with this, and what was available to me. Is it possible for that to happen for you?But more importantly, I think in our circumstances it is so important to be conscious of our own experiences. That means when you start to find yourself having difficulties, you act right away-- you don't try to wait and see what happens. And if you find that help isn't sufficient, give yourself permission to step out of a course, take a break-- it is okay to do that. It is worse to try and force yourself through a course 3 times (That's me!) than it is to say "this isn't working, I need to re-evaluate myself/my plan." You are your most significant safety net when things get difficult.The best thing you can do is give yourself permission to try, because you need forgiveness to get through this. You need to challenge the idea that you cannot, in favour of the idea that you can-- even if it doesn't look how you anticipated it. I wanted to start working again after being out since my diagnosis, so I started volunteering several hours a week. Then I went for part time, and when I feel ready, I'm going to move up again. Sometimes stepping stones are a luxury, but if you can see them in your path and you feel cautious about your ability to succeed, don't punish yourself for feeling it out before jumping in.So much love to you. I hope that at least a fraction of my words are purposeful and that you can find a place where you feel better about where you are, and believe in your ability to get further. I have to tell you-- when I hear about fellow bipolar individuals who push for what they want despite the challenges they face, I feel a bit more brave myself. Might be worth looking out for some support groups, and see that success has many faces and they can be good. It's good to be reminded that there is possibility, no matter what it looks like.

seekingzen1 [info] Okay OP, you’ve been given some great advice here that mostly can be worked in after you have quieted your mind.  I’m an academic, PhD and bipolar.  I also am a bit older than a typical I went straight through from my undergrad to MA and then PhD.  Why?  I chose to get some life experience to work out what I wanted to do and then in my PhD, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had a 3 year pause before I finished.So I’m going to start in a different place. And please don’t answer these questions here.1.  Type of Bipolar 1 or 2.  If 1. Are you high functioning, medically compliant and able to function or are you struggling in any of these areas.  If you’re struggling in any of these areas, put education to the side.  Get treated, get functional, and maintain for a year before looking at school again.  Type 2, is it managed?2.  An associates is a respectable degree!  Can you do what you would like with it?3.  Is it your goal to finish undergrad or are you fulfilling a promise to your grandfather.  If you do this, you have to be in it for your own reasons...a degree has to be more important to you than it is to wanting to please someone else.  Your grandfather sounds amazing but is he accepting?4.  What type of support system do you have?  Are you accepted and supported?  If not, I would start looking for that support from other people and communities.  There is a great bipolar community here.OP, I think before you can find answers to these questions about school and work, you need to make mental health your first priority.  If it is great!  If it isn’t,  I can empathize bc making decisions when symptomatic is often impossible or unwise.  Can you talk to your grandfather?  Is he supportive?  And finally you have to establish a support system that you can rely on.  That knows you, supports you, guides you and keeps you compliant if needed.  I think if you address these things first, you will find there are interdisciplinary majors that would allow you to combine your interests.  Set some measurable goals and truly figure out is school is the best avenue at this time.  Once I stopped living by someone else’s definition of time, I made much more progress!Feel free to dm me!

There are different types of bipolar though, and different treatments that can vary in effectiveness from person to person. I've found for myself that Lamictal (an antiseizure drug used as a mood stabilizer) keeps me pretty level. The biggest thing though is routine.

clumsyrunner [info] Don't sell yourself short to yourself. You're an amazing human.I experienced a massive acquired brain injury (ABI) 5 years ago this November. I've re-learned to speak, read, write, and think in English; I've learned to breathe on my own, stand, walk, and am currently learning to jog and run again.My memory is shot; I've forgotten most of my pre-ABI life, and though I've been able to begin to remember some of it, I will eventually forget that I've already remembered it before. For example, I've remembered losing my baby in a car wreck when I was 19 (I'm still in my 20's) - multiple times. But I'm able to hold on to the memories longer and longer each time I remember. Thanks, neuroplasticity!Last year I was diagnosed with bipolar type II with psychopathy and schizoaffective traits. I've attempted suicide several times in the last 5 years, both before and after my psychological diagnosis. I kept seeing images of people writing or drawing on themselves rather than self-harming. Now (as of maybe 2 weeks ago), I use non-toxic, skin-safe markers to draw on myself rather hurting myself.Killing myself has been on my mind near daily for the past year, but being able to look at things I've placed around my apartment to help me remember who I am and what I've been able to survive, keeps me alive.So, anytime you feel like or think of doing IT, take a moment think of what you've been through in your short life; make it your goal to live through the next hour. Then, live through the next 8 hours, day, week, month, year. Repeat. Take it moment by moment, step by painful step, and never give up because t's never been better than making it to the moment you're living now.You'll be okay. Never give up. It's never been better. You're okay. Stay alive. You're still okay. [info]  [info] 1536243330
bp2buddy [info] Please don't apologize for sharing your thoughts. It was very poignant and something that I truly needed to hear. I don't know, maybe I respond well to metaphors. I don't like the thought that adulthood comes with dealing with these types of situations that don't easily have a happy ending. And I don't mean easy as in everything falls into your lap precisely the way you want it to with zero effort put forth, I mean in the way that working hard and trying your best actually gives you what you want instead of hitting a wall after you gave everything to achieve your goals... It's painful to think of life that way. You're not reaching in assuming that I'm doing this, in part, to prove to myself that I am better than my family. Especially my mom. I believe everyone when you say that my caring, compassion, and the things that I've done so far is proof enough that I am better than them and her but if the end result is the same -- if he ends up back on the streets, homeless in the snow, disconnected from reality -- am I really any better? Intent vs impact matters to me. But I think I might be thinking too simply about that. All the same, it still feels like an emotional hump I have to scrapple my way over.I just don't want to fail. I can't fail him like everyone else has. I have a hard time getting C's in college courses so to fail at something this important -- I would never be able to look at myself the same way again. But I know that there is a very real chance that I will have to get over that. I recognize that fact because I have been seriously listening to you all and deep inside my rational mind I know that my emotions/hangups/baggage is the true source of my inner turmoil. I took some heavy blows, mentally, a few years ago and soon after that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I could not be any less mentally equipped to handle this mental weight, as you put it. I don't understand why I am so irrationally upset at not being strong enough to shoulder this massive weight. I wouldn't beat myself up for not being able to lift a bus off of a bunch of children. But I would do everything in my power to find someone or something that could do what I cannot. I think that's what I'm doing here (which is a change in my course because previously, I was going to shoulder even more of this burden and find him all the resources he needed by myself and not get him a case worker. Poor judgement on my part) but even that much has been hard.Thank you for talking to me and sharing your thoughts. It's such an abstract concept to think that you've seriously impacted the life of a strange you've never even met before but I hope really good things come to you for the time you've taken to help me through such an impossible situation.

SliferTheExecProducr [info] I was very briefly on Adderall before I was diagnosed with bipolar, which I *loved* . I didn't realize until years later that my experience was not that of most people, and the reason I loved it was because it made me regular-manic rather than my usual angry hypomanic. It was the first time I had felt good and motivated in about a decade. [info] None [info] 1536502443

cheweduptoothpick [info] I'm 40, diagnosed at 36 after an incorrect diagnosis of bipolar when I was 16. I am a master of masking and by the time I was diagnosed with bipolar,  could have already won an Oscar for my acting ability although I had no interest in acting at all. I was operating from a place of making people comfortable. I had so much confusion about social tradition, dating and everything that I just emulated people around me.  My parents were extremely supportive of my quirks, my brothers too,  he is undiagnosed however definitely autistic, and my father also. I basically just tried to not be too weird. I have hyperlexia and my grades at school were great,  but my behaviour was poor so schooling was a seesaw. I hated clothes and would try to wear as little as possible, except in winter as I'm super sensitive to cold. My brother and I both couldn't have the seams of our socks touching us,  his ears were supersensitive and my stims are making noises so we triggered each other into meltdown a lot (my poor Mam). Getting an actual diagnosis has helped me by being able to know my limits and remove myself from situations that are too intense for me. My workplace is supportive,  although it's rife with mental illness so nothing is taboo.  [info] None [info] 1536563198

AndItsAders [info] Sharing experience here:I was 18 when I got pregnant, my kid’s dad was also 18. We were still kids ourselves. I lived with my mom so she provided a cushion as well as his mom and stepdad, but it was still a struggle. I binge drank for 3 years, he became addicted to heroine. I got sober at 22 and he went to rehab and did methodone withdrawal. At 24 I was diagnosed with bipolar and a plethora of other mental health issues. Ultimately by about 26 we both had our lives in order. He went to work in his dad’s successful business and found an amazing girlfriend who became his wife a few years ago.  I went to college and got my degree and work at a fancy shmancy  private school. My mental illness IS very serious and was hospitalized earlier this year. Our child is now 16 and has been in therapy since 12.It takes work and effort, which is daunting. The love of your child can give you the motivation to make it work.You and your girlfriend may not stay together and that’s fine. It was more important to love our child than try to love each other. I admire and respect him and he always come through. Helps with moves, lends me money when emergencies pop up ( he is much more successful than I am in regards to earnings).We are 35 now and an amazing parenting team. Our kid is nearly launched, an assistant manager at work and an honors student. It can be done and it’s the best way I could have spent my life.Manage your medication, go to therapy, get some training in a growing field. You can do this. And if you can’t do it with her you can do it alongside her. Good luck friend. [info] None [info] 1536605475
coffeeandjesus1986 [info] My ex boyfriend-emphasis on ex. Almost 14 years ago he was drunk one night and I told him I wouldn’t go out with him that night he was drunk and I wasn’t going to be the designated driver. Plus I was sick of his abuse when he was drinking. He had raped me twice previously, tripped me down a flight of stairs because I wasn’t paying enough attention to him I hit my head on concrete knocked me unconscious but I stayed I thought it was my fault.It escalated. That night he took my no as an insult. He punched me in the nose, busted my lip and gave me two black eyes. He then proceeded to choke me and then I fell to the ground. He then using his steel toed boots (famous brand begins with a “T”) to kick me in the ribs and delicate areas. I started screaming help and then in the far corner of my eye I saw my best guy friend as it faded to black. Best guy friend I found out slugged him in the face and drug him away from me. I don’t remember this but I told him take me home just don’t tell anyone. I awoke in the backseat of my car in absolute agony watching the street lights go by I was under the blanket I kept in my car. Best guy friend was taking me home. I blacked out again woke up in my bed with him staying with me. The next day he called my girlfriend (not lover just best friend) so they arranged a meeting telling me to leave him. I will never forget looking in my bathroom mirror my face was bloody and black and blue. I had a bruise from my armpit to hip and my ribs hurt. I never saw him again I never pressed charges I tried to move on with my life.I entered therapy 5 years ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and complex ptsd from the abuse. I still have nightmares and I still flinch sometimes when I’m touched. I have a beginning of a uterine prolapse from the abuse. I’m married to an amazing husband who has never hurt me pushed me to get help and has been by my side through it all. Domestic violence is horrible I’m just glad I’m alive.

lexcanon [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar about a year ago, and was prescribed lithium. I took it for a while, but it never felt right to me because personally it felt like a shortcut. I’m sure that a lot of lives have been saved because of medicine, even lithium in particular. I’m not trying to say that everyone should be like me or anything. I’m just saying that I felt like taking medicine or trying to find medicine that will “fix” me was like .. someone else doing my homework. Sure, it gets done, but now the whole point of it is moot because I didn’t learn anything, or grow as a person. I’m spiritual which has a lot to do with it, but I chose to give up the shortcuts and work very very hard to have my moods be self manageable. And it worked! I’m more content than I’ve ever been and I know how to let my low moods come and go without attaching to them. I made this decision right after seeing a video of middle aged woman whose organs were failing after having been in lithium for so long. If medicine were the solution to my problem, it wouldn’t create more problems. I’m glad that I was confident enough in myself to go against the advice of my doctors... who never even had a chance to know what I was capable of without them. [info] None [info] 1536765109
smoothazbutta [info] First and foremost you need to take care of yourself first. How are you coping with your bipolar disorder? Are you on medication? Are you seeing a Dr? Do you have someone you can confide in? Please make sure you are taking care of yourself first because no matter what job you take you will always bring yourself with. If you are not in the right state of mind all jobs will seem horrible.  You are so strong. One of my favorite quotes is "you wake up every morning to fight the same demons that left you so tired the night before, and that, my love, is bravery." The fact that you are still pushing through is so great. Your time spent in publishing was not a waste at all! I am sure you learned some very valuable things while working for a publishing company AND THEN doing freelance work! That's great! Take the things that you learned that you excelled in and bring those to any job you take. (example: I have great customer services skills. Now i worked in an office but I still carry those customer services skills with me to every job). If you really want to go back into publishing have you ever considered reaching out to old contacts and explaining your situation? I know it is extremely hard to talk about mental illness but maybe reaching out and saying "Hey, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 5 months ago. When I was not diagnosed I had a manic episode and did some things that were out of my character but I am now properly diagnosed and doing much better now. Would you consider allowing me to work on a project again?" (only say that if you and your Dr. truly think that you are better.) If your heart isn't set on going back to publishing try something new! Who cares if you don't end up doing the publishing gig anymore. You are the person who has to go in and work that job everyday so YOU might as well enjoy it. There is no expiration date on our goals. Morgan Freeman didn't get his breakout role until he was 52!  Colonel Sanders, was 62 when he started Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC)! I saw on TV the other day they had Track and Field competitions for people who are 100+ years old! You are never too old to do anything!Peace and love my friend. Good luck with the job hunt :)  [info] None [info] 1536778500

Been involuntarily committed about a year ago, came out, graduated with honors, went onto a graduate program, graduated again with honors. Had a very serious manic phase where I was having a bout of paranoia (i.e., when the apocalypse comes, dinosaur heads will be the new currency, so I went about collecting them), and a few "less serious" manic phases in which I got four tattoos in less than 3 months.

crochetingpenguin [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar at 15. I'm still not sure if I'm 1 or 2, I've been to many psychiatrists and none of them can seem to agree even though I tell them all the same thing. I rapid cycle though; I get at least one manic episode a month, always followed by a depressive phase, and my mood rapidly swings all over the place multiple times throughout the day. I drank to deal with all of it. When I drank I felt normal; I didn't notice manic or depressive phases. I'm on pretty hefty medication for it now and even that isn't really working. I know I can't start drinking again but sometimes I want to just to feel that semblence of normal again, even if it is just for a few hours. [info] 74 days [info] 1537075040
aboyhasn0name [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar, GAD and panic disorder. Lamictal + Xanax has been a winning combination for me lately. Just be careful with the Xanax, it can be a slippery slope. It makes me feel so "normal" and that can be addicting. So I try not to take it every day.Klonopin or Valium are slower acting benzos that stay in your system longer than Xanax. So the peaks and come down are gentler. Ativan would knock me on my ass, although I may have just had too high of a dose.May I ask why you rejected the idea of Xanax immediately?

midnight_sparrow [info] Please go back to your doctor. Having a child really does things to your brain and body chemically.I say this with experience as I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of ignoring signs and symptoms. It has saved my life. Literally. My relationship was tanking after almost daily fights. I attempted suicide twice. I'm lucky not only to be alive, but that my boyfriend was a good enough man to stick by me, and who supported me in getting help for me and for our relationship in couples counseling (which I also recommend).Trust me, getting outside help is going to significantly benefit you and your family. Call your doctor and schedule an appointment, and seek a marriage counselor. You'll see major differences in your situation. [info] None [info] 1537405085
LaneyyCakes [info] Hey guys, so I've been dating my boyfriend now for 8 months. He's 22 and I'm 19. We met in college and had the time of our lives together. We're absolutely head over heels for each other and are talking about getting married. The problem is, he graduated last spring and moved to Indiana for grad school while I'm still taking classes in Delaware. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in the spring of last year and shortly after, tried to commit suicide. Since then I've been living at home with my parents and taking part time classes at the University. I absolutely hate living at home and I feel like it's making me feel so much worse about myself. Me and my boyfriend decided to give it a trial run and I went to visit for a week in August. I had the time of my life and he hadnt seen me that happy since we lived together in Delaware. While I was there I decided to stay an extra three days. I called my mom and she proceeded to tell me that I was ruining her summer and that she's disappointed in me. Fast forward to now, me and my boyfriend have decided on moving in together on the 26 of December. I have no doubts this is the right move but the only thing that worries me is telling me parents. Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I'm absolutely horrified to bring this up.  [info] None [info] 1537416821

If you forget to take Quilonum SR, take it as soon as you remember. Do not double the dose to make up for any missed or forgotten doses.&amp;#x200B;Lithium is excreted by your kidneys, but the longer you take lithium, the more it builds up in your body. This is what gives it its protective effect. **To be clear: Your system maintains lithium even if you miss a dose.** This is not a reason to panic.&amp;#x200B;I've been on lithium for several months myself. I've felt the benefits of lithium. It's amazing. I had to reduce my intake from 900mg (effective therapeutic) to 600mg for thyroid related reasons, and it took a week or so for me to start noticing the...loss of the 300mg. I'm no longer in mania-therapeutic level range, **but the change was not immediate.**&amp;#x200B;Bottom line: Don't sweat it. You'll be fine. Call your doctor and discuss the situation when you can.

Aasokeo [info] Keep your chin up. After graduating college, I moved to another state for a really nice job with good benefits. When I was diagnosed with bipolar following a suicide attempt about 6 months later, I lost my job, my apartment and (so I thought) my future. For the next 8 months I lived with my parents, unemployed and feeling like a failure. I managed to recover and find a decent job and even moved out a year after that. But at the beginning of this year I attempted suicide and, once again, I moved back in with my parents one week before my 25th birthday.9 months later, I'm still with my mom and dad, but I'm also stable and feeling truly like myself again for the first time in over a year. Living with your parents isn't glamorous, sure, but I'm reasonably certain that I would not be alive right now if they didn't bring me back into their home. You and I are extremely fortunate to have access to such an awesome support system.Btw I'm making the assumption that your parents are somewhat supportive in the first place. Or at least don't belittle you or are willfully ignorant of what you're going through. I'm sorry you feel lonely. Are there any hobby shops you could go to? Dance/improv/acting classes maybe?

_grottesca [info] Personality disorders are generally considered separate from mood disorders or traditional mental illnesses because they are literally a dysfunction within a person's personality.  A person with bipolar disorder will have periods of stability that last months between episodes, while a person with borderline will sometimes have multiple episodes just in a day.  Personality disorders tend to require regular, frequent therapy because the person literally has to unlearn their personality - let go of bad habits and replace them with normal coping skills, do self control exercises, etc. They're considered REALLY hard to treat because of this - the person has to really want to change.  Treatment for personality disorders is very different from treatment for mood disorders, although people can have both at the same time as well.NOTE: I'm not a psychiatrist or therapist, but this essentially how my therapist explained the difference to me when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

gwenthrowaway [info] I was clinically depressed but I didn't know it. I just thought everything in my life had turned to shit. I took no joy from my job, my hobbies, my books, my marriage. Everything irritated me and I really didn't see any point in continuing my life.So I decided to reboot myself, start over in a new city with a new job, new living situation...get away from all the bad stuff and make a fresh start.I couldn't bear to break my sweet husband's heart by telling him I wanted a divorce, so I had an affair and made sure he found out. That is common enough that marriage counselors have a name for it. I had an "exit affair."Eventually I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder II and I realized that my succession of "reboot" experiences, once every two or three years, had nothing to do with external circumstances. I had thrown away relationships and good living situations and good jobs due to screwed-up brain chemistry.Anyway, that's why I cheated.

yesihaveshatmyself [info] Hey OP. First off, I have so much respect for you. You’re fighting for your partnership while balancing that with your own self care and that’s hard and amazing and important.I was diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD a decade ago. I’ve been a real mess throughout my adult life, and to be honest I still am. And almost as bad as, maybe worse than, my own struggle is seeing the toll it takes on my husband. He’s been dealing with my shit for going on 9 years now and I don’t know how he does it. For all the times I’ve nearly called it quits on my own life, I’m in awe of his ability to not call it quits on the life we share together.I don’t know what kind of person your partner is, but I know from personal experience that when my husband takes time for himself, sets boundaries, airs his grievances, and keeps me in the loop with how my illness affects him I am grateful and humbled. It’s hard to deal with how your sickness effects those you love, but a million times harder when you know that it’s *not* being dealt with at all. Over the years, my husband has taken steps to take better care of himself, and that in turn has had a wonderful effect on our marriage.I’m rooting for you two so hard. I know how much of a struggle it is. But take my advice as a person on the other end: do not set yourself on fire to keep your partner warm. It will burn the both of you. Don’t fall into a caretaker role, it’s hard to dig yourself out of that and it will only hurt both of you. Make your own space and make your needs known. Mental illness is an explanation for behavior but it is never an excuse. He must be accountable just as you must be supportive. I wish you both the very best of luck. [info] None [info] 1538781444

I tried to continue school but had withdraw many consecutive semesters due to bad grades affecting my gpa and was expelled for a year. During that year I was expelled the only reason I got sober was because I ran out of the substance and didn't know where to find any more. I was on that stuff for four years and have been sober for four. [info] None [info] 1538878735
kykapoo [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar, a misdiagnosis, but during an internship I needed to take some days off so it was suggested I speak with HR. I didn't know what I had to say so I told them. I didn't get a job offer, everything pointed to me getting one, and after the intern head was let go she told me it was because everyone found out I was bipolar. That was five years ago. I have never had an actual job. No one within my field would hire me... And in interviews they'd mention they knew the previous place's CEO. Fun. [info] None [info] 1538882627
SmellNoEvil [info] I had a pretty wild time last year - went through a phase of having multiple super-intense (like, omg I think I’m having a stroke) orgasms during sex. My partner and I kept a count one time and I had 40 intense orgasms in the space of 1.5 hours, before we stopped counting. Earlier this year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It turns out that I was hypersexual last year and my libido and sexual responsiveness were off the charts. My orgasm rate and intensity is much lower now that I’m not manic. Interesting fact, though - we discovered that I could cum just from having a certain spot on my back pressed, with no other stimulation required.  [info] None [info] 1538911965

peasantsean [info] I hope this doesn't get too buried, I might be able to help. This story sounds all to familiar to me and I hate to admit it but I really think sharing my thoughts might be of some use. Your bf sounds exactly like the type of guy I was to my ex. The relationship started off great but soon became overwhelmingly toxic. I was very emotionally abusive/controlling. She was the nicest person I have ever met and put up with it for so long because she empathized with my struggles with mental illness. During that time I didn't want to admit I had any issues, in my head everything was her fault. But after a few escalated incidents(similar to your bf - just doing stupid dangerous abuse tactics) I felt like something had to be going on in my head. I knew something was weird with my reactions to things that shouldn't have warranted such a strong reaction. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which makes sense since it runs in the family. But that's not an excuse for the way I acted. That was a starting point to figuring out how to grow. I knew I was abusive. I knew I didnt want to be, and now I knew my manic and depressive episodes contributing to my lack of self worth probably werent helping the situation get any better. &amp;#x200B;Let me just tell you, it WILL NEVER get better. The more you put up with his crap the worse it gets. He needs help. So good on you for finally ending it. You made the best decision possible. Your feelings towards the decision are understandable but please do a lot of research on domestic violence to get some context. &amp;#x200B;So back to a little background on my story: I started to resent myself for being so abusive. Which made the relationship even worse. Every time I couldnt control my anger or be the ideal partner to her I would self harm hoping itll teach me a lesson and id learn to get better one day. And it became this horrible cycle of me abusing her and myself until one day I snapped. We got into an argument and I left her house and sliced up my arm pretty good. I wasnt trying to kill myself, just take control of my emotions...or get help...or maybe even manipulate her?? idk really. But her dad took me to the hospital and I got 19 stitches. Her parents were very supportive of me getting treatment but didnt want me so close to their daughter anymore. The best thing that happened to me was going in and out of psych wards until I found treatment that actually helped. Also, letting go of that relationship so we can both heal was a step in the right direction. It was the only way(looking back on the situation now) that I see the abuse would have ever stopped. &amp;#x200B;I believe 100% that as long as you guys are in each other's lives neither one of you will move on to a healthier future. I now have a daughter and am in a loving relationship with somebody else. There's no abuse on either side and we're constantly growing. But that's because I had to admit I had issues and learn to grow/move on from them. The best thing you can do for yourself is accept the fact that you deserve MUCH better. It's time for you to heal. Do not visit him in the hospital. Dont have any contact with him at all. Its going to be tough but its completely necessary for your safety and well-being. Reach out to some support during this process. Maybe look into getting therapy. Join some sports clubs, find hobbies. Keep yourself distracted and moving forward. &amp;#x200B;So yeah, I dont think domestic violence ever gets better. It ends badly. Personally I think I got lucky by being so passionate about not being an abuser that I forced myself to cut contact with my ex even after she initiated contact months later. He needs to admit he's abusive(to himself), learn to grow and then move on. If he honestly cares about you he'd leave you alone to prevent from causing any more damage. But just like I was, he's manipulative af and cares more about himself. &amp;#x200B;Accept your decision to leave him. And learn to love it. It probably saved your life. &amp;#x200B;Also, if anyone is curious why I think I was abusive, I was thinking about this recently. I think it all came down to the fact that I was very weak. Of course there were a combination of other factors(seeing abuse growing up, mental illness, never learning a healthy way to express emotions etc). But I was weak and had no self worth. So control was the only way I think I found any sort of comfort. It started off small. Like getting annoyed when she talked to other dudes. Then it escalated into full blown screaming at her, attacking her self worth and preventing her from going certain places or speaking to certain people. I hated doing it. But I didnt know any other way. If I knew then what I know now I'd see those early signs of weakness in myself and be mature enough to say "hmmm, getting this jealous isnt a good sign for our future. Maybe I shouldnt be in a relationship at this time..." So, if any of you see those ealry signs in yourself or in a partner really look into ways you can improve the situation. It wont improve on its own.  [info] None [info] 1538924035
thecuddlykrab [info] I feel the same way about my brother. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 but to me, it’s more like looking at the symptoms rather than labeling with a disorder...I just know me and my brother both had mood issues all our lives. Maybe I’m in denial. But I still haven’t even gotten a good control on my own mood disorder yet, I really doubt trying to help my brother will be a good thing :/ I want to help him though. But I guess now isn’t the time because I’ve got to help myself first. It doesn’t help that my mom downplays our emotional problems a lot, and she doesn’t like that I’m going to be taking medication long-term. She doesn’t think anything is ever inherently wrong with me, I guess that’s what a parent is for.  [info] None [info] 1538950207
ilazria [info] I hope my experience will help. I once was a teenage girl with extreme mood swings. After I had my first child, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Now she's almost 15, going through the same rough mood roller-coaster. At your age, I felt the same things. There were times I would plummet to the point I was so depressed, all I could do was curl up and cry. I would think things like how I was complete garbage, a poser. One of those things I felt so awful I thought about taking all of my clothes and stuff and burning them in a giant bonfire. The only thing that stopped me was that I was so depressed I couldn't get out of bed to do it. Then, once the worst of the storm was over, I would feel numb. Empty. There was no joy or sadness. Just nothing. Then, when that passed, it would feel like nothing had happened at all. It was frightening and confusing, to go from feeling so certain that the world was pure shit, to feeling like a meat puppet, then back to normal. First, to some extent, the peaks and valleys are normal. As cliché as it sounds, being a teenage girl comes with some really crappy hormonal attacks. Sure, some girls aren't as severely afflicted as others. Genetics don't play fair. However, when they're so bad they disrupt your normal life, it's important to get help.Don't discard the idea of therapy and medication. I've been going to therapists and psychiatrists for  20+ years. Unfortunately, in the 90s, no one took an emotional goth girl seriously. You are in luck, that there is a much more educated, progressive mental health environment these days. You may have to try a few different doctors and therapists to find the right one for you, but they *are* out there. A therapist is a safe person to vent to. There is something genuinely beneficial in talking to someone completely impartial. Friends and relatives might care, but they're inherently biased, and it's often hard to bring oneself to "burden" them with one's issues. Therapists also help you develop coping skills. They help you identify the triggers and earliest signs of your mood going in a bad direction. They help you understand *why* your mood is doing that. Moods spiral out of control the worst when you don't understand *why* you're so miserable, and feel like you have no control over it. You may start to fixate on something, *anything,* just to feel like you have some control, but because you're not addressing the real problem, you're still stuck in the swing.Medication is also an important tool in some cases. The thing is, you have to understand why you should take it. It's not good as a bandaid. It can work that way, for a time, but if you put a bandaid on a wound that need stitches, you might slow or stop the bleeding for a time, but eventually, it's going to fail. Medication isn't a bandaid, it's a dressing for a wound. Therapy is the stitches. Learning coping skills helps you understand what's causing the wounds, and how to avoid then or make them less dire.It sucks to have to work harder than others to find stability, but it *is* possible, and worth the effort. If your mom is the type of person who has mental health issues, and *doesn't* get help, or doesn't work to maintain her stability, you already have a good example of why that's *not* the way you want to handle things, yourself. It sounds like you are already taking the right steps in choosing to manage your mental health. Now, I will admit that, even though I do know how this all goes, that doesn't mean it's easy to handle with my own daughter. Maybe that's what's going on with your mom. It's tricky. Mother-daughter relationships are already strained by the usually course of growing up. Maintaining mental stability can be hard when one is trying to empathize with someone who is absolutely sure you cannot possibly understand. If there's any part of you that thinks your mom could actually want to help, give it a chance. If she's willing to get you help, try using some of your therapy time for mediation. Sometimes my daughter has me come in for a few minutes during her appointment to discuss things. Having a therapist there helps... translate... if that makes sense. If you can't get help from your mom, try talking with your school guidance counselor. I know our high school has confidential help that kids can ask for. Your school may, also. They definitely will in college.  [info] None [info] 1539010183
gimru [info] Yeah, listen to AiC and Mad Season; the records I mentioned are classics and some songs are pretty self-explanatory, like 'Angry Chair', 'Sickman', 'Junkhead' and 'Would?'. I totally missed AiC in the nineties, but discovered *Dirt* and *Jar of Flies* later and fell in love with them. Also, those records are so different, you can pick a song from a wide array of moods and styles, between [Junkhead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1dT6yI33v0) and [Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_601kPxo1lQ), for example. I also like [What the Hell Have I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKXIk45pL0o), but it's not on those records.I'll tell you what I think about *Proper Dose* later, cause I always need time to assimilate new music and tell something relevant about it ;-)I first dabbled with codeine because I had back pain and, at the time, I could get it over the counter in my country. Later, as I had to deal with a lot of shit in my life, I began using it more and more, then on a daily basis. For reasons not related to my new drug use, my life was getting more and more complicated, spiraling into total craziness. I was exhausted most of the time, working like mad, and had problems in my family. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type II), which made a lot of sense, but was hard to swallow. All hell broke lose. I even snorted heroin, twice, but didn't like it (good thing!). I eventually kicked codeine and asked for medical help. I now have meds and regular consultation to a psychiatrist. I was veeeery surprised when she prescribed me with buprenorphine, but it helped a lot.Bupe is a strange opioid, because you don't get very high from it. It has calming and stabilizing effects, though, and is a mild antidepressant. So I guess it's a good thing for often depressed but uptight, nervous people like me. It also suppresses withdrawal and most of craving for other opioids/opiates. That said, to be fully honest, I still wish I had a few codeine tablets to swallows to get numb. I loved its soothing effects.Later,— gimru. [info] None [info] 1539014763
alliengineer [info] I am also a victim of CSA. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was a teenager and struggling to cope with what happened to me. I was put on medication for 11 years. As an adult I started to go to therapy and I realized I did not have bipolar disorder. The medication was simply keeping my feelings under control and it was unhealthy for me. It took me a very long time to wean off the medicine in a healthy way because my body was addicted and I realize my brain and body will have lasting effects from taking the medication while I was developing. As an adult and not on medication (after about 4 years of therapy) I think my brain has healed quite a bit. I still suffer highs and lows but I feel much more normal now, and I continue to go to therapy when I need it. I don't know if you have bipolar disorder or not but I am telling you that you are not alone, and to really give therapy a shot with a psychologist. My mom had originally sent me to a psychiatrist and all he did was diagnose me and prescribe medication without actually helping.  Take care.  &amp;#x200B; [info] None [info] 1539018865
Wee_Albet [info] TL;DR: Yes, I have mental health problems and one night I was suicidal and we spoke via WhatsApp for 6 hours until I fell asleep. Details on what happened that night:We will do that too. He goes to stay with his mum at the weekend, so we will talk through messaging during the day. But we will also talk through serious things through messaging too.I have mental health problems and before the diagnosis I had was questioned (Sept last year), I had a very bad depressive episode towards the end of July, which lasted throughout August and into February of this year. Very confusing.Anyway, on August 5th last year, I was feeling very low and had decided to take my own life that night, which was a Saturday, so he was at his mums an hours drive away. I had tried calling him and my family and no one had picked up.He had fallen asleep and had woken up at 11:30pm and saw the missed calls. I was sat there, about to carry out the act (no further info will be given on this, so no methods or mention to what I would have done). He didn't know if I would be awake or not and didn't want to wake me of I had fallen asleep, I'd been awake for nearly 4 solid days with no sleep at this point and he hoped I was sleeping.He sent me a message apologising for missing the calls and asked if everything was OK. I couldn't think of anything to say and any way of lying was lost to me at this point, so I simply replied back saying "no" and he tried calling me. I felt completely ashamed about what I was going to do and what I would be leaving him to come home to. I couldn't bear to talk to him on the phone. So I kept rejecting the calls and I was eventually able to get a message over saying I'd talk on WhatsApp.We then went through absolutely everything that had gone one over past few months (which we now know was hypomania, I was diagnosed with bipolar). We spoke about what I was going to be doing and about why I was doing it (an even longer story than this, sorry for this story). For about 6 hours we both sat up and spoke about everything. Not just about how I felt, but also him too.So, yes, we do reach out through messages too, and by doing that, it saved my life.I hope everything is OK on your end. I'm sorry this reply was so long.

gimv [info] Feel you. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the beginning of M3, I graduate next summer, I made it. Medical school obviously did NOT give me bipolar, but it definitely triggered it. It takes a toll on your health: physical, mental and emotional.As one of the other commenter said, school is just a means to an end. I’ve spent 4 years down your path, I understand, my school is crap, curriculum is crap, and they shove theoretical classes + hospital rotations down our throat like if’s apple juice (I have some PTSD from M3, I don’t know how I survived it).Just remember that a school doesn’t make a doctor. You have the possibility of taking your education in your hands and shaping your circumstances in the way that works best for you.I don’t know what year you’re in, but along the way you’ll meet more maddening things (helloooo Step 1), so try to stay cool. Look for help, medication, therapy, support group from your classmates maybe, whatever it takes. Best luck, you got this. [info] M-4 [info] 1539059274
neonred1 [info] My post was removed and directed towards here. I was wondering how I can appropriately secure an internship with a record.Details: when I was 20 I was arrested for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, misdemeanor paraphernalia, misdemeanor battery. Two days later I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder.I went through a trauma which triggered my first documented cycle so I was self medicating. The man I was smoking with wanted to get in my pants and when I refused he turned me into the police for possession. We got into a fight and he got a mark on his wrist and used it to press charges for battery.By the time I graduate from the social work program is will be two and a half years since the incident. The deposition of all three charges is dismissed by the motion of the prosecutor. The ROAs of each charge indicate I went through a diversion program to get the charges dismissed. My state does not allow expungements. My program requires two internships to graduate. We have an internship fair coming up and I don’t know if it’s 1. Appropriate or necessary to self disclose or 2. If there is anything I can do to help up my chances of being successful.  I’m just trying to think of ways that would actually give me a chance and would appreciate any insight or feedback.

The-Harmacist [info] Well I'll give you a hint bud, the drug free approach to my bipolar, while it was undiagnosed, led to me to many visits to the hospital for suicide attempts, and enough incidents where the police were called.

Interestedatheist [info] My PMS used to last two weeks, the week before my period and the week of my period. I was diagnosed with bipolar because it was so bad and I used to cycle between highs and lows so much, but I didn't make the connection to my period until I switched to a contraception that meant I didn't have periods. My moods have been completely stable ever since. Both high and low levels of sex hormones can cause emotional instability, just because hormone levels spike before your period, that doesn't mean that your lower hormone levels during your period wont affect your mood too.

mickcube [info] i know it's not news that kanye doesn't know how to talk but pitchfork printed this transcript and it's incredible how similar it is to how trump speaks&gt; At one point, West discussed why he wears a MAGA hat:&gt; &gt; This hat, it gives me power in a way. My dad and my mom separated, so I didn’t have a lot of male energy in my home. And, also, I’m married to a family that, you know, not a lot of male energy going on. It’s beautiful, though! I love Hillary. I love everyone. But the campaign “I’m With Her” just didn’t make me feel—as a guy that didn’t get to see my dad all the time, a guy that could play catch with his son—it was something about when I put this hat on it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman.&gt; &gt; Later, he discussed the 13th Amendment, which segued into West talking about bipolar disorder:&gt; &gt; I did say “abolish” with the hat because, why would you keep something around that’s a trapdoor? If you’re building a floor, the Constitution is the base of our industry—of our country, of our company—would you build a trapdoor that if you mess up and you accidentally something happens and you fall and end up next to the Unabomber, you gotta remove all that trapdoor out of the relationship.&gt; &gt; The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment—and I think the way the universe works, it’s perfect. We don’t have 13th floors, do we? The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn’t look like the people they were amending. Also, at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read. Or African-Americans to read. And so that meant that if you actually read the amendment, you’d get locked up and turned to a slave! Again.

That you associate someone merely calling out a mental illness as an attempt to degrade them says more about *you* than any of the bullshit you just spouted off.  They didn't say "he's a fuckin basket case let's write him off", they said "It's kinda sad when he dismisses his Bipolar disorder".  The Bipolar disorder that Kanye himself has discussed being diagnosed with. It's not up for debate.&gt;“What I think is we don’t need sentences, we need pardons. We need to talk to people. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and NFL. He looked at my brain,”He said as much in this very meeting being discussed here: [Source](https://people.com/music/kanye-west-tells-donald-trump-misdiagnosed-bipolar-disorder-sleep-deprived/) [info] None [info] 1539365994
Couldawg [info] Please. [Read the transcript](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2018/10/11/kanye-west-donald-trump-and-jim-brown-the-full-transcript/). Forget right-vs-left. Here are some of the points he makes: **1) Cops and Blacks are both victims, being driven towards each other by the system:** &gt; And that’s a major thing about racial tension. And we also, as black people, we have to take a responsibility for what we’re doing. We kill each other more than police officers. And that’s not saying that the police officer is not is not an issue, because they are in a place — a position of power. But sometimes they’re in a place of law enforcement. They need to be law-power. It’s force versus power. And when you — you shouldn’t have to force people to do that. So a lot of times the police officer is sitting there, they’re being forced to do this and forced to do that block. And then they force somebody into something and force into something. Cops are told to "clean up the streets." So they do. They arrest Blacks for crimes, and into the system they go. Once there, they are marked with a record and a Scarlet P (probation), and turned back out. Things don't look good from there...**2) 13th Amendment as a "trapdoor"**&gt; There’s a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment. I did say “abolish” with the hat on. Because why would you keep something around that’s a trap door? If you’re building a floor — the Constitution is the base of our industry, right? Of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you — accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber? You end up — you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship.The 13th amendment abolished slavery. What is this "trapdoor" he's talking about? READ IT: &gt; Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,** shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.Maybe he has a point? The 13th didn't abolish *all* slavery, only *illegal* slavery. *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*... it's right there. Look at the prison system. Loaded with people, most of them Black. You might say, "that's not slavery, that's prison." I refer you to the Scarlet P from above... **probation**. [4.5 million](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2018/04/26/probation_update-2/) are on probation or parole. We are accustomed to viewing that as a *good* thing... after all, they are getting a "break," since they *could* be in prison. But let's change up our perspective here. Why is prison the default? Honestly... because we don't have anything better. Right? &gt; "Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read — or African Americans to read. And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave."Is he wrong? He's talking about how petty bullshit spirals into a lifelong sentence, unless you have the education and/or resources to tread above it. Is that not the crux of the Black Lives Matter argument?&gt; "Again — so what I think is, we don’t need sentences; we need pardons."In other words, if I've done my time, then get the damn chain off my ankle.**3) The Role of Mental Illness in All These Problems**&gt; "And I think it would be cool to have Yeezy ideation centers, which would be a mix of education that empowers people and gives them modern information like — sometimes people say, “This kid has ADD. This kid has ADD.” He don’t have ADD. School is boring. It was boring. It’s not as exciting as this. We have to make it more exciting. We have to mix curriculums. You play basketball while you’re doing math. You learn about music while you meditate in the morning. We have to instate mental health and art programs back into the city."&gt; "We need to talk to people. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. And he looked at my brain — it’s equal on three parts. I’m going to go ahead drop some bombs for you — 98 percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards, (inaudible), so I’m going to work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent — Tesla, Freud. **So he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar; I had sleep deprivation,** which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name."&gt; And then, we got rid of the mental health institutes in the ‘80s and the ‘90s, and the prison rates just shot up.After Kanye left the White House, the MSM pounced on the meeting calling him crazy and unhinged, *while referencing his prior mental health issues.* They repeatedly referenced his alleged bipolar diagnosis. But wait... is that even true? Or was it sleep deprivation? Does it even matter? If so, why? If it wasn't bipolar disorder, does he now have to *disprove* that it was? What kind of BS is that? Also... Kanye gets a LOT of flak for all the self-promotion and braggadocio. But what is the theme? This isn't the typical  "sting-like-a-bee" rhetoric you hear from athletes, or "bitches-n-hoes" boasts you hear from a lot of rappers. He's bragging about his intellect. When is the last time you can remember a Black man bragging about his *intellect*? What is the context for his comments? He's talking about education. He's talking about standards. He's talking about Black kids who are bored out of their minds, subject to insulting low academic standards... schools that simply teach from the book, and only care about getting kids in and out. What if inner city schools started with the presumption that their students are *smart*? Why are they all built and operated on the presumption that these kids are one inch away from failure? Why is every student in the inner city schools placed in "intervention mode" from the very start? Maybe if we treat these kids like they can have a bright future, some of them will actually... believe it? Why are distraught young kids in the inner city treated like criminals who simply haven't learned how to shoot? Why is a distraught middle class suburban white kid stuffed with medication and sent to the rainbow room for nappies? Does either system work? At least we talk about the second system for a minute, when someone shoots up a school. Do we *ever* talk about the first system? Nope. We just comfort ourselves with images of [Michelle Pfeiffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_ShmAq4sqc), [Jim Belushi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9ps--2lySY) or [Hillary Swank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhXMJlm852A) or [fucking Meryl Streep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p50UW7zhM4) making it all better, so we can *pretend* that this is what's happening downtown. Oh, and don't worry, [disillusioned white kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQht2yOX9Js)... you get [Robin Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zivL4GgPxKg).**4) Liberal Ignorance and Hypocrisy**A reporter reminded Kanye what he said about George Bush, and essentially asked Kanye why he doesn't *also* think *this* Republican President is racist. Kanye: &gt; "So — and that’s a move. One of the moves that I love that liberals try to do — the liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism, because they know that we are very proud, emotional people. **So when I said “I like Trump” to, like, someone that’s liberal, they’ll say, “Oh, but he’s racist.” You think racism could control me?** Oh, that don’t stop me. That’s an invisible wall." Directly after Kanye says this...... a reporter asks the following: &gt; "But you don’t think — you reject those who say he’s racist?"This reporter... I don't know, man. He didn't even *pretend* to be listening to what Kanye was saying. It's like the reporter just heard "I don't believe... Trump... is racist," and wanted Kanye basically given him a weaponized soundbite. Kanye responds: &gt; "On your question — and you had *one* question; we’re going to do it to another question."The reporter: &gt; (Laughs.) Okay.	 What the hell are you laughing at, dude? Kanye just called out this bullshit, and your impulse is to double down on the *same bullshit*?Take this interaction together with the SNL episode, and Don Lemon's reaction to this interview. If they don't *have* to listen to you, they won't... they'll just shut you off. If they *do* have to listen to you, they'll just nod and smile, but they won't hear what you are saying. Instead of hearing and absorbing, they are positioning and packaging. *How can I lead this towards a bombshell soundbite? How can I use this interaction to talk about George Bush or Brett Kavanaugh, or the electoral college*? The Left comes to the table with talking points, and treats every interaction like a poker match. They are just staring at their cards the whole time, waiting for you to throw down a particular card, so they can lay out their hand. _____Obviously, there is a lot here. One reaction could be to actually listen to him, and take from it what you will. You don't have to worship the guy, or even agree with him. But can we at least make a good faith effort to listen to him, and *try* to hear what he's saying? Another reaction is to write it off completely, as crazy rantings, to avoid any opportunity to discuss *the very same issues* that everyone is talking about... to scroll through the video looking for the "wildest moments," kick out a story about his phone password, kick out another story about how he banged on *the Resolute Desk*, and call it a day.

TulipsLovelyDaisies [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar 1 and PMDD but it may all be due to PMDD. But to get to the point, I consider this to be hypomania and it happens to me during ovulation. Because I have bipolar disorder it can escalate into impulsive behaviours so for me I am choosing to shut down ovulation. [info] None [info] 1539492975
AndySipherBull [info] And really, the reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, that he wasn’t just one of a monolithic voice, but he could wrap people around. So there’s theories that there’s infinite amounts of universe and there’s alternate universe. So it’s very important for me to get Hoover out, because in an alternate universe, I am him. And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I’m moving back to Chicago and it’s not just about, you know, getting on stage and being an entertainer and having a monolithic voice that’s forced to be a specific party. You know, people expect that if you’re black you have to be Democrat. I have a — I've had conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat. They say — you know, first of all, it’s a limited amount of jobs. So the fathers lose the jobs, and they say, “We’ll give you more money for having more kids in your home.” And then, we got rid of the mental health institutes in the ‘80s and the ‘90s, and the prison rates just shot up.	 	And now you have “Chiraq,” what people call “Chiraq” — which is actually — our murder rate is going down by 20 percent every year. I just talked to the superintendent; met with Michael Sacks; that’s Rahm's right-hand man. So I think it’s the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. You know, they tried to scare me to not wear this hat — my own friends. But this hat, it gives me — it gives me power, in a way. You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn’t have a lot of male energy in my home. And also, I’m married to a family that — (laughs) — you know, not a lot of male energy going on. It’s beautiful, though. But there’s times where, you know, there’s something about — you know, I love Hillary. I love everyone, right? But the campaign “I’m with her” just didn’t make me feel, as a guy, that didn’t get to see my dad all the time — like a guy that could play catch with his son. It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman. That was my — that’s my favorite superhero. And you made a Superman cape. For me, also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys — non-political, no bullshit — put the beep on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay — and just goes in and gets it done. Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas. Because at Adidas, when I went in, in 2015, we were a $14 billion company losing $2 billion a year. Now we have a $38 billion market cap. It’s called the “Yeezy effect.” And I went to Casper. We had a meeting in Chicago. And I said, “You have to bring manufacturing onshore.” And not even shore; into the core. It’s not about the border; it’s the core of Adidas. And Chicago is the core of Middle America. And we have to make Middle America strong. So I had the balls — because I have enough balls to put on this hat. I mean, this Adidas thing made me a billionaire. And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal. But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than to have no fathers in Chicago with no homes. And when we do have prison reformation, for no — because it’s habilitation, not rehabilitation, because they didn’t have the abilities in the first place. We never had anyone that taught us. They didn’t teach us. Exactly — we had no one that “taught” us. Right? So it’s more important than any specific deal — anything — that we bring jobs into America, and that we provide a transition with mental health and the Amer-I-Can education curriculum that Jim has worked on. Larry Hoover also has a curriculum that he’s worked on. We have Montessori curriculums that we worked on. WeWork has a beautiful curriculum. The Waldorf establishment has a curriculum. We have meditation. There’s a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment. I did say “abolish” with the hat on. Because why would you keep something around that’s a trap door? If you’re building a floor — the Constitution is the base of our industry, right? Of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you — accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber? You end up — you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship. The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment — and I think the way the universe works, it’s perfect. We don’t have 13 floors, do we? You know, so the four — the four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn’t look like the people they were amending. Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read — or African Americans to read. And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave. Again — so what I think is, we don’t need sentences; we need pardons. We need to talk to people. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. And he looked at my brain — it’s equal on three parts.

So he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name. So all this power that I got, and I’m taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn’t be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage. And what we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money. That’s one thing — I’ve never stepped into a situation where I didn’t make people more money. So we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories. We can bring not only Adidas onshore, we can bring — Foxconn has set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota. edit: I notice now that the transcript has periods and commas which is weird because Kanye doesn't use them.

Is it because Trump speaks in a similar matter? Seriously, tell me how this makes sense. This was nothing more than a publicity stunt for both of them. Kanye has an album dropping soon, Trump needs someone to make him look not racist. Even if Kanye made some valid points, and there  are one or two. The way talked about it, and the context he put it in made no fucking sense. It’s just two narcissists blowing each other in the White House. [info] None [info] 1539567726

may6_2018 [info] Hey I’m so sorry that you’re going through this. I was diagnosed with bipolar last year and my life has been miserable ever since. People were sympathetic initially but eventually that dries out. People don’t enjoy the company of someone who is super miserable.

novahex [info] This is wholesome af and I needed this. I'm diagnosed with bipolar but still have to hide my medication (which makes my life liveable) from my parents because my dad will go off on me about how I don't need it and I just have to toughen up. It's hard to not always feel like a failure when you grew up with that prejudiced rhetoric.  [info] None [info] 1539668095
TheViciousWolf [info] I would definitely be careful and see a doctor for an official diagnosis. I thought I had schizo in high school and it turned out to be a terrible manic episode instead and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

I'm just finally starting to get my life on track at 25. It was extremely hard to ask for help and even harder to fallow through. I used to believe psych meds were big pharma propaganda, but since I've been diagnosed with bipolar and medicated for it, my quality of life has drastically improved and that what I hope you can achieve.

FuFoozle [info] The DSM is a guide, not a rule. Even the inventors warned against using it for diagnosis. So many people do not fit well into a category and so many therapists do not find the categories helpful. My therapist thinks a diagnosis for someone who isn't a typical case can do more harm than good. I was diagnosed with bipolar by a "therapist" (she didn't have much training) and it sent me and my partner down the wrong track for ages because we didn't relate to most of what we read about it and I wasn't getting help for trauma. I seriously resent the DSM.In the Body Keeps the Score, a book about PTSD, there is a big part about the DSM and how the people who certify it stated some years ago that people who had trauma as children were only a "niche population" in mental health. That seems like a statement from old school types that think everything is genetic and environment doesn't matter.Maybe it is a little different now, but one of the largest funders of mental health research in the world, The National Institute of Mental Health in the US, has withdrawn its support for the DSM and now funds studies based on target symptoms and not diagnostic categories.Did I mention I don't like the DSM? Haha. Anyway, you can read more about it but don't let that book invalidate you. [info] None [info] 1539768076
dublinhank [info] Mental illness is always a bummer. Just because one is more debilitating than the other, doesn't make your situation any less valid. Depression sucks. Anxiety sucks. The good thing is it seems like you've made a bit of a revelation. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about seven years ago. Like you, I used this as an excuse to justify all of my shitty behavior, even when I knew it wasn't the cause. The most important thing that I realized is people will only be understanding for so long, if it all. If you're an asshole, it doesn't matter that you're a bipolar asshole. The diagnosis is important so that you can learn the things you need to do to live your best life. [info] None [info] 1539824451
lonelygem [info] I'm nothing like the stereotype either! Yay for being a lady, incapable of puzzles, and hating math.Yeah I can agree with you probably that schizophrenia is probably similar to autism in that some people diagnosed with it do have some sort of brain difference. However a LOT of the time they just use schizophrenia as a catch-all term for anyone who sees/hears/believes things most people do not. Just like bipolar tends to be the catch-all for people they want to drug but can't find another reason to do so, but there are people out there who are more susceptible to extreme moods/emotions in the pattern described in the DSM as bipolar. I've been diagnosed with bipolar in the past but I strongly disagree with that diagnosis. [info] None [info] 1539875370
Exclusivelorenz [info] I'm sorry. Humans are repulsive and you have every right to be a misanthrope. Even if you feel hopeless, there's still a chance for you to live a happy and prosperous life. Rather than focusing on how much time was wasted wallowing in sadness and hatred, focus on how much time you still have left to manifest your dreams and create a mental utopia. What I'm saying may seem like senseless optimism, but it's not. Although I am not schizophrenic, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and often get episodes of paranoia, delusion, and annoying intrusive thoughts.

bellabou [info] My dear sweet, beautiful, loving daughters Kimberly &amp; Danielle. Momma, wanted to let ya'll know that since our stupid spat a month ago, how much I miss you both so profoundly that my heart stays in a constant state of brokenness. My arms ache to hug ya'll… my eyes long to see ya'll... my ears yearn to hear your voice &amp; laughter again. I’m lost in a sea of grief &amp; these waves have no mercy. But, I’m hanging on tight praying that God will calm the sea &amp; rescue me! After shooting myself in the chest last year trying to stop this same ole' heart of mine from the constant sadness, pain &amp; despair I just wanted to say, “I'm sorry, Honey, to both of you for not being stronger &amp; for letting ya’ll down!” Of all the things in life since that fateful day last year, I had hoped I would never disappoint either of you again. Sadly, I have failed. Our ridiculous argument over Facebook had more to do with my own insecurities and I should have handled it in a more mature way instead of constantly bringing it up because I felt ya'll were lying to me, for that I am sorry! I know in the past in the throes of my bipolar disease I’ve said and did things that I can’t take back or change. I know I have embarrassed ya’ll with my words and actions because looking back I’m embarrassed too! All I’m asking of you is to please find the forgiveness in your heart so we can continue on this journey that we call life together standing strong and supporting one another and whatever may come our way!You know before I shot myself I would wake up in the mornings and say in an anguished tone of voice, “Oh, God, why am I still alive?” But, since that fateful day, I now wake up in the mornings and say, “Thank you, God, that I’m still alive!” However, in the last month since our spat I find myself saying the latter again…I’m not making excuses for my actions and words but when our spat occurred I had been without my bipolar medications for 3 days because of they were lost with my purse in my storage unit.Last year when I was diagnosed with bipolar I had mixed emotions. I was relieved to finally have a diagnosis for my manic highs and debilitating lows. People like me tend to avoid getting the help they need because of the labels placed on them by family, friends, &amp; society. It's not fair that people with a sick brain are usually ostracized which only adds more confusion and heartache for them.  On the other hand, I was scared of the judgment society, family and friends would place on me simply because my brain was sick. When someone is diagnosed with a sick brain people tend to judge that person unmercifully. Then the labels and name-calling start, for instance, she is a crazy bitch or stay away from her because she's cray-cray etc. Now take my kidney disease, for example, whenever I become sick and I’m in pain and running a high fever people don’t judge me for that, they tend to be very concerned and there are no derogatory judgments placed against me when my kidneys aren’t functioning properly. However when my brain isn’t functioning properly that’s a completely different story and comes with a lot of heartache and embarrassment for me.I haven’t found a doctor yet since I moved back home but I’m sure he will write two prescriptions. The first prescription will be to either increase or change my current medications. But the second and most important prescription would be for us to start communicating again, being loving and compassionate toward one another &amp; ya'll forgiving me for my words &amp; actions because my brain is sick! This is a learning process for all of us. I have realized how important it is for ya’ll to be in my life and how much your love and support makes my sick brain function so much better. Simply put I cannot live without your love. I will be awaiting your response. Just know that I love ya'll to Infinity I always have &amp; always will… Love, Momma [info] None [info] 1539998652

My professor compared me to a child protegy - incredible until 18 when everything went to shit. At 19 when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I didn’t really feel the need to other those who were sick.  That sort of attitude is why I actively avoid group therapy.  Every person is unique, so is their illness and it’s presentation.

DawgMan87 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder  I last year and I’m still learning a lot. One of the figures I had heard tossed around is that 90% of marriages end in divorce where a partner is bipolar. It’s not true. Though it led me to research the issue and while no solid statistics can be made about it, the tendency to assortatively mate with others who have mental health issues can exacerbate the challenges of those interpersonal relationships. For that reason, I’ve decided that I will not get involved with any long term relationship with someone who has a mental illness.

Karoal [info] If you feel depressed, please go see a doctor if you can.It's good that you know the basic facts about mental illnesses. However the more you delve into it, the more you can get positive bias and reason on false assumptions.Feeling dreamlike is not a delusion, so don't worry about that. As long as it doesn't cause you distress, lots of people space out. If it's distressing, you might want to bring that up with your doctor then.Personally I have been diagnosed with bipolar. Anecdotally people's mental illness can be "coloured" by their personality.In my experience mental illness affects you a tiny bit like being under the influence of a drug. You're acting and thinking differently, but you're still you in some way. That's where the analogy ends but I hope you understand me that your personality and your mental illness blend together somewhat.I know it's easy to freak out, I have done it and am still doing it. But remember that you want to take care of yourself, not identify what exactly is "not right" with you.Edit: if it matters at all, I scored ENFP :) [info] None [info] 1540467499
Narq1013 [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 and my fiancé has Borderline Personality Disorder, which can have similar traits to bipolar. First thing I suggest is finding a therapist for you and her to share. Sometimes when me or my fiancé are cycling it’s hard to listen to the other because A. It can come off as nagging and/or it can come off almost as a “know it all” and B. Not everything is being communicated or understood. A shared therapist can give you both insight on the others thoughts and where they are coming from. Also, as mentioned already on this thread you need to separate the sickness from the person you love. You know who you fell in love with and that person is still present. A few tips I have found to help when I’m dealing with my fiancé illness is to make your feelings known. One of my fiancé’s issues is taking her meds, so just every few days I ask and make sure she took them, if she comes across defensive  about it I just remind her that I care for her and want to to be the best she can so it doesn’t come off as if I’m babysitting her meds.Overall remind yourself that you are in love with this person. Even on meds there’s going to be times that are tough but remember the tough times are worth it. [info] None [info] 1540480253
uLAYeAMpStri [info] Disclaimer: I was diagnosed with bipolar 3 years ago. If he does not seek out help this behavior will come back. Often times you will get hyper focused on a new hobby or interest and your bad behavior might subside as you pour all your time and attention into said activity. Unfortunately these obsessive desires tent to end, dropped completely. Then it is back to the bad behavior. This might be different from person to person but it’s how I felt. Also lithium sucks and it didn’t do anything for me but I’ve heard people have good results with it. Good luck op, I hope you get some help and a different psychiatrist  [info] None [info] 1540502529
Mittinmang [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a professional psychiatrists in a clinic. I've made my peace with it, or at least I try to cope with it and try to keep my balanced without medication. I just wish my family, especially my mom would understand that I'm trying my hardest but sometimes I'm just depressed and sometimes I do crazy stuff out of nowhere without caring about the consequences. Her constant judgement makes it hard to fight against my own brain because I feel like it's my fault, I'm doing it KNOWING I shouldn't, which isn't true.But to be positive: In my manic episodes I'm doing crazy stuff, and yeah, I'm in debt. But it's an adventure and it sometimes actually helps me doing things that I always wanted to do; Just like moving 600km away from home for my first love. I may be struggling a lot, but at least I get to see a lot of beauty. [info] None [info] 1540507091
LiloWalker [info] I'm not a doctor but I'll share my experience: I was diagnosed with bipolar I at 19 and ADHD at 21.  I definitely always had ADHD  as a kid but self learned coping strategies to some extent and got by.  In college and grad school, I had a really tough time compensating.  It was similar.. I couldnt remember anything and I would start so many things but not finish.  I started taking medicine for ADHD which helped a lot.  I don't consistently take medicine now in my late 20s because I get soooooo tired when I take it (I always thought ADHD medicine woke you up? Not for me..best sleep with it tho).  I stay organized at my job with lists and take walks around the building during the day.  I also am better at forcing myself to finish things that I start..it can be hard.  My brain feels calmer  and I feel more like myself when I take the medicine, I just don't like being so tired.I mentioned the bipolar in the beginning because theres some overlap with symptoms.Tldr; I was dx as an adult with ADHD. It couldn't hurt to see a specialist if money isnt an issue. [info] None [info] 1540521582

Q1e3t5r4w2 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 before BPD and I went through all the same things. None of the medications ever worked for me except benzos when I was having a really bad episode/panic attack. Sleeping pills never even put me to sleep just gave me headaches and made my mouth taste horrible. You could try buying him a DBT workbook and read it with him if you want to try to save money. Most therapists will just work through the DBT workbook with him. But there are other therapists who try different kinds of therapy specifically for past abuse and PTSD type disorders. I've had others try things like hypnotherapy and crystal healing... which never did anything lol. It might be more helpful for him to work through these things with a licensed therapist though because I know how hard it is to read a book while dealing with mental problems. I've been doing it on my own because I dont have health insurance and I've still been making a lot of progress. But sometimes it's easier to have a professional explain things to you. My last therapist just took pages of the DBT workbook and scanned them for me to take home though and I was paying her a lot of money so I guess I'm just jaded when it comes to therapy. Thank you for being there for him and trying to help him through this. Hes very lucky to have someone like you in his life who cares so much. :) [info] None [info] 1540637960
saladisawasteoftime [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was a teenager. I’ve been medicated for ten years and I’ve always ALWAYS taken my meds. It is so important to keep taking them even if you’re feeling better. I made the most movements towards regaining myself in the last five years when I was seeing a therapist as well. One of the things she taught me was to be kind to myself. The illness is never going to go away but it will get easier to deal with. So when it hits me hard for a week or so I remember to be kind to myself and remind myself that it’s ok that certain things can’t get done. When I’m sick I can’t do it all but I can do what’s important.  [info] None [info] 1540652164

_grottesca [info] Personality disorders are generally considered separate from mood disorders or traditional mental illnesses because they are literally a dysfunction within a person's personality.  A person with bipolar disorder will have periods of stability that last months between episodes, while a person with borderline will sometimes have multiple episodes just in a day.  Personality disorders tend to require regular, frequent therapy because the person literally has to unlearn their personality - let go of bad habits and replace them with normal coping skills, do self control exercises, etc. They're considered REALLY hard to treat because of this - the person has to really want to change.  Treatment for personality disorders is very different from treatment for mood disorders, although people can have both at the same time as well.NOTE: I'm not a psychiatrist or therapist, but this essentially how my therapist explained the difference to me when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

gwenthrowaway [info] I was clinically depressed but I didn't know it. I just thought everything in my life had turned to shit. I took no joy from my job, my hobbies, my books, my marriage. Everything irritated me and I really didn't see any point in continuing my life.So I decided to reboot myself, start over in a new city with a new job, new living situation...get away from all the bad stuff and make a fresh start.I couldn't bear to break my sweet husband's heart by telling him I wanted a divorce, so I had an affair and made sure he found out. That is common enough that marriage counselors have a name for it. I had an "exit affair."Eventually I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder II and I realized that my succession of "reboot" experiences, once every two or three years, had nothing to do with external circumstances. I had thrown away relationships and good living situations and good jobs due to screwed-up brain chemistry.Anyway, that's why I cheated.

yesihaveshatmyself [info] Hey OP. First off, I have so much respect for you. You’re fighting for your partnership while balancing that with your own self care and that’s hard and amazing and important.I was diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD a decade ago. I’ve been a real mess throughout my adult life, and to be honest I still am. And almost as bad as, maybe worse than, my own struggle is seeing the toll it takes on my husband. He’s been dealing with my shit for going on 9 years now and I don’t know how he does it. For all the times I’ve nearly called it quits on my own life, I’m in awe of his ability to not call it quits on the life we share together.I don’t know what kind of person your partner is, but I know from personal experience that when my husband takes time for himself, sets boundaries, airs his grievances, and keeps me in the loop with how my illness affects him I am grateful and humbled. It’s hard to deal with how your sickness effects those you love, but a million times harder when you know that it’s *not* being dealt with at all. Over the years, my husband has taken steps to take better care of himself, and that in turn has had a wonderful effect on our marriage.I’m rooting for you two so hard. I know how much of a struggle it is. But take my advice as a person on the other end: do not set yourself on fire to keep your partner warm. It will burn the both of you. Don’t fall into a caretaker role, it’s hard to dig yourself out of that and it will only hurt both of you. Make your own space and make your needs known. Mental illness is an explanation for behavior but it is never an excuse. He must be accountable just as you must be supportive. I wish you both the very best of luck. [info] None [info] 1538781444

I tried to continue school but had withdraw many consecutive semesters due to bad grades affecting my gpa and was expelled for a year.

peasantsean [info] I hope this doesn't get too buried, I might be able to help. This story sounds all to familiar to me and I hate to admit it but I really think sharing my thoughts might be of some use. Your bf sounds exactly like the type of guy I was to my ex. The relationship started off great but soon became overwhelmingly toxic. I was very emotionally abusive/controlling. She was the nicest person I have ever met and put up with it for so long because she empathized with my struggles with mental illness. During that time I didn't want to admit I had any issues, in my head everything was her fault. But after a few escalated incidents(similar to your bf - just doing stupid dangerous abuse tactics) I felt like something had to be going on in my head. I knew something was weird with my reactions to things that shouldn't have warranted such a strong reaction. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which makes sense since it runs in the family. But that's not an excuse for the way I acted. That was a starting point to figuring out how to grow. I knew I was abusive. I knew I didnt want to be, and now I knew my manic and depressive episodes contributing to my lack of self worth probably werent helping the situation get any better. &amp;#x200B;Let me just tell you, it WILL NEVER get better. The more you put up with his crap the worse it gets. He needs help. So good on you for finally ending it. You made the best decision possible. Your feelings towards the decision are understandable but please do a lot of research on domestic violence to get some context. &amp;#x200B;So back to a little background on my story: I started to resent myself for being so abusive. Which made the relationship even worse. Every time I couldnt control my anger or be the ideal partner to her I would self harm hoping itll teach me a lesson and id learn to get better one day. And it became this horrible cycle of me abusing her and myself until one day I snapped. We got into an argument and I left her house and sliced up my arm pretty good. I wasnt trying to kill myself, just take control of my emotions...or get help...or maybe even manipulate her?? idk really. But her dad took me to the hospital and I got 19 stitches. Her parents were very supportive of me getting treatment but didnt want me so close to their daughter anymore. The best thing that happened to me was going in and out of psych wards until I found treatment that actually helped. Also, letting go of that relationship so we can both heal was a step in the right direction. It was the only way(looking back on the situation now) that I see the abuse would have ever stopped. &amp;#x200B;I believe 100% that as long as you guys are in each other's lives neither one of you will move on to a healthier future. I now have a daughter and am in a loving relationship with somebody else. There's no abuse on either side and we're constantly growing. But that's because I had to admit I had issues and learn to grow/move on from them. The best thing you can do for yourself is accept the fact that you deserve MUCH better. It's time for you to heal. Do not visit him in the hospital. Dont have any contact with him at all. Its going to be tough but its completely necessary for your safety and well-being. Reach out to some support during this process. Maybe look into getting therapy. Join some sports clubs, find hobbies. Keep yourself distracted and moving forward. &amp;#x200B;So yeah, I dont think domestic violence ever gets better. It ends badly. Personally I think I got lucky by being so passionate about not being an abuser that I forced myself to cut contact with my ex even after she initiated contact months later. He needs to admit he's abusive(to himself), learn to grow and then move on. If he honestly cares about you he'd leave you alone to prevent from causing any more damage. But just like I was, he's manipulative af and cares more about himself. &amp;#x200B;Accept your decision to leave him. And learn to love it. It probably saved your life. &amp;#x200B;Also, if anyone is curious why I think I was abusive, I was thinking about this recently. I think it all came down to the fact that I was very weak. Of course there were a combination of other factors(seeing abuse growing up, mental illness, never learning a healthy way to express emotions etc). But I was weak and had no self worth. So control was the only way I think I found any sort of comfort. It started off small. Like getting annoyed when she talked to other dudes. Then it escalated into full blown screaming at her, attacking her self worth and preventing her from going certain places or speaking to certain people. I hated doing it. But I didnt know any other way. If I knew then what I know now I'd see those early signs of weakness in myself and be mature enough to say "hmmm, getting this jealous isnt a good sign for our future. Maybe I shouldnt be in a relationship at this time..." So, if any of you see those ealry signs in yourself or in a partner really look into ways you can improve the situation. It wont improve on its own.  [info] None [info] 1538924035
thecuddlykrab [info] I feel the same way about my brother. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 but to me, it’s more like looking at the symptoms rather than labeling with a disorder...I just know me and my brother both had mood issues all our lives. Maybe I’m in denial. But I still haven’t even gotten a good control on my own mood disorder yet, I really doubt trying to help my brother will be a good thing :/ I want to help him though. But I guess now isn’t the time because I’ve got to help myself first. It doesn’t help that my mom downplays our emotional problems a lot, and she doesn’t like that I’m going to be taking medication long-term. She doesn’t think anything is ever inherently wrong with me, I guess that’s what a parent is for.  [info] None [info] 1538950207
ilazria [info] I hope my experience will help. I once was a teenage girl with extreme mood swings. After I had my first child, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Now she's almost 15, going through the same rough mood roller-coaster. At your age, I felt the same things. There were times I would plummet to the point I was so depressed, all I could do was curl up and cry. I would think things like how I was complete garbage, a poser. One of those things I felt so awful I thought about taking all of my clothes and stuff and burning them in a giant bonfire. The only thing that stopped me was that I was so depressed I couldn't get out of bed to do it. Then, once the worst of the storm was over, I would feel numb. Empty. There was no joy or sadness. Just nothing. Then, when that passed, it would feel like nothing had happened at all. It was frightening and confusing, to go from feeling so certain that the world was pure shit, to feeling like a meat puppet, then back to normal. First, to some extent, the peaks and valleys are normal. As cliché as it sounds, being a teenage girl comes with some really crappy hormonal attacks. Sure, some girls aren't as severely afflicted as others. Genetics don't play fair. However, when they're so bad they disrupt your normal life, it's important to get help.Don't discard the idea of therapy and medication. I've been going to therapists and psychiatrists for  20+ years. Unfortunately, in the 90s, no one took an emotional goth girl seriously. You are in luck, that there is a much more educated, progressive mental health environment these days. You may have to try a few different doctors and therapists to find the right one for you, but they *are* out there. A therapist is a safe person to vent to. There is something genuinely beneficial in talking to someone completely impartial. Friends and relatives might care, but they're inherently biased, and it's often hard to bring oneself to "burden" them with one's issues. Therapists also help you develop coping skills. They help you identify the triggers and earliest signs of your mood going in a bad direction. They help you understand *why* your mood is doing that. Moods spiral out of control the worst when you don't understand *why* you're so miserable, and feel like you have no control over it. You may start to fixate on something, *anything,* just to feel like you have some control, but because you're not addressing the real problem, you're still stuck in the swing.Medication is also an important tool in some cases. The thing is, you have to understand why you should take it. It's not good as a bandaid. It can work that way, for a time, but if you put a bandaid on a wound that need stitches, you might slow or stop the bleeding for a time, but eventually, it's going to fail. Medication isn't a bandaid, it's a dressing for a wound. Therapy is the stitches. Learning coping skills helps you understand what's causing the wounds, and how to avoid then or make them less dire.It sucks to have to work harder than others to find stability, but it *is* possible, and worth the effort. If your mom is the type of person who has mental health issues, and *doesn't* get help, or doesn't work to maintain her stability, you already have a good example of why that's *not* the way you want to handle things, yourself. It sounds like you are already taking the right steps in choosing to manage your mental health. Now, I will admit that, even though I do know how this all goes, that doesn't mean it's easy to handle with my own daughter. Maybe that's what's going on with your mom. It's tricky. Mother-daughter relationships are already strained by the usually course of growing up. Maintaining mental stability can be hard when one is trying to empathize with someone who is absolutely sure you cannot possibly understand. If there's any part of you that thinks your mom could actually want to help, give it a chance. If she's willing to get you help, try using some of your therapy time for mediation. Sometimes my daughter has me come in for a few minutes during her appointment to discuss things. Having a therapist there helps... translate... if that makes sense. If you can't get help from your mom, try talking with your school guidance counselor. I know our high school has confidential help that kids can ask for. Your school may, also. They definitely will in college.  [info] None [info] 1539010183
gimru [info] Yeah, listen to AiC and Mad Season; the records I mentioned are classics and some songs are pretty self-explanatory, like 'Angry Chair', 'Sickman', 'Junkhead' and 'Would?'. I totally missed AiC in the nineties, but discovered *Dirt* and *Jar of Flies* later and fell in love with them. Also, those records are so different, you can pick a song from a wide array of moods and styles, between [Junkhead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1dT6yI33v0) and [Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_601kPxo1lQ), for example. I also like [What the Hell Have I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKXIk45pL0o), but it's not on those records.I'll tell you what I think about *Proper Dose* later, cause I always need time to assimilate new music and tell something relevant about it ;-)I first dabbled with codeine because I had back pain and, at the time, I could get it over the counter in my country. Later, as I had to deal with a lot of shit in my life, I began using it more and more, then on a daily basis. For reasons not related to my new drug use, my life was getting more and more complicated, spiraling into total craziness. I was exhausted most of the time, working like mad, and had problems in my family. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type II), which made a lot of sense, but was hard to swallow. All hell broke lose. I even snorted heroin, twice, but didn't like it (good thing!). I eventually kicked codeine and asked for medical help. I now have meds and regular consultation to a psychiatrist. I was veeeery surprised when she prescribed me with buprenorphine, but it helped a lot.Bupe is a strange opioid, because you don't get very high from it. It has calming and stabilizing effects, though, and is a mild antidepressant. So I guess it's a good thing for often depressed but uptight, nervous people like me. It also suppresses withdrawal and most of craving for other opioids/opiates. That said, to be fully honest, I still wish I had a few codeine tablets to swallows to get numb. I loved its soothing effects.Later,— gimru. [info] None [info] 1539014763
alliengineer [info] I am also a victim of CSA. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was a teenager and struggling to cope with what happened to me. I was put on medication for 11 years. As an adult I started to go to therapy and I realized I did not have bipolar disorder. The medication was simply keeping my feelings under control and it was unhealthy for me. It took me a very long time to wean off the medicine in a healthy way because my body was addicted and I realize my brain and body will have lasting effects from taking the medication while I was developing. As an adult and not on medication (after about 4 years of therapy) I think my brain has healed quite a bit. I still suffer highs and lows but I feel much more normal now, and I continue to go to therapy when I need it. I don't know if you have bipolar disorder or not but I am telling you that you are not alone, and to really give therapy a shot with a psychologist. My mom had originally sent me to a psychiatrist and all he did was diagnose me and prescribe medication without actually helping.  Take care.  &amp;#x200B; [info] None [info] 1539018865
Wee_Albet [info] TL;DR: Yes, I have mental health problems and one night I was suicidal and we spoke via WhatsApp for 6 hours until I fell asleep. Details on what happened that night:We will do that too. He goes to stay with his mum at the weekend, so we will talk through messaging during the day. But we will also talk through serious things through messaging too.I have mental health problems and before the diagnosis I had was questioned (Sept last year), I had a very bad depressive episode towards the end of July, which lasted throughout August and into February of this year. Very confusing.Anyway, on August 5th last year, I was feeling very low and had decided to take my own life that night, which was a Saturday, so he was at his mums an hours drive away. I had tried calling him and my family and no one had picked up.He had fallen asleep and had woken up at 11:30pm and saw the missed calls. I was sat there, about to carry out the act (no further info will be given on this, so no methods or mention to what I would have done). He didn't know if I would be awake or not and didn't want to wake me of I had fallen asleep, I'd been awake for nearly 4 solid days with no sleep at this point and he hoped I was sleeping.He sent me a message apologising for missing the calls and asked if everything was OK. I couldn't think of anything to say and any way of lying was lost to me at this point, so I simply replied back saying "no" and he tried calling me. I felt completely ashamed about what I was going to do and what I would be leaving him to come home to. I couldn't bear to talk to him on the phone. So I kept rejecting the calls and I was eventually able to get a message over saying I'd talk on WhatsApp.We then went through absolutely everything that had gone one over past few months (which we now know was hypomania, I was diagnosed with bipolar). We spoke about what I was going to be doing and about why I was doing it (an even longer story than this, sorry for this story). For about 6 hours we both sat up and spoke about everything. Not just about how I felt, but also him too.So, yes, we do reach out through messages too, and by doing that, it saved my life.I hope everything is OK on your end. I'm sorry this reply was so long.

gimv [info] Feel you. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the beginning of M3, I graduate next summer, I made it. Medical school obviously did NOT give me bipolar, but it definitely triggered it. It takes a toll on your health: physical, mental and emotional.As one of the other commenter said, school is just a means to an end. I’ve spent 4 years down your path, I understand, my school is crap, curriculum is crap, and they shove theoretical classes + hospital rotations down our throat like if’s apple juice (I have some PTSD from M3, I don’t know how I survived it).Just remember that a school doesn’t make a doctor. You have the possibility of taking your education in your hands and shaping your circumstances in the way that works best for you.I don’t know what year you’re in, but along the way you’ll meet more maddening things (helloooo Step 1), so try to stay cool. Look for help, medication, therapy, support group from your classmates maybe, whatever it takes. Best luck, you got this. [info] M-4 [info] 1539059274
neonred1 [info] My post was removed and directed towards here. I was wondering how I can appropriately secure an internship with a record.Details: when I was 20 I was arrested for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, misdemeanor paraphernalia, misdemeanor battery. Two days later I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder.I went through a trauma which triggered my first documented cycle so I was self medicating. The man I was smoking with wanted to get in my pants and when I refused he turned me into the police for possession. We got into a fight and he got a mark on his wrist and used it to press charges for battery.By the time I graduate from the social work program is will be two and a half years since the incident. The deposition of all three charges is dismissed by the motion of the prosecutor. The ROAs of each charge indicate I went through a diversion program to get the charges dismissed. My state does not allow expungements. My program requires two internships to graduate. We have an internship fair coming up and I don’t know if it’s 1. Appropriate or necessary to self disclose or 2. If there is anything I can do to help up my chances of being successful.  I’m just trying to think of ways that would actually give me a chance and would appreciate any insight or feedback.

The-Harmacist [info] Well I'll give you a hint bud, the drug free approach to my bipolar, while it was undiagnosed, led to me to many visits to the hospital for suicide attempts, and enough incidents where the police were called.

Interestedatheist [info] My PMS used to last two weeks, the week before my period and the week of my period. I was diagnosed with bipolar because it was so bad and I used to cycle between highs and lows so much, but I didn't make the connection to my period until I switched to a contraception that meant I didn't have periods. My moods have been completely stable ever since. Both high and low levels of sex hormones can cause emotional instability, just because hormone levels spike before your period, that doesn't mean that your lower hormone levels during your period wont affect your mood too.

I had a 75 percentile of all human beings when it was counting numbers backwards, so I’m gonna work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent. Tesla. Freud. So, he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar.

mickcube [info] i know it's not news that kanye doesn't know how to talk but pitchfork printed this transcript and it's incredible how similar it is to how trump speaks&gt; At one point, West discussed why he wears a MAGA hat:&gt; &gt; This hat, it gives me power in a way. My dad and my mom separated, so I didn’t have a lot of male energy in my home. And, also, I’m married to a family that, you know, not a lot of male energy going on. It’s beautiful, though! I love Hillary. I love everyone. But the campaign “I’m With Her” just didn’t make me feel—as a guy that didn’t get to see my dad all the time, a guy that could play catch with his son—it was something about when I put this hat on it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman.&gt; &gt; Later, he discussed the 13th Amendment, which segued into West talking about bipolar disorder:&gt; &gt; I did say “abolish” with the hat because, why would you keep something around that’s a trapdoor? If you’re building a floor, the Constitution is the base of our industry—of our country, of our company—would you build a trapdoor that if you mess up and you accidentally something happens and you fall and end up next to the Unabomber, you gotta remove all that trapdoor out of the relationship.&gt; &gt; The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment—and I think the way the universe works, it’s perfect. We don’t have 13th floors, do we? The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn’t look like the people they were amending. Also, at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read. Or African-Americans to read. And so that meant that if you actually read the amendment, you’d get locked up and turned to a slave! Again. So, what I think is we don’t need sentences, we need pardons.&gt; &gt; I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Couldawg [info] Please. [Read the transcript](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2018/10/11/kanye-west-donald-trump-and-jim-brown-the-full-transcript/). Forget right-vs-left. Here are some of the points he makes: **1) Cops and Blacks are both victims, being driven towards each other by the system:** &gt; And that’s a major thing about racial tension. And we also, as black people, we have to take a responsibility for what we’re doing. We kill each other more than police officers. And that’s not saying that the police officer is not is not an issue, because they are in a place — a position of power. But sometimes they’re in a place of law enforcement. They need to be law-power. It’s force versus power. And when you — you shouldn’t have to force people to do that. So a lot of times the police officer is sitting there, they’re being forced to do this and forced to do that block. And then they force somebody into something and force into something. Cops are told to "clean up the streets." So they do. They arrest Blacks for crimes, and into the system they go. Once there, they are marked with a record and a Scarlet P (probation), and turned back out. Things don't look good from there...**2) 13th Amendment as a "trapdoor"**&gt; There’s a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment. I did say “abolish” with the hat on. Because why would you keep something around that’s a trap door? If you’re building a floor — the Constitution is the base of our industry, right? Of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you — accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber? You end up — you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship.The 13th amendment abolished slavery. What is this "trapdoor" he's talking about? READ IT: &gt; Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,** shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.Maybe he has a point? The 13th didn't abolish *all* slavery, only *illegal* slavery. *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*... it's right there. Look at the prison system. Loaded with people, most of them Black. You might say, "that's not slavery, that's prison." I refer you to the Scarlet P from above... **probation**. [4.5 million](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2018/04/26/probation_update-2/) are on probation or parole. We are accustomed to viewing that as a *good* thing... after all, they are getting a "break," since they *could* be in prison. But let's change up our perspective here. Why is prison the default? Honestly... because we don't have anything better. Right? &gt; "Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read — or African Americans to read. And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave."Is he wrong? He's talking about how petty bullshit spirals into a lifelong sentence, unless you have the education and/or resources to tread above it. Is that not the crux of the Black Lives Matter argument?&gt; "Again — so what I think is, we don’t need sentences; we need pardons."In other words, if I've done my time, then get the damn chain off my ankle.**3) The Role of Mental Illness in All These Problems**&gt; "And I think it would be cool to have Yeezy ideation centers, which would be a mix of education that empowers people and gives them modern information like — sometimes people say, “This kid has ADD. This kid has ADD.” He don’t have ADD. School is boring. It was boring. It’s not as exciting as this. We have to make it more exciting. We have to mix curriculums. You play basketball while you’re doing math. You learn about music while you meditate in the morning. We have to instate mental health and art programs back into the city."&gt; "We need to talk to people. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. And he looked at my brain — it’s equal on three parts. I’m going to go ahead drop some bombs for you — 98 percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards, (inaudible), so I’m going to work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent — Tesla, Freud. **So he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar; I had sleep deprivation,** which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name."&gt; And then, we got rid of the mental health institutes in the ‘80s and the ‘90s, and the prison rates just shot up.After Kanye left the White House, the MSM pounced on the meeting calling him crazy and unhinged, *while referencing his prior mental health issues.* They repeatedly referenced his alleged bipolar diagnosis. But wait... is that even true? Or was it sleep deprivation? Does it even matter? If so, why? If it wasn't bipolar disorder, does he now have to *disprove* that it was? What kind of BS is that? Also... Kanye gets a LOT of flak for all the self-promotion and braggadocio. But what is the theme? This isn't the typical  "sting-like-a-bee" rhetoric you hear from athletes, or "bitches-n-hoes" boasts you hear from a lot of rappers. He's bragging about his intellect. When is the last time you can remember a Black man bragging about his *intellect*? What is the context for his comments? He's talking about education. He's talking about standards. He's talking about Black kids who are bored out of their minds, subject to insulting low academic standards... schools that simply teach from the book, and only care about getting kids in and out. What if inner city schools started with the presumption that their students are *smart*? Why are they all built and operated on the presumption that these kids are one inch away from failure? Why is every student in the inner city schools placed in "intervention mode" from the very start? Maybe if we treat these kids like they can have a bright future, some of them will actually... believe it? Why are distraught young kids in the inner city treated like criminals who simply haven't learned how to shoot? Why is a distraught middle class suburban white kid stuffed with medication and sent to the rainbow room for nappies? Does either system work? At least we talk about the second system for a minute, when someone shoots up a school. Do we *ever* talk about the first system? Nope. We just comfort ourselves with images of [Michelle Pfeiffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_ShmAq4sqc), [Jim Belushi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9ps--2lySY) or [Hillary Swank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhXMJlm852A) or [fucking Meryl Streep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p50UW7zhM4) making it all better, so we can *pretend* that this is what's happening downtown. Oh, and don't worry, [disillusioned white kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQht2yOX9Js)... you get [Robin Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zivL4GgPxKg).**4) Liberal Ignorance and Hypocrisy**A reporter reminded Kanye what he said about George Bush, and essentially asked Kanye why he doesn't *also* think *this* Republican President is racist. Kanye: &gt; "So — and that’s a move. One of the moves that I love that liberals try to do — the liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism, because they know that we are very proud, emotional people. **So when I said “I like Trump” to, like, someone that’s liberal, they’ll say, “Oh, but he’s racist.” You think racism could control me?** Oh, that don’t stop me. That’s an invisible wall." Directly after Kanye says this...... a reporter asks the following: &gt; "But you don’t think — you reject those who say he’s racist?"This reporter... I don't know, man. He didn't even *pretend* to be listening to what Kanye was saying. It's like the reporter just heard "I don't believe... Trump... is racist," and wanted Kanye basically given him a weaponized soundbite. Kanye responds: &gt; "On your question — and you had *one* question; we’re going to do it to another question."The reporter: &gt; (Laughs.) Okay.	 What the hell are you laughing at, dude? Kanye just called out this bullshit, and your impulse is to double down on the *same bullshit*?Take this interaction together with the SNL episode, and Don Lemon's reaction to this interview. If they don't *have* to listen to you, they won't... they'll just shut you off. If they *do* have to listen to you, they'll just nod and smile, but they won't hear what you are saying. Instead of hearing and absorbing, they are positioning and packaging. *How can I lead this towards a bombshell soundbite? How can I use this interaction to talk about George Bush or Brett Kavanaugh, or the electoral college*? The Left comes to the table with talking points, and treats every interaction like a poker match. They are just staring at their cards the whole time, waiting for you to throw down a particular card, so they can lay out their hand. _____Obviously, there is a lot here. One reaction could be to actually listen to him, and take from it what you will. You don't have to worship the guy, or even agree with him. But can we at least make a good faith effort to listen to him, and *try* to hear what he's saying? Another reaction is to write it off completely, as crazy rantings, to avoid any opportunity to discuss *the very same issues* that everyone is talking about... to scroll through the video looking for the "wildest moments," kick out a story about his phone password, kick out another story about how he banged on *the Resolute Desk*, and call it a day.

AndySipherBull [info] And really, the reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, that he wasn’t just one of a monolithic voice, but he could wrap people around. So there’s theories that there’s infinite amounts of universe and there’s alternate universe. So it’s very important for me to get Hoover out, because in an alternate universe, I am him. And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I’m moving back to Chicago and it’s not just about, you know, getting on stage and being an entertainer and having a monolithic voice that’s forced to be a specific party. You know, people expect that if you’re black you have to be Democrat. I have a — I've had conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat. They say — you know, first of all, it’s a limited amount of jobs. So the fathers lose the jobs, and they say, “We’ll give you more money for having more kids in your home.” And then, we got rid of the mental health institutes in the ‘80s and the ‘90s, and the prison rates just shot up.	 	And now you have “Chiraq,” what people call “Chiraq” — which is actually — our murder rate is going down by 20 percent every year. I just talked to the superintendent; met with Michael Sacks; that’s Rahm's right-hand man. So I think it’s the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. You know, they tried to scare me to not wear this hat — my own friends. But this hat, it gives me — it gives me power, in a way. You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn’t have a lot of male energy in my home. And also, I’m married to a family that — (laughs) — you know, not a lot of male energy going on. It’s beautiful, though. But there’s times where, you know, there’s something about — you know, I love Hillary. I love everyone, right? But the campaign “I’m with her” just didn’t make me feel, as a guy, that didn’t get to see my dad all the time — like a guy that could play catch with his son. It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman. That was my — that’s my favorite superhero. And you made a Superman cape. For me, also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys — non-political, no bullshit — put the beep on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay — and just goes in and gets it done. Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas. Because at Adidas, when I went in, in 2015, we were a $14 billion company losing $2 billion a year. Now we have a $38 billion market cap. It’s called the “Yeezy effect.” And I went to Casper. We had a meeting in Chicago. And I said, “You have to bring manufacturing onshore.” And not even shore; into the core. It’s not about the border; it’s the core of Adidas. And Chicago is the core of Middle America. And we have to make Middle America strong. So I had the balls — because I have enough balls to put on this hat. I mean, this Adidas thing made me a billionaire. And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal. But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than to have no fathers in Chicago with no homes. And when we do have prison reformation, for no — because it’s habilitation, not rehabilitation, because they didn’t have the abilities in the first place. We never had anyone that taught us. They didn’t teach us. Exactly — we had no one that “taught” us. Right? So it’s more important than any specific deal — anything — that we bring jobs into America, and that we provide a transition with mental health and the Amer-I-Can education curriculum that Jim has worked on. Larry Hoover also has a curriculum that he’s worked on. We have Montessori curriculums that we worked on. WeWork has a beautiful curriculum. The Waldorf establishment has a curriculum. We have meditation. There’s a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment. I did say “abolish” with the hat on. Because why would you keep something around that’s a trap door? If you’re building a floor — the Constitution is the base of our industry, right? Of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you — accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber? You end up — you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship. The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment — and I think the way the universe works, it’s perfect. We don’t have 13 floors, do we? You know, so the four — the four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn’t look like the people they were amending. Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read — or African Americans to read. And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave. Again — so what I think is, we don’t need sentences; we need pardons. We need to talk to people. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. And he looked at my brain — it’s equal on three parts.

So all this power that I got, and I’m taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn’t be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage. And what we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money. That’s one thing — I’ve never stepped into a situation where I didn’t make people more money. So we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories. We can bring not only Adidas onshore, we can bring — Foxconn has set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota. edit: I notice now that the transcript has periods and commas which is weird because Kanye doesn't use them.

FuFoozle [info] The DSM is a guide, not a rule. Even the inventors warned against using it for diagnosis. So many people do not fit well into a category and so many therapists do not find the categories helpful. My therapist thinks a diagnosis for someone who isn't a typical case can do more harm than good. I was diagnosed with bipolar by a "therapist" (she didn't have much training) and it sent me and my partner down the wrong track for ages because we didn't relate to most of what we read about it and I wasn't getting help for trauma. I seriously resent the DSM.In the Body Keeps the Score, a book about PTSD, there is a big part about the DSM and how the people who certify it stated some years ago that people who had trauma as children were only a "niche population" in mental health. That seems like a statement from old school types that think everything is genetic and environment doesn't matter.Maybe it is a little different now, but one of the largest funders of mental health research in the world, The National Institute of Mental Health in the US, has withdrawn its support for the DSM and now funds studies based on target symptoms and not diagnostic categories.Did I mention I don't like the DSM?

dublinhank [info] Mental illness is always a bummer. Just because one is more debilitating than the other, doesn't make your situation any less valid. Depression sucks. Anxiety sucks. The good thing is it seems like you've made a bit of a revelation. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about seven years ago. Like you, I used this as an excuse to justify all of my shitty behavior, even when I knew it wasn't the cause. The most important thing that I realized is people will only be understanding for so long, if it all. If you're an asshole, it doesn't matter that you're a bipolar asshole. The diagnosis is important so that you can learn the things you need to do to live your best life. [info] None [info] 1539824451
lonelygem [info] I'm nothing like the stereotype either! Yay for being a lady, incapable of puzzles, and hating math.Yeah I can agree with you probably that schizophrenia is probably similar to autism in that some people diagnosed with it do have some sort of brain difference. However a LOT of the time they just use schizophrenia as a catch-all term for anyone who sees/hears/believes things most people do not. Just like bipolar tends to be the catch-all for people they want to drug but can't find another reason to do so, but there are people out there who are more susceptible to extreme moods/emotions in the pattern described in the DSM as bipolar. I've been diagnosed with bipolar in the past but I strongly disagree with that diagnosis. [info] None [info] 1539875370

bellabou [info] My dear sweet, beautiful, loving daughters Kimberly &amp; Danielle. Momma, wanted to let ya'll know that since our stupid spat a month ago, how much I miss you both so profoundly that my heart stays in a constant state of brokenness. My arms ache to hug ya'll… my eyes long to see ya'll... my ears yearn to hear your voice &amp; laughter again. I’m lost in a sea of grief &amp; these waves have no mercy. But, I’m hanging on tight praying that God will calm the sea &amp; rescue me! After shooting myself in the chest last year trying to stop this same ole' heart of mine from the constant sadness, pain &amp; despair I just wanted to say, “I'm sorry, Honey, to both of you for not being stronger &amp; for letting ya’ll down!” Of all the things in life since that fateful day last year, I had hoped I would never disappoint either of you again. Sadly, I have failed. Our ridiculous argument over Facebook had more to do with my own insecurities and I should have handled it in a more mature way instead of constantly bringing it up because I felt ya'll were lying to me, for that I am sorry! I know in the past in the throes of my bipolar disease I’ve said and did things that I can’t take back or change. I know I have embarrassed ya’ll with my words and actions because looking back I’m embarrassed too! All I’m asking of you is to please find the forgiveness in your heart so we can continue on this journey that we call life together standing strong and supporting one another and whatever may come our way!You know before I shot myself I would wake up in the mornings and say in an anguished tone of voice, “Oh, God, why am I still alive?” But, since that fateful day, I now wake up in the mornings and say, “Thank you, God, that I’m still alive!” However, in the last month since our spat I find myself saying the latter again…I’m not making excuses for my actions and words but when our spat occurred I had been without my bipolar medications for 3 days because of they were lost with my purse in my storage unit.Last year when I was diagnosed with bipolar I had mixed emotions. I was relieved to finally have a diagnosis for my manic highs and debilitating lows. People like me tend to avoid getting the help they need because of the labels placed on them by family, friends, &amp; society. It's not fair that people with a sick brain are usually ostracized which only adds more confusion and heartache for them.  On the other hand, I was scared of the judgment society, family and friends would place on me simply because my brain was sick. When someone is diagnosed with a sick brain people tend to judge that person unmercifully. Then the labels and name-calling start, for instance, she is a crazy bitch or stay away from her because she's cray-cray etc. Now take my kidney disease, for example, whenever I become sick and I’m in pain and running a high fever people don’t judge me for that, they tend to be very concerned and there are no derogatory judgments placed against me when my kidneys aren’t functioning properly. However when my brain isn’t functioning properly that’s a completely different story and comes with a lot of heartache and embarrassment for me.I haven’t found a doctor yet since I moved back home but I’m sure he will write two prescriptions. The first prescription will be to either increase or change my current medications. But the second and most important prescription would be for us to start communicating again, being loving and compassionate toward one another &amp; ya'll forgiving me for my words &amp; actions because my brain is sick! This is a learning process for all of us. I have realized how important it is for ya’ll to be in my life and how much your love and support makes my sick brain function so much better. Simply put I cannot live without your love. I will be awaiting your response. Just know that I love ya'll to Infinity I always have &amp; always will… Love, Momma [info] None [info] 1539998652

your_aunt_mildred [info] Depression is a bitch. &amp; I was diagnosed with bipolar originally, but since coming here they said it's actually borderline personality disorder. It turns out I've been very, very good at avoiding my feelings. And I'm pretty bad at relationships. But I've learned quite a bit about how I can help myself with those things here. The timing with leaving the church and coming here is somewhat coincidental?

folieadoubleformes [info] In some ways I can relate.  I was a gifted vocalist.  Had huge scholarships to my first year of university in classical voice.  My professor compared me to a child protegy - incredible until 18 when everything went to shit. At 19 when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I didn’t really feel the need to other those who were sick.  That sort of attitude is why I actively avoid group therapy.  Every person is unique, so is their illness and it’s presentation.

DawgMan87 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder  I last year and I’m still learning a lot. One of the figures I had heard tossed around is that 90% of marriages end in divorce where a partner is bipolar. It’s not true. Though it led me to research the issue and while no solid statistics can be made about it, the tendency to assortatively mate with others who have mental health issues can exacerbate the challenges of those interpersonal relationships. For that reason, I’ve decided that I will not get involved with any long term relationship with someone who has a mental illness.

Karoal [info] If you feel depressed, please go see a doctor if you can.It's good that you know the basic facts about mental illnesses. However the more you delve into it, the more you can get positive bias and reason on false assumptions.Feeling dreamlike is not a delusion, so don't worry about that. As long as it doesn't cause you distress, lots of people space out. If it's distressing, you might want to bring that up with your doctor then.Personally I have been diagnosed with bipolar. Anecdotally people's mental illness can be "coloured" by their personality.In my experience mental illness affects you a tiny bit like being under the influence of a drug. You're acting and thinking differently, but you're still you in some way. That's where the analogy ends but I hope you understand me that your personality and your mental illness blend together somewhat.I know it's easy to freak out, I have done it and am still doing it. But remember that you want to take care of yourself, not identify what exactly is "not right" with you.Edit: if it matters at all, I scored ENFP :) [info] None [info] 1540467499
Narq1013 [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 and my fiancé has Borderline Personality Disorder, which can have similar traits to bipolar. First thing I suggest is finding a therapist for you and her to share. Sometimes when me or my fiancé are cycling it’s hard to listen to the other because A. It can come off as nagging and/or it can come off almost as a “know it all” and B. Not everything is being communicated or understood. A shared therapist can give you both insight on the others thoughts and where they are coming from. Also, as mentioned already on this thread you need to separate the sickness from the person you love. You know who you fell in love with and that person is still present. A few tips I have found to help when I’m dealing with my fiancé illness is to make your feelings known. One of my fiancé’s issues is taking her meds, so just every few days I ask and make sure she took them, if she comes across defensive  about it I just remind her that I care for her and want to to be the best she can so it doesn’t come off as if I’m babysitting her meds.Overall remind yourself that you are in love with this person. Even on meds there’s going to be times that are tough but remember the tough times are worth it. [info] None [info] 1540480253

Unfortunately these obsessive desires tent to end, dropped completely. Then it is back to the bad behavior. This might be different from person to person but it’s how I felt.

Mittinmang [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a professional psychiatrists in a clinic. I've made my peace with it, or at least I try to cope with it and try to keep my balanced without medication. I just wish my family, especially my mom would understand that I'm trying my hardest but sometimes I'm just depressed and sometimes I do crazy stuff out of nowhere without caring about the consequences. Her constant judgement makes it hard to fight against my own brain because I feel like it's my fault, I'm doing it KNOWING I shouldn't, which isn't true.But to be positive: In my manic episodes I'm doing crazy stuff, and yeah, I'm in debt. But it's an adventure and it sometimes actually helps me doing things that I always wanted to do; Just like moving 600km away from home for my first love. I may be struggling a lot, but at least I get to see a lot of beauty. [info] None [info] 1540507091
LiloWalker [info] I'm not a doctor but I'll share my experience: I was diagnosed with bipolar I at 19 and ADHD at 21.  I definitely always had ADHD  as a kid but self learned coping strategies to some extent and got by.  In college and grad school, I had a really tough time compensating.  It was similar.. I couldnt remember anything and I would start so many things but not finish.  I started taking medicine for ADHD which helped a lot.  I don't consistently take medicine now in my late 20s because I get soooooo tired when I take it (I always thought ADHD medicine woke you up? Not for me..best sleep with it tho).  I stay organized at my job with lists and take walks around the building during the day.  I also am better at forcing myself to finish things that I start..it can be hard.  My brain feels calmer  and I feel more like myself when I take the medicine, I just don't like being so tired.I mentioned the bipolar in the beginning because theres some overlap with symptoms.Tldr; I was dx as an adult with ADHD. It couldn't hurt to see a specialist if money isnt an issue. [info] None [info] 1540521582

Q1e3t5r4w2 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 before BPD and I went through all the same things. None of the medications ever worked for me except benzos when I was having a really bad episode/panic attack. Sleeping pills never even put me to sleep just gave me headaches and made my mouth taste horrible. You could try buying him a DBT workbook and read it with him if you want to try to save money. Most therapists will just work through the DBT workbook with him. But there are other therapists who try different kinds of therapy specifically for past abuse and PTSD type disorders. I've had others try things like hypnotherapy and crystal healing... which never did anything lol. It might be more helpful for him to work through these things with a licensed therapist though because I know how hard it is to read a book while dealing with mental problems. I've been doing it on my own because I dont have health insurance and I've still been making a lot of progress. But sometimes it's easier to have a professional explain things to you. My last therapist just took pages of the DBT workbook and scanned them for me to take home though and I was paying her a lot of money so I guess I'm just jaded when it comes to therapy. Thank you for being there for him and trying to help him through this. Hes very lucky to have someone like you in his life who cares so much. :) [info] None [info] 1540637960
saladisawasteoftime [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was a teenager. I’ve been medicated for ten years and I’ve always ALWAYS taken my meds. It is so important to keep taking them even if you’re feeling better. I made the most movements towards regaining myself in the last five years when I was seeing a therapist as well. One of the things she taught me was to be kind to myself. The illness is never going to go away but it will get easier to deal with. So when it hits me hard for a week or so I remember to be kind to myself and remind myself that it’s ok that certain things can’t get done. When I’m sick I can’t do it all but I can do what’s important.  [info] None [info] 1540652164

Sugar-Wookiee [info] I'm really curious about this too.I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder years before narcolepsy so I've been on *so* many different meds to get me to sleep better.I've previously taken Trazodone (very zombefying, like you said) and possibly others that I'm not thinking of.Right now I'm taking Seroquel, Vistaril and 10mg of Melatonin for sleep. This is alongside other meds that make me drowsy (like Gabapentin). I still either wake up constantly or constantly have sleep state misperception.)*Somewhat* understandably, every psychiatrist I saw was utterly perplexed as to how I could wake up so often every night no matter what we did. I really wish they'd have dug deeper and referred me to someone who may be able to help rather than basically just telling me to "stick with it til it works" (which it never has, ever). 🙄I'm not currently on any stimulant and I doubt I'll ever get to try Xyrem because even if it was miraculously approved by my insurance apparently it interacts with other things I'm on (like Seroquel).

Or, I'll be on one that quits working and have to switch. Also, they come out with new and improved meds that some drs believe to be better than others.

perishedstarsz [info] It warms my heart to read your post. You're an amazing friend for being concerned with his well being. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features. I received my diagnosis two and a half years ago when I was hospitalized during my first manic episode. I recently came out of my second hospitalization. Even with the delusions and major shift in my thinking, I wasn't given the assessment of schizoaffective. I do still believe I may be schizoaffective, but the professionals think it was a manic episode. &amp;#x200B;If he is taking medication for bipolar, he probably has been assessed as such. Although it sounds like this current medication combination may be insufficient for his current state. The pressured and disorganized speech sounds like he may be manic again. It's a difficult mental illness to watch as an outsider, but much worse for insider. If his family is far away in Sans Fransisco, I would also be worried about his well being. I had a very similar experience with the AI paranoia. I thought I was similar to a robot or alien and that Google and Facebook were stalking me. The grandiosity belief that my family and I were exceptional, thus I was a subject being studied closely online and in real life through cameras. Sounds silly now that I am re-stabilized, but at the time I firmly believed it. &amp;#x200B;He must be struggling right now and I think you did the right thing. Let him know that he is not alone in this. I felt the same way he does and he's not crazy and he needs help right now. Right now, his concern shouldn't be school and AI. It should be his humanity and mental health improvement. Speaking as someone who's been through it, know that it is not your responsibility, but it is much appreciated its\_okay\_tommy.

CummyBot2000 [info] And really, the reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community.  He started showing that he actually had power, that he wasn’t just one of a monolithic voice, but he could wrap people around.So there’s theories that there’s infinite amounts of universe and there’s alternate universe.  So it’s very important for me to get Hoover out, because in an alternate universe, I am him.  And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I’m moving back to Chicago and it’s not just about, you know, getting on stage and being an entertainer and having a monolithic voice that’s forced to be a specific party.You know, people expect that if you’re black you have to be Democrat.  I have a — I’ve had conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat.  They say — you know, first of all, it’s a limited amount of jobs.  So the fathers lose the jobs, and they say, “We’ll give you more money for having more kids in your home.”  And then, we got rid of the mental health institutes in the ‘80s and the ‘90s, and the prison rates just shot up.And now you have “Chiraq,” what people call “Chiraq” — which is actually — our murder rate is going down by 20 percent every year.  I just talked to the superintendent; met with Michael Sacks; that’s Rahm’s right-hand man.  So I think it’s the bravery that helps you beat this game called life.You know, they tried to scare me to not wear this hat — my own friends.  But this hat, it gives me — it gives me power, in a way.  You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn’t have a lot of male energy in my home.  And also, I’m married to a family that — (laughs) — you know, not a lot of male energy going on.  It’s beautiful, though.  But there’s times where, you know, there’s something about — you know, I love Hillary.  I love everyone, right?  But the campaign “I’m with her” just didn’t make me feel, as a guy, that didn’t get to see my dad all the time — like a guy that could play catch with his son.  It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman.  You made a Superman.  That was my — that’s my favorite superhero.  And you made a Superman cape.For me, also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys — non-political, no bullshit — put the beep on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay — and just goes in and gets it done.Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas.  Because at Adidas, when I went in, in 2015, we were a $14-billion company losing $2 billion a year.  Now we have a $38-billion market cap.  It’s called the “Yeezy effect.”And I went to Casper.  We had a meeting in Chicago.  And I said, “You have to bring manufacturing onshore.”  And not even shore; into the core.  It’s not about the border; it’s the core of Adidas.  And Chicago is the core of Middle America.  And we have to make Middle America strong.So I had the balls — because I have enough balls to put on this hat.  I mean, this Adidas thing made be a billionaire.  And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal.  But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than to have no fathers in Chicago with no homes.  And when we do have prison reformation, for no — because it’s habilitation, not rehabilitation, because they didn’t have the abilities in the first place.  We never had anyone that taught us.  They didn’t teach us.  Exactly — we had no one that “taught” us.  Right?So it’s more important than any specific deal — anything — that we bring jobs into America, and that we provide a transition with mental health and the Amer-I-Can education curriculum that Jim has worked on.  Larry Hoover also has a curriculum that he’s worked on.  We have Montessori curriculums that we worked on.  WeWork has a beautiful curriculum.  The Waldorf establishment has a curriculum.  We have meditation.  There’s a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment.I did say “abolish” with the hat on.  Because why would you keep something around that’s a trap door?  If you’re building a floor — the Constitution is the base of our industry, right?  Of our country, of our company.  Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you — accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber?  You end up — you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship.The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment — and I think the way the universe works, it’s perfect.  We don’t have 13 floors, do we?  You know, so the four — the four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn’t look like the people they were amending.  Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read — or African Americans to read.  And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave.Again — so what I think is, we don’t need sentences; we need pardons.  We need to talk to people.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL.  And he looked at my brain — it’s equal on three parts.  I’m going to go ahead drop some bombs for you — 98 percentile IQ test.  I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards, (inaudible), so I’m going to work on that one.  The other ones, 98 percent — Tesla, Freud.So he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name.  So all this power that I got, and I’m taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn’t be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage.And what we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money.  That’s one thing — I’ve never stepped into a situation where I didn’t make people more money.  So we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories.  We can bring not only Adidas onshore, we can bring — Foxconn has set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota.

I was an absolute wreck and had parents that were very judgemental of people with mental illness and didn't like us showing emotion. I started being suicidal when I was 9. Early this year, I was diagnosed with bipolar and some other stuff after years of covering it up and feeling ashamed. I'm finally stable and it's reconfirmed my decision to be child free. I will not risk putting a child through this. I can not go off meds to have a child because I would be both a risk to myself and the spawn. I would not be a good mother for so many reasons, not just my mental illness. I hope you continue to be well, friend.  [info] None [info] 1541660980
BLAKSEAL [info] Hi I’m BLAKSEAL or Adam. I’m 23 and I’ve been in the military for 4 years so far but recently I was diagnosed with bipolar so I’m being medically separated. This is what gave me motivation to really take my music seriously. I never put anything out there but now I’m working on my first EP and not putting it out until I get my photoshoots complete and finish writing up my business plan. I have everything ready. I’m a rapper who has the basic knowledge of producing. I mainly go for a dark, angry, light the world on fire kind of vibe for my music. I’m mainly looking to network with rappers who have the same vibe, producers, social media figures, and anyone interested in photo/video/graphic design. I already have connections with some bigger social media pages who agreed to promote me already (50k+ subs on some), a few photographers who are a small distance from me, and a few producers who might not have my sound but might fit the sound your looking for. My forte besides rapping is fashion, marketing, marketing psychology, and creating a realistic business plan. I’m willing to help anyone I fuck with. [MY MUSIC SOCIAL MEDIA IS EMPTY UNTIL MY CONTENT IS READY TO BE DROPPED]Everyone is welcome to DM me on Reddit.

eatpoetry [info] Dude I met at church camp in 2010. We had an immediate connection, made out in the dark on the last night, got told by a camp counselor to "leave room for Jesus!" while playing tonsil hockey the morning we were all leaving. I fell in love with him over the course of about 4 days, something about him said "he's the one." He told me he felt the same way. Problem was I went to college the following fall and became severely depressed. Depression led to full blown psychotic break. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but it was actually something more like PTSD. During that time I sent him a lot of strange, psychotic Facebook messages. He ended up blocking me. To say I was embarrassed when I got my right mind back was an understatement. Dying every day from shame is more accurate. At some point years later I sent him a message from someone else's Facebook account apologizing, and he unblocked me. At this point, I am in a serious relationship with someone I plan on marrying and I believe he is either married or in a similarly serious relationship (I think he's still with this one chick that he's been with for a really long time.) I have no interest in him anymore romantically. But I just wonder sometimes what he thinks of all that shit. If I could say something to him all I would say is "Damn, I'm so fucking sorry" even though I didn't really do anything to him. It was just weird because we had such an incredible connection and it fucking disappeared. [info] None [info] 1541830201
jarealz [info] Hey man, I can relate with that situation, though mine is a bit different. I’m athletic and above average in looks as well, but a few years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Thanks to a manic state spanning a few months I did some really crazy and weird shit that definitely threw people off. It still makes me cringe really hard. I think the best way to handle a deficiency is to not mention it unless it comes up in conversation. It could throw some people off but the ones who won’t let it factor into how much they like you are the people you want to keep around. For example, I was a little too tipsy at a party one night and mentioned to some random girl that I’m bipolar. It immediately killed whatever positive vibe we had going and she walked away shortly thereafter. The friends that are still with me even after my episode are my closest, most valued friends. Our respective deficits are just another minute piece of the puzzle that makes you, you. If you lose a piece of a 2000 piece puzzle, sure, it may look a bit weird if you even notice that the piece is gone, but you can still tell what the pleasant image on the puzzle looks like.Best of luck man.

skewered_tits [info] I have intrusive harm imagery that resolves in one of three ways.  1. I do the bad thing (don’t recommend this one).  2.  I fight with the images until I become so upset that I have a panic attack, and the extreme emotion seems to reset my brain.  3. Now that I take a low dose of SSRI and have some DBT, I am at times able to recognize the intrusive imagery and work through the compulsion while maintaining control.I was diagnosed with bipolar first.  Before when I was ignorant about all the different ways OCD manifests, I thought that these extra symptoms were some kind of psychosis.  Honestly, my psychiatrist is the one who told me. I had no idea I had OCD until she diagnosed me.  Now that I understand what OCD really looks like, I am able to recognize the symptoms in myself.I guess the real answer to your question is that my OCD manifests totally differently than racing thoughts from a manic episode, which probably isn’t that helpful.  My racing thoughts are like my internal monologue gone wild, whereas my OCD is like visual imagery in my minds eye which make me feel pulled or compelled.Sorry for the late response.  I hope that helps.  At the end of the day, the diagnosis doesn’t matter so much as receiving whatever treatment works for you.  My best advice is just to be really honest with your doctor.  If you have any other questions about what it’s like for me, I will do my best to explain. [info] None [info] 1542288990

LadySullivan [info] The therapist might have been independent or working with others in a practice, can’t remember, but it wasn’t in a school. Therapists had a hard time with me because I exhibited behaviors of someone abused, but never was. One of my psychs kind of hinted that maybe I was hiding something (which admittedly I did some times) but I didn’t have a dark past at all. I was diagnosed with bipolar so with the right meds to even out my mood, some aging, and a series of good decisions, I was able to overcome it. No therapist has ever helped me, but there was at least one that meant well, and it was nice to talk to someone who understood my condition. The only thing that really helped was medicine that made me think clearly enough to make better decisions for my life and it just snowballed into better circumstances. In general I would recommend therapy over medicine, but that wasn’t the best fit for me at the time. Come to think of it, the support group I attended for a while helped me a lot more. Being around others that could empathize as well as being support for them in return was a much more positive experience for me.  [info] None [info] 1542408364

ledandelion [info] If you don't like or trust your psychiatrist you can get another opinion but if you don't trust doctors in general that might not help. I recommend giving them all the info, and maybe tracking your moods/situations to show them, too. Do you have a therapist you trust? Or could you try to find one? Most of them can help diagnose, too, and you'll have more time with them and see them more frequently. I trust my psychiatrist, but started seeing a therapist I like and feel more comfortable opening up with her. I understand the confusion, I was diagnosed with bipolar after an SSRI reaction, and it kind of fits but I am also debating if I have ADHD or OCD in addition or instead and if I just had a weird med reaction.

carnivorous-Vagina [info] This isn't an attack on anyone and I I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I am speaking from experience. One of the biggest things you can do is stop feeling sorry for yourself. I know that sounds harsh or simplistic but that's a huge step and usually step number one. Because you're not going to get anything solved you're not going to get out of bed you're not going to do anything if you keep thinking the card is stacked against you and you're constantly feeling but that other people should feel sorry for you as well. Whenever I start getting angry and upset and hurt and not want to do anything a lot of the time it's because I feel like what's the point the world is against me so on and so on and a lot of it is sympathy for myself so I have to start thinking differently than that and it helps out majorly. Once I feel like everything's not pointless and I do stand a chance I'm changing how I feel then lots of change starts to happen and it makes life a lot easier. [info] None [info] 1542659993

StoneyBabee [info] I absolutely can relate with you. I've been diagnosed with bipolar, but not adhd. Although I have only seen the psychiatrist once and had a negative experience so ive been procrastinating on finding a new one. Lately ive been making the connections of some of my behavior to adhd as its increasingly gotten worse. my mom also made me realize today that ive always had adverse reactions to Benadryl. my mother absolutely HATED having to give me some or when the hospital insisted on giving me some.. most kids would knock out, id be a living nightmare. even as an adult, I cant take Benadryl for this reason. I started looking into it and I guess that 10 % of people with ADHD experience paradoxical agitation after taking Benadryl. maybe im looking too much into it idk.

annamae13 [info] My birth control actually helps stabilize my moods. I'd always had crazy irregular periods, very painful and really bad PMS. I went on birth control years before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and have been on the same pill this whole time non stop. I missed a few days of it last month while I was sick, and my mood went crazy. It made me realize my pill actually helps stabilize me. If it's something you're open to trying, I'd ask your doctor about a low dose hormonal birth control. The only drawback is that it gives me very bad cystic acne (I've just been dealing with it because I have zero periods or other period symptoms) and I'm kinda scared now to switch to a different pill to fix that, cuz I don't know what it'll do to my mood. But it shouldn't be a problem if you find one that works for your body.  [info] None [info] 1543004358
sketchypudding [info] Oh boy do I have a story for you. First here's a little back story. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 14 years old and I was always in denial of it. I didn't see myself acting the way I thought bipolar people acted (literally crazy). So after being forced to take meds for years as a minor, I finally turned 18, moved out of my Mother's house (she was the one forcing me to take these meds), and stopped taking my medication cold turkey. I didn't think I was bipolar anyway so what could go wrong? Anyway, I went a year without the pills and self medicated with large quantities of marijuana and other party drugs. A year or so later I was working as a telemarketer and I met (who I thought was) the one. We seemed perfectly in sync and I later came to find out she was also an unmedicated bipolar. After getting acquainted and discussing our stormy pasts, we were both in an upswing at the same time and we formed the really close, soul bonding connection. Everything was perfect, with the world, with her, with my life, everything was great and I needed to seize the moment. So then we started drinking and doing drugs together to further our highs and we eventually ended up having sex. We were both feeling so high on life and so perfect that we eventually decided to start going out and then less than 6 months later we made the impulsive decision to elope. Eloping was the perfect cherry on top of this mania fueled love affair.So then, we move in to an apartment together and we are so delighted to finally have our own space where we can be together all the time. We both got hired at the same call center together and we started making decent money an everything was still fantastic. We continue to be manic together, doing drugs, being impulsive, spending more money than we had, having group sex. And then finally, the mania ends. Her mania ended first and then mine later. We both ended up horribly depressed, in and out of the hospital, getting fired from our jobs for attendance due to being too depressed, and then getting evicted from our apartment for being unable to pay the rent. After we went our separate ways I realized that our relationship and the feeling we felt were pretty much all relate to our mania. To this day, I don't understand how we ended up cycling together, but damn did it mess up my life. The relationship, including the part before marriage, lasted less than a year. The only thing more embarrassing than impulsively getting married at 19 is divorcing that same person at 20. This was absolutely an unhealthy relationship and it is a nightmare to look back on, but I like to think that I am wiser for the experience. I'm not sure if this is too much info, but this relationship is a grade A example of a negative relationship with another bipolar person. Had we both been medicated, this whole painful experience could have been prevented.  [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1543098171

cryptid_critter [info] I definitely have a complicated relationship with emotions. When u was in high school my dad went into a bipolar psychosis that ruined my life. He treated to kill us, my school almost had to honor knockdown because they thought genes going to come to try to kill my brother and I. My parents divorced. Later that year I was diagnosed with bipolar. I remained resilient in my ability to master my emotions, and to not tip too far like my dad did. I feel, I feel a lot and I feel very very strongly. It's very easy to make me cry or make me red-faced and I hate it about myself. I am so afraid of feeling anything too strongly. When I do express my emotions I always feel like everything I do is too much. I feel like I'm annoying everyone around me. I had feelings of gender dysphoria throughout high school, even though I didn't realize that's what it was. At least, I think that's what it was. I wanted to be Eli Goldsworthy from degrassi (ugh lmao) Acting like him, acting masculine, made me feel SO GOOD. it felt right, I felt like me. But then it would feel so good that it felt fake? So I would stop. This feeling persisted, in college I wanted to act and emulate Tyler Durden from Fight Club. I loved feeling like a punky badass DUDE. But it makes me /too/ happy? Like I feel SO STRONGLY when I act like that, and it freaks me out and triggers my desire to suppress my emotions really really hard so I shut down and convince myself I don't like feeling that way, or that I'm fucked up for wrong for wanting to be that way. Sorry for the super long rant lmao  [info] None [info] 1543362138
FuFoozle [info] I think most evidence suggests it is a combination of genes and environment. I was diagnosed with bipolar II but no longer meet the diagnostic criteria. I read about it a lot at that time. A separate professional considered a diagnosis of borderline and called me a "borderline borderline", so I read about that more recently. I know that borderline people have genes that make them more emotional, but lots of people have those genes and will not develop borderline if the environment is emotionally validating.My trauma therapist said a lot of what people think about bipolar is from old research and even some mental health professionals have not updated their thinking. Apparently once a theory is dominant for awhile, it becomes very difficult for new theories to displace it from textbooks and reference materials, even if the amount of evidence for both is the same.For the physical disease I have, there is evidence that actually makes the old theory of the disease impossible, but because no theory has been proven, textbooks still present the old theory in its own section and everything else is "other theories".That is my long way of saying that there is a lot of outdated information about bipolar (and borderline) because scientific thinking about those disorders has changed A LOT. So you have to make sure your source is modern. Have you read a newer book about bipolar? Learning about yourself can be fun and it can actually lessen your symptoms (it is called psychoeducation).Anyway, I guess I don't technically have bipolar but I have had a lot of mood and personality issues and have an Ndad.

Abusers are all the same; they instigate an argument and no matter what you do, it escalates sharply.  You are blamed for everything, and nothing about you is acceptable.  They deliberately make you feel like shit, because they need that power to feel any identity.  *But anything an abuser tells you that you are, is not at all about you, but about themselves.*For 30 years I have had various friends with bipolar disorders:  any creative field seems to attract unique personality types.  I have met people in hospital settings with bipolar.  One of my best friends has both bipolar and borderline.  And recently I was diagnosed with bipolar—before that I had fluctuating moods but I dealt with them w/o medication, and also saw a psychiatrist.  (Extraordinary stresses pushed my body chemistry into, what I think of as, brain shock, and now I take medication to rebalance it .)My point is, out of all these people, I have never met an abusive person,  they care too much about others.  We’ve joked around that you’re bipolar because you are overstimulated, feel too much, and the empathy kills you, lol!An abusive person couldn’t give a shit.  Either your focus is on them, or you’re nothing.  You are meaningless.  I don’t think most abusive people know that true love does NOT mean true power.So, I strongly disagree that all people with BP are abusive.  I do agree that, in some mania, selfishness can be a predominant symptom, because you are just pretty much incapable of thinking clearly—you are swept away by a hurricane made up of a thousand tornadoes.Your ex, op, is an abuser.  An abuser can wear such a great mask!  So, whether he has BP or not is rather irrelevant BECAUSE *he is an asshole!*.   This is  not your fault:  darkness wears the best disguise,  You are well out of it. [info] None [info] 1543905198

For example, in 2016 I was diagnosed with bipolar, OCD, and suicidal thoughts. I’ve gotten so drunk high on weed and coricidin and Xanax that I accepted my fate whilst looking towards the ceiling of the train station laying on the platform. I’ve also been held up at gunpoint, robbed, beaten, put in a group home away from my parents, Been through rehab, mental hospitals, expelled from various schools.

CamTheKid22 [info] That must be a hard job, kids it seems, are very often misdiagnosed. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around the same time as I was labeled mentally Disturbed by the school district, then later after a bunch of testing it was concluded that I did not actually have bipolar. Puberty can really affect someone's mental state, and I believe that's the reason why I was showing symptoms of bipolar disorder.  [info] None [info] 1543985392
GypsyRose_83 [info] I get it...I used drugs for years to feel normal because my altered state of mind felt right. My sober me was not who I thought I wanted  or needed to be. But I got older and my actions from doing drugs came with heavy consequences and I was hospitalized after trying to commit suicide from being depressed because I just did not understand why everyone and everything was against how I wanted to live.  Long story short I was diagnosed with bipolar while in the hospital. Learning about this illness and being medicated over the years has put sooo much into perspective of why I did the things I did and why they felt right and justified. I’m not saying I’m cured by any means but now it’s been almost 10 years since then and moved away from my home town and I now live a life I never thought I could.  A sober life.  I urge you to seek help for your addiction.  Good luck my friend [info]  [info] 1544002312
nicepixelsyagotthere [info] Wow.. yeah that sounds eye opening.I feel bad bc my first thoughts when witnessing a toddler-like tantrum were almost a mixture of shock and abhorrence.  I had no idea what BPD was but other things showed themselves too and I realized something was not right, I knew it was more than bipolar bc I have been diagnosed with bipolar two for most of my life so I’m familiar with that.. this is much more intense.Turns out his mother had something happen when she gave birth that caused her to lose her memory.

I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 at age 25, I can almost guarantee it had nothing to do with the specific high school I went to. Mental illness is almost always hereditary, and individuals predisposed to such illness often wind up having them, not as a result of being ill adjusted, but simply because of the fact that their brains are wired that way.

You may still do well at nursing.&amp;#x200B;Whether you are bipolar or something else you must suffer symptoms for your friend and you to suspect you have bipolar.

TheRoyalGodfrey [info] yeah the way kanye talks about mental health isn't really accurate or healthy. Like I remember in his interview with Charlamagne, Charlamagne asked him if he sees a therapist and he said "the world is my therapist."And the ye cover is perpetuating the misleading stereotype around bipolar disorder that you just constantly switch between manic and depressive but usually cycles last for 3-6 months. Ultra-rapid (cycles lasting days) and ultradian (cycles within a day) are very very rare.It's also unclear whether Kanye actually has bipolar disorder. At the White House, he said "I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and NFL. He looked at my brain. I wasn't actually bipolar, I had sleep deprivation" but now he's back to saying he has it. Which (I don't wan to armchair diagnose but) he probably does. [Mariah Carey has bipolar disorder](https://people.com/music/mariah-carey-bipolar-disorder-diagnosis-exclusive/) and she's talked about how he wanted to believe it was just sleep deprivation for a while.It feels like Kanye is trying to use his mental illness to guilty people while not even treating it properly and spreading harmful misconceptions about BPD. A lot of the stuff he's been saying about not listening to other people and being "free" sounds like feeding into a manic episode. Like the song "Freee" and saying "bipolar is my superpower" sound like embracing the mania which seems ill advised.Also that Gucci/Quavo song doesn't destigmatize BPD at all [info] None [info] 1544908543

XxFoster2287xX [info] I was seeing someone nice right before I got manic for the first time in my life. It was long distance relationship. Knowing I had to back into treatment, I had to obviously explain that I was in no condition for a relationship. I'm not so sure that my story was actually believed  but I guess it was whatever. Anyways it just so happened that my ex came back into my life briefly after this all happend and was very supportive with me as I had to go back into treatment again. Theres nothing more stressful than being symptomatic and losing control of your life, having to go back to treatment.... But things got much better after being very patient my new med management once I was diagnosed with bipolar 1.  Not only did things get better as far as my quality of life a d feeling great again (gradually) ... But things have also never been better with my ex  who is no longer my ex. We're now closer than ever  since we had some closure on our break up.This was also great for us to vent and to go on and decide to move forward with our relationship again. If had a choice of being healthy with the long distance person... or having to back to treatment again (as much as I hate it) and reunite with my ex... I will always take latter in a heartbeat. The main point of the story...As much as it hurts and I can relate, you  have to always prioritize your mental/biological health. Sounds like you and I have gone through similar situations in life.The good news is once you start getting better gradually, everything else in life gravitate back in your life.   Life is crazy... all we can do is take it one day at a time.  When the chips are down... it's really hard to realize when you're symptomatic but there are more options out there than we could even start to imagine. Stay strong. You got this!!!

audiomanic [info] I know what you mean, I was diagnosed with bipolar 7 years ago and while I agree that blame is not the right thing to do, that's not what he's saying. Blame and accountability are not the same thing. Blame is telling someone "it's you're fault that we were late to the event and now the night is ruined", blame provides no solution. Accountability is looking yourself in the mirror and saying "I was late because of my (insert reason here). Roger that. Let's fix it so it doesn't happen again". I had a buddy who always had a quote I loved that said "don't appologize, just don't do it again". And that's his whole thing, no "excuses" just means you acknowledge there's a leak in the roof and you fix it, you don't "excuse" yourself. Depression is staring at the leak and asking "why me" while the house floods. Depression is both physical and mental. If you fix the mental, the physical follows. Vice versa, if you push your body, the mind follows as well. Trust me, I've been hospitalized and taken more meds for my disorder than I can count over the years, but Goggins has helped more than any therapist I've had in the past. At the end of the day, we are the only ones that can accept the help or not, a therapist can't change you, they can only ask the questions that we don't wanna ask ourselves. Goggins just tells you to go deep and ask why, that's it. [info] None [info] 1545503386

-Thoona- [info] My grades began plummeting around age 11, and several months later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I wish that my parents (who worked in the mental health field) and/or my psychiatrist at the time had further investigated what the issue was, especially when psychotherapy and various mood stabilizers were incredibly ineffective.  &amp;nbsp;That being said, I DO actually have bipolar disorder, as well as ADHD. So they weren't completely off base. I just choose to only take medication for my ADHD, and do my best to control my bipolar symptoms on my own. And generally, I wish that I could've been easier to deal with for my parents, and less of an ungrateful dickhead.

xuekuan [info] The reason I created Reddit is that I wanted to talk about Donald Glover and most specifically Because the internet. I've done a pretty thorough read through, multiple actually. Although by screenplay standards this is no classic, I think it is simply revolutionary - combining film, storytelling, and a conceptual album with a plethora of influences and genres. If you haven't done a couple listens to the albums or only find the singles appealing I'd just like to say its ALL good. This being said, you could say I am biased. But I'd like to think its a tribute and appreciation.This album is three things at once, a background for the screenplay, a conceptual album marking the growth of CG as an artist, and a storytelling piece. Because the internet uses lyrics that are succinct but powerful - example:" when we were, kind of thing, betcha crawl, all alone." Representing the four stages of a failed relationship. "when we were, kind of thing" insinuates a casual relationship common in our internet-obsessed society. "betcha crawl" is CG egotistically expecting this girl to come back after their eventual break up, but in the end he remains "all alone" and it becomes apparent that he stems confidence from vulnerability. Defense mechanisms, traumatic experiences, Insecurity, melancholy. This is beyond the atmosphere of the album but also the characteristics of our character "the boy". This is why I loved the album, coming from a place where I was 15 and hopeless and incredibly split between my past and the uncertain future - I later broke up with my girlfriend the same month I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and kicked out of school while being fucked up by acid and an intense weed dependency. These were things I have never done 5 months ago and it completely changed my perspective. Anyways, to combat the loneliness I portrayed myself as a brooding nonchalant figure but forgetting to be genuine to myself. Because the internet was my anchor throughout this time and these are the reasons I connect to "the boy" so much. "Don't be mad at me cause I'm doing me better than you're doing you." Fat fucking mood.Because this album is such well written for the perspective and story of "the boy", it also uses him and his reflections to speak on more significant philosophical ideas. These are sprinkled across the album and just goes to show the creative process and effort put into the album to be poetic and cryptic - another way of saying genuine.  I really don't know what to add so I'll end on this note.&amp;#x200B;That power : 3:00Crawl: the raw and aggressive rap that doesn't come out abrasive in comparison to the mood of the albumDial-up + The worst guys: beach and seagullsTelegraph ave: best CG song The Party: 1:02Flight of the navigator: watching the stars with a girl you're trying to fuck.

Miss_Management [info] I've never been diagnosed with Aspergers butI was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 10.  It runs in my family both fortunately and unfortunately.   I don't have any children myself (yet anyways) but I've come to believe that the real secret is NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING.  Upon reaching my 30s I kinda feel like the end scene in the movie The Big Short about the collapse of the housing market.   These two young men were standing in an empty cubeville building looking around when asked what they were hoping to find replied something like 'I dunno,  adults. ' to paraphrase it.   That's how feel now.   We're all just kinda trying to figure out the "right" way to do things and people act like they know what they're doing and act like an authority figure but the truth is they don't really know what to do either.  I think as far as parenting goesI would say just be a good example and expect to fuck up.  A lot.   My parents did,  their parents did,  my friends with kids do,  etc.   It sounds like your life is stable enough and you're already raising two great kids so maybe consider going for it and take the plunge, so to speak.

chidoriana [info] I believe that my first manic episode (recent to memory) lasted for the entirety of Fall quarter my third year in college. I'm usually shy and introverted too. I was stressed/anxious beforehand during the summer because I was anticipating everything I'd have on my plate. Once school started, it felt like I was a whole new person. I introduced and befriended more people during Fall quarter than I have during my first 2 years of college lol. My confidence skyrocketed too. I became close friends with acquaintances from my first year. I was out of the house a lot and bonding with people. I was a social butterfly. I would engage conversations first during class or meetings (usually I'm a wallflower so this was definitely new to me).I had so much energy that I was the best student I have ever been thus far during that quarter. I did a lot of hw and readings waaay beforehand (I'm usually a procrastinator!!) I'd stay up late for no particular reason at all, sometimes with the urge to clean or to do more hw. If I slept for 2-3 hours, I'd still have the same energy and be ready to kickstart my day.This energy persisted through Winter quarter. Things felt like they were going really well until Spring quarter started. Legitimately, the very first day of instruction of Spring quarter, my mood COMPLETELY shifted. I was hit with a low mood in an instant. I can even remember the exact moment it happened. I always describe my mood swings as flipping a light switch on and off.My grades started slipping. I never wanted to leave the house or hangout with anyone. All I ever did was sleep. I loathed all my responsibilities/extracurriculars that I was very passionate about during Fall/Winter. I fell back into old destructive habits. Everything hit like a truck. Tbh 2018 was depressing LOL. Spring quarter is when I was diagnosed with bipolar because I hospitalized myself for suicide ideation. It's been wild up until now but I like looking back at my 3rd year because it gave me clarity of how and why I did the things I did. I'll never forget Spring quarter because it'll always remind me of all the bad shit I went through and yet still came out of it alive. It stands out to me because of its relativity to Fall/Winter. TLDR; reflecting on your past struggles gives a sense of pride. Hindsight is 20/20.  [info] None [info] 1546372255
ExperientialTruth [info] Hell yes.  So, 7 years married here.  In the last year, see fun shit happened!!!!  I was fired 3 mos. ago from a.miserable white collar job.  I was diagnosed with bipolar II.  I admitted to my wife that I sometimes wish I didn't wake up again.I'm so fucking blessed (not by a god)/fortunate and GRATEFUL that my wife has accepted these aspects that she was not aware of on our wedding day.  The only constant is change, people.  Embrace change - it's natural and healthy.  But if the person changes to be anti-human - GTFO. [info] None [info] 1546495393
lysol_belt [info] At no point in my response did I resort to insults towards your mental faculties or your personal character. In fact, I said "your heart may be in the right place." I gave you the benefit of the doubt. I did, however, call out the arrogance of an obvious layman attempting to online diagnose an entire population based on some documentary they watched. I also called out the disrespect inherent in doing so publicly.I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I'm no stranger to mental illness.One of the first things you learn in treatment is that it's your responsibility to handle your mental illness. No one else's. If you suspect you are suffering from mental illness, I urge you to seek professional treatment and diagnosis. Take the steps you need to take to be as healthy as you can.But don't put that off on the rest of us.Best of luck in your recovery, wherever it leads you. No sarcasm or ill will.

AutoModerator [info] ^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***This account is a throw away. I want to get some perspective since I do feel like the asshole but as the same time I don't.tl;dr: coworker took my shift so I could get a test done and the owner handled it very poorly and immaturely.I want to start this with some back ground info. I got this job after my previous one had been a nightmare. I went into my current job explaining to them some of what happened and how I never wish to have those things happen again. When I received the offer for my current job I was promised an increase in hours and a management position down the line which never happened. Its a super small new business, excluding the owner there are four of us. I am a very warm and love to laugh. I love making people laugh and smile and I HATE confrontation because it is the exact opposite of me. I try my best at work to be as sweet as possible to the customers as the work I do is in the image of the business. A good amount call me Sweet (my nickname).Now to the story. When I went through the interview process the owner asked, "If a customer came in and wanted to buy something but wanted it at a lower price would you do it? I allow up to 10% discount to get the item sold. They want it for 25% off and you can't reach me to ask, what do you do?" I told her that it depends on which product it is. If it is something that has been sitting on the shelves a while I would consider it, but if it was a good moving product no I wouldn't. She then asks, "I get back or you finally reach me and I tell you you shouldn't have given that discount, what do you do?' I told her I would apologize profusely and would never do it again. She said she was happy with this answer. This is relevant because a worker from my school (community college) came in and I knew her and she talks a lot and could be good to get more students into the store. She wanted two products (I can't say what they are as it might be a clue to my store) one was usually around $35 (this one hadn't sold at all in months) and the other is $7.50. Long story short I discount it as it hadn't sold so she gets both for $35 (the $7.50 she got for free) and not too much longer later she returns it and kept the "free" product. My boss who said in the interview she would speak to me had a completely different reaction. She flipped. I realize I shouldn't have done it, but it didn't warrant the reaction."YOU DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS! This is unacceptable! DO NOT DO THIS AGAIN!""I'm really sorry and I swear it'll never happen again""DO NOT DO IT AGAIN!""I swear it will never ever happen again.""DO NOT DO IT AGAIN! HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE?!""No I haven't and I swear it will never ever happen again"I need to add in that I offered repeatedly for her to take the price of the "free item" out of my paycheck as it was my mistake that I needed to pay for.She rolled her eyes and had an attitude the rest of the time she was there. I need to add this woman gives her friends free stuff all the time, and HEFTY discounts. I understand that it is her business and she can do what she wants but she never treated me the same after that. She nit picked everything, from the pitch of my voice on the phone, to my sales (which are good and still VERY good) and my personality which at this point the customers LOVE. Her daughter had bad cancer and I covered for her so she could be with family. I have covered a good amount of shifts for everyone there.We offer retail and sessions (can't specify or it might give it away). The machines for our sessions break down a lot and I have nearly figured out how to fix it each time or keep it running SAFELY until the new parts come in. I have fixed our computer, the internet, our tablet, pretty much if it goes down I try to fix it. I keep us on schedule most of the time and can handle a full lobby of customers by myself. For a while I was the only one working a shift by them self. I have kept rooms cleaned, session running on time, customers super happy and going to her to compliment my service. All other shifts had a closer to clean the facility but I had to do it by myself although one day a week its a lot of work on top of keeping the sessions going and not accumulating too much over time.She has made comments that are over the top. I've been having medical issues and my father had issues with his heart pump. We are "like a family" she would ask about whats going on with us and my stupid self answered truthfully. One day I get the comment from her "there's always something" I nearly snapped as its the same for her and her family, and up to this point, I had been sweet through her stress snaps and comments and trying my best to stay at my best. I had only missed one day and my coworkers repeatedly called out. I caught her attitude for the final time and started looking for other employment. It didn't bother me much until this current incident. I take responsibility for not checking the schedule for days she has NEVER scheduled me (and this is after she messed up the schedule royally enjoying her vacation while we run the store) I had a dyslexia test that cost a hefty amount and I couldn't miss it (I already rescheduled 3 or 4 appointments to accommodate her and other call outs) as she had stated not to bother her while she was away, I talked to a coworker and she agreed to cover (we both had the same shift for once). Recently I was diagnosed with bipolar and it was a mess and I was a mess but my mask at work was perfect. I get an email and it was sent to everyone else too, about notifying her of call outs as it can put us in a "bind". Apparently my coworker had called out and didn't tell me so she got special treatment and was told to stay home and get better. It hurt and it crashed my moods BADLY (again on me but her reaction, as per usual, over the top) Did I forget to mention I jammed my neck, still got to work and scheduled a chiropractic appointment for during my lunch break and came back to work as to not put anyone in a bind and she surely did not tell me to get better at home. She didn't even contact me just blasted an email. I text her and was met with attitude. I feel like an asshole but it doesn't matter what I do I CANNOT PLEASE THIS WOMAN.  AITA for now putting in my notice? Sorry for the wall of text, it also feels good to vent it for once.*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

thewhowithin69 [info] Burst my bubble?? Lmao. You really don't have a clue and should be cautious with your sterotyoing. I need kratom for pain (I don't care if a spinal tumor is a "legit" reason for needing pain control or not) because after too many years taking synthetic meds my body will not recognize them (genetic disorder) so you are assuming many things about me which is what frustrated me to begin with!! I know all about addiction and tolerance, first hand. And I know all about the damage that can occur thru injesting any product long term. I do not think that kratom isn't addicting but my point was it's not the plants that's the problem and I stand by that. If you struggle with addiction you can put anything in that spot (sex, food, etc) and still have this problem. Instead of focusing on this plant (or whatever your addicted to) it's internal personal work that needs to happen! So please don't think I'm just blindly prancing down the kratom to hell pathway because I know that isn't accurate. I am curious what you seem to think might be a good option for long term mood disorder?? And why do you have an opinion?? Because I was diagnosed with bipolar as a young person and have been treated with everything there is and so I actually come at this topic as a 50 yr old with some very strong opinions and experience!!

niknak90 [info] Strattera is available as a generic. Either that or I am taking a mysterious unknown substance. It’s called atomoxetine, which autocorrected to “stomp stone” at first. I can relate to the feeling of hating having to take meds to feel “normal”. I was diagnosed with bipolar after a dramatic manic episode, so I’ve been on meds for a while. I think the diabetes comparison is apt, as it’s also a chronic condition that needs meds. It might also help to think of meds as another tool you can use to live your best life along with non med tools like organization systems, calendars, eating well, exercising, etc.  [info] None [info] 1546649428

MeditationFabric [info] This really hit home with me, and I absolutely identify with the sensation that everybody else has moved on to a new phase.

I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, though I suspect (hope?) that those symptoms will also dissolve once this is over. Either way, you've raised a good point about waiting to see how a reduction in my stress will affect my perspective.

notafanofmath [info] I took Depakote for about four months, years ago, to treat chronic migraine. This was before I was diagnosed with bipolar, at the time Social Anxiety was my diagnosis, so I was also taking Paxil at the time (hopefully I’m remembering that correctly, it’s been a while.) Unfortunately for me, Depakote did almost nothing. I didn’t have any negative side effects but I also didn’t benefit from it either.  Hopefully it works better for you, and it’s possible that Paxil would have interfered with mine anyway. But I have known other people who got very positive results with it, so best of luck, I hope it helps you! [info] None [info] 1546724424
SilverSword7 [info] I appreciate the prayers and I do believe God loves me. I suppose however that I also think he gives us challenges in life. Part of me very much believes that this is simply a challenge for my life that he has put in my life. I used to believe that I would be happy if I just mastered myself, that if I just had total control over what I did with my life, if I was hard working to a certain point and if I arranged my life to where I was progressing in all the areas of my life, then I would feel peace. But then I was diagnosed with bipolar and then it was like I could almost hear God saying that my beliefs wouldn’t be realized and I wouldn’t be able to have that kind of peace and that it’s simply apart of the cross to bear through life.

havebeenfloated [info] Interesting. I should note that I was diagnosed with bipolar one when I turned 25, and that was drug-induced. I didn’t know until recently but X can be super dangerous in general, but especially for manic-depressives. Too bad, cos it’s awesome. Speed is my shit too—I was ironically prescribed Vyvanse and Klonopin for a while and that ruled, but I became a slave to it and started having memory problems. Meth was the next move. So that’s where I’m coming from. Bipolar’s not *terribly* common, but it couldn’t hurt to check out the criteria over or crosspost over at r/bipolar.

jeanadhoc [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was given Zoloft for an MDD diagnosis. I entered a manic episode almost immediately. This isn't an uncommon reaction to SSRIs, probably due to an already present imbalance of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, and since Zoloft increases serotonin (and in its specific case, dopamine as well), it's not at all uncommon for Zoloft to antagonize the underlying symptoms of bipolar disorder. I'm not sure how Zoloft reacts with atypical antipsychotics like Abilify, since I haven't taken it without the addition of a mood stabilizer. If you haven't been having any adverse reactions to sertraline (such as hallucinations or common manic symptoms), then it's probably alright. I will say that when I was in the hospital right after my first manic episode, the nurse told me that it's a common joke in the industry that if you want to find out if someone's bipolar, give them an SSRI.&amp;#x200B;I didn't have any real adverse reactions with alcohol and Zoloft, but I only really have two or so drinks when I do drink. However it should be noted that the use of alcohol with psychotropic medications is counteractive to the positive effects of medication. The way it was explained to me is that if you drink while you're taking antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, etc. then you might as well not take the meds, because the alcohol will negate any positive effects the meds will try to produce. I don't know how true that is or how well I've echoed that, but it's what I got out of it.  Mind that I'm not a medical professional. I've done my homework but everything I say really comes from personal experience and the knowledge I've gained from others. Take it with a grain of salt and trust your psychiatrist; he probably knows more about drug interactions with disorders than I do. [info] Bipolar 1 with Psychotic Features [info] 1546927104

fabioelfabuloso [info] I always knew that religion could cause some major mental disorders due to the oppression and dogma. However, it wasn't until recently that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depersonalization, and dissociation. I can have an entire day with a mental lapse of what transpired. I've emailed my therapist in panic and tears, only to not having remembered writing any of the words I used. These lapses are terrifying, and it's absolutely a way for your brain to protect itself, albeit awful. You're not alone, and it took me years to realize that these disorders could have very well been opened due to trauma of living as a regular pioneer in a strict household, to then losing faith and family. it's an incredible trauma. I highly recommend finding a good therapist, and discovering these truths for yourself. Discover why your brain does what it does, what causes it. Learning these truths has saved my life multiple times. Don't forget, each mental slip up is a learning opportunity towards mental success. [info] None [info] 1546981795

Bi_Everything [info] If you feel that you are relatively stable and weren't especially distressed by the experience, then maybe you needn't be very worried?

I just wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/afnzza/feels_like_a_separate_you/ee0n2t3/) about dissociation the other day. Feeling like you're outside of your body is just one of many forms of dissociation. Fantasizing is not dissociation. However, you can become so absorbed in the experience of fantasizing, that your attention to the outside world and your other mental processes fades into the background. That could be seen as a form of dissociation, but a rather normal one, not pathological in and of itself.  [info] Mixed+psychosis+dissociative [info] 1547504814
Papaverpalpitations [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at a very young age (13). Of course this wasn’t really the case but I noticed over the years up until this last year I knew that something was off about that diagnosis. Now, at 24, I got a correct diagnosis after a pattern of suicide attempts resulting from failed relationships (abandonment) and other stuff. I dropped out of college multiple times and the last several jobs I’ve had have lasted no more than 3-4 months.I recently moved to a new state and started up at school again after finding a major that was suited to what I’ve wanted to do since I was 10 years old and have been doing very well academically and made the deans list last semester. I also started DBT therapy a few weeks ago, so pretty new to that still but I am learning skills that I have always  severely lacked due to BPD. Life for us is a whirlwind, no doubt about that. We go through the lowest of lows and seemingly bounce back before hitting a low once more. But what I’ve noticed throughout all these years is that even if things aren’t exponentially better than they were before-things have still progressively kept getting better, even if just a little bit.It takes time and you’ll have ups and downs. The best thing I can recommend is finding a DBT therapist you mesh well with. Keep your head up, and tell yourself that this isn’t the end, and that things won’t always be like this.Of course, I know when we’re in the shit it’s very hard for us to see anything positive or any future for ourselves. But there *is*. Always look forward even if you’re blind in the moment.  [info] None [info] 1547518425

cmdr_felux [info] Sort of. They put me on a medication when I was diagnosed with bipolar that had a very convenient side effect of getting t-boned by a freight train shortly after digestion. I went from sleeping 3-4 hours to sleeping 9-10 hours. My body built a tolerance to it after being on it for 9 years and it stopped being effective as a mood stabilizer and sleep aid so it was back to square one. Traditional sleep meds haven't been effective since then so I've been sleep deprived these last 2 years as I tried all these other drugs. I'm waiting to get into a CBT-I program now to see if that'll help! I hear good things about it. [info] None [info] 1547561991
frenchiestfry96 [info] Yes! A ton! I personally have a lot of addiction in my family as well as mental illness. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I keep a strict regimen of what drugs I ingest (weed and alcohol only on rare occasions) just because I'm paranoid I'll turn into one of my family members. I say this only because I think a lot of the kids in med school live in a bubble. They've usually grown up in upper class families in safe neighborhoods. These kids don't know how surprisingly functional addicts can be. I know a ton of kids who have self-diagnosed themselves with mental disorders/illnesses so they can take the class II drugs. Even worse, some of these kids have doctors in the family who write them scripts whether or not they have an actual issue. They'll  often abuse stimulants or painkillers in the morning, only to go home and drink a ton in the evening. However, they would never tell you they may have a problem.

LunaDales [info] My high school friends got pregnant before we could graduate H.S and that took over their time so I went off to start my live with him on campus at a university. I made friends there but my husband at that time (boyfriend) wasn’t interested in school and I was too focused on making our school debts worth the time and get any degree at this point but he told me and everyone that school was not for him, had bigger dreams and dropped out and I followed him because that’s what love do and I felt safe with him. I was born in USA but sent to a foreign country as a child. Moving from house to house because no one really wanted to take care of me and my sister (I never knew what was love or someone who cared for me until I came back to the states and met him) He cared. He taught me English. So I became attached to him. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I tried taking my life away as a teenager. I’m going through so much in my mind and Body as of right now that I don’t see myself being a good friend to someone for the last 10 years. I found myself cancelling on friendly dates due to my maniac episodes that I’ve decided to not have friends altogether. I don’t love myself. That’s why I know our relationship is not healthy to my soul anymore. And if I don’t feel safe with him than what’s the point of staying. I sometimes feel as if he rather wish I was dead.

showtunie [info] Hey!So my opinion might be kaput, but I did want to say something!So I used to be on some SSRIs about a year ago before I was diagnosed, but still exhibiting signs of OCD. I’d say they helped me some in the sense that I wasn’t... Fixating so much? But I was still doing some compulsions. So, intrusive thought wise, things were pretty great. Here’s where I kind of suck on giving my opinion on SSRIs. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so antidepressants and the like actually make my mania worse to the point where I was ready to jump off a bridge. After figuring that shit out I had to be taken off of them, which sucked because the intrusive thoughts began to creep back into it and I went through a real tough time for a year.But CBD oil! Boy howdy! That shit helps SO much. I’m generally an anxious person, but my mom sells CBD oil and gave me a 1000mg bottle. I take it in the mornings and at nights, and when I take my CBD oil, it’s so much easier to deal with my obsessions. I feel like I’m able to take a step back and say, “okay, this is just a thought. What’s next?” CBD oil has made my life improve so much and I super recommend it.Not to say SSRIs didn’t help! And if I can find the right one, I’d be down for it again because it was a lot easier than combating. But even if I did, I’d still take the CBD oil. It’s that good.TL;DR: SSRIs helped me with thoughts, but not so much with compulsions. CBD oil lets me take look at my OCD from a rational standpoint.Hope that kinda helped!

boberito [info] Yes, it's hard to diagnose someone so young when it comes to mood disorders, and some doctors don't do it. However, it's completely plausible for him to be showing signs of it as an adolescent. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at the age of 20, but there was a history of "behavior issues" beginning around the age of 6 for me (though nothing like this post describes). How a mental illness presents can absolutely change over time, especially during puberty!! I think you should follow the advice of other Redditors here and set up a psych evaluation (even if it's inpatient). Tell the doctors everything, especially family history of mood disorders such as bipolar and substance abuse issues. They might not give a formal diagnosis due to age, but it will help them when determining treatment options going forward. Best of luck. You guys are great parents.  [info] None [info] 1547770427

I didn’t mean to come off that way at all, I just want to make an effort that could be aided from as similar circumstances as possible. [info] None [info] 1547844442

Illamasutra [info] Thank you for this. I was diagnosed with bipolar II when I was 25, (28 now), and that gave me the realization that I never wanted kids because so many things would irritate me at the drop of a hat, and I can’t help how I feel sometimes even if I try to control showing it outwardly. There is no way I would put a child through that. People don’t understand and assume when I have my own kids it’ll be different.  [info] None [info] 1547918013
pizzazza [info] What are your favorite hiphop songs that deal with mental health that aren't corny? I was diagnosed with bipolar last year but I'm going to the psychiatrist on monday to discuss symptoms of schizoaffective disorder and I'm nervous as fuck because I don't normally bring that up with him even though I should, I've just written off my symptoms as normal shit everyone encounters in their mind but after doing more research this is not normal. Seeing shadows and figures in my peripheral, full on hallucinating people that move but aren't really there (like in my room at night), hearing things that aren't there, voices in my head telling me to relapse on hard drugs, smelling things that aren't there, mad paranoia and disconnection from reality for extended periods of time, etc. are some of the things I've been dealing with for as long as I can remember and I always just thought that's how our brains work. I'm struggling with this a lot right now and music has always been the way I calm my nerves, so hearing something that touches on the importance of being open about mental health would be really nice right now. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  [info]  [info] 1547937991
rmillhausen [info]    Ayahuasca is a great healing compound, both spiritually and physically. In the traditional setting people tend to do more spiritual healing of traumas and such. The go with many issues to work out and in the communal setting with shaman being metaphysical psychotherapists, they tend to work out a lot of deep rooted mental issues thus transforming the mind and healing the spirit.        What many people do not realize is the fact that ayahuasca ( and even dmt alone ) have medically significant healing properties.  Many tannins, plant fats and other chemicals help purging not to mention the mane cause being the bets-carbolines harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharmaline (RIMA's) really clean out your body. They flush your digestive tract, blood, kidneys, liver, sweat glands and basically your entire endocrine system. Many people journey south to be healed of cancers as well.    Both beta caroline's and dmt heave been identified as marked cancer fighters due to being sigma one receptor ligands and could increase calcium uptake in mitochondria in normally unaffected and massively reproducing cancer cells causing an increased rate of cancer cell apoptosis and thereby shrinking tumors and fighting many forms of cancer.     They may also be used as carrier or delivery agents for future cancer fighting drugs. Being that both dmt and beta carbolines are both cancer fighters, they work better synergistically in ayahuasca. There are many applications that are just now starting to be explored in modern medicine. As far as how a shaman can trip on aya at the same time as you and give you a diagnosis to treat you with other plant medicines for physical healing still blows my mind.    As far as pharmahuasca goes,  I have some Syrian rue extract (harmine hcl) and some dmt/nmt and might give it a try and will let you know any differences I can dicern. And stay away from prescription maoi's to allow absorption of dmt, they can stay in your system for 6-8 weeks and really fuck you up. It's easier to follow a proper diet for only 24 hours. Although beta carbolines typically only inhibit the mao-a enzyme produced by the liver which cancels out dmt but doesn't inhibit mao-b enzyme which stops absorption of tyramine which moderates  blood pressure which could send you into hypertensive crisis so diet isn't technically as important when dealing with harmalas but it's still a good idea to follow it for a day.  And you definitely want to watch your drug interactions both leading up to and the day after your usage.   As far as going in alone, I prefer it as well.  I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder 23 years ago and have been on and off many medications since. Used to trip a lot on cid, shrooms and x when I was young, but fell away for several years for family, career, etc. Then I decided to grow some caps and they blew away anything I'd ever done before.  Quarter ounces + working up to 21 grams all producing mind altering breakthroughs. What I didn't realize was that I was transforming my mind through mindfulness meditation, group therapy weekly and monthly spiritual, hallucinogenic, serotonin reprogramming breakthrough. I then finally weaned myself off my last medication (I had developed liver problems and put on mass amounts of weight due to  them) and began working with ayahuasca. Since then, I've lost 72 pounds, my liver panel has returned to normal and is shrinking ( it was enlarged) and my digestion has returned to normal as well as my metabolism.  I have never felt so healthy and clear headed since I've been awoken and returned to a more earthly and natural way of living. I naturally grow all my own vegetables and fruits, tend my garden and yard daily ( which is very spiritual and meditative ). I go to therapy once a week ( mainly to help others and let them know that healing is possible ) and meditate often. I smoke my herb daily and monthly I have intense aya, dmt, or psilocybin (and sometimes psilohuasca) sessions. With all of this, I've restructured my entire being and am reaching both model health and spiritual bliss through the healing powers of plant medicine ( I also study and make/use and work with many plant medicines and extracts).   In the end I definitely believe ther are good healing and spiritual aspects to both traditional ceremonies and going it alone, but I believe it should be up to the individual because everyone is different. Many people can't handle these substances on their own and therefore need a shaman (or in the case of psilocybin it may soon be a shrink here in America). And you should always be careful when dealing with maoi's due to drug and possible food interactions   [info] None [info] 1548029460
velasha [info] This is SUCH a good idea! I was diagnosed with bipolar along with BPD and PTSD, and lightly track mine. I may look into doing something more like this to show my therapist. My psychiatrist just throws meds at me every three weeks because he doesn't listen to me (and can't remember the diag he gave me .______. ), so I feel like this would be a good way to track exactly what he's doing that's either helping or not (which is mostly not given my current state).

Drugs_are_awesome [info] Ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 ive been convinced sex hormones play a sizable role. Estradiol, testosterone, dht, shbg all of them have effects in the brain. High levels of DHT are known to increase glutamate which is what most BP drugs try to inhibit (ie lamictal). And estradiol is known to be neuroprotective which is why fewer women get degenerative brain diseases. Unfortunately no doctors test hormones in bipolar but I can say that going on TRT and having my hormones balanced has eliminated a lot of the symptoms. Are sex hormones the end all be all of bipolar? No. But I believe having them balanced can help a lot.  [info] None [info] 1548425631

oldcarfreddy [info] Oh come on that's fucking bullshit. None of that has anything to do with Kanye. His wife deserves credit. Kanye doesn't. I get y'all love to mythologize shit about rap but this is verifiable politics and law, let's stop with the made-up stories and mythmaking. Even the article you posted doesn't support that at all. You're believing a meme /r/kanye made up, lol.Kanye mentioned prison reform ONCE in his rambling interview, here it is because it was an official white house meeting so the transcript is available:&gt;You know, they tried to scare me to not wear this hat — my own friends.  But this hat, it gives me — it gives me power, in a way.  You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn’t have a lot of male energy in my home.  And also, I’m married to a family that — (laughs) — you know, not a lot of male energy going on.  It’s beautiful, though.  But there’s times where, you know, there’s something about — you know, I love Hillary.  I love everyone, right?  But the campaign “I’m with her” just didn’t make me feel, as a guy, that didn’t get to see my dad all the time — like a guy that could play catch with his son.  It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman.  You made a Superman.  That was my — that’s my favorite superhero.  And you made a Superman cape.&gt; For me, also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys — non-political, no bullshit — put the beep on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay — and just goes in and gets it done.&gt; Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas.  Because at Adidas, when I went in, in 2015, we were a $14-billion company losing $2 billion a year.  Now we have a $38-billion market cap.  It’s called the “Yeezy effect.”&gt; And I went to Casper.  We had a meeting in Chicago.  And I said, “You have to bring manufacturing onshore.”  And not even shore; into the core.  It’s not about the border; it’s the core of Adidas.  And Chicago is the core of Middle America.  And we have to make Middle America strong.&gt;So I had the balls — because I have enough balls to put on this hat.  I mean, this Adidas thing made be a billionaire.  And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal.  But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than to have no fathers in Chicago with no homes.  And when we do have prison reformation, for no — because it’s habilitation, not rehabilitation, because they didn’t have the abilities in the first place.  We never had anyone that taught us.  They didn’t teach us.  Exactly — we had no one that “taught” us.  Right?&gt; So it’s more important than any specific deal — anything — that we bring jobs into America, and that we provide a transition with mental health and the Amer-I-Can education curriculum that Jim has worked on.  Larry Hoover also has a curriculum that he’s worked on.  We have Montessori curriculums that we worked on.  WeWork has a beautiful curriculum.  The Waldorf establishment has a curriculum.  We have meditation.  There’s a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment.&gt; I did say “abolish” with the hat on.  Because why would you keep something around that’s a trap door?  If you’re building a floor — the Constitution is the base of our industry, right?  Of our country, of our company.  Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you — accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber?  You end up — you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship.&gt; The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment — and I think the way the universe works, it’s perfect.  We don’t have 13 floors, do we?  You know, so the four — the four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn’t look like the people they were amending.  Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read — or African Americans to read.  And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave.&gt; Again — so what I think is, we don’t need sentences; we need pardons.  We need to talk to people.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL.  And he looked at my brain — it’s equal on three parts.  I’m going to go ahead drop some bombs for you — 98 percentile IQ test.  I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards, (inaudible), so I’m going to work on that one.  The other ones, 98 percent — Tesla, Freud.&gt; So he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name.  So all this power that I got, and I’m taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn’t be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage.The next time Trump actually says something is after several more minutes of more bullshit, right before Kanye brings up the iPlane. lol.If you want to credit Trump's support of the reform bill to Kanye because of... that, and not meeting with advisors and actual lobbyists with something to say and his son-in-law... then you're the slow kid in your class.

jillerski [info] Recognize that speaking in absolutes always places you into an antagonized perception of yourself. Don't feel that you're dumb for doing so because I still struggle with that tendency myself. I would advise you to take a moment and acknowledge your feelings and break them down to their root causes. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder several years ago and there's times where I simply have to acknowledge that the root of my depressive episodes were simply biological. But I also recognized that I do have control of how I react to it. Instead of writing off my life as a permanent and hopeless end, I acknowledged that yes I am experiencing a bad cycle (term used for long depressive episodes) and I also acknowledged that this cycle was temporary and that really was key in helping me cope. When you're in the desert dehydrated, a simple drop of water feels better than nothing. Keep at it and don't speak in absolutes. Always address your feelings in the present tense but never as your absolute outcome.  [info] None [info] 1548721029

antennas_to_heaven [info] Hi friend! I used ket both recreationally and medically (spiritually?) when I was diagnosed with bipolar and overcoming an emotionally abusive relationship (it also later helped me come to realizations regarding gender identity).It’s impossible for me to prescribe a purely medical route seeing as I love ket as a drug but I guess I would say the nights I spent listening to ambient in bed after shooting 80mg IM were some of the most constructive.In general I think ket helps you sort through thoughts and feelings without being attached to them in the moment. At a show, I snorted 300mg (I have a moderately stupid tolerance, don’t do that) and fell into a deep hole in the corner thinking about my ex and just letting the thought “I don’t feel bad for her and I don’t need to” sit in my head. I picture the brain like a knotted ball of yarn; ketamine expands the spaces and pauses time so you can slowly un-knot that ball. If I had any specific recommendation it would be to meditate on things that have hurt you or made you feel worthless while decenty ketty but not in the hole.Also in order to IM you *have* to get it out of a sterile vial. Some people use micron filters but at that point I’d rather IV. Don’t want any bullshit stuck in your muscle tissue. Side note, if you want to avoid needles plugging 150-250mg in your ass feels VERY similar, it just wastes a lot of k but it lasts several hours.Source: am no longer suicidal :) [info] None [info] 1548782582
esoper1976 [info] I have been on all sorts of meds, some not at all helpful and some a little helpful. The mix I am on now are super helpful and have kept me stable the longest. I have been on these for nine years. I take Clozapine, Nardil (or Parnate, they are both MAOIs and I switch back and forth every few years when the one I am on stops working), Naltrexone, and Zonisamide. I think these are the only psych meds I am on. I take several other meds also.  In addition to BPD I am diagnosed with bipolar nos and fictitious disorder. Just because these work for me doesn't mean they will work for you, but the MAOIs have been way more helpful than any SSRI, and the Clozapine is much better than any other antipsychotic I have been on. Both of those meds come with complications, so doctors don't like to prescribe them. ECTs are often used before MAOIs because you have to follow a special diet or risk stroke or death. With Clozapine you need to have regular blood tests. Every week for the first six months, every two weeks for the next six months and then monthly as long as you are on the medication.

300FeetPerSecond [info] In 2008 after months of self-medicating with a constant mixture of uppers &amp; lowers but mostly LSD, MDMA, &amp; Cocaine I had a mental break with reality and was picked up by the police after breaking into and assulting the tenant of a house I believed I had been living in for 1000 years.[Papers for proof](https://imgur.com/HTavyrj)I was charged with assault on a police officer and that was dropped via plea deal to plain assualt in 3rd. The tenant brandished a 1:1 airsoft pistol at me and I was off the property at the time (they arrived after I had already broken in) so it was considered self-defense.Through the process of that I was diagnosed with bipolar. Myself and my family believed it to be a false diagnosis and felt my break with reality was more due to stress, lack of sleep, &amp; drug use.Went years continuing to self-medicate with marijuana. Was able to keep a steady job and worked my way from toy store retail clerk to operations manager of an online paintball store and youtube channel. Helped it move out of the owners basement into a retail location.Springboarded that into a full-time lead graphic design job at a motorcycle dealership management company.After a year or so of that in comes the diagnosis of Bipolar 2 and me [Waking up Bipolar](https://trevorsnotepad.com/2017/04/20/waking-up-bi-polar-2/)I now take 300mg of Oxcarbazepine daily and am still with the company that hired me 6 years ago.

I am still the lead graphic designer, and I still enjoy what I do with them.My marriage is healthy and only growing healthier as time goes on.Not every day is easy -- in fact, few are "easy".

___tnbee [info] I have a BA in psychology and I’m working on my MA in clinical psychology right now. I was diagnosed with bipolar II in my sophomore year of undergrad. College is possible with bipolar, but you have to be able to manage your disorder. For me, that means I take my meds, I see my therapist, and I make sure I set aside time just for me to practice self-care. Management looks different for everybody, and I’d encourage you to find your “routine” if you haven’t already. Also, some things will be more difficult than for a student without bipolar - for example, explaining to your roommate why you need to bleach the shower at 3 AM every day for a week. But again, if you can manage your symptoms, those situations can be pretty well avoided, at least in my experience. [info] None [info] 1549175293

heathermlavoie [info] Don't lose hope. I was diagnosed with bipolar and brought up BPD with my psychiatrist, he said while I may have some symptoms of BPD, he didn't think I had it. So he's continuing to treat the bipolar with different medications (none have really worked so far) while I try to practice mindfulness and all that DBT kind of stuff on my own. I really recommend reading books on BPD and reading other people's experiences. It helps me feel less alone. In terms of relationships, they're going to be hard and painful, and trust will never come easy. I'm very sorry you're going through a breakup, letting go is always very hard for me.

trashytreebaby [info] Firstly there was the presence of both depressive episodes with manic episodes.Then when I started seeing a psychiatrist it came up that I have many of the other traits - risk taking behaviours, agitation, impulsiveness, reckless behaviour (ie: reckless spending) restlessness, self harm, delusional thoughts, problems with concentration, frenzied thoughts, all of which were far worse when I'm manic. I also experiance psychosis when manic so I was diagnosed with bipolar 1.There's a lot of good resources online, but at the end of the day seeing a doctor is your best bet. That way you can get on medication and get therapy, and trust me if you have bipolar disorder getting treatment will turn your life around. Finding a good psychiatrist and psychologist is essential. Finding meds that work can be a struggle but when you find the right ones you'll be shocked at how much better you feel. I didn't get diagnosed til I was 20 and I feel like when I got on medication I actually got to start living my life properly without my life being ruled by mental illness. I do have other issues that I'm working on but I feel so much more stable and like dealing with those other issues is possible.Treatment for mental illness is never easy but 110% worth it in the long run.

The lethal dose and the effective dose are close enough that they had to run blood tests pretty often to make sure I was taking the right amount. The lithium itself made me feel like absolute shit, and drained me of all energy. Everyone else seemed to think that was a good thing.Not the same, obviously, but excluding the surgeries to remove necrotic tissue, I see the outline of a familiar experience that not many others understand. Thank you. [info] None [info] 1549376818
annikek [info] I remember being 500% ready to kill myself over something completely minor and trivial, I just didn’t have the energy to deal with. I think I burnt some food or something. I stopped ruminising suicidal thoughts at one point just to think “wait, this isn’t normal”. I told my SO, and I went to my doctor the next day. He diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, and later I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2.  [info] None [info] 1549440532
bathroomspaceman [info] Tracy reminds me so much of myself it's crazy. I was diagnosed with bipolar II three years ago and before I learned how to handle it better, I was always doing shit like this. Cutting off friends for no reason other than the fact that it felt appropriate. Deleting social media accounts, recreating them, deleting them again. I even had my number changed so nobody could contact me. I frequently dropped hobbies and picked them back up weeks or months later. Not to mention using substances to cope and having very real suicidal thoughts. All I can say is that I feel for Tracy. People who are downplaying this like "ThIs iS jUsT hOw He iS" really don't realize what they're doing by disregarding his clear mental illness. I hope he gets help soon. Bipolar really fucking sucks, and in my experience, making posts like this really is a cry for help.  [info] None [info] 1549500636

Papaverpalpitations [info] I would tell your therapist that you’re having some issues and would like clarity as to what may be causing those issues for you so that you can have a better understanding of yourself and that having that understanding about yourself and your symptoms will better allow you to address those symptoms. Not sure if you’ve had any previous diagnosis, but I know with me, I was diagnosed with bipolar at a young age (14). I learned I was misdiagnosed and actually had BPD only this last summer (ten years after my misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder).I told my therapist that my mood swings only last up to a couple of hours and are very intense, and are usually caused by interpersonal issues surrounding relationships. I told her that the only times I’m ever suicidal is when I feel as though I’ve been abandoned (such as dealing with a breakup). I also told her that I become attached very quickly and will do anything possible to avoid abandonment. I told her that my impulsivity (such as reckless spending and other behaviors) is a constant problem-whereas with bipolar, impulsivity is typically only associated with manic episodes, which last for weeks to months, not hours or days. Basically, explain to them your symptoms and say you want to have a better understanding of yourself so that you know how to address these symptoms, and ask what they believe you’re dealing with.Getting a correct diagnosis of BPD was (surprisingly) a great thing to happen to me, because I then knew what treatment I needed and could learn how to address these behaviors. I’ve improved more than I have over the last few months of DBT therapy than I did in the previous ten years (when I was incorrectly diagnosed with bipolar). Best of luck, hopefully you can get things figured out and finally have some confirmation and find a way to address the problems you’re having. 🙂 [info] None [info] 1549676503
405sucks [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2012 and I’ve been through many unstable relationships that included self harm, abuse, suicide attempts, manic spending / infidelity, the list of shitty things I’ve done to my partners because of my bipolar goes on.  Only after going on Lamictal in late 2016 did my relationships begin to show improvements/stability.  However, I did date a girl with BPD (borderline personality disorder) and I gotta tell you that BPD puts bipolar in its rear-view mirror.  If you think this sub is depressing, head on to /r/bpdlovedones and check it out.  At least as a bipolar patient, you’re still manageable under medication. You can (to some extent) recognize your symptoms or episodes by monitoring your sleep or your spending habits, sex drive, etc.Bipolar disorder is a manageable mental disability compared to what’s out there, so don’t give yourself a hard time. That being said, it’s still a disorder which brings instability. My advice is to respect the boundaries your SO sets for you. Take your meds, sleep well and you’ll be better than 90% of bipolar patients out there.  [info] None [info] 1549772113

InevitableBother [info] All the love for fellow Spoonies! ❤ I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 13 after my parents got a divorce, I was thinking about suicide a lot. I went into therapy and the therapist was terrible but he was the only therapist within 2 hours of where we live. He always wanted to discuss my looks and my sexual relationships.. At the time I didn't have any relationships... Anyway, here I am 11 years later, my new therapist doesn't believe I have bipolar but something else. My sister recently found Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria and it literally is everything i've experienced.  I go back to my therapist tomorrow so I am going to bring it up to her since it is literally every symptom I have told her. I feel like this is the beginning of finally fixing my true issues and I am a bit excited. I have been doing better on my current meds but still have outbursts sometimes. Lot of childhood abuse and such, I just always feel like a bother to everyone and that everyone thinks the worst of me or that they think i'm stupid..It's rough sometimes..[I have a few different lists](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/21TGNQJKIS0W9?&amp;sort=default) [info] https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3RHOUCHNCVXCM [info] 1549908308

wyldyflower [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 20. I have mostly depressive swings that last a long time. I also have hypomania swings which isn’t as severe as mania. I’ve been told it’s most likely genetic, my grandpa had it and was treated for it and probably came from his mother. I’ve seen a few different psychiatrists about it and have a pretty good understanding of how my swings go. I have a lot of other side effects that go along with it too. Anxiety insomnia are just a few to mention. Mental health isn’t a joke or something to fake or lie about. I wish it could have gone more into depth in the episode but the episode was about my weight not my brain.  [info] None [info] 1549944842

Just_A_Faze [info] At first, there is regret, especially if you are one of the many people who is somewhat addicted to food and uses it as a coping and comfort mechanism. But if you deal with that, it goes away and you will be thrilled with your choice. The first month or so was hard for me for that reason. I did have an addiction to food and used it to deal with emotions. I hid eating and ate constantly. The first month or so I was depressed and couldn’t eat my way way out of it, and I regretted my choice and felt like I had made a terrible mistake, I started therapy, I took up hobbies, and started talking more openly about  feelings and looking after myself, and I started losing weight. Today I am 7 months out (7 months on Sunday) and I know for a fact that it is the best thing I have ever done for myself. I have lost 112 lbs with 37 to go to my goal weight. I went from super morbidly obese  to overweight and approaching a normal BMI. I feel amazing, everything is easier, I’m much more confident, I’m wearing a medium in most brands, I feel so much better physically and emotionally since I stopped using food as a crutch. It spurred me to deal with other issues I had, and I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 which had been the case the whole time, untreated. I started medication for that  4 months ago, and things are so much better for me in every aspect of my life. I’m not diabetic anymore, my resting heart rate has dropped to 64, I can handle issues when the come up calmly most of the time, I’m better at my job and in my relationship, and I’m balancing grad school, work, and my relationship without feeling like death all the time. When it gets hard, remember why you did it, and that you sometimes have to do hard things to get better. It might also help to know that I attend a support group and none of the people I have met there regret doing this. They all say it’s the best decision they ever made.  [info] None [info] 1550008987

Once_Dead [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given a slew of medications after coming out as trans. Guess what the meds didn’t work, they made me numb or suicidal. Also got hooked on lithium for a bit. It made me manicish. I was pretty happy most of the time on it and not much phased me. I went toxic due to the psychiatrist having to continually up my dosage. At 18 I ripped myself off the medication and suffered massive withdrawal symptoms which my mother said were the symptoms of bipolar. Turns out I leveled out for the most part after a couple months of nightmarish withdrawals. (For those who don’t know you are supposed to wean yourself off of that medication, quitting it cold turkey is actually dangerous and can cause seizures, i just didn’t care and wanted my emotions back.) the transness had just gone dormant while I became a shell of a person.

lulukodiak [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar, but I feel like I relate to borderline a lot more. Borderline mood shifts usually happen quicker/more frequent so within a day you go from manic to depressed rather than a few days of each.

xoxo--gossipgirl [info] Every person is different. I got diagnosed over a year ago and the first thing my doctor said was “I’ll have you feeling so much better in 8 weeks.” I would say it took 3-4 months for me to be like wow okay I’ve come a long way but it was slowly getting better. Don’t get me wrong though, I have my bad days and still have struggles. It’s just not as severe and happens less. As for you being able to function, it depends on you. I’d say if you are normally functioning now, it will get better. I am functioning better than ever if that gives you hope. I’m a nurse and live on my own. It will get better. I felt really upset when I was diagnosed with bipolar, so it’s normal if you do. But just remember now that you have an accurate diagnosis, you can get the right treatment and help to feel better!

g_netic [info] I'm late to the party, but..My mother had me diagnosed with ADD when I was 3 and I was put on ritalin from then on. Then in grade 7 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and began taking all kinds of drugs. I always felt very sad and suicidal, on auto pilot all the time. In grade 10, I figured if I had never, ever felt good on pills then maybe they were the problem. Long story short, my mother agreed to let me go off all of my meds except for ritalin. It was like an enormous cloud drifted away from above me. I never felt intense feelings like that ever again. I eventually went off of my ritalin as well and ended up excelling in college and now university.

She turned out to be a horrible therapist and after a particularly nasty session where she yelled at me for nearly ten minutes, I chose to no longer be her patient. The medication she had prescribed was not one that I was supposed to go off cold turkey - Lamictal. I saw a psychologist who booked me in with the psychiatrist on staff because he did not feel I had bipolar disorder but it would be a few days until I could get that appointment. I had to contact my GP to get medication to taper down in the meantime.My evaluation with the psychologist confirmed that I do not have bipolar disorder. Fortunately I was only on the medication for a few months and no serious damage was done but both the psychologist and psychiatrist said they would report the PNP because of her behavior both towards me and towards them.

ridethewavy [info] I saw this post and had to watch it immediately. It is totally me. I was diagnosed and treated for  ADHD from the age of 9 to 20ish.  After I had my first manic episode I was diagnosed with bipolar. It’s definitely something you should discuss with a psychiatrist. I would suggest making an appointment soon.

Silly_Sloth_Owl [info] Oh god. This is so real for me.Especially since I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I worry it may mean I am about to have an episode or something. Even when I am stable, though, I am still worried that something is wrong.Not having a reason to be worried seems to worry me.

BearGryllsUrine [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2018. I was asked to spend 1 month in a mental hospital for mental rehabilitation after a serious manic episode. In the hospital a met a lot of interesting people but the one who I really found interesting was James. He was a chemistry major at Georgia State University and loved to party and make money. So what did he do? He utilized his talent for chemistry and the underground club market to manufacture and sell LSD. He thought it would be a good idea to micro-dose after seeing studies online about the potential affects it could have improving brain function exactly like this study. What he didn’t know was that it was going to impact his life forever. He told me everything was fine for the first 3-4 months of daily use. He had more energy and felt more creative. But after 6 months, things went wrong. He would wake up with seizures and sleep paralysis. That’s when they sent him to the hospital. When I met him he was coming down off the drug and was having muscle spasms, trouble focusing, and had a serious gap in social ability. (It seemed like he was always drifting off thinking about whatever was in his head). He told me he wished he never had done it, he felt like he fried his brain. I’m sure you can find plenty of secondary source articles about the positive effects and it may be an option for the right person but I will never touch any hallucinogen. Yes this is an anecdote and reddit likes statistics but what I’m telling you is that I’ve witnessed the affects of micro-dosing first hand and what I saw aligns with the facts of these drugs, they alter your brains chemistry, plain and simple. Anything that unnatural is going to have its side affects.   [info] None [info] 1552061853

knullemora666 [info] My advice to you: Get off all social media for at least 6 months minimum.I deleted Facebook 5 months ago and couldn't be happier. There are subliminal messages in all of social media. I have kept my Reddit and Instagram, but that is it. Way back in 2004 I was diagnosed with bipolar, back when the trend literally boomed. Take it with a grain of salt. I am not bipolar, I feel like they do this to just about everyone.You are young, hormonal, and won't stop changing until your old and grey.Don't let that diagnosis define you. Let you define you. Eat a balance diet, it will help balance the chemicals in your body. Start meditating for 20-30 mins in the morning. It might not make sense or 'work' at first, but give yourself time and you will find the go to zone to help you clear your mind. Use guided meditation on YouTube if needed. Do a sport or exercise that you enjoy. This will release endorphins and give your body a habit of providing endorphins to you on a regular basis. Give yourself time to heal. All that attention seeking you did in high school, not saying your experience wasn't real just you did it to get your family to notice you, affected how you look and are looked at in the world. Raise your vibration, if something makes you unhappy, angry, depressed then chances are it isn't good for you. Think positively, I know it isn't easy, but I promise you can do it. For example, I don't have a car right now, it broke down in Aug and I had to sell it. I have 5 kids, 3 being toddlers. Things might seem bleak, but that is far from the truth. We walk all the time, which has made us happy with the exercise and fresh air. We are more united as a family. We have discovered many things around our neighborhood. The best part is that I know this isn't forever. This is just a phase we had to go through.We always go through phases, changes, cycle and that is ok. It is so that we can grow. We are only human and don't have all the answers. The more you go through, the more you learn. Work on you, focus on you, give yourself time to be who you are destined to be, love yourself, and know that no matter what you will get through this. Also, hair grows back. I shaved my head bald last Sept because I was going through so much I let it get to me. I won't do it again, but now I have beautiful virgin hair. It is super soft and vibrant. I've died my hair since 1998 and don't remember my hair feeling so good.If there is a craft or hobby you like, do it. That way you always have joy close by. I wish you the best.

cakecrisis [info] It could be that you are going through an episode currently or that you’re entering one. I’ve been there and it’s extremely scary. I was hostile and even attacked my own mother after she locked herself in her bathroom and I broke down the door. I was hallucinating and having delusions and having memory problems, and time lapses. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder and put on medication and my life is much better now. The thing you must remember is that you are still you, and you’re not alone. I’m not a doctor and I can’t give you medical advice but only advice from my personal experience. It’s a really terrifying thing and mental illness is really tricky. The most important thing is that you are safe, and your parents hopefully should see that. If you’re feeling like you can’t trust yourself or don’t feel safe around yourself or are slipping away from reality please please please, get help. I understand that money is a huge deal and a big issue for you and many people but you come first. It got so bad for me that I thought it the episode would last forever and if it did I’d have to kill myself. I’m so glad I reached out and got help. Remember, you come first, money has to come after. You are the priority and getting your mental health back in order is what’s most important.  [info] None [info] 1552246676
LostInOtherWorlds [info] Omg you are not fat. Look, my husband married me 7 years ago and I am 5' 8" and weighed 185 at the time. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had to come on and off meds for the next five years, most of which caused weight gain no matter how hard i fought it. Today I am way heavier than that, but my husband thinks I'm gorgeous and loves me just the same. If a man is that shallow (and my dad is too. So I get it) leave his ass. You deserve better. You deserve someone to love you for you and if you want to lose weight, then lose it for healthy reasons. But don't get down about it. And don't project onto your boyfriend what your dad said. Because they are not the same person. [info] None [info] 1552250937
YOUREABOT [info] The line between logic/delusion gets really blurry during manic episodes, especially with the internet. Who's to say what's possible. Done different he might have actually been able to get Drake, or some other big name, to come out.  I just started to come down from about a two weeks of mania. I ended up doing a couple of mania fueled things (like deciding to raise money to fly from Taipei, Taiwan to Milwaukee to see a Wu-Tang concert…  haha ) I've been documenting the whole thing (in a long form sloppy way).  What I know, that other people don't, is that these "manic projects" often times have paydays at the end up them. Like, for example, in 2008/9 (while at the peak of my YouTube career) I won a laptop from Tim Ferriss and  a car with free gas and insurance from Ford (when the launched the Ford Fiesta). If anyone saw what I was doing and thinking to myself behind the scenes I was clearly manic in both cases (I was diagnosed with bipolar in 1999). I was actually off my meds too.  Anyhow… it's complex. The "delusions" can have very real positive effects. For example the delusion from my first manic episode set me on a path to becoming a serious martial artist.  Anyhow… there's a bit about me. :) Thanks for making this video. I subscribed and hit the bell button (the first time I've done that. :) ) [info] None [info] 1552291793
onegira [info] I can *definitely* answer this one!First the dreams: yeah. I had a lot of dreams like this. Mostly, where I was reluctantly trying to do things like women would do, and worrying about what people would think. The most obvious one was right after coming out to some close friends, where I looked in a mirror and saw a woman's face looking back. Gee, I wonder if there's any significance to that one?At about thirty, I felt like I was fumbling around in the dark, trying to find an exit. I didn't really know where I was going, but sensed that there had to be an exit somewhere. I stopped cutting my hair, getting a sense that later I'd be glad I did. I moved to a major city, and got a job with a tech startup.In the city I moved to, I joined a trans support group, but kept that group entirely separate from my other friends and family. It allowed me to develop my anima, but not to integrate it. My anima was impulsive, selfish, bratty, and vain at first, but improved over time into a reasonably effective way of channeling emotions that had been shut out of my animus. But because the two were not integrated, I was not whole.I was alternately exhibiting characteristics of anima and animus possession, as strange as that might sound. Most of my time was spent moody and passive, while other times, I would start arguments way too easily and then be *very* aggressive, trying to win them. It got pretty bad, and I was diagnosed with bipolar II.I came up with two terms for what seemed to be going on in my mind. Both are kind of self-explanatory. The first is "mental constipation". It just felt like my mind was at an impasse, blocked with all sorts of shit, and try as I might, I couldn't clear it.The other is "mental self-flagellation". Like, every time I'd do something that was really embarrassing, that thing would go on the pile of other things I was embarrassed about. Every so often, they'd play on a loop in my mind, and I'd feel like I needed to mentally punish myself.  I'd force myself to imagine these episodes, to get them to go away, but they wouldn't really diminish over time. If I did something MUCH more embarrassing than anything I'd ever done before, then that thing would take the top place, and the other things would be scaled accordingly. But the mental pain from whatever was the most embarrassing would always be identical, no matter what it was.These two personalities were deliberately kept separate, because I'd concluded a long time ago that I could never come out about it. I'm not sure how I continued to feel that way for such a long time, but I did.What finally triggered their integration, was coming out to a friend from grad school. I wrote a text to him on my phone, telling myself I wouldn't send it. Then I hit "send" before I could stop myself, and hid under my covers. But he was really accepting, and I started to realize that perhaps I *could* transition after all. This triggered a tectonic shift in my mind, which to be honest, scared the shit out of me. If you've ever played video games, imagine a level, where you've been scouring the whole level over and over, trying to figure out how to advance to the next one. You've tried pressing all the buttons you can find, but they don't do anything. Then you remember there's this one button, that you've been avoiding looking at. You've locked it up really well, and there's cobwebs on it. You feel like there's absolutely no way you could ever push it, because you just *can't*. But eventually you get sick of looking for an exit, and reluctantly go over and push it.As soon as I push it, the screen starts to shake, and *boss music* starts playing. Tentacles start emerging out of the ground. I can tell what was coming, but not how it's going to present itself. I knew it would be one of the hardest things I'd ever done in my life, but it was too late to turn back. The alternative was death. All I could do was prepare for the battle, because my exit was cut off, and I had no other options left. [info] In order to think, you have to risk being offended [info] 1552330203
BayazRules [info] Meth puts me in my own head, kinda relaxes me. I hole up in my room and fap or listen to music.I did kinda edge into stimulant psychosis last night, though. I'd been up for three days and smoked probably 2 grams in that time frame. I started hearing voices and remembered that I'm a powerful chaos magician who can bend reality, and the voices wanted me dead. I thought I was being remote viewed and my devices had been hacked. Long story short, I went to bed and problem solved. Not once during that ordeal did I consider leaving my room, let alone any kind of human interaction. Believe it or not the scariest psychoses I've had were induced by heavy cannabis use. Twice in the past ten years, smoking weed has driven me out of my fucking mind and landed me in the psych unit. The second time, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I'm not claiming "meth &gt; weed", this has just been my experience and I'm an outlier. [info] None [info] 1552353621

rock_crystal [info] You're not a fake! And your assumption might very well be right. I was diagnosed with bipolar and was psychologically examined because they suspected borderline.

LiwyikFinx [info] Just a heads up: this is probably better suited to Temper Tantrum Tuesday, my apologies. TLDR at bottom.So I have a really big semicolon tattoo on my upper arm/shoulder area. I got the tattoo years ago - I like to read, there’s no other reason I got the tattoo. I also have a lot of v old but still v noticeable keloid scarring over a lot of my arms/back/chest, some from work/some from decade-old self-harm/but most from a v shitty ex tbh.Starting a few years ago, there were a couple incidents where strangers made what I perceived at the time as unexpected emotional.. idk, confessions/outbursts to me? about their experiences with mental health &amp; self-harm &amp; suicide. I was always polite/non-judgmental while quickly excusing myself, and didn’t really think much of it. Recently I found about some project called Project Semicolon, a faith-based anti-suicide initiative, supposed to build awareness/solidarity for mental health+suicide. Now I understand - people see my tattoo &amp; my scarring and assume that I am apart of the Project Semicolon, that I am someone who is open about things like this. Tbh I *am* pretty significantly mentally ill, have long history of suicide attempts/institutionalizations/etc, but I am a reserved &amp; guarded person irl, am not friendly (though again, being polite is very important to me), am decidedly not someone who wants to talk with strangers about things like that.I’m planning on getting a cover-up whenever I can afford to, but in the meantime, what should I do if another stranger tries to confide in me, thinking that we are apart of the same project? I recognize how vulnerable that person is making themselves, and I want to be kind, gracious, compassionate.TLDR: have v old semicolon tattoo/suspicious scarring, people think I am about that Project Semicolon initiative but I am defo not, gonna get a cover up but in the meantime, what do?

LaurenxKate68 [info] Thank you for asking for advice on this matter. I am diagnosed with bipolar as well. (23F)Bipolar disorder is a tough disorder that affects their entire life. Yes, lack of sleep, sugar, alcohol and even caffeine can worsen symptoms and increase manic episodes. One of the easiest ways to help with mood frequencies is to cut out alcohol in general. Bipolar persons can feel alcohol related symptoms of mania for even up to two weeks and can actually cause someone on lorazepam to go to sleep and never wake up if they take multiple alcoholic drinks while on the medication. I think the most important part of dating someone with bipolar disorder is patience and communication. I can tell that you are proactive in making your relationship work with her disorder and that you are passionate about making this work. When you get into a manic state, extreme irritability is a common symptom and it’s due to lack of sleep..when you’re manic, you feel like you’re floating almost and it’s hard for you to make educated rational decisions because you feel emotions full throttle and it’s extremely hard to control them as you assess risk differently. Most bipolar persons in manic episodes do not realize the effect they are truly having on others while in that state because I like to refer to it as their perception of reality is skewed in that time frame, so it would make sense that she could potentially be borderline abusive to you in that state but not fully comprehend the true effect of what she is saying and how it affects you. It may seem like you are dealing with two separate people (manic vs non manic) and that because you honestly are. You are very understanding of her and her disability and that is so important. The main key is communication and patience. Listening to what she needs, helping keep her perspective of reality on when she’s in those states. If you are aggressive or argumentative back she may match it with even more aggression, best thing to try is to agree with her concerns in that state, be calm and give her her space if she needs it. I hate to say this, but you will probably need to be the bigger person in arguments.  It is unfortunately a chemical imbalance that many people suffer from but with the property medicine and treatment they are able to live relatively normal lives. Everyone I have told that I am bipolar have told me they would’ve never known if I didn’t tell them and that’s because I’ve been able to master my emotions and even maintain healthy long term relationships as well as full time jobs.  If you have any questions about bipolar disorder I would love to answer them. I hope this helps you understand what may cause symptoms of bipolar and how to counteract it.

LlamaramaDingdong86 [info] Well I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2. I have tried mood stabilizers but they make me feel like a zombie, so far cannabis works great. But if I quit I either get very manic or very depressed and I give up om taking a break because I just feel SO BAD. When I smoke regularly I can sleep 6-8 hours a night at a usual time and get up and work 8 hours and do all the human things like cleaning my apartment and cooking dinner. When I stop all of that falls apart. Sleep goes first and the rest follows. [info] None [info] 1552882874
MissDoomNGloom [info] Thank you so much for your response, and I can't express properly how glad I am for you. The recovery from mental illness is a lifelong process and you've done very well so far by the sound of it! If you ever have a difficult day my PMs are open, always.I attempted suicide at 16, and the period of inpatient admission was one of the most difficult times of my life. Regardless, I try to exercise my empathy and experience the most with pediatric psych patients in my ER. It did help me on the road to recovery despite the difficulties. People seem to appreciate it. My meds seem to be working well since I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. Previously I was on 60-80 mg Prozac for years which didn't help and caused me to gain about 60 lbs. I'm way more functional now, but have to catch up on the skills that others have had years to work on, like organization, study skills, time management and discipline. I've always tested incredibly well, I got incredible scores on my SAT and ACT. So much so that I got a free ride to my first year of college (in, admittedly, a dead end town) even with a 2.4 GPA. I'm hoping fervently that the MCAT will make a noticeable difference in a school's decision. If I get in for an interview I may be passionate and quirky enough to sway the committee.

TheNinacorn [info] I wanted to get my PhD in psychology and open a detox and rehab facility by the time I turned 30.I turned 30 two weeks ago and I haven't finished my associate's degree. You're not bad for "being a mess" or being less successful than your friends. You're not a failure. You are a person and life happens. Don't try and measure your success to others, it will only bring you down. You still have time to get your life where you want it to be. It may be a little harder for you, but don't assume everyone has their shit together (because honestly I know grown ass men with great degrees drinking their lives away and not really caring.)As for feeling you're in a slump, all I can say to that is personally I have found if you really work towards managing your mental health it becomes easier. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 25 and I had a very (very) hard time accepting it. It will never go away but if I put the stigma of mental illness to the side I've realized its easier to focus on getting better.You aren't alone. I wish someone told me that sooner, but know you are not alone. [info] None [info] 1552928336
0h3mG33MandiLeigh [info] I almost cried when I heard my diagnosis but they were positive tears. I was so relieved to finally have an answer. My whole life I genuinely felt like I was trying my best but it didn’t seem that way to friends and family. “I was so smart!” “I knew better!” “No excuses!” My whole life I’ve carried so much guilt with me because I felt like such a disappointment. I believed everyone when they said certain things were so easy I must be sabotaging myself and how mean is that because people depend on me. I had my son at 16 too and there was the guilt of feeling like a crap mom on top of it.I’m 30 now and just got my diagnosis a month ago. I went back to school and am currently working on a masters degree. I did that all without any sort of adhd medication. Hearing I had adhd made me feel like I could be proud of myself. I felt finally like instead of falling short I was actually way ahead. I felt like I accomplished a lot in my life despite my brain literally not making or moderating its own chemicals like it should. I guess I am mildly angry at former therapists for not knowing sooner. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well and I told people i “didn’t feel right”. No one listened but it really is hard to blame anyone. Studies weren’t done on girls, how could they know?I’m fairly certain my mother has undiagnosed adhd as well and other kinds of mental illness run in my family on both sides. Abnormal and unhealthy behavior are actually our norm. Of course they wouldn’t notice the signs! All in all- I feel like it’s not too late for me. I’m eager to see what else I can accomplish. I feel like if I got where I am today lugging a metaphorical giant rock around- now that the weights been lifted I’m sure I can do even more!  [info] None [info] 1552937566
Silent_Sibyl [info] I went through school to become a funeral director. Graduated summa cum laude and loved every part of the education. Once I got a job at a funeral home, I lasted three months. It didn’t help that the owner was a chauvinistic asshole, but what really got to me was that I had to constantly walk on eggshells. Even answering the phone  with “good morning” set some people off. It’s been six years since I left that job and the field, and I wish I could say I’m doing much better and that I’m happy, but I’m really not.

LeafyQ [info] My mom refused to take me for ADHD testing as a kid, although it was recommended over and over. She convinced me that it didn’t exist. I struggled a lot in school, even though I really loved it and I’m not a stupid person. I got by, but college took a couple of attempts, and my GPA is piss poor. I spent my entire school life super stressed out about my performance, and I spent hours and hours every day just to keep up. I want to go to grad school, but I really don’t think I’ll get into any programs. I’ve now been diagnosed with ADHD, and on Adderall I’m a much, much higher performing individual, but I think it’s too late for me to change my life. She also would never take me for any kind of mental health evaluation. Since I was a teen, I’ve gone through long periods of horrible emotional struggles and more. I also had periods where I was doing really, really well. I won’t go into detail, but a few years back I was diagnosed with bipolar I.

cherry_tree_95 [info] My partner and I met when we both thought we were happiest alone. I asked for a transfer to his store and he immediately thought I was a customer and wanted to help me, I had my interview there and when I left he asked the manager to hire me because “I was the girl he was going to marry”. We started working together and within being there a week I told my best friend he was the one I would settle down with but here’s the thing we both played it too cool. It took 2 months for us to play hard ball and go on a date but from there it was fire works. 2 months later I told him I wanted to marry him while on a road trip, he got fake upset and said it was the worst engagement ever with no ring and no big proposal, it was hilarious and we kept it up before he seriously turned to me and said, “Will you marry me?” We didn’t immediately set a date but 3 months later we found out his father was seriously ill and potentially wouldn’t live much longer, within 3 months we organised to elope with our parents present and it was the most magical day of my life. 2 years on and I’ve never been happier, times haven’t always been easy - in that time I was diagnosed with bipolar and post traumatic stress from child hood abuse, but I’ve got him.

TheSausageTurd [info] I agree to a point. I use it both recreationally and medically. I was diagnosed with bipolar 5-6 years back. They put me on a concoction of medications saying it would help. These included but not limited to prozac, lithium, and Xanax (not all at one time but when one didn't work they would give me another one). Most of the medications did get rid of the extreme mood swings but completely took away my personality. I started smoking weed over a year ago and I will never go back on prescription mood stabilizers. While weed does has it's downsides including not being able to drive or work it allows me to be myself and keeps me in a good mood for the entire day. I've tried CBD gummies and whatnot but they don't seem to have the same effect for me. It could be placebo but whatever it is weed truly is a hell of a medication but it should be used responsibly.

I’ve tried and tried but I couldn’t even expect true comfort from my mom because my problems weren’t as bad as hers.I was just diagnosed with bipolar 1 at 22, just a few days agozI first started showing signs and symptoms including voicing my concern about suicidal thoughts at 15.. I’ve spiraled more and more since then. I wish she would’ve taken me to follow up so I could have nipped this in the bud. I was crying for help but it was just ignored.

OrphanS1ayer [info] I noticed that my relationship was toxic when, I saw myself wondering why I’m still with her. She would always play victim and whenever something bad happened to me, no matter how trivial, something worse always happened to her. Or when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she suddenly was diagnosed with the same thing but “a lot worse than yours” is how she put it. She had gotten into my head. Made me push away my friends and family. She made me think she was the only person I had. The only person that was there for me. The only person that mattered to me. She enclosed me. Really she kept me prisoner inside of myself. That’s how it felt anyway. She always had to 1-up everything I had done. She would constantly belittle my problems. She would convince me to do things I didn’t want to do. Tricked me into believing that she was good for me, when she wasn’t. She had devoured my mind. All I could think about was how I could get out of the relationship without hurting her feelings. Because I’m a sucker for that. I don’t like people getting upset at me or upset with something I’ve done. I knew she’d been through a lot like when her mom passed when she was 12 or when she was molested the year after. But constantly belittling or outright ignoring my problems. She would create fear inside me when I felt confident, which wasn’t often. She had created a false reality in which I mattered, when she really was only afraid of being alone. She only wanted me until someone better came along.  [info] None [info] 1553579323

Gaynicorn2 [info] I know this post is old but I stumbled upon it when searching if anyone else has both. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 for five years now and adhd for four years. I was medicated for adhd for two years and went off because I lost insurance. I’m now back on my vyvanse (in addition to my lamictal and seroquel) and it’s made such a difference. I was having more frequent episodes when I wasn’t on my vyvanse. Now that I’m being treated for both, my moods have been much more stable. It’s always good to be cautious when on adhd medication because it can be addictive and can result in lack of sleep, sometimes resulting in a manic episode because no sleep. But as long as you pay close attention to how your meds are affecting you, you’ll be ok. [info] None [info] 1553660151

syntheticgerbil [info] Luckily the calling work thing subsided after the first 3 years of the relationship, but it's like when I really started to think about her and BPD, that was one of the things I had read that stood out, since it was odd she used to be so clingy to that point. Also I didn't have a cell phone until 2008 I think. So now if there's some kind of cling or panic, it's just a lot of texts.I would like to get into therapy but I've been working contract stuff for the last three years and I'd either have to get third party healthcare or pay to be on my wife's plan. Both are not affordable for me by a long shot. I go to a psychiatrist because I was diagnosed with bipolar II back in 2011 so I do talk to him sometimes but it's not the same. I did do about 4 years of regular CBT therapy though from 2008 to 2012 so I still try to apply things like that I learned every day to keep the bipolar sadness at bay. They don't concern the mania part of Bipolar II so I just take a mood stabilizer every day that my psychiatrist seemed to figure out the perfect dosage for and I often just feel pretty content throughout my days.But yes, I hope to get into maybe DBT therapy myself if I can find a full time job with benefits. As it is right now, when I need healthcare stuff that isn't regular therapy, it's cheaper to just get the cash discounts and no insurance discounts as well pay the tax penalty.

Domidoggy8 [info] One of the issues is that I don't have direct contact with the psychiatrist. I was referred to a psychiatrist back in December but am being told that an appointment is still 4-6 months out. My social worker at my primary care office consults with this psychiatrist once a week. My only other option is to pay out of pocket to go to a private psychiatric facility. It isn't a possibility with my income and I've already paid about $200 in co-pays since the beginning of this month when I was diagnosed with bipolar. I thought I was a bit paranoid when I got an appointment last Thursday for a rash that was only on my legs. The psychiatrist saw photos and said it wasn't Lamictal related. I then proceeded to buy new body wash, detergent, and laundry softener because maybe I was reacting to something else. After it spread Sunday night, I saw my primary care physician yesterday and stopped medication. I feel let down because I thought I was doing well on the medication so far. None of the other Drs. have been able to get in touch with the psychiatrist for medication recommendations since my appointment for the rash yesterday. [info] None [info] 1553712152

I've certainly had a lot of sex and my opinions and experiences on polyamory stem from my relationship with Ellie and again with my second wife, but I've never claimed to have sex every day since I was 16, just that I usually have sex every day when in any sort of relationship that includes sex.Also, I've never had this type of attention before on any of my posts.

misticlese [info] Thanks, I'm a couple of months out from my latest surgery so hopefully the symptoms will improve.My husband and I decided not to have kids before I was diagnosed with bipolar and endometriosis. He actually had a vasectomy before we got married. Even so, I sometimes wonder what our kid would look like and be like and I know he would make a good father. I also know that having kids is just not something we'll do. I've talked to my therapist about these kinds of thoughts, knowing that I don't want kids for a variety of reasons but sometimes just wondering what it would be like. I think that's normal, too! There's a continuum between being absolutely sure you want kids and absolutely sure you don't. I definitely think it's worth talking to your therapist about, just to share your feelings in a non judgemental environment.  [info] None [info] 1554617542
babykittenbella [info] I’m an adult child. At age 32 I suffered an episode of mania. My mother comitted me to an insititution involuntarily, and I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I have been stable since, but am suffering severe consequences of the meds and social stigma around mental illness. It sounds like your son needs help very urgently. I did too at the time. However... Today I am scared of my mother and SO, because of the trauma of getting me help. There was paramedics and police involved, I was taken to a hospital in handcuffs, even though I never hurt anyone including myself. I have forgiven them, but will never ever forget. I think it might have been better if they had explained to me that I could go voluntarily, if not they had the power to rob me of my rights and would get it done without my consent. I might have gone on my own... Good luck! [info] None [info] 1554653681
manicslut [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a year ago and ADHD a couple months ago. I was prescribed adderall that I take a couple times a week for school and while it works wonders for my ability to focus and get things done, I think it also triggers hypomanic states.  I think overall the stimulants are bad for my mental health but I’m starting grad school in the fall and feel like I need adderall to get through the program even if it’s sabotaging my mental health. So I’m kind of stuck. I also started abilify a year ago which had me very stable until about a month ago.. not sure if my current hypomania is caused by the adderall or the time of year (I usually get hypomanic in the Springg). But, one of the worst parts about the dual diagnosis is that the impulsivity associated with ADHD combined with bipolar’s hypomania work together to create the perfect storm to make terrible choices.

yasssssplease [info] are you on any medication--whether mood stabilizers, anti-depressants, or birth control? Have you been officially diagnosed by anyone?Have you gone to a psychiatrist or gynecologist and talked to them about this? I have bipolar disorder and take mood stabilizers. I don't have any problems around my period, and I'm actually stable in general. It sounds like it's REALLY connected to your cycle. That could be something other than bipolar disorder--PMDD like someone else said. Have you talked to doctors about IUDs? If you haven't gone to the doctor, that should be your first step.If you're on some sort of pill birth control, that could also affect you. I was taking it for awhile and had started it before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I immediately realized that birth control pills probably wasn't helping, and that was the right call to stop. Taking them together with mood stabilizers can affect how well both drugs work.

taytay9955 [info] Some people who have medicine resistant bipolar have better results from the keto diet ( which was designed to treat epilepsy) so maybe that is an option if you notice that it is responsive to changes in diet and exercise. I think if you check the boxes you check the boxes and it is just extra shitty that it doesn't respond to drugs, but if you have never had an EEG it might be worth having done. Sometimes epilepsy can seem like bipolar disorder. I have a really long story about this where I was diagnosed with bipolar, then diagnosed with epilepsy only to get a second and then a third opinion who told me I didn't have epilepsy. However, it could be worth looking into if you have any other warning signs.

spankyspank [info] If it makes you feel any better, you are not alone. I have had friends who literally posted every single moment of their child's life on FB, to the point that they made a profile for their newborn and posted statuses/pics pretending to actually be her. If you can't stop her posting, you could at least ensure that her posts about you are limited to a specific audience (people who you are okay with seeing that much info about you) - this can be done on her FB settings. If she is on board, you could have her make those changes. I would be sure that at the very least, the posts are limited to just her friends and not public. This is easy to change on the privacy settings too.As far as getting your mom to not do FB at all, I feel your pain. When I was diagnosed with bipolar my mom was on the phone/facebook with everyone about my diagnosis and my life. I also felt I had no privacy. Even when I stressed this to her, she said to me that "she needed to vent" so I at least got her to cut out the FB shit. There is literally no privacy since once you put it on the internet, it is out there for everyone. Maybe get your mom to move her talking about you to private phone calls like I asked my mom to do? It doesn't really save your privacy in that she is still sharing it with someone, but at least it's not the entire internet.Edit: a word [info] None [info] 1554902801

So they resent talking in English probably assume I don't have a job so see me as foreign mentally ill scum and probably assume I am on benefits and using their welfare system. So they see me as dirt. I probably pay just as much taxes as they do though. I don't want the battle anymore the stress is not worth it so online is the best thing for me.

kslidz [info] that someone that is a christmas fanatic is a good example of how ocd presents itself. people are stupid man until I was in my late teens I thought bipolar was multiple personality disorder, then I thought schizophrenia was multiple personality disorder. And this wasn't because I thought this on my own this was something that lots of flippant usage of these terms implicated.  I really didn't learn a lot until I was diagnosed with bipolar. And now when people find out lots of them will act differently or treat me in ways that doesn't even make sense. There is a ton of misinformation and although many people know better, tons don't. It's the same reason I stopped making racist jokes. I never believed any of the stuff I was joking about I just thought it was an absurd concept.

Also, I was 15, and a gay biracial kid living in a backwoods shithole, of fucking course I was depressed and angry and got into a lot of fights. I spent at least a year on 4 or 5 different mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, etc. at the same time. I remember basically nothing about it.

WHAT-WOULD-HITLER-DO [info] The worst part is that the more religious a theocratic politician is, the more sociopathic and callous their political ideology tends to be. Christian voters here are mobilized for the most fucked up things, like oppressing their LGBT brothers and sisters or making sure fellow Americans can't have feasible access to basic healthcare. Obamacare saved my life shortly after the age I can stay on my mom's plan was extended. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of trying to manage symptoms with alcohol and xanax because insurance companies usually didn't cover mental health services (which cost hundreds of dollars a visit for psychiatrists, at least $100 for the cheapest therapists who usually are just starting out and haven't established themselves yet). Plus I was just about to get kicked off because of the age cutoff, so other basic chronic health issues would have become a major financial strain. These bible thumping fuckers think what jesus would do (WWJD is a common thing on bracelets and whatnot) is tell me to pray about it and if my prayers aren't answered it's because I lack faith/am a sinner. So yeah in my mind the opposite is to distort/white wash/historically revise the polar opposite (Hitler vs Jesus) and pretend that Hitler was the altruistic and deeply empathetic leader who tried to bring about positive social change. Don't intend for it to be trolly in the sense of being online and starting arguments for dumb shit, but I can see why it comes off that way. I like comedy and I like to laugh at dark shit. My family came as refugees from antisemitism to the US when the USSR collapsed in 1993. I think the cure to all social fuckery is to laugh at how absurd it all is. Take the seriousness out of it, take away the power of words and references that are painful and destructive (and at times, genocidal/institutionally oppressive). As a female I love gender/sexist jokes and being in an interracial relationship my bf and I love racial humior. Rather than being angry at racism or sexism, we can destroy the power it has through laughter. Fresh Prince of Bellaire, Eddy Murphy movies, and comics who made it ok to laugh at race in the 90s really did have a major impact on white people who otherwise had a lot of shitty opinions on black people. I saw it in my parents and friend's parents growing up. Even seemingly "racist" jokes, when executed masterfully by great comedians and in epic movies/sitcoms, I think all contributed to easing how seriously people took themselves and their hatred towards others by forcing them to laugh against their will. Sure some jokes are a net negative, but those need to be able to exist too if we want the more fun stuff to be allowed to flourish. Like how Megan Kelly and others get fired for offending people, congrats, now you taught racists to just keep their shitty opinions private so that, as the late great Patrice O'neal pointed out repeatedly, he has no way of knowing who's racist. Which means he can't talk to them honestly and maybe change their minds. He "never met a racist", so he knew people existed who *thought* "nigger", but had no way of knowing if the person being polite to him hated him deep inside or was genuinely a nice person. On the other hand if we didn't try to censor people and let them be honest, we can laugh at the shitty things they say and take that power away genuinely vs just pretending it doesn't exist (which is does, but people learn to keep it covert, so you seem ridiculous for insisting it's real). To me, Hitler jokes do the same thing. Better to laugh at the insanity than to get outraged and radicalize people by fighting shittiness with shittiness. [info] None [info] 1555948184
lxlCaraBoolxl [info] For as long as I can remember I have had this habit of picking my nails. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I am on medication for it. I have a job where I count cash to hundreds of people a day and I am so embarrassed at how my fingers have gotten. I wore acrylics from July of last year til October. Took them off for a month and had a relapse into picking. Put acrylics back on November til March and now I am back to doing it. This time it’s progressively worse. Before I was maybe a medium picker but now it’s gotten severe for myself personally. I have gotten to the point that I can ignore the severe pain while bleeding. Everything hurts. Showers hurt, washing hurts, just moving them hurts. On top of my hands are swelling this time from the picking. The one finger I don’t pick doesn’t swell. I do like this Rip-Fix lotion I get on amazon and I prefer not to do acrylics again because working out and lifting weights is hard but ultimately I might have to. Any tips or tricks?

Tigergirl1975 [info] This will get vlburied, but here goes.I refuse to dismiss mental illness. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (among other things) at 12. My mother decided that she didn't agree with the diagnosis, and refused to allow them to treat it. She decided that if I spent more time around people, I would be happier. So I was forbidden from being in my room to do anything other than sleep. And if she felt that I had slept enough, or that I was in my room when I shouldn't, she had a remote doorbell installed that sounded like a fire alarm go off in my room.I'm now 35. Guess what? I have PTSD induced bipolar disorder. Because it wasn't dealt with properly when I was a kid, it got worse.  Thanks mom. I really needed that. [info] None [info] 1556065292
themarajade1 [info] Actually if you read my original comment, you’ll see that I clearly stated my defense for her. (which in case you can’t tell, is the very first reply to this whole comment thread.) Also, I’ve been through two nightmarish pregnancies, both alluded in the original comment. I had HG with my first and lost 15 lbs in the first trimester. I couldn’t even keep water down. Not to mention, he was born five weeks early and he’s now an autistic five year old boy. My daughter was conceived through a sexual assault, so imagine that, and the entire time I’ve had either of my children I’ve been a single mother. My entire experience as a parent has been borderline a nightmare. Also if we want to talk about mental health, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder right after my daughter’s birth and it’s taken me a really long time to get to where I’m at now, which is a good place. So don’t @ me with that no compassion bullshit. I still fully believe that OP’s wife needs and deserves some serious support and probably therapy/professional help but at some point, also, people are still responsible for their own actions. This is coming from someone who *has* been there. Take a seat, young skywalker. [info] Asshole Enthusiast [5] [info] 1556074437

kl1lly [info] My husband.I knew after 2 weeks of dating him he was my hero. I was 17 and on the way home from his house trying to make curfew and I went head on into a tree. I texted him as soon as I got out of the car and he pulled up right after the ambulance did and he took my mom to the hospital and sat with me all night and watched me sleep to make sure I was ok. Since then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have put our marriage through pretty detrimental things that I wouldn’t have blamed him for leaving me over. He has stayed with me throughout and stopped me from attempting suicide one night and on a separate occasion found me after attempting and rushed me to the hospital. He visited me every day even after working, taking care of kids, house, etc. I was abused as a child and he does everything he can to make me feel safe and protected. Hands down the most heroic person I’ve ever encountered. [info] None [info] 1556228553
AutoModerator [info] ^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***Fairly long winded so bear with me.My sister and I have always been at odds with each other - we have never been the type to play nice together. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after getting kicked out after finishing secondary school and never looked back. After struggling with substance abuse and generally impulsive behavior throughout my twenties I finally got my shit together and made an active effort to get closer to my parents. I realize now that they didn’t have the tools they needed to deal with me and that maybe we could essentially start over. It’s going well and we’ve gotten heaps better at communicating at 28 than when I was 18. Recently I’ve also mended a few relationships with people I’ve hurt over the past few years with my impulsiveness.I’ve always wanted to try the same thing with my sister but recent events have me thinking I’m better off not. I recently have gotten close to my girlfriends family and it blew me away how close and loving all of the siblings are to one another. What I always laughed off as siblings being siblings (getting chased with a kitchen knife for being an annoying little brother always comes to mind) actually seemed very cruel. In her adulthood she’s always been very narcissistic and explosive if she doesn’t get her way and this has always resulted in blowout arguments the few times we get together. She’s a social worker and thusly has a lot of experience with people not too different from me but I feel like she uses this against me - any time I bring up her behavior that’s ‘just her personality type’ whereas my reaction is always regarded as a part of my mental state despite being stable and medicated for several years. In addition to this I’ve noticed that the only time she contacts me is when she needs something (I work in hospitality and my travel benefits are great) and even then it seems like something that’s expected. After our last fight at Christmas last year (started after I skipped a song on her Christmas playlist) I told her she wasn’t welcome to using my benefits. I was painted as a monster because I was not only making her pay more money but also her friends who were depending on the discount so they could afford to go. I ended up caving under family pressure. Any time in the past when I’ve ignored her she tends to explain to people that she’s always reaching out to be close but I always turn her away or that I must be off medication.Fast forward to today, the two of us have moved cross country for work and ended up in the same city a mere five subway stops away yet haven’t seen or contacted each other. My parents are disappointed but I really don’t want to willingly hash things out with a person I believe to be toxic to me. I know a lot of posts here are rooted in validation but sometimes I find I have a tendency to not be as empathetic as I should be considering my mental health history.

MrRabinowitz [info] Well, I was diagnosed with ADD in my early 20s. I got prescribed meds, my career took off things improved dramatically overall. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 5 years ago. At first I had a shitty therapist who gave me the wrong meds - but later I found someone else and let me tell you - I am a totally different person in a very good way. I'm taking care of myself better, have lost weight, have an improved and more stable mood, and honestly - I have a lot more self respect because I'm actually in tune with my feelings. Before all of this I was basically dead inside and nothing mattered - so I wasn't really taking actions that made my life better. [info] None [info] 1556293377
jess-mills_ [info] Ok so before I was diagnosed with bipolar, I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Prozac. During the intake all she asked me was how I felt on a scale of 1-10. I also have dermatillomania, which is a type of ocd. She literally said prozac would solve all of my problems if I went on the max dose. She prescribed me 20mg and bumped it to 40mg the next week. She also said I didn't need to see a therapist and I should call in a month to check in. About 4 weeks later when the side effects kicked in, I started my sophomore year of college. Long story short the prozac activated my bipolar, and I went through a manic phase without realizing it and a depressive phase. Long story short I ended up in the hospital because I drank way too much and hit my head on a table and had to get 4 staples in my head. It kinda funny - I told the nurse that my gown could be a prom dress lolol. I was very suicidal in the hospital and the psychiatrist at the hospital said I was possibly bipolar. So I went back to my psychiatrist and explained everything that happened at school (I had dropped out at this point). She was like oh ok well the meds won't work on ocd unless you are on 80mg...so she literally prescribed me 80mg and I was like wtf I basically went insane on 40mg...so I told her I didn't feel comfortable with 80mg and the psychiatrist at the hospital thought the prozac was activating the bipolar. She literally said "oh you probably just talked to a social worker at the hospital. They don't know what they are talking about, but if you are feeling bipolar we can try a different medication" So then she proceeds to scroll through her phone (she wasn't even on a computer or taking notes for any of it) and after a few minutes she was like hmm maybe this one. So she prescribed me seroquel and she was like "oh this is an antipsychotic but it doesn't mean you are psychotic. Take it tonight and call me in the morning if you feel hungover" I explained I had taken the 40mg of prozac that morning and she was like oh that's fine. So basically I was like um shes crazy and never picked up the prescription and never went back to her... [info] None [info] 1556354464
Nikiki124C41 [info] I remember after I did mushrooms, waking up the next day and literally walking outside I felt like a new person, it’s so hard to describe.

trenorh [info] I’m really sorry and wish you nothing but the best. My mom has schizophrenia and it breaks my heart to hear of anyone else going through that. I agree with much of the advice from the previous commenter, but I’ll try to add a few useful things. Regarding medication, from what I’ve seen it takes a long time to take action and your doctors may spend months balancing and rebalancing your dosage or combinations. Whatever happens, it’s important to stay on the medication and be in touch with your doctor about any concerning side effects. I know this seems obvious, but in my mom’s case she often has delusions regarding the medication itself. Schizophrenia characterized by hallucinations, sometimes called positive-schizophrenia, is generally easier to treat with medication, so don’t lose hope. It can be really hard to be around the ones you care about when mental health issues come up, but it’s important to remember that they care about you too, even when you feel otherwise. I was diagnosed with bipolar this semester and it’s taken a toll on a lot of my friendships; during my depressive episodes, people find me insufferable. The best way I’ve found to manage friendships is to find a way to do something nice on the days where I don’t feel like absolute shit. It doesn’t have to be a good day or anything, just a day where you feel like you manage. Your partner and friends will really appreciate just any gesture of kindness you can muster when they know all that you’re going through. I really hope that you can get the medical and emotional support you need; there are ways to manage this disease. Take care of yourself [info] None [info] 1556520180
MildlyUpsetCrusader [info] A lot of things, over the last year or so I've thought a lot about life. I've had a lot of suicidal ideation and such as I've been diagnosed with bipolar one. I started not wanting to because I was terrified of non existance but then I realized it's not scary, because there is no you to be non existent.Then I thought about how shitty life is. Not even for me just the billions of people without clean water. Those who are raped. People dying of cancer. It's all rather shitty and happiness is extremely fleeting and most of the time at best people are feeling meh all the time.Then I thought about my own life. Maybe nothing is hopeless, but its just so much more difficult to try and get better. Esspecialy becuase I'm going to have episodes the rest of my life. Bipolar is a hell of a disease and it'll only get worse. I don't want to try that.My long term partner recently left me, but I was planning on hanging myself before that anyways, so that's not my main reason. Although it sure does help.

fujifilm96 [info] I'm not going out much, and I do have some people that I talk to in uni. I don't hang out with them, though. They're more of acquaintances, and I don't feel confident enough to hang out with them (idk if that makes sense). I'm tired all through the day, but I can get my homework done. Uni is really manageable, actually.I didn't know if it was my depressive moods coming back. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a couple of years back, but the past 6 months have been great and honestly I thought I was cured from it. I thought that it was a matter of motivation, or rather the lack of it. I've given it a bit more thought and from reading everyone's comments here and I think I'll agree that maybe my mood is worsening. I'll look into it and speak to my psych when I next meet her I guess. Thank you for your help anyway :) [info] None [info] 1556610383
thegirlcandream [info] I’m 26 and am currently struggling with this. I was diagnosed with bipolar at 7 so it’s nothing new for me. Single life was ideal because I knew how to deal with myself during the ups and downs and didn’t have to worry about anyone’s else’s feelings. I’m having a really hard time with this right now and I’m sure my partner is getting sick of it. My natural response is to end things. Saying it’s just easier to end it sounds like such a cop out but to be honest, with all the shit I’m constantly trying to regulate for myself, it WOULD be a lot easier and probably a less painful solution for both of us. I have another 11 months left on a lease with my partner so I really don’t have the option to run away from that impulse. I still haven’t figured out if that’s a good or bad thing because it’s forcing me to work through it but good god it’s uncomfortable. Hang in there. You’re not alone. [info] None [info] 1556674322

keetstreet [info] Sorry I'm 40, not 50. When I was 28 I got pregnant and had an abortion. There were times I wondered if I made the right decision. Years later, my mental health started deteriorating (not because of the abortion - mental illness runs in my family) and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I went through years of hell and a hospitalization before finding the right combination of meds, and I'm unable to work but was turned down for disability. Trying to raise a child under those circumstances would have been pure hell, and I probably would have ended up losing custody anyway, due to my mental health. Now I have no regrets about what I did. The only thing I worry about now is growing old alone. [info] None [info] 1556742587
nmsims [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar two back in 2013 but I figured I was before I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist I willingly went to on my own. I’m a CPA and have a masters degree. I’m 33 and am successful depending on how you define it. The dr was surprised that I got by as well as I had without treatment. To that point. I told her I’ve always just thought I had problems that couldn’t be resolved and even though things felt hard and like I had to try hard I just tried hard.  I was out on some different meds but didn’t feel differently after the adjustment phase. I eventually stopped taking anything and went back to self managing. I always had trouble organizing my thoughts and communicating concisely and to the point. Mainly cause I feel like I have a million thoughts in my head just running through my mind faster than I can speak. I have a really hard time focusing on simple things cause my thoughts are very complex. That’s the one thing I wish I could change cause I think it has caused some to not take me as seriously. I didn’t know this was a bi polar symptom but I just read it. I now want to ask my psychiatrist if she can prescribe me bi polar meds. I’m on adderall right now and have been for about 8 months. It gets me focused but I can’t wrangle my thoughts. I just found this Reddit page today which I’m glad about. Seems like so many really understand bi polar disorder and their quirks at a deep level. I’d like to be able to do the same. [info] None [info] 1556763204
termedea [info] That's a tough journey! I'm proud of you for getting this far.I didn't know about mental health awareness month. It's a great thing that I'll spread here too. It isn't a thing here where I live, but it should be. Now, considering your post, I've stopped to reflect on my own progress. I've been on sick leave for about 3,5 years for what started out as a burn out and later unraveled a plethora of issues and diagnoses for me. I've been depressed for most of my life, without knowing I could get help, I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 2, and now I'm awaiting an assessment to see if I'm suffering from a neurodevelopmental disorder.  It's been a tough couple of years, but I've finally started to move forward - and I've gotten far.  I've got a much better understanding of myself now, my strengths and limitations. I can work part time again and even push myself, because I know how to recharge and balance myself after challenges. I've got a better understanding of what I need from others. And probably most importantly of all, I'm more calm toward my bad episodes, and I rarely go into a depressive spiral where I fear nothing could get better again when they happen. Best of luck to you and happy Mental Health Awareness Month. Thanks for bringing this to my attention! :) [info] bp2 [info] 1556802702

Soggy-Slapper [info] What radicalized me was when I hurt my back from being overworked by a job that didn’t want to hire anyone to save money, then not being able to afford to get treatment for it. I’m 22 years old and I’ve had horrible lower back pain like a 40+ year old man for 3 years and that should never happenThen later on I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and couldn’t afford any treatment other than medicine. I was forced to teach myself how to cope with it because I couldn’t afford mental healthcare. I almost killed myself multiple times because my brain just shit itself and decided it was time to go crazy, the only reason I’m alive is because I had good people to watch over me to make sure I didn’t do it I’m 22, I shouldn’t be dealing with back pain and I shouldn’t need friends to serve as a personal suicide watch but rich people would rather let me suffer and die before they let me get treatment without making them any money [info] None [info] 1556912831
tblitzy [info] My parents took me to a therapist when I was 12. After a few sessions the therapist directed me to a psychiatrist that worked in the same clinic. She sent him an introductory email about me and during the appointment I was asked a few questions. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed medications (I think they were mood stabilizers).Then a few months later my mom took me to another psychiatrist as my old one left the country. The new one, after being told about my previous diagnosis was kind of shocked and said that it was very unlikely I was bipolar at this age. I told her about the symptoms I was experiencing and she concluded it was ADHD. I had to withdraw from my medication and start adderall which made me lose a lot of weight.Fast forward a year later, I move countries and go to this new doctor. My mom asks if my medication can be changed because my current ones weren’t doing much good. I’m asked a lot of questions until she concludes I need to be taken off Adderall, because apparently I’m not ADHD, it’s major depressive disorder. So I withdraw, again, and boom, antidepressants.I’m 14, been on them for a few months now and they’re actually working. My parents still have no idea what’s really going on with me.

perennial__pupil [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and ADHD (as well as OCD). Bipolar 2 and ADHD are commonly comorbid. I can relate to your symptoms.  I zone out, I obsess and sometimes lose sleep over new interests. I usually also don’t adjust well to sudden change and emotions were hard for me to handle. I’ve been told that I’m also pretty creative. I have other symptoms but those are what we share.I would stick to listening to your psychiatrist as she is a licensed professional. If you’re feeling better then that means you’re going in the right direction. It’s common for your meds to be tweaked to be more personalized for you as the reactions your body has with medications may differ from others. They had to tweak mine a bit.After getting meds and attending cognitive behavioral therapy, I’m a lot more self aware of my emotions. Unfortunately, it has cost me my relationship at the time.

youtubecommercial [info] This is rarely mentioned at the recruitment meetings I had during high school. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at a young age but nowadays you’d could never guess. I’ve been on the same meds for years, without incident, but I was told that because of the meds (not the diagnosis) that I was ineligible for everything.  I suppose it makes sense but it’s still a bummer, considering I have a better temper than most (working retail and food service helped.) [info] None [info] 1557264301

nottodaycrazy [info] We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are. -Sirius Black (Harry Potter)I actually have this tattooed on my back. When I was 22 I was admitted to a psych hospital for being suicidal. I was diagnosed with bipolar while in. While that was one of the lowest points of my life I realized that I could accept the help being offered or I could continue down a destructive path I was on. Thankfully I chose to accept the diagnosis and fight. It hasn’t been easy but I’ve been blessed with what I always wanted: a daughter and a husband who loves us. When I was 5 I was asked what I wanted to be, my answer was a mom. [info] https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/91ZNAN04VDKQ [info] 1557283816
plmtigr [info] Just replying to let you know that reading this warmed my heart, because I identify with it so much. I discovered polyamory (now relationship anarchy) before I was diagnosed with bipolar. My partner who I was originally monogamous also has agency and chooses to remain monogamous. Space is such an essential component in my life, I can never imagine being the way that I am and living with someone else without eventually lashing out and/or being triggered into a depressive episode. I need space to learn things about myself without any external influences. [info] None [info] 1557323424
irene289 [info] Yeah, i feel that too. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder for a year now. I lost my mom at 10, dad at 18, grandma at 19z (now 21) and I never felt good since then. And now, I can't even remember the things that happened in high school, whenever my friends told me a story about a situation that happened I just asked:” when did that happen?” I had no idea. Some memories are completely gone, some of them I can still remember vaguely. Whenever I tried to remember, my head hurts. [info] None [info] 1557330956
AutoModerator [info] ^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***I’ve been with my girlfriend for roughly two years now. We both met in a city that wasn’t our own and I moved to be with her and essentially start over. Aside from this incident everything has been great - she’s incredibly loving, we have great chemistry, etc. In a lot of ways I truly consider her to be ‘the one.’ She’s expressed similar feelings about me.I grew up in a family with parents that were both narcissistic and abusive to me. I was physically assaulted from the time I was about ten until I was sixteen when I was hospitalized after making an attempt on my own life. Prior to hospitalization I was in a juvie program for fighting and during this period I was beaten pretty badly forced to other things by an older teen. Afterwards I left home and stayed with friends and in shelters until I got my G.E.D and started going to school for the industry I’m in now. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder shortly after leaving home.My girlfriend is from a very affluent family and has admittedly never had it hard. She went to an Ivy League school, has two caring parents, has never had to struggle financially, etc. We couldn’t be more different on paper but more similar personality wise. It seems as if though she sort of romanticizes my upbringing a bit. She’s always liked hearing me talk about my childhood though it is sometimes painful to do so and admits that she ‘didn’t have a very eventful or ‘exciting’ upbringing.’ She constantly refers to them as ‘my stories’ rather than my life, it almost feels like she’s hearing me talk about someone that’s not me. I’ve been upfront at her request about all of the pain (both physical and mental) that I’ve endured and exacted and I admittedly am no angel. I tried to brush this off until earlier this week.She’s a fairly nostalgic person and keeps a journal that I accidentally stumbled upon and then purposely and regrettably went through. In it I found a few accounts of friends and people she’s dated and she describes them like they’re characters in a story and not real people. I found things about myself that characterize me as a sort of ‘bad boy with a heart of gold’ or a likable antihero. Accomplishments are sort of congratulated along the lines of ‘look how far you’ve come despite ___.’ I feel like my pain is currency to people who have never experienced it.I felt embarrassed but didn’t say anything until we had an admittedly petty argument yesterday. In the middle of this she said something in reference to my history and I blurted out that she was no longer a ‘tourist in my pain.’ That my life is not a story and I was hurt that she seemed to paint me in this light of a ‘poor boy who got it together.’ I didn’t tell her about the journal but she responded by blurting out ‘at least I’m not pretending to be something I’m not.’ I left and we haven’t talked since.I know ITA for violating her privacy, but AITA for how I feel about what I learned or what I said?

DrRobotniksMachine [info] When I was diagnosed with bpd I didn't think much of it because I didn't really know much about it. When I was diagnosed with bipolar I was devestated because that's what my abuser had. Through both of these diagnoses they tried to discuss a trauma diagnosis as well which I was not ready for. Then a few years later bipolar was scrapped and replaced with cptsd, which I feel satisfied with. I think people seek a diagnosis to validate their experiences but I think sometimes it can be detrimental. It's easy to read a pattern of behaviour on the Internet and adopt it as your own if you are impressionable. For example I self harmed a lot more after my bpd diagnosis because I realised it was an accepted action for people with bpd. [info] None [info] 1557356885
ShinyNewAndroid [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar last month.  It's super irritating to hear people call any sort of change in mood being bipolar.

Dorothyzbornaklewks [info] I’ll bite. Not a doctor, but I was diagnosed with bipolar/hypomania by 2 psychologists.

hfuga [info] Oh, I have never in my whole life not felt like I was depressed. I can 'forget' about it sometimes (in moments, not lengthy periods of time), but I am always depressed. My 'manic' episodes just seem to change the way that I handle it, if that makes sense. That might be what a lot of people call 'mixed episodes'. It's not really an end-all-be-all when it comes to symptoms. Some people describe things on this subreddit that I've never felt either, but that doesn't mean that I don't have bipolar. I've been diagnosed with bipolar II. If you haven't, look up the differences between type 1 and 2 and you might resonate more with that &lt;3 [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1557417649
dobutamine44 [info] I’m in my 4th year of med school and I was diagnosed with bipolar during my second year and I’ve had to take time off multiple times. Med school and residency is possible with a major mental illness, but it is very difficult and you get into so much debt without knowing if you’ll ever be able to pay it off. So I think if you could be happy and furfilled doing something other than an MD then you should do that. Also the training to be an NP is so much more flexible and less competitive than MD that is very important when you are chronically ill. [info] None [info] 1557536670
Mrs_ChanandlerBong_ [info] Went through the exact same thing. I failed a semester and was a hot mess and my parents had no clue. Telling my mom on the phone was the hardest conversation ever. I showed signs of mental illness as a teen but my parents were in denial. This was a confirmation of their worst fears. And I was so ashamed for failing. And I felt weak and lacking for not being strong enough to overcome what was going on in my brain.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, got on a treatment plan, and got back on track. My parents ended up being more proud than ever that I managed to graduate on time, despite the challenges. [info] None [info] 1557545216
jessdudzlmt [info] I am sorry for your predicament. Like many others I experienced a similar scenario. My mom found out I was suicidal and refused to do anything about it. When I was an adult I was diagnosed with bipolar. I told my parents and they told me that it's not a real thing. They have always been dismissive of my mental health. My husband on the other hand has always been supportive, from the very moment he realized that something was wrong. I still struggle with my parents, but I have a new support system.I'm guessing you are under 18 and therefore you can not seek your own help. I hope you can find a friend or a teacher that you can trust to help you through these tough times. [info] None [info] 1557588461
b-ray9969 [info] I am in a very similar situation myself. I live with my parents and they pay for my college as well.About a year ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I can relate to mental health interfering with schoolwork. You should definitely speak with a counselor about mental health resources that the school offers. My diagnosis gives me access to the schools Disability Department which gives me priority registration, and other amenities to accommodate my disorder like extra testing time, ability to test in a private room, deadline extensions etc.As well, if you talk to your teachers and explain your situation, they are usually really understanding and may give you an Incomplete for the class, which allows you to finish the class the next semester with no penalty to your transcript.I am on academic probation myself. My school has academic probation 1, 2, and then the third semester you are “suspended” from the school for a semester. If after you are readmitted, and don’t bring your gpa up, you are then banned for 5 years from the college. So if your school is like mine, you have a couple more semesters to fix your gpa.Take care of yourself and do what you need to take control of your mental health. YOU and YOUR needs should take priority in your life.Good luck. Everything will work out with time. [info] None [info] 1557714417
BadlyDrawnGrrl [info] &gt;Dude. I am bipolar. One of the symptoms of mania and even hypomania are that you end up extremely impulsive. When I'm like this, I have my wife confiscate my money and cards. Hence: he withdrew money on impulse, then impulsively spent it....Okay I'm not sure how you're not seeing the *vast leap of logic* you're executing here.I have also been diagnosed with bipolar II at different points in my life; I was on Lamictal and Seroquel for years. I am familiar with the condition both from a first-person and an academic perspective. We're not arguing whether impulsivity and compulsive spending etc. are symptoms of hypomania in general. That is a known fact which is not up for debate, and suggesting otherwise is a strawman.*That* is a looooooong way from "hence: he withdrew money on impulse." "Hence" how?? Like, just because this is theoretically possible does not mean there is any evidence to suggest this is what literally happened! It seems like you're conflating what's feasible and what *really took place*. Of course he *could* have spent or given away the money, but how do you come to that conclusion with such certainty in the absence of any evidence that demonstrates where that money actually went?&gt;My evidence? My own fucking experiences.Oh my God that is the absolute worst basis for a hypothesis, anecdotes are not evidence. This is super, super basic Scientific Method 101. I can't even tell if you're serious, how do your life experiences shed any *verifiable* light on what Innes did with that money 13 years ago? If we can't know one way or the other, how are you able to make this statement of fact?&gt;Now how about instead of going on some stupid moral crusade...Oh for fuck's sake lol.&gt;you assume that someone citing something specific like the money (and then doing the bare minimum of Googling symptoms of bipolar, which would show you that impulsive spending is a common as all fuck symptom) knows what the hell they're talking about.As I mentioned, I have been diagnosed with bipolar myself. I also have a degree in psychology, which I noted elsewhere, and I concentrated in abnormal psych. Part of my putative "stupid moral crusade" involves making it clear that every suspicious death warrants a thorough and openminded investigation, *regardless of one's psychiatric history*. They should not be automatically "written off" as a suicide on the basis of a diagnosis (for that matter, Innes didn't even have a dx). People with bipolar and schizophrenia can and frequently do become victims of violent crime.&gt;If I ended up dead like this, it's likely because I was fucking having a manic break and I probably did commit suicide.*But we aren't discussing your life we are discussing Innes' life*.&gt;Nothing seems to suggest there was necessarily a homicide, so fuck off. You absolutely are suggesting we're callous for calling this like those of us who are bipolar see it."Those of us" presumably includes me then.&gt;You're damn lucky I'm one of those people who doesn't mind talking about their experiences with this, because plenty would not answer.Wow.

Fridaythe13thCh [info] I’m in sort of a similar situation. My parents never accepted anything that was out of the norm with me, I was diagnosed with bipolar at 15 but I was showing signs since 12. My parents ignored the fee psychologists that said I was depressed and what not. Then when I was 15 I knew I was gay but hid it bc of how my parents acted with me being bipolar. At 18 I get a girlfriend and we are dating for almost 4 months (at the time) so I tell my parents (bc I met her parents and I felt that she should meet mine), At first they seemed supportive, but as time went on homophobic jokes didn’t stop and I got outed to several homophobic family members who I wasn’t going to tell. It sucks to have this negativity and lack of support, but if you are able to move out do so. Find your own family full of supportive friends and you will be happier. [info] None [info] 1557839900

ginamoe167 [info] People like this never used to  other me, until I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. A lot of the time when I tell somebody about my bipolar disorder they say something along the lines of "I think i have that too, my moods are so up and down."No. Just fucking no. That's called being a human.Bipolar disorder does not mean you're moody, it doesn't mean that some times you're sad, and some times you're happy.I some times don't know what is real and what's not. I can go from so happy I try to kill myself to so depressed that I want to die more than anything in the world. I will intentionally cut people out of my life, for ridiculous reasons like they got a cat even though im allergic to cats.  I will tell my husband I want a divorce when honestly I just dont really want to spend time with him in the moment. I will see how much money we have for bills say yeah im going to pay them, and then just not pay them, instead go on shopping sprees, all the while knowing I wasn't supposed to spend that money but not giving a shit about the consequences. I have ended relationships because I got frustrated over something that had literally nothing to do with the other person. I will just not show up for work. I have gone through more jobs than I care to admit. I will go days without sleeping, and then weeks doing nothing but staying in bed. I struggle daily, even with medication, not knowing what thoughts are mine, and what thoughts are my mental disorder's. No, you don't have bipolar disorder because you have human emotions.

Weissach [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I have my master's and have been working in that field for roughly 4 years now. Historically I did the 2 years at one place thing (since undergrad), but it was mostly because better opportunities presented themselves. I have been working for the government for a little over 2 years but in different positions (recent change). I've gotten lucky and have had really understanding/supportive coworkers and supervisors, so the BP hasn't really been an issue (i.e. never fired for disciplined). I do find myself getting bored, though. Regardless, don't let you BP deter you from doing something you love. I've had good luck with being open about my illness at work, which has made the bad times much easier to deal with since my supervisors knew it wasn't "me". If you made it through a master's program, then you can handle a job =] Also, talk to your therapist (if you don't have one, I highly recommend seeking one). [info] None [info] 1558310342

e_plain_simple [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2 some time ago, and now my psychiatrist said that I got some BPD traits. I didn't see me as BPD until I started to learn about it (had the stigmatized outburst view before). Now I think that I can be between the self-destructive and impulsive sub-types. It's weird because I can relate more or less with each sub-type depending on my current mood episode.  If I'm depressive, I behave more like the self-destructive type, if I'm hypomanic or "baseline," I act more like the impulsive type.  It was very enlightening to me because I got some self-destructive behavior even when I'm hypomanic and feeling on the top of the world. I don't know if it is comorbidity or a characteristic of one of this two illness alone. Hope to find out soon. [info] None [info] 1558378307
elhopem [info] Bipolar runs in my family. Genetically. If it is in your gene line, you’re more susceptible to getting it, but psychologists have found that kids who have genetic based bipolar are less likely to get it if they have a supporting and stable life. However you are almost guaranteed bipolar if you grow up with abuse and neglect of any kind. At least that’s what happened to me. Ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 I have done extensive research and tried to gather information because it’s such a tricky and intricate mind malfunction that is complicated to understand.

jessicadiamonds [info] I think INFO is the only way to actually respond to this. She has told you she does not feel "love" for people. But perhaps that is just the perception of what neuro-typical people act like love is. Maybe she doesn't even understand it? Her brain doesn't work the same way as the larger population of people, but that doesn't mean that there isn't any kind of feeling at all towards others, otherwise I'm not sure you would have a relationship with her in any meaningful way. I mean, love isn't a specific thing. We as a society act like it must be this very specific thing, but what is that? I believe it is different to each person. The fact that her boyfriend loves her and wants to marry her tells me that they at least on paper have a good relationship. Do you believe that she has manipulated her way into this for the purpose of some sort of gain, like wealth, status or security? Sociopathy is not actually a medical term, and ASPD focuses mainly on behaviors rather than specific traits, or psychopathic traits. It doesn't sound like she behaves in the same way that she did when she was diagnosed, am I hearing that correctly? &gt; DSM criteria include a disregard for and violation of others' rights since age 15, as indicated by seven possible features: failure to obey laws and norms by engaging in behavior which results in [criminal](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/punishment) arrest, or would warrant criminal arrest; lying, [deception](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception), and manipulation, for profit or self-amusement; impulsive behavior; irritability and [aggression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger), manifested as frequently assaulting others, or engaging in fighting; blatant disregard of safety of self and others; a pattern of irresponsibility; and lack of remorse for actions. \*This is from [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-is-2020/201812/difference-between-the-psychopath-and-so-called-sociopath) about the difference between ASPD and psychopathic traits, for others who are reading this. I think it's much more complicated than anyone here can say. I definitely do not believe that a DSM diagnosis is something that anyone else should disclose other than the person with the diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder, which I am open about, but I would not want other people telling my own diagnosis, especially since I have sought to manage my behavior, which it sounds like she is doing.&amp;#x200B;Lastly, does it matter if her love is real or if she is just going through the motion of it for her own happiness? I'm not so sure. If she is happy and he is happy, why does it matter? [info] None [info] 1558496287

worstgurl [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and insomnia a couple years ago and (minus the ADHD medication and add in some antipsychotics), the amount you’re taking is similar to the amount I was taking, save some of the dosages.

jellyresult [info] It depends who you’re telling. In certain situations, like you’re an easily replaceable low level employee with an at will employment contract, probably not a good idea to tell them. There’s always a possibility that your boss may not be as understanding as you think, and try to find little things to fire you over, or make you quit. I worked front desk at a hotel once, and after a little while my manager and the group, who were super tight knit friends, wanted to know more about me. Eventually I spill the beans that I deal with mental illness (at the time I was diagnosed with bipolar, which ended up being an incorrect diagnosis). It seemed to go over fine, everyone seemed cool about it. Then the next week I’m in the ER at 3 am for severe and sudden cramps, and text my manager that I won’t be able to make it to my 7 am shift. She texts me at 7 am that I’m fired, “this isn’t going to work out”, etc, and to pick up my final paycheck with HR. And because I live in Florida, my employment contract was at-will, meaning they or I could terminate employment for any reason at any time. If I hadn’t told anyone about my mental illness, I would not have been fired for missing one single shift with evidence from the hospital that I was in the ER. A friend of mine recently was hospitalized for 72 hours in the psych unit. He mistakenly told his boss he was in the psych unit- instantly fired as soon as “psych unit” was spoken. But had he been, idk, in a car accident, he would not have gotten fired, as that’s exactly what happened to a coworker, and he kept his job. Moral of the story: you don’t need to tell anyone except your closest people, and especially don’t tell an employer, unless it is 100000% necessary, because many people will try to screw you over.

frankenshay [info] First, there are two things you need to know about my family. One, mental illness runs rampant in both sides and two, they are very avid believers in ghosts and the paranormal. I live in a Southern state and my dad's side of the family are certifiable rednecks so even though mental illness is so prominent, no one ever talked to me about it growing up.Through my teenage years, I'd constantly hear ghost stories about my grandma's house: my cousins, aunts and uncles saying that they'd seen/heard things when they'd stay there, objects moving, etc and when you grow up hearing that sort of thing all the time, you start to believe it. I'd seen/heard things too but not only in my grandparents' house; I'd hear them in mine, too.It wasn't until my mom and I moved out of a traumatic situation and in with my distant cousins around two years ago that my cousin suggested I see a therapist, if only to work through some of the things that had happened. My therapist had been asking me about my moods, the situation I'd been in, etc and a few sessions in, she asked me if I'd ever seen or heard things that no one else had.

840InHalf [info] No you're correct, in a way. I'm not diagnosed with OCD, I'm diagnosed with bipolar, cptsd and my doctor says I have obsessive compulsive tendencies but I don't fully meet the criteria for OCD. I used to have more ritualistic behaviors but I've come a really really long way. My biggest ones now are my bedtime routine and cleaning. My doctor believes that the cleaning and the bed are actually more caused by my cptsd. Exposure therapy is hard because it was sexual assault that triggered it. He thinks the cleaning has become more of a coping mechanism but it is borderline obsessive. We habe a middle ground of how many chores I'm allowed to do or how long I can dedicate focusing on it.The bed thing we are working on, but on nights when I'm losing too much sleep because of it and it's absolutely not working, we fix the bed because the sleep depravation worsens my symptoms. But we have other exercises, like if I choose to take a nap outside of my normal sleep schedule, I cannot fix the bed as I usually would.To be completely honest with you, we're all just thankful for me getting as far as I have.

SleepDreamRepeat [info] As someone who has type 1 diabetes and manic depressive disorder I can say that the stigma for both are so damn high. I always get the comments of "You can't be diabetic you're skinny!" Most people believe what ever the movies or media tells them. When I was diagnosed with diabetes all my friends and family were there to support me and help me. When I was diagnosed with bipolar no one came to support me through it. In fact most stopped associating with me entirely because I was labeled "Crazy" or whatever. Even after being stable for years I can't escape that stigma. When someone you know is suffering from a mental illness please don't let that illness define them. [info] None [info] 1558623791
pgirl30 [info] There are too many negative stories about people struggling with mental illness and while it's good to make people understand the struggles, it's also important to share the positive stories of people surviving with mental illness. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 with psychotic features when I was 22 and it took a while to recover, but now I'm 41 with very few symptoms after finding the right medication and living a very fulfilling and productive life. It's possible to overcome the pitfalls of mental illness with the right medication and healthy living, and most importantly to stay off drugs. [info] None [info] 1558625751

"Hazel this is why nobody likes you because you're so dramatic." And now, years later, they know I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Their new favorite lines? "Hazel nobody likes the dramatic bipolar little b**** you are. Are you off your meds again??" The most ironic thing about it? They send me book long text messages explaining how "dramatic" I am, failing to realize that they're projecting themselves onto me.

Anyone who thinks that you are is ignorant. All people are difficult to deal with sometimes, and you shouldn’t have to feel this way purely because you have a diagnosis. People need to learn how to interact with each other better. Thought I do not know your personal struggle, I often get brushed off when showing any emotion because I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and get the occasional “you’re pretty high functioning for someone who’s bipolar”.

Bowserette [info] Unfortunate that it’s the same policy as for pilots. I earned my PPL at age 19. Later that year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on medication. I’ll never be able to fly again and that kills me. It was the best experience of my life, and I was looking forward to making it a career. The FAA is slowly starting to accept a couple antidepressants, but certain conditions are permanent disqualification. That also means pilots often self medicate with alcohol to cope. I’d rather have a stable pilot on medication than one who pushes the “8 hours from bottle to throttle” guidelines. [info] None [info] 1558719065

gigababejfl [info] &gt;I don't like putting my personal life or business out there because there are way too many people with bad intentions online, especially the incels that lurk this sub but I have been diagnosed with bipolar II, GAD, PTSD, and OCD. I've been getting help for them but I'm not okay and I've yet to have anyone aside from my family wants to put up with all that. I'm "old" so I've been on a few dates in my life but nothing's lasted. I've had one boyfriend in my life and he emotionally abused and raped me. I don't know if because of a little sexual experience with less than a handful of men I'm no longer considered mentalcel.You are not required to put your personal health info out there.. that would be asinine, but we are not clairvoyant and one of the important functions of this sub is its service to its members. The onset of your comments focused on surface level things that were entirely dismissive and you only identified yourself as someone who has the opportunity to pick and choose men. Nothing wrong with it but this isnt the platform for such a woman.  To have all these issues, not present some framework, and now take things personally as if I k know you is very unrealistic. &gt;But you've deemed me as not really being mentally ill or meeting the criteria of being mentally incelibate and have changed my flair to "normie". Someone else has just told me I don't belong here and they don't understand mentalcel, that we're just "failed normies" which is not something people with mental disorders need to hear. No matter how normal I try to be I already know that I'm a defective human because of my DNA and brain and I'll never truly fit in which is why I had connected with this sub. But I see that I'm not welcome here. We are not equipped to treat mental disorders.  We also do not know you. To be welcome you need to present with more than blue pilled ideology with no relatable framework to speak off. As it stands, this sub is about to undergo a culling because r/trufemcels was never designed to tackle all the ills of female kind. Just the ills of femcels.

mercyphoenix [info] When I was around 8 or so, I always felt these random urges to cry. Nothing had to happen for the urge to come up. I remember bawling my eyes out one time at dinner for no reason, and my parents seemed super frustrated that I wasn’t able to tell them why. I believed they were my ‘baby instincts;’ my line of logic behind this was that sometimes babies just cry randomly, even when they’re not hungry or tired or in need of a diaper change, and since I was still young, maybe I didn’t grow out of them yet.

KittyCatTroll [info] Holy shit. Thank you so much for giving me a name for this.

JD515515 [info] &amp;#x200B;I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1. I have also been hypo manic in the past few months because I went off my medication. The best thing you can do for yourself is to take your mental health into your own hands. I started cleaning up my life slowly. This started with me identifying my behaviors that were not healthy for me. 1. Do you have healthy people in your life? How do you feel when you're around these people? If you feel bad when you're hanging out with them. Perhaps they should not be in your life.2. Do you exercise regularly?  You don't have to attend a gym, but literally 30 minutes of exercise a day will help you feel a lot better.3. Drink water regularly4. Eat fruits and vegetables. It seriously helps. 5. Are you on any medication? I know western medicine is not for everyone, but it can help tremendously once you find the right medication. 6. If you want to go on medication, go to your GP and ask for a referral to a psychiatrist. 7. Find a hobby. This can be a great thing to do because it provides motivation when you're depressed and it's an outlet for when you're manic.8. Journal or try cognitive behavioral therapy. Go to [www.moodgym.com](https://www.moodgym.com). It costs $40/annually but it's a very helpful resource to help combat negative thinking. 9. Practice gratitude and self-love. Take care of yourself and love yourself. In any way that you can. Take baths, watch your favorite shows, talk to a friend, journal. Do what makes you happy.10. Do you like your job in the first place? If not, perhaps it's time for a change of occupation!Take care of yourself. It's cliche to say but even the fact that you posted on this subreddit is a step in the right direction. You are not responsible for your mental illness. It's not you fault that it happened. Take everything one day at a time and I promise you it will get better &lt;3 [info] None [info] 1559101951
gr8dane95 [info] All Might from My Hero Academia.(Sorry for the long post and formatting, I'm on mobile)(And kinda drunk)When I first started watching the show I saw him and was like "ugh, just another perfect, overpowered character to satisfy the weaboos". But when I saw what he really was, I fell in love with the show. The exact moment I saw him in his "skeleton" form, I realized that he's exactly what I strive to be.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14. It was rough, and it still is, but I'm doing my best to work with it. There are days where I feel weak and unable to do anything at all, and there are also days where I feel like a goddamn superhero. That's honestly just the duality of being bipolar, and I came to accept that after a long time of living through it. There will be ups and downs, probably ones that are more extreme than the average person, but hey... That's just the hand I've been dealt. Then I watched MHA. In the first episode or two it introduces All Might as this unbeatable monster of a hero (in the best way). Villians can't beat him, superheroes can't top him, and everyone around adores him. LAMEEEEEE. Sounded like a knock off Superman to me honestly.But then I saw his "skeleton" form..I had never related to a character more. He was so weak. So frail. So broken. He wasn't always that symbol of peace everyone thought he was. Hell, the majority of the time he was weak and unable to do anything at all, but regardless of the odds, he still fought with strength and a smile so that others were encouraged to stand alongside him.I'd like to think that's the kind of person I am.My illness does hold me back. I'm fully aware of that. I can never be a happy, fulfilling adult. But I'll be damned if I don't give 110% and use that 110% to inspire people to fight even harder. That's what All Might did. Kinda.

LadySerenity [info] In my freshman year of college, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and panic disorder. I immediately began the arduous process of trying different medications before finding the right one. Unfortunately, unless your side effects are really severe, you have to wait at least 3 months before you know for sure if the medication is a good fit. During the spring semester, I tried a new antidepressant. The stuff made me a fucking zombie. When I walked to class, it felt like my feet were cinderblocks and I had trouble starting awake in my classes. I was also constantly nauseous. Towards the end of the semester, my pre-Calc professor called me out in front of the entire class for how arrogant I was to skip the homework and try to take the exams anyway. He used me as an example of what not to do. I had a talk with him privately and mentioned that the Dean of Students was aware of my situation. He was mortified and publicly apologized the next day in class. I ultimately passed the class with a C, but damn did I want to drop his class.I took the next semester off and got myself sorted out. Once stable, I took Calculus and got an A. Even so, I still cringe when I remember that day in class. [info] None [info] 1559130682

PintsizedPachyderm [info] I had a psychotic episode back in 2014-2015. I had been hearing vague voices for 6 months, but thought there was a very quiet broken radio in my house/car/office (and eventually became positive there were people living in my house) and didn't realise I was hallucinating until I started hearing them right next to my ear.&amp;#x200B;The scariest night was when I went to shower and hallucinated that my entire body was covered with spiders. I ran to my room, where I then saw a strange, dark and very tall figure (picture one of the Queen's guards, but all black) in the corner of the room leaning over the bed and 2 voices just behind me scream-growled "It's coming!". I was diagnosed with bipolar 5 months later, although no future hallucinations were quite so bad.  I understand it was a hallucination, and can rationalise it all now, but I still get shivers at the memory and can still picture/hear it in my head clearly. [info] None [info] 1559235024
inkedandnerdy [info] Okay. So I'm going to tell a little bit of my story here to answer this. I was first diagnosed four years ago. I have been diagnosed with bipolar, BPD, GAD, and PTSD. All after severe trauma. I went to see a therapist for the first time when I decided I wanted to end an abusive relationship I was in and did not know how to and I needed strength and I knew it had messed me up. My first therapist told me one of the times I got raped didn't count because I was drunk. I walked out and then went back two weeks later. I fought. I found a therapist that worked for me. I got on an anti-depressant. My brain only wants to kill itself when I am lost in my trauma or I decide I'm worthless (also rooted in trauma.) Yes, I think my healthy brain never wants to kill itself. If suicide was natural and healthy-thinking, I don't see how the human race could be where it is today. Every mammal is built for survival. We fight to survive. That's life. And it's hard and it sucks. But I truly believe whatever you have going on, it gets better if you're willing to give it a chance and fight for yourself.

momscakeday [info] Hey, I read it. That is indeed a really stressful chain of events that would set anybody off who might have depressive or bipolar tendencies. So don't be too hard on yourself if you can help it.I was diagnosed with bipolar II eh maybe 5 years ago now, though I was a bit suspicious before that, and I've had serious depressive issues since puberty (which was a long time ago now, sigh). The couple ideas I would offer based on my own experience are:* Absolutely, totally, 1000%, getting sleep regulated is Step 0 of any management of bipolar. For nearly everyone with bipolar, it is critical in order to stay stable. Most of us tend to have lifelong sleep weirdness of one kind or another - me for example, I'm an extreme night owl if left completely to my own devices. And I prefer the night. But it turns out it's f#$%ing terrible for me to be nocturnal. I am absolutely thoroughly convinced that getting my sleep under control (with a regimen of daytime light exposure and evening microdose melatonin) was fundamental to my recovery, and I worked to learn my limits as far as variance, etc, so I can keep it regulated now. Because the surest way to a "mood excursion" is messed up sleep.* It would be good to find a good therapist and hopefully also a support group or something like that as well (e.g. DBSA, NAMI, or even something like a Stitch N Bitch, a faith group, sports/exercise group, etc). Meds alone really don't cut it for a lot of bipolar people, and often bipolar can be complex enough that it takes a while to find the right meds even so. It can really help to have a good therapist. My rule of thumb (can you tell I've been thru this grind MANY times yet?) is that if you don't click well by the end of the 3rd session, find somebody else. Which I know is a HUGE pain and a challenge. But it's really worth it to have a therapist you actually relate well with, vs one that's merely okay.* Finally, if at all possible, and despite it probably seeming like the last thing you want to do, it might also be good to directly ask your parents to increase their involvement on "the little things" in terms of you living at home. This may well not be appropriate for you, but I've found that living with people who are naturally chatty and will say things - without nagging! but just making a note of it - like "oh I haven't seen you at breakfast for a couple days, are you sleeping okay?" or making sure you're aware of when meals are happening and that they'd like you around, without judgement if you do need a day or two off.... this is SUPER helpful to keeping me engaged in the household, which in turn regulates my mood and keeps me moving forward better. This can feel awkward at first but to me it's so helpful. I feel like it's sort of like a cobbled together version of IPSRT, which is a therapy for bipolar (which I haven't yet tried) that focuses on keeping us stable by keeping us integrated with other people. Isolation is very very damaging for many of us, and that absolutely includes me, even though I have reclusive tendencies and often really do need to withdraw! It can be a fuzzy line. As long as you're aware and are trying to find yours, that's what matters :)Good luck, I really hope things start looking a bit better for you soon, and just a side note I'm sorry to hear about the girl. That would have crushed me as well. I find personally that I tend to come on real strong once somebody gets "in" enough that I'm willing to open up to them, and I've scared more than one good person off this way. Kinda comes with the territory sometimes. But there really, really, really are more fish in the sea, eventually one will swim your way, and hopefully it will be one who is a little more adept at handling sensitive people. Hoping for the best for you! [info] None [info] 1559256522

ketofummy [info] The message bot said "Just Started" posts should go here...**Restarting Keto for Physical and Mental Health**Hello, everyone! I'm glad to be rejoining the community, and this time not as a lurker.I  first started eating ketogenically in 2018 after a co-worker  recommended it for boosting energy and managing stress symptoms. We  worked in a professional field know for burnout and high turnover due to  stress and long hours. For me, keto certainly did help for the five  months I maintained it. The changes in how I felt were so significant, I  was able to go off my antidepressant medication. I also appreciated the  weight loss, though that wasn't the main reason for me then.Unfortunately,  I went back to a carb-based diet. Of course, I gained the weight back  and then some. I also lost the general benefits of increased energy and  mental clarity.Then a series of  traumatic life events triggered the most severe mental health crisis of  my life last November. I attempted suicide twice. I was hospitalized in  mental facilities four times. I was diagnosed with bipolar II, panic  disorder, major depressive disorder, and PTSD. It has taken months of  trial and error for my psychiatrist to find the correct medications and  dosages. I had to go on a medical leave of absence in November, and then  again in February, and I have yet to return to work and will be  transferred to a less stressful work environment when I do.In  the meantime, I have been fairly isolated at home, not eating some days  and eating mostly crap the rest of the time. Weeks have gone by where I  have not left the house, sometimes spending all day in bed. I am the  heaviest weight I have ever been and so incredibly uncomfortable in my  body. Even though I have been overweight or obese since my teen years, I  have never been so frustrated with how I look and how I feel as I am  now. I need to lose about 170 pounds. As my mental health has been slowly improving, I knew that one of  the changes I wanted to make, as soon as I could manage it, was to return to keto.Today is that day. I look  forward to actively sharing this journey with you all, and I hope that I  can contribute at least half as much encouragement as I have received  here in the past as a lurker. KCKO!

ashalisig17 [info] I've actually been wanting to get this off of my chest. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (annoying ass mood swings) nearly a year ago, and I'm on a medication that has stabilized my mood swings. My psychiatrist told my parents that it explains why I would sometimes be unnecessarily irritable, and it made a lot of sense. My mom has taken this is as "every time she's mad, it's just the crazy talking". I don't remember why, but a month or so ago we had started arguing about something on our way home, and my sister (who was in the car with us, but didn't know what happened) asked my mom why I was angry. My mom responded with "it's just that time of the month" and did that hand gesture of twirling her finger next to her head implying that I was crazy. Maybe this isn't a huge deal but it really hurt my feelings that my mom doesn't take my feelings seriously just because I have a mental disorder. She's "apologized" but I know there wasn't any meaning behind it, my mom never thinks she's at fault for anything. I say "apologized" since she only said sorry because my dad told her she should, she didn't actually care. [info] None [info] 1559416215

relephants [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was in high school. I knew something was wrong with me then but never could put a finger on it. My brain would tingle and go numb. I was very impulsive, then very sad. I was put on medication and it helped, but made me feel like I was in a cage so I stopped taking it. Since then (15+ years), I've been unmedicated and every day is a fight. Its difficult to explain. My good brain is in a never ending sword fight with my bad brain to remain balanced. Deep down I know it's a slow, losing battle, but so far I have been okay. I can't keep this fight going forever though. It's too tiring. I will either have to go back on medication or die fighting.

I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 and have spent the last year trying recommended none stimulant meds that pysche has suggested but nothing is helping the ADHD symptoms.

Marlinspikesailor [info] This is the nightmare of the so-very-common bipolar misdiagnosis. Psychiatric ignorance about ADHD is destroying lives.I was diagnosed with bipolar by lazy, ego-driven psychiatrists with a programmed desire to medicate every symptom possible (drilled into them in their studies... the university studies these protocols and interventions are derived from are largely funded by?...  yup, you guessed it.) I immediately sealed the recorded that proved their incompetence so they couldn’t harm me further. (Just try to get a psych to overturn another’s diagnosis). Thank goodness I already knew I had ADHD (I owe a lot to this sub for that), as you know all to well, the drugs they throw at bipolar literally block the very neurotransmitters we are so desperately lacking in our frontal lobes. I don’t know how many untold thousands of victims this misdiagnosis has claimed. I’m so happy you escaped it, OC. I also know these conditions can be co-morbid. I have no idea WTF you are supposed to do then. [info] ADHD-C [info] 1559787581

upunkrockbeezy [info] When I read your edit outlining your diagnoses I did a double take because I literally have every SINGLE thing that you listed, down to the #2 after bipolar...The ADHD label was slapped on in high school, two years later I developed PTSD after almost being murdered by my boyfriend, which was shadowed by panic disorder... then I spent the 10ish years that followed thinking I was just more fucked up than your average ADHD girl as a result of one too many head injuries. But last year after impulsively taking off to Reno with my $15,000 work bonus and spending (gambling) it in a matter of two days only to come back home and just quit my dream job for literally no other reason than it felt right, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and evolved into my final form: a shell of my former self, which actually works out because that leaves plenty of room within said shell to house my multitude of mental problems while still leaving plenty of room for all of the guilt, shame and self doubt that comes along with them.I am quite pleased to have finally encountered someone else like me, and I'm also really sorry that you can probably relate to a lot of the things that I've described. One thing that I will say though is that my being crazy af has resulted in me somehow raising two of the most sympathetic, patient and kind kids I could ever have asked for, with that perfect sprinkling of the greatest sense of humor that only comes from being raised in a shitstorm of dysfunction.

Elriuhilu [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I know what it's like to be actually depressed. I've been in situations where I thought about jumping off a building or something and I can tell you one thing, I never discussed it with anyone until after I decided not to do it. If I did kill myself, I would do it privately somewhere that people wouldn't watch or try and stop me. People who announce how depressed they are for pity points annoy the hell out of me because they're behaving like a life ruining illness is trendy. So, with that said, I agree with Chaim Witz there to a point, that people who make a great big show of killing themselves and make sure everyone knows about it are probably doing it for attention. That's not to say that they don't have issues, but they should talk to someone instead of preemptively traumatising their friends and family with something they might not even be committed to.

quesojacksoncat [info] I used to work as a behavioral counsellor for a residential treatment home for developmentally and physically disabled adults.  We took the ones who had been kicked out of other homes because their behaviors were too violent, extreme and disturbing for those homes. I quickly learned that as the staff we were expected to risk our lives and wellbeing for these clients with zero back up from management in regards to our safety &amp; well-being.Here's a few examples:&amp;#x200B;My main client, a 28 year old woman with violent tendencies towards herself and others (she's put people in the hospital and has nearly lost several limbs and a breast because her self-harm is so severe... she's used an uncooked piece of rice on her skin hard enough to open a vein and don't even get me started with what she can do with a plastic button.. She managed slit her throat quite deep with a broken button once). Anyhow, I worked with this woman in her small apartment along with one other staff member around for support if needed. I'm a 120lb female and while I was confident in my ability to restrain her if needed, she could easily get the upper hand if I was caught off guard and do some serious damage. It wouldn't be the first time. This client developed an obsession with scarring my face and wrote me notes that she wanted to pour boiling kettle water on me while I made her tea sometimes.  She expressed a desire to push me into the oven while I was cooking for her and also said she would grab the wheel while I was driving the company vehicle and make us crash off a bridge.   I no longer felt comfortable cooking foods like pasta or making her tea in the tiny apartment after we had a few close calls and she almost burned me with boiling water.  I brought this to the clinician who makes up her program and he told me I had to continue cooking there (there was an upstairs kitchen for other clients I proposed using) because if I cooked elsewhere it would destroy my clients sense of normalcy.&amp;#x200B;I began asking my client to sit in the very back of the van when I had to drive her places because I feared she would grab the wheel or attack me while I drove (she always sat in the passenger seat before she started up with these threats) and she retaliated by punching the mirror off my personal vehicle which was parked in the same driveway.  Again the company refused to compensate me for the damage to my car and seemed unconcerned by the danger I was in.  Eventually, my mental health got to a point where I was anxious constantly.  I transferred to a different place within the company, hoping that since it was a "Day Program" with a lot of clients and staff doing activities together I would have more support.  This was not the case.  Now, I was expected to take up to 5 clients in a van into the community, all of which had the tendency to run away and become violent in the van or at the outing location.  At the main office, one of the clients beat a staff member with a fire extinguisher and she suffered permanent damage because there wasn't enough staff to keep her safe or stop the attack once it started.&amp;#x200B;At this time, I started to realize I was going to get badly hurt or have someone hurt under my care, both of which would effectively end my career. Addressing my safety concerns  with management only led me to retaliation from my supervisors and being slightly ridiculed.  This entire time, I had a psychiatrist who was truly amazing and even better, his son worked at the same company as me and was experiencing similar issues.  I couldn't believe it, as we live in a capital city and the odds of that are just insane. My psych offered to put me on temporary disability due to my deteriorating mental state but I refused because I believe disability should be a last resort and I wasn't at that point.  During this year and  a half is when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I had some extremely dark times, for sure exacerbated by my work environment.  I had to be on a variety of medications to make it through the days and  I accepted this may be the case for the remainder of my life. One day, a coworker of mine was severely beaten with a rake and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance.  That day I sent in a brief email to my manager stating I was resigning, effective immediately, and would be happy to provide  a doctor's note if they had any questions.  They didn't.&amp;#x200B;After that, I did a few interviews while my boyfriend supported us (not ideal, but we made it).  Within two weeks, I was hired for two jobs in one day.   One was as a waitress for a restaurant and the other was as a health support worker for a health care company.  I waitressed until my job at the health care company began and then began doing that full-time.  That career had it's issues but it supported me for the next 8 months until I found my current job. I now work in an office and the change in my mental state is absolutely incredible.  The lack of stress, financial stability and routine schedule has changed my life.  I've been off all my psychiatric medications for a few months and I've never felt so clear headed.  I  felt so hopeless before.  I look forward to most days at work now.&amp;#x200B;Sorry for the novel, if anyone can relate to switching fields and positive effects on their well-being I'd love to hear.&amp;#x200B;EDIT: spelling/sentence structure [info] None [info] 1560606611

You mention ADHD shares a lot of symptoms with other disorders, which, guess what, a __psychiatrist can make those misdiagnoses too and can easily get you the wrong kind of care too__ I think for quite a few medical issues, yeah, you shouldn't self diagnose because you shouldn't self diagnose, say cancer or something, but self diagnosing mental issues is completely valid.* Not everyone has access to mental health professionals ESPECIALLY poor people and people without insurance and marginalized communities. Some psychiatrists have wait times months out and that doesn't help either*  YOU know yourself better than anyone and you can read posts and say "this is my life constantly" where again, your psych may end up misdiagnosing you* ADHD diagnosis are extremely poor in girls and this often leads to a misdiagnosis for something else* Can I mention being poor and low access to care again?* Even if a psych makes a wrong diagnosis it's important to realize that not everyone can get a second opinion, and it can be years later until they find out something like "oh, turns out, I don't have X, I have Y"Anecdotally, I was diagnosed with bipolar. I knew I didn't have it and refused to take the medicine, and years later, I asked my psych while I was being re-evaluated, and she was like, "yeah, you don't have the mania associated with it, I don't know what she was thinking". Point is, your mental health professional is flawed, they are human, they can/will make mistakes in your care and misdiagnosing is extremely comming, and self diagnosing can be very helpful and can offer up support. Self medicating is a whole 'nother issue tho and I don't recommend that. [info] None [info] 1560608073

victorioushermit [info] I wasn’t diagnosed with anything until about a year ago when I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. Earlier on my psychiatrist said she thought there might be a schizoaffective aspect to my course but she didn’t seem very convinced. Once I was more stabilized, though, it became clear that I was having psychotic symptoms without mood episodes. At the time my diagnosis changed I was honestly relieved. I have several friends with BP1 and none of their illnesses’ courses looked like mine. It scared me, feeling like my illness was so different and the symptoms were so difficult to control. Having a diagnosis that explained the degree of prominence that psychosis plays in my experiences was a relief. It made it something that was understood, rather than a weird and difficult to treat side case. The treatment isn’t all that different, although some aspects of my therapy sessions have changed focus with the diagnosis shift. There’s a stronger attention on treating my psychotic symptoms. Rather than focusing solely on mood-altering triggers my doctor and I examine psychosis inducing triggers as well. We’ve delved a bit into the causes and expressions of my delusions and hallucinations, to help me start better identifying these patterns and to increase my insight when I’m in an episode. A change in my medications that’s made it clear that I had been experiencing a lot of problems with thought disorder, which had been an unexamined symptom up to that point. Now I know to look out for it as a symptom and can use as needed meds to (try to) treat it when it comes up So, I guess I’m saying the change has overall been a good thing. I feel like my treatment has started to better address my needs. I’m still coming to terms with the diagnosis itself. I think this is probably more a matter of societal stigma causing this response than it being inherently justified, but it has a bit of a blow to have a diagnosis for a psychotic disorder [info] bipolar subtype [info] 1560648127

AutoModerator [info] ^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***My mum and I get into a lot of arguments, we don't have a very healthy relationship. A lot of the time she'll turn things back on her and say shit like "you never think about my feelings" and "you never worry about me". I can't really control my emotions, which my mum should know especially since my happiness fluctuates a lot and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. A lot of things I say are in the heat of the moment and I always apologise afterwards if I said something hurtful, which I usually don't because I'm pretty scared of her ngl. The thing is, she never apologises for saying hurtful things to me but I always apologise for doing things wrong. She's said stuff like "you're an embarrassment to this family" and "I'm going to send you somewhere else, I can't deal with this anymore" and yet she never thinks about how her words affect me. The meanest thing I've said to her is "I hate you", which I did end up apologising about. Every time we argue and she shouts at me, I shout back and stand up for myself, to which she responds with "don't you dare raise your voice at me" most of the time. Am I an asshole for shouting at her? I understand that she does a lot for me (feeds me, makes sure I have clean water everyday, etc) but I really just can't control my anger and I'm not just going to stand there and let her shout and swear at me. I get angry about a lot of things and tbh that runs in the family, my whole family gets angry over the smallest of things yet they're all so blind to it. I'm grateful that she doesn't hurt me anymore but I'd really like if she was just calmer about things and actually took into account my feelings*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

elpollodiablox [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 almost 20 years ago. I manage it with cognitive therapy and medication. It's a little personal to me, too. Mentally ill people with a history of suicide ideation have access to a multitude of means for harming themselves. Do we ban them from owning a knife or being able to fill a prescription for sleeping pills, too?I don't own a gun and probably never will, but I'm also loath to use mental illness as a singular reason for denying that to someone. It's getting old using "but mental illness" as the go-to any time something goes wrong. All it does is perpetuate the stigma and turn those who suffer into a pariah. [info] None [info] 1560893622
ErebosGR [info] Araragi mentioned that he went through a depressive period in middle school or earlier in high school IIRC. And he seems hypomanic in most of his encounters with the other female characters (talkativeness, distractibility, restlessness, disinhibition, euphoria, hypersexuality etc.).Senjougahara could have suffered from PTSD because of her sexual assault that subsequently could have triggered her eating disorder, but I didn't see any symptoms of PTSD in the present. What did you see that makes you say that?I'm not saying that all the characters fill all the criteria to be diagnosed properly, it's entertainment after all, but the parallels with almost every character are too many to ignore.Disclaimer: I'm not a psychologist, but I've been diagnosed with bipolar type II and I found Araragi's messiah complex very relatable instantly.

anotherburner33 [info] Posting from a burner for obvious reasons. I'm currently taking a former employer to a tribunal for disability discrimination. My current employer is aware of the case, though I'm still undecided about whether or not to be listed in later proceedings under my real name, as I have been given the option of 'Ms X.' To date, the preliminary hearings have been closed to the public.My contract at one high profile company ended abruptly after I had one sick day. The manager had contacted the company who performed the background check to ask if I suffered from any 'recurring conditions.' I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder several years ago. The next day I returned to work and was asked to resign as 'if you become depressed you'll probably take a lot more time off and that wouldn't work for us.' I complained internally yet the following week my contract ended abruptly with no reason provided.For what it's worth, my sickness record is below average and I take maybe 5 sick days a year, max.While talking about mental illness is generally a positive thing, it completely ignores the fact that certain industries can be overtly hostile to disclosure (I work in finance). Bloggers in artsy jobs do not deal with the same stigma.On saying that, I did buy a domain last autumn with the intention of starting a blog to discuss the financial impact of mental health issues, though I'll need to wait until this legal issue is more resolved. As it stands they want to resolve it out of court, though I'm very conflicted about the ethical aspects of signing a NDA. I've represented myself throughout and have found holding them accountable to be cathartic, while stressful.The person I work for currently knows that I have bipolar and it has not been an issue at all. None of my coworkers know, so it's a bit like leading a double life at times. [info] None [info] 1561159512
CoffeeCrazedMom [info] My thoughts are just my experience.I used to break things and I still have those urges. It's just that my son is very important to me so I'm trying to act right tho I do fail from to time.I think around the time my son was a year old I was thinking I had bpd as well. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and also pmdd. I talked to some friends and they said my current med (lithium) was effective for both bipolar 2 and bpd so it was my choice if I wanted to go in to see a doctor or not.In hind sight I'm thinking maybe it was more hormonal than anything. I went through a bit of PPD and from what I read that can start even after a year post partum. I breast fed for 9 months so that could have had something to do with it too.Or it may have been that I started back up on lithium after breast feeding and weaned off again because I didn't like the weight gain (dumb I know).I haven't broken anything in over a year and my son is 2.5 now.

slithybooks [info] I was sexually and physically abused by a honored priesthood holder.  I was diagnosed with bipolar because of the trauma.  I was suicidal - I thought about gassing myself in the garage.   I had two psychotic incidents and went through ECT several times.  I don't want to compare experiences with people because that is not what our journeys are about, but I believe suicide  is a respectable end to some conditions and situations that get to hard to live with.  I don't mean that we shouldn't try to prevent suicide, I just mean that we shouldn't blame the person who felt like it was the only solution.  My cousin killed himself, but I honor his disease and experience.  He brought love to my life even if his life ended early.Anyway,  I somehow got out.   I WAS LUCKY.  I found medication, had an amazing family, got an amazing psychiatrist and therapist.   I guess I just want to say it is possible to heal.  That love exists.  That there is hope.

I was diagnosed with bipolar II several years ago and had tried so many meds leading up to that point. Lamictal as a mood stabilizer was life changing for me. I know everyone responds differently to different meds, but I still wanted to ask about your list in case there’s anything missing that either of us haven’t tried. It seems like the most effective antidepressants for me have pretty bad sexual side effects which always leaves me taking certain ones only when things get really bad.

It’s been difficult lately because I just got out of a 6 year relationship, I have no friends left in my town, and have really been alone for the first time in my life.In all reality I’m very lonely and want to be able to openly express my emotions. I want to love and be loved. I will never admit that to them though. [info] None [info] 1561506724
FigurativelyPedantic [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 20, a few months after my oldest was born. Your situation is an perfect example of what I never want my child to face, and what has driven me to strictly and consistently adhere to my medication and therapy. They do not need to see me weeping for little or no reason. I don't ever want them to live with the trauma of a mother who killed herself. I'm so sorry you have to deal with that. You deserve better.

Awkward_Dachsund [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 14, although it never quite felt "right" - I fit some criteria but not a majority of it, which led me to keep learning and looking other possible diagnoses. Well, one hospitalization later at 19, I started seei ng a different clinician and she diagnosed me with BPD, sayi ng I don't *quite* fit the criteria for bipolar. I was elated and started reading up on BPD and as I did I felt more and more confident in the diagnosis. Educate yourself and compare what you learn to your own feelings/thoughts, it's worth it [info] None [info] 1561678912
Kimberlite_1223 [info] I can relate so much to your story. I was diagnosed with bipolar and from day 1 I did not have any of my family members’ support. When I was 18, I attempted to commit suicide and I was sent to the ER - then the mental ward. While I was at the ER, my mother called me and told me to get out of the hospital because the family couldn’t afford it. She was yelling at me angrily, completely ignored the fact that her daughter fell mentally ill and attempted to commit suicide. Both my parents refused to believe that I was struggling and I was completely on my own. Similar to you, I always really wish that I had their support, but I never received the kind of love I desire. Indeed it was our parents who are responsible for not raising us with the appropriate care and support, but it is our own responsibility to take care of our own emotions. I suggest to seek help from psychotherapy, as I am trying to do right now. Stay distance from your parents because sometimes distance will help. All the best! [info] None [info] 1561743672

Domidoggy8 [info] I'm 100% there with you! You can skip to the last paragraph for just my opinion on dress shopping instead of reading my rant. We're at 89 people before accounting for caterers and photographers. I hate being the center of attention and would love nothing more than to elope but my fiance won't have it. I sat here for a good couple minutes trying to articulate why he won't have it but basically familial obligation to his parents since his brother is a hot mess and will be the last to marry (if at all).I feel like I'm taking this on myself and I despise it. Nothing gets done without me nagging (took months to get a list of names for wedding guests on his side). It's been half a month since he decided that he wants a church ceremony but he's yet to reach out to the person he wants to officiate or to the church for that matter. We have less than a year until the wedding and I can't even contact photographers until he gets things figured out for the ceremony. I was diagnosed with bipolar in March and I'm doing more than enough struggling without having wedding planning on top of it. I'm having to relearn how to handle myself and communicate effectively. There's a lot of guilt that I bring to our relationship with the diagnosis but that will hopefully be figured out in time with therapy. The diagnosis makes me fear that I'm setting up our marriage to fail, as a large percentage of bipolar marriages do. Anyways, enough of me venting in your venting post. I'm not sure how traditional your wedding beliefs are but I went wedding dress shopping with just my fiance. In the end, my opinion of my dress is the only one that counts and I didn't care if we broke the whole "can't see the bride in her dress before the wedding" tradition. [info] None [info] 1561823299

robinnicole [info] Well it seriously escalated to suicide attempts and self harm. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which they realized was wrong and rediatnosed me with borderline personality disorder. I dont want to scare you, but it stemmed from me being sexually assaulted. I was good and a perfect person in public , but in my comfort zone I was horrible and disrespectful. My mom took me to therapy and I also went to crisis centers. Eventually they just couldn't handle me and signed.me over to CYS custody (children and youth services) and I spent the rest of my childhood away from.home (only because my parents didnt want me, not because I wasnt getting better). when I was in there I learned alot of coping skills and stuff and when I came out at 18, I just basically got my shit together. Try to ask her if anything is going on.. make sure there's nothing happening behind closed doors.. also try therapy and nip it in the bud now so she can get some type of help.. this doesn't mean medication either... just to be able to talk to someone that is a third party and isnt biased helps alot, especially for a kid because judgment is something they deal with on a daily basis...

Anything involving my mental illness she tells me I’m faking and “lying to the doctors” (I was diagnosed with bipolar, and then BPD) and she tells me I’m wasting resources because I’m taking them away “from people who actually need them.” I agree though. She’s never been maternal or motherly to me, while doting on my brothers every needs.

CaseyAPayne [info] I want to start with **culture shock is real**. Everyone reacts to it differently.Then I want to say **be kind to yourself**. I'm not suggesting this, and I will add thoughts on how to counter this shortly but... embrace the fact that maybe you won't be able to "get your shit together" while alone in a foreign country. If you don't get the PROTIPs you need from this thread, or you do and drop the ball on applying them. That's OK. Be kind to yourself.Alright... here's my PROist of PROTIPs.First, **get an accountability partner**. Someone that you're going to check in with EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. The check-in might be super simple. Maybe you just send a "y" letting them know you did "the thing" that day. If you send an "n" you need to explain to them why it was an "n". I think a good friend or family member works best, but maybe you have a digital friend that could work.Second, **write down exactly what you'll be checking in about**. I know you have dreams of doing 8-10 hours of work a day and attending all of your classes, but start with the smallest, IMPOSSIBLE TO FAIL, thing and build up from there. **Maybe all you'll be checking in about each day is doing one Pomodoro cycle**. If you do that, you're a winner. If you do more... AWESOME! But... don't worry about doing more. Worry about doing one.Third, **build on your daily success**. One Pomodoro might become eight. Perhaps along with it you also do 30 minutes of walking a day and meditate. Once you build up this daily muscle it gets easier to add more to it and you'll also become aware of what is, and is not, feasible to do.**BACKSTORY**I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 20 years ago. I've had to dig myself out of depressed states more than a few times. The last time I had to do it was the worse because I had grown accustomed to "waiting until I felt better" and then... slowly getting back into the swing of things. This time a year had gone by and I was still playing video games 10-14 hours a day (Destiny when it first came out), not showering, living at grandma's house, etc. and... just felt empty/hopeless. I'm actually one of those super upbeat dudes all about goals (when not like that) and... goals just weren't working. There were three times that year I wrote out goals I wanted to do and I totally failed at doing them. They were super weak too (brush my teeth, shower, make the bed, etc.)What finally got me out of that loop was choosing a single goal that I didn't think I could fail at (which I had  already earlier that year) and called my brother and said "I'm going to send you a text message every day before 10:30 pm letting you know if I made the bed or not." After I knew someone was "watching" me and I knew there was no reason to fail I immediately changed. There were a few times I squeezed in making the bed at 10:25 pm, but I never missed a day. It took about 50+ days for it to become automatic, but I built on to that (brushing teeth, showering, etc.) until it got up to exercising, writing, meditating, bed early, etc.Anyhow, I know you want/need to "GO BIG" right away. Even though that's the case, ramp up to it a bit. Start with one Pomodoro and if you win, or do more, ramp it up the next day. Check-in with your accountability partner and when you fail, explain why. The explanation isn't for shaming or anything. It's to learn and adjust for the next day.Kudos for trying to figure this out! The human brain is a complex organism and human life is unnecessarily complex... :P Good luck! [info] None [info] 1562241369
lucyNdisguiseBlueyes [info] late response.... but I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 a little over 2 years ago following my first severe, full-blown manic episode. I slept between 0-1.5 hours a day for 2 weeks somehow without feeling tired and was eating close to nothing. I was overweight and wanting to lose weight for a long time, but I think primarily my manic energy and level of activity made me forget about food and I never felt hunger vs me very actively trying to restrict. Since then I’ve been put on a mood stabilizer, and experience more mild depressive episodes, but struggle so so much with binge eating during them. So yeah, definitely a correlation for me [info] None [info] 1562279323

katatl [info] I genetically am predisposed to addiction but didn’t realize I was an addict until I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last year. I was lucky in some sense that my addiction was cigarettes and a ridiculous amount of pot, but it was still pretty hellish and I felt completely out of control. For me, my addiction was actually really escapism. The smoking was great but it was more I was addicted to running away from myself. It has taken a lot of time to be able to be quiet with myself without altering my state chemically, and I’m still fucking up here and there (sometimes everywhere) but I’m blessed to have a support system of friends who know that though it’s not their responsibility to keep me sober, it is important that I can share with them and be honest about my struggles.

I feel like they kind of balance eachother out for the majority of the day I guess. I don’t take it every single day, some weekends I’ll take off to reset my system if i feel like my tolerance has gone up. I also like that I can skip a few days without any major repercussions.

rleekc [info] I got diagnosed when mania and psychosis. Parents called 911 and got sent to emergency room. They thought I was on drugs or something when I was around 18 years old.

Having mood swings is normal but being delusional and out of touch with reality is not and needs to be regulated.

cheesypenguin78 [info] Hi! I'm new to Reddit in general and I am so grateful to find this subreddit. I'm fairly young (24), but my husband and I started trying to get pregnant 3.5 years ago. After no success and a miscarriage, we decided to go see my doctor to figure out what was going on. We didn't really get a clear answer. They told me to take ovulation tests and for three months, there was never a positive one. We went back to the doctor and we're given some options for treatment but turned them down. We don't make very much money and my insurance at the time didn't cover anything.  Now we are at the point where we have better insurance, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

EvilAngel13 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1, schizoaffective disorder and borderline personality disorder years ago.  I was absolutely terrifed and heartbroken and embarrassed but I did believe it...and I spent about a year going to therapy and trying to find the right cocktail of medications that would help me "function normally" without making my entire life suck (lol).I ended up gaining a ton of weight and spent several months feeling emotionally numb, completely detached from everything and just sort of existing rather then living.  I pretty much gave up and bought into the drs and my (now ex) husband's assertions that this was how my life had to be and that wandering around in a numb, emotionless fog was better than riding the rollercoaster that was my life before. Until one of my daughters' best friends (they were elementary school age at the time) was hit by a car on her bicycle right in front of our home and did not make it.  And I felt nothing.  Literally, nothing.  Not at the accident scene. Not at the hospital.  Not while my 2 little girls were clinging to me for comfort.  Not at the funeral.  The night after the funeral I was trying so hard to just feel...something and it kind of dawned on me that the medications I was taking were the cause. I threw them all out and flushed them that very night and I haven't touched psych meds since.  I quit seeing all of the drs and therapists.  And have never gone back.  My (ex)husband tried ultimatums, coercion...even force to get me back on medication and back into treatment but I absolutely refused.  He ended up moving out and I filed for divorce immediately. It took some time to get everything out of my system and to sort of reshape my thoughts pertaining to mental illness, personality disorders and the field of psychiatric medicine.  While I do believe that mental illness obviously does exist and I would never ever discourage someone who feels they need help from seeking treatment. I also believe that sometimes drs/pdrs are too quick to diagnose and medicate what just a few years back would be considered personality traits but are now labeled as mental illness. I realize this isn't going to be a popular statement and I hope that I don't sound critical or judgmental or unsupportive. [info] None [info] 1563026171

I try to play games to take my mind off things but it never works.I would even go as far to say that eating actually makes me feel worse sometimes. [info] None [info] 1563114140

Kate055 [info] That’s such a sad story, I’m so sorry :(. I’m probably going to offer some horrid advice, but this is what I think. So, I always wanted to join the army as a dog trainer, my plan was to get my degree, join the army then do my masters and PhD through the army. Mental health has always been apart of my life, but I went untreated for years. I attempted suicide and couldn’t avoid it any longer. I was diagnosed with bipolar type two and borderline personality disorder. Because of those diagnosis’s, I can never get that military career I always wanted. I did get my degree, even a second one and also my masters. But now my mental health is all over the place and I’m unemployed. I always wonder what would have happened if I joined before getting my degree, perhaps the military would have sorted my head out by giving me structure and removing me from the demons I was fighting. I don’t know, but now at 28, I feel like I missed out. I would think really hard before you make a decision. I don’t want you to have a similar regret, but I also don’t want you getting really sick and attempting something really drastic. Maybe join some support groups that do not require a GP referral. That way it’s off your medical history, but you’re still getting the help. I would look at every avenue for support that doesn’t require the doctors, but if you’re really struggling, you gotta find a new career path. I’m sorry I can’t be of much help OP. I hope you find your answers [info] None [info] 1563208173
blacknobility [info] Hey brother/sister, I don’t know how to help you on the money side of things but your post really sparked something in me to reply. I have been diagnosed with bipolar/schizo/major depressive/etc/etc. I’ve been diagnosed with just about everything. What they don’t tell you is all the great people in history have the same problems. I’ve done amazing things with my life despite all this. I’ve had a friend try to make my life story into a movie, worked on the stealth fighter (f117a) when I was 20 to 22, been a whistleblower for 9/11 families against Saudi foreign lobbying, written a couple books, and done just about everything in life. Right now, I’m an assistant to a treasure hunter on the History Channel. I know you have problems, brother/sister, but work on them to get better at controlling the destiny of your life. Your human spirit is stronger than any illness you have. I look forward to seeing great things from you. With love. -Dustin [info] None [info] 1563274762
mosaicevolution [info] This is just like me! But I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2. I joined a bipolar sub, I realized I'm not a typical bipolar. I feel you on how you describe relationships. I am exactly like that. I force myself to be like what I think a 'normal' person would be, I can be kind, but I feel a detachment in a way. I seem to affect people in a way that others do not. I make people feel really good about themselves and I never do it with the intent to be selfish. If I am snippy, it's not well received. I am a woman and frequently get told I am attractive and it's almost like when I hear that I lose respect for that person. Idk. [info] None [info] 1563279231
0123456789javy [info] Yeah it seriously bugs me that people think it’s cool and different to have a mental illness. I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder a few months ago and it’s fucking awful.

HoundyPaws [info] I think what she shares about health care has less to do with cost and with the emotional validation she seeks from health care providers. It comes up in her book and she just said the French medical professionals made her feel like family. I think this is creepy and will snark at this.To say the least, I despise that in the US, health insurance is largely coupled with employment, but for now that's how it is; Heather could find a job that provides health insurance, but as she details in her book, she cannot handle employment and having a boss. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2003. I learned that, in order to gain stability and at least a modicum of peace in life, I had to modify my behaviors in many different ways. I had to realize that how I was acting affected people around me. This is my main thing with Heather, and it's so clear in her book and on this Paris jaunt -- she thinks there's nobility in HER suffering, and an experimental treatment or a stay in Paris is just window dressing for attention. The hard work is the day-to-day boring shit of learning (and wanting) to keep yourself together, do the routines that keep you alive, ask for help and be a little humble. Loving French health care for their "hot doctors" who "see" you is sexier, I guess, than growing up at 44 years old into a self-confident, calm, less-obsessive, capable, unselfish woman.

Shalebridges [info] Thank you. I have issues with seizures (possibly epilepsy) as I have brain damage from an accident that effects everything in life and before that I was diagnosed with bipolar and I've always had trouble walking as a result of scoliosis. I have doctors, I have professionals that I trust with my health and managing the damage done to my body plus my preexisting conditions has been hard enough but I'm managing. If anyone, ANYONE tried to tout that shit as a cure for what I have I would feed them their teeth. I'm disabled, I'm fine with that, I'm NOT A SALES PITCH. Disabled children and adults have a right to exist. God help them if I ever catch these huns trying to sell to my autistic sister I will fucking break every bone in their body.

EsotericEcology [info] Hey I also have a question for you regarding stimulant induced manic depressive disorder if you feel comfortable answering. I have ADHD so I was on stimulants in my teens. Eventually my behavior became so erratic I was diagnosed with bipolar. Later on, I was misdiagnosed and told my symptoms were from the stimulants which I no longer take. Is that essentially what stimulant induced manic depressive disorder is referring to in this instance? I googled it but I wasn’t finding much information. No worries if you’d rather not talk about this! [info] None [info] 1563461789
Goddess_Hel [info] No, but *hypomania* can be way less severe and lasts for about a week. As someone who's diagnosed with both BPD and bipolar 2, I know the two can coexist... I'm not saying he's definitely Bipolar 2, but it does sound a lot like my own symptoms, aside from being a dick. I've been way less obviously hypomanic than say, someone with bipolar 1 with full blown mania. But I am irritable, and can say things I regret in the heat of the moment. I can become hypomanic when I'm head over heels "in love" with someone, or passionately obsessed with something.I can see reasonable doubt for the diagnosis, but I've been in therapy for almost my whole life off and on, and I was diagnosed with bipolar at 25 years.It can happen.

beanieweenie [info] Hey OP, you are not alone. I have been in a committed relationship for about 16 years. The first 6 years were long distance, and I cheated on my partner with 3 people during that time (a coworker, a guy who I knew was using me for sex but who I was obsessed with, and also my sister's boyfriend). I 'fessed up to my partner and he was able to forgive me. We ended up moving in together 10 years ago, and during the first two years of living with my partner I found the opportunity to cheat on him yet again with one of my old hookups. My partner is a lovely person, we are totally emotionally and sexually compatible. Basically there was no reason for me to cheat except that I craved the rush and validation of someone (anyone, lol) desiring me. Up until recently, I just thought I was a shitty person. Two months ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and found out about hypersexuality and it suddenly made me realize that my infidelity was not because I'm a terrible human being, but because I am ~~I'll~~ ill and sometimes unable to resist the urges and feelings that this disorder lays on me. I still do think that I am somewhat responsible for the choices I made back then, but now I realize all I was up against with dealing with this illness that I didn't know I had. I think maybe if I would have known about my bipolar maybe I would have made different choices. [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1563908237
aasofia [info] Just curious, do you have other symptoms of bipolar?I can't literally hold myself back when I go hypo as my sexdrive goes up the roof, if I i didn't get what I needed from my partner, I would go and find someone that could give me what I wanted/needed. Many relationships down the gutter just because of that. Medication is the only thing that works for me, the downside is that I dont even wanna have sex anymore, but maybe that's better hehe.

BaliHaiCR [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2. I take lamotrigine for mood stabilization, which has served me well since diagnosis and I have no plans to stop taking it. Probably the biggest benefit I get from the addition of kratom is my alcoholism (4+ drinks per day) and daily cannabis use ceased immediately after discovering kratom. I still enjoy drinking and a little toke on occasion, but my general life experience and world outlook are greatly improved since discovering kratom over a year ago. Now I'm in full control of my alcohol and cannabis use. Very grateful for this plant. May I ask what antipsychotic you take? For a brief period I took quetiapine, which did not react well with kratom.&amp;#x200B;Interesting article, and maybe we'll soon discover more and greater benefits for people with serious mental disorders.

thecrowening [info] This stuff makes me so fcking angry. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago and since then have been on and off different meds trying to figure out what works. I'm not trying to invalidate her experience: side effects can be frustrating and make you feel out of control. However, I do get a little testy when she gets melodramatic about 10-15 lbs from Lexapro when I'm trying to cope with weight gain, hair loss, skin rashes, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and the emotional roller coaster of thinking I've finally found what works only to have a mood shift the next day. It's so triggering for me to watch her have an existential crisis over 15 lbs. You're absolutely right: some people don't have a choice about the weight gain. She's really privileged to be able to have that be her biggest concern about a medication. [info] None [info] 1563979766

Haybaybay2792 [info] Tl;dr at the end, my personal experience here.I was diagnosed with bipolar at 18 and after 7 years of a working diagnosis of BPD, my amazing pdoc gave me the comorid dx of both. Her primary reason was that she has seen me through both types of episodes, stable from bipolar with meds so then she could she the short live volitialy, identity issues, and relationship struggles. Then after an embarrassingly long time of DBT skills training, when I stablized from that and had a situational/medical manic episode i recongized early but used so many skills and called her right away to get through to my emergency appointment, she gave me the comorid diagnosis.Tl;dr it takes years of a relationship with a pdoc and working to get better and trying things out to get a proper dx of either or both [info] None [info] 1564241207

Magicallypeanut [info] Could I ask you some questions? Dont answer if they're too personal, I wont be upset. I was diagnosed with bipolar last year and my psych mentioned how it can also manifest as a schizoaffective disorder and to be mindful of changes. But they left it super vague like that and I'm like I didnt even know i was "off" before my diagnosis so how can I be aware of any changes? What should I be looking for or cognizant of? Did you know that what you were seeing or hearing weren't there? I'm just wondering where the line is if that makes sense. I'm just really confused and I dont want to ask my psych because honestly I'm afraid of asking for fear if the stigma. I'm really sorry if I am out of line or asking too personal of a question.

They ranged from barely covered to nude, and I sent them to my boyfriend. He was not as a receptive as I expected, but I was fine with that. I thought I looked really good in one of the ones that I was mostly covered in, and so I posted it to my public ig account. My boyfriend ask me to take down the "slutty" post and I did, and we did not talk about it so I did not think much of it.About two days later, I went out with my friends and one of them took a photo of my outfit from the neck down. I was wearing a white shirt that I borrowed from my boyfriend (that I really liked because of the logo over the left chest area) tucked into cutoff shorts. I posted it in a series of photos of me and my friends. He was enraged and said that my boobs were bulging out of the shirt. I got mad at him in return, thinking that the photo was benign. Looking at it now, I do think it was mildly suggestive, but that was not my intention. I told him that I did not like to be treated as property, and he replied that my social media indicated otherwise. He said he felt disrespected and betrayed, and that he was repulsed and extremely turned off by me. I apologized over and over and he said that we should take a break, as he still feels love for me despite his other emotions.Today I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I look back at this situation and am fairly certain that the first photo was taken and posted in a state of mania. The disorder has made me do impulsive and irrational things before. He says that it's no excuse, but I disagree.AITA for posting those photos and blaming it on being bipolar?*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The_Durandal [info] I am also diagnosed schizophrenic, schizoaffective bipolar to be exact.  I was diagnosed with bipolar originally about 15 years ago, which changed about 8 years ago to my current diagnosis, and have been on a variety of antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxyiolitics, and lithium, for most of that time.  Currently I am not on any medication from a Psychiatrist.I use a custom stack myself;Lion's Mane for Nerve Growth Factor,Omega-3 for nerve repair and dopamine receptor health,Brahmi (a plant that is a bacopa monnieri source)  for GABA receptor health and sometimes for sedative effect if I feel overstimulated.I have been addicted to alcohol 4 times in the past year, since I went off of my antipsychotics and lithium I was prescribed.  That is why my stack is so heavily skewed to nervous system health, as alcohol withdrawal damages the nervous system badly. There are two other aspects in my recovery that are helping tremendously.  One is sleep.   I've focused heavily on my sleep hygiene; I stop doing anything intense at around 10:30, I drink a reishi + red tea tea around that time, then 2-3 cups of a calming lemon tea to prepare myself for bed around 12:15am.  That works for me and I've had a ton of problems with sleep in my life (I've had sleep paralysis around 50-70 times in the past year as well).The other is socializing.  Working with my psychiatrist, I was given referrals for social activities such as addiction services, mental health support meetings, etc.  These are helpful as schizophrenia lends itself to isolation and drug abuse is a common effect from that isolation.This is working fairly well for me now and my sleep is improving as well.  I am engaging a lot more in the community and that is encouraging, and encouraging me to attempt more engagements as well.That's my 2 (or 20) cents.  Good luck whatever you decide and whatever happens. [info] None [info] 1564922393
coleserra [info] I used to work with my Dad. One night I was having serious suicidal idealation to the point where I layed on some train tracks for a good 20 minutes. The next day I went to work and had I complete breakdown. I decided to talk to my Dad, had no one else to talk to at the time. I told him everything.His response?"Man the fuck up and keep that shit to yourself, you're a grown man, act like it."   I tried "manning up" for the majority of my adult life. You know what happened? I became a hardcore alchoholic who constantly wanted to kill myself or do something risky. Finally my Uncle and my ex convinced me to see a psych and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Even then, I didn't take my medication until a few months later because it made me feel so weak and I really did feel like less of a man. [info] None [info] 1565035905
millapinch [info] I was diagnosed by my psychiatrist. I asked him to test me and he did as well as my childhood history. He bulk bills all our sessions so I’ve never paid anything out of pocket. He prescribed me dexamphetamine which I pay $6.50 for 1 months supply (5 repeats) with my healthcare card. I was diagnosed with bipolar 6 years ago by the same psychiatrist but have always felt something else was going on. After some research I asked him to test me. I am also just beginning Strattera as I have a long history of alcoholism and addiction and the dexamphetamine is great but I can see my self abusing it. I’m hoping the Strattera will work for me. I also tried Modafinil but it is very expensive and it felt somewhat dirty to me. Good luck! (I’m in NSW btw) [info] None [info] 1565094441
nightbirdisdead [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a week ago and it's difficult enough just going to work and making dinner for myself, I cannot imagine what you are going through... It took me forever to admit to myself that I needed professional help and I'm so proud of you knowing yourself well enough to understand that the way you're feeling is not ok and that you could use some help.  I don't really have any practical suggestions on how to deal with the system, but I really do hope that you find a doctor and that eventually you will get better.. stay strong. I'm proud of you for fighting for yourself. And if it is really all too much at any point emergency room is a perfectly good option. [info] None [info] 1565124334

Idontlike2color [info] Fun fact: I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, went to the psych wing at the hospital not once, not twice, but three times... and I bought a gun in about 5-10 minutes from a pawn shop.

Candid_Pomegranate [info] I kind of had a similar experience/dilemma...When I met my current boyfriend, I had **a lot** of personal issues I was dealing with, as I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder less than two years prior. He knew about it before we began dating, but I don't think he truly understood just how bad it could be. I definitely hurt him through my own self-destructive behaviours, and tried to push him away for his own sake because I just thought he deserved way more than dealing with me but... he loved me. Somehow, he stuck by me through my worst and helped me with the baggage that I had been carrying on my own. So in my case, it took someone else to love me so much to learn how to love and accept myself. I guess I also got really lucky in finding someone whom accepted me despite my flaws.So it's all up to you. Therapy definitely helped begin the process, but it my progress took some time... I took a year off after my diagnosis and took advantage of the services provided by my uni. I wish you the best and I hope my own story helped (at least a little)! :) [info] None [info] 1565296473
facefulloffuzz [info] Mental health is a good point and I agree. I just struggle on what would disqualify someone. After I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I surrendered my fire arm to the local police department. Had no legal obligation to do so but I just wanted to ensure safety for everyone. Last thing I would ever want to is to be off my rocker with a gun in my hand. Probably not likely, but always safe than sorry. [info] None [info] 1565305103
Callalilly45 [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so I basically understood that my moods are highly exaggerated versions of what everyone else has. I really started to see the difference when I was dealing with mania and people were genuinely concerned for my well-being instead of being along for the ride with me.I also had a friend ask me how I would feel if I didn't need to take mood stabilizers and could just "be myself" without any of the repercussions or judgement. Really gave me something to think about. Is my sick self really the true me? I go back and forth. [info] None [info] 1565321702
barberos3 [info] 100% agree. One must be cautious with advices of that kind. In my situation I had undiagnosed ADHD for years and each time I felt socially anxious or simply overwhelmed by being in a group, incapable of completing a task because of attention deficit, it nourished my lack of self esteem and social isolation, ending in cycling depressive episodes. That's why I was diagnosed with bipolar first.My doctor wants me to think of this combination of ADHD and bipolar as "intellectual and emotional hyperactivity" rather than a handicap or an illness. He says once it's under control it may even be a super power. And I thought that was a very cool thing to say, it gave me hope and confidence. Telling myself I was ill has contributed to my lack of self esteem. And I just wanted to share, but I understand it may harm other peoples perception of their illness / difference.

BoneBruja [info] I'm glad you have your boyfriend. It sounds like you have a good and healthy relationship. Breaking that cycle of abuse and getting yourself out of that toxic atmosphere is difficult. I'm glad your in a good place now. My mental health is stable now. I was diagnosed with bipolar and I have been on medication for several years. I feel awful for some of the things I have said to people when I was younger and out of control. I have also made amends to my family for that. Though my life before medication is very fuzzy I don't remember much of it.But, I am in the best place mental health wise that I have ever been. I've been stable for over 2 years and i'm happy I'm currently with an amazing boyfriend. We have been going out for almost 2 years. He is wonderful and he makes me so happy. It's my first healthy relationship and seriously he is so amazing and supportive. I never thought I could be loved like this. [info] None [info] 1565365836

But due to financial reasons, I don't think I will be starting school at the end of the month. It's a toss up.&gt;Have you ever worked?SYEP summer job program in NYC, intermittently from age 14 to 23. Was hoping this summer would be my final year, but they changed the age range without telling anyone, from 14-24 to 14-21, so, fuck the nyc government. Taking opportunities from people who need them. -____- Got a month long temp job through a friend at Toys R Us.

Mom is supposed to be taking me to try to get approved for disability, we'll see how that goes.&gt;What do you do with your time?Pretty much am on Youtube all the time. I think I might be addicted but idk what else to do. Googling random thoughts and learning useless facts also takes up much of my time. Sometimes I help people on /r/LearnJapanese, since I've been learning the language since I was 12. Used to play games, not anymore.&gt;Do you have health issues? Mental? Physical?I guess. I was diagnosed with bipolar last year when I voluntarily went into a mental hospital but I don't think the symptoms fit me. Hoping to get reevaluated next week.&gt;Do you want to escape NEETdom? Is it possible for you? What do you want to do?I don't know. I like that I don't have to interact with a lot of people and have no responsibility or anyone counting on me (I hate letting people down and them getting angry with me), and if I coud, I'd love to be a neet forever. The other side of me is saying that I can't maintain thid lifestyle forever. One day my parents will get tired of me. They probably won't throw me out since I'm a girl, but hey, my dad threatened to do so once years ago. And when my parents finally die, then what will I do? They're already old with tons of health problems. And society expects people to be independent and contribute. I feel peer pressured to get a job, so to speak. Even though I don't want one people try to force work on you and look down on you when you don't have a job. Used to play games and wanted to be a designer my whole life, but earlier this year I lost my love for games, and am disappointed with the current state of the industry. It's mostly that I don't enjoy programming and am not an artist so there's nothing I can contribute to a company. I have a lot of ideas, but there are thousands of Joe's out there with "ideas". Companies have enough idea people.So now that I've given up games I don't know what to do with my life now. It's funny. All these years I waited to study game design, now I'm in school and hate all my classes/find them very difficult, and my interest in games have diminished. It's a sick joke played by the universe.

stardust_zan [info] Hi, I am in the same place as you are! And I hear your struggle.My life was just one long shit show up to recently, with my abusive and crazy father, who was going through the motions of being the best to the worst human being in the whole world (later diagnosed with bipolar, committed suicide 5years ago), substance abuse, neglect, domestic violence and sexual abuse = welcome to my world. 2 months ago I was diagnosed with bipolar myself, and I am struggling to accept it. Yeah, I did some weird stuff in my life, but who didn't right? I also go through mood waves and my moods do cause a lot of issues in my life, make me often be tense and isolate myself as I never know what's coming. But then comparing to my father, I am really sane.  So I dunno, with the amount of shit I went through, it should be normal for me to not always feel normal, rigth?Unfortunately, because of the nature of mental diseases sometimes it's very hard to state what's what, especially when loads of trauma comes into place as well. I'm afraid no one here can really help you or me with that question and it's something both of us will have to work closely with our doctors and theraphist. But look, just do what's best for you. Doesn't matter what label they put on you, you just keep pushing forward, trying to find the solution that works for you, that will make your life better.  Good luck, hope you feel better soon.

Fatassmatilda [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 10 years ago and I was diagnosed with borderline 4 years ago. I think I was always both at the same time but they finally realized the borderline part too. So living with both idk I figured out bipolar i can see when I'm becoming manic when I'm becoming depressed but o god the mood switches with borderline are fucking terrible they can change at any moment so I am rapidly cycling through moods on top of whatever bipolar is doing to me. I don't have any friends n my family all want me dead. And on top of this I also have PTSD and a panic disorder. Idk I got hit with the crazy stick hard. One interesting thing though that made me respond to ur post is that everyone always tells me " ooo no u can be both bipolar and borderline it's one or the other " but my doctor's diagnosed me so fuck those people they r not doctor's idk have u ever had someone say that to you?

Chibi347 [info] I can totally relate. My older sister (by 6 years) has epilepsy. I remember having the same thoughts of wanting to have my physical injuries being more than they were. I know now that I was just craving more attention, mostly from my father. My family is great but I wanted to be “special” too. I obviously didn’t understand the severity of my sisters condition. I got what I wanted a year ago when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I definitely always want to be mentally okay but sometimes I think about if I broke my leg it would give me an excusable chance to just, slooooow dooooown.

Gaynicorn2 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar about 5 years ago, and adhd about 3.5 years ago. Got diagnosed after being hospitalized due to my first severe manic episode. It’s definitely something you should bring up with your doctor, although it does sound like you may have bipolar. If you have never experienced a full manic episode, you are most likely bipolar 2. But I’m no psychiatrist or doctor so it’s best to bring it up with yours. Also, I recommend tracking your moods for awhile. The length and severity of your ups and downs will be very helpful for a doctor. [info] None [info] 1565708757

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***Ok hear me out because I know that sounds terrible. Here’s the background, N(28F) and I(25M) have been friends for 8 years now. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year and a half ago. I’m still trying to get my own mental health under control. N has her own mental health problems that she refuses to handle. N has been in a rehab program for alcoholism for about two months, but that’s all the help she’s been getting.I’ve been begging N to see a psychiatrist for about six months now. She clearly has either bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder (they present somewhat similarly, and I’m not a psychiatrist so I don’t know).  She’s been having breakdowns, manic and depressive episodes, unwell thoughts and behaviors. And she’s been relying heavily on me during all of this, meanwhile not taking any of my advice on getting professional help. Also I’ve been trying to handle my own mental health during this. I’ve been keeping myself together but it’s been hard. I’ve thought about cutting her out of my life constantly but so far I haven’t been able to do it.Anyway it finally came to a head a few days ago. She called me late at night and said she was going to do something bad. So I went to her house. She was in such a state that she didn’t remember calling me. I got her to the hospital and they put her on a 72 hour psych hold. Then they transferred her to a mental health facility. That’s where she is now, she’ll probably be there for two weeks or longer.So what I’m asking is, would I be an asshole if when she gets out, I keep a wide berth and don’t hang out with her anymore? If I still talk to her, but we’re not as close as we used to be? Because I can’t keep doing this to myself anymore.*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

dananky [info] Agree. I suffered tremendously in my teens with the smallest things and even now I do. My family thought I was just an angsty teen but I would go days without eating or showering because I couldnt stop staring at walls. Like you said, it's a really fine line and even harder when you are a teen. You dont know what's going on and everything feels magnified ten fold. It wasnt until I was diagnosed with bipolar my family started realizing that tough love doesnt work when I'm already so damn vulnerable. Your mind twists that type of help sometimes.But yes, please help her get into therapy and other types of help before it continues getting worse. [info] None [info] 1565821659
alteregosluville [info] I’m not going to claim anything, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar. Then I went to therapy and they think it’s more likely BPD, but I gotta get sober for 90 days then actually do “treatment”. I did anger management too. I’m violent. The classes did help. There’s actually a cycle to getting angry and having rages. It’s wild. Had no idea. Even BPD, basically, I never learned how to cope with hard stuff in healthy ways. The end.

PugsAndPuns [info] Short answer: I don’t.Long answer: I feel really awful about myself and decide to do something about it. I work really hard at it but then I get frustrated and discouraged and stop all progress until my next bout of extreme self-hating. I make long and detailed “action plans,” outlining what I’ll eat, an exercise routine, goals, etc. and declare my dedication to “actually stick with it this time.” Given a little bit of time and it all falls apart again. Repeat this cycle indefinitely. I think it’s also worth noting that I am diagnosed with bipolar I with borderline personality disorder traits, so my mental instability is also a major contributor to this pattern.

RetinalFlashes [info] I haven't been diagnosed with adhd but I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 (which often overlaps symptoms with adhd and can be misdiagnosed either way). It's posts like these that make me reconsider talking to my doctor again about adult female adhd. This is me, even when I'm not hypomanic.

boguia [info] I’d definitely consult a doctor about it but my instinct is to say no. Head injuries in generall cause mood swings.

celolex [info] I don't like saying this on my main account (because, as you've admitted, there's a lot of stigma) but I was diagnosed with bipolar two weeks ago. The stigma is one of the most difficult things to grapple with. I'm afraid to tell friends because I'm worried they'll cut me out of their lives if they know.  It's important to remember that bipolar manifests in many different ways, and your experience with one person is not indicative of everyone with the condition. Additionally, while she obviously caused you significant emotional distress, this girl in no way "totally ruined" your life – certainly not to the degree that she's ruining her own.

barbeque_crawfish [info] Obviously not a doctor and the following is in no way intended to be or substitute for actual medical advice. I hope I'm not doing this wrong.I have experienced a lot of what you talk about going through, starting at age 15. Around age 20, after 5 years of disorienting mental agony, I was diagnosed with bipolar type I. You may be just fine, these things happen to many of us, even people who are overall mentally healthy, but if you are truly concerned about your mental well-being it wouldn't hurt to have someone look under the hood.Point is, mental health is no joke and you should speak to a professional. My parents couldn't afford it either, but the university I attended offered free consultations and therapy sessions with licensed practitioners through the university health services department. Even if you can't afford it outright and want to skip school counselors, there are other ways to get the help you need. Plus you have access to resources I didn't at the time (20 years ago).

mistyterrain [info] Holy shit dude I've been experiencing this the past few days.

UmbraNyx [info] I think I might have some form of epilepsy. Starting when I was 19, I would occasionally have episodes where time would slow down, everything felt unreal, and I could barely move or speak. Like, I couldn't physically make myself do it, even if I wanted to. I would also get vivid images and sounds in my head, sort of like a daydream, but far more intense and out of my control.I got a sleep-deprived EEG that turned up nothing. Later I spoke with a psychiatrist who thought they might be dissociative episodes. I was in a very dark period in my life, so it's not out of the question.A few years later I was diagnosed with bipolar II, and the medication I was prescribed for it is also used to treat epilepsy. I haven't had an episode since. It could be that my improved mental state meant that I stopped dissociating, but I'll probably never know for sure. [info] None [info] 1566066054

RadicalFemale [info] Hey there! I’m 36 F and just started treatment for adhd. I was like you, super smart with a high iq that sailed through school, until high school. Being restricted to a desk was awful and I didn’t do homework or know how to study. I was also very compliant and eager to please until adolescence.I was diagnosed with bipolar and have been treated for it since I was 24. I’ve brought up my executive functioning problems to several of my doctors over the years. If I was so smart how could I have no common sense and be so stupid??Well, I had my teen daughter tested for adhd as she had symptoms. She was diagnosed. I was able to go to my psychiatrist and by explaining my symptoms, what area of life they affected (all of them. If I don’t see a paper bill it doesn’t get paid.) and with the dx for my child in light of how heritable adhd is he diagnosed it. We started with Wellbutrin because since I’m bipolar I don’t want to see off a manic episode with stimulants.There are so many of us women that fell through this crack. I’m glad we’re getting up.

Like you're crazy or what you feel isn't valid. I haven't shared my diagnosis because I don't want it shoved in my face jokingly or otherwise. OP's husband's behavior was completely unacceptable.

Abood1917 [info] thanks for responding. I was diagnosed with bipolar (not sure if 1 or 2, but I’ve had psychosis so can that pin it down?). Anyways I called my psychiatrist today and mentioned to him that I feel like I have bipolar because of the mania or hypomania, not sure which one, that I had prior to my psychotic break. I’ve only experienced delusions, no hallucinations at all. Even when I did LSD last week I experienced delusions for 2 days cuz I didn’t sleep and when I slept everything went away and realized I was nuts lmao.Have you had any experience with adderall for adult ADD/ADHD, smoking weed, and/or psychedelics?

stardust_zan [info] Hi, I am sorry you have to go through it. I know how hard it is as I was in your shoes. My father was bipolar and my family struggled a lot because of that. And I, like yourself the oldest child, was the one, who always had to deal with his illness. It's exhausting. So I hear you. All the questions you asked are valid and increadibly hard to answer. It depends on what his relationship with his illness and yourself is. I was very close with my dad, but he refused to medicate, and I reached my limits. Now he's gone, took his own life and I still don't know how to deal with it, plus I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder myself exactly 5 years after he passed away. With every passing year I get to understand him more. I also got to understand the illness itself. And I know that without mediaction (most of us anyway), talking therapy (especially needed if he can't drop the vicitm role) and healty routine (diet, sleep, exercises) it is only going to get worse. Even though we are ill, we are still responsible for our actions, and we owe to the people close to us, to do our best to stay in control and manage our sypmtoms. There are going to be worse times, you can't avoid that, but in most cases it is doable to live a good, relatively stable life. I don't know how it looks with your dad, with mine it was a pure chaos. He didn't want to medicate, he blamed everyone else. He was falling deep into his episodes. We had to basically move him, on our backs, through the life. And it was devastating. If that's your case. You probably should remove yourself from him, because if he lets this illness run its course, it's going to end really bad (been there, seen that) and there'll be nothing you can do about it. You should make very clear rules and boundries with him. Tell him what you need from him to do (therapy, meds, routine) to help maintain a good relationship between the two of you (it's normal within relationships to do that ). Create an emergency list, as there are going to be times when it slips and he might need you, but for the most part, for him, and yourself, he has to learn what his disorder is, what are his triggers and pattern, so he can be ready when they come. Some people when they catch early signs they commit themselves.With a proper help from a specialist, it can be very managable. With that the quality of his life can vastly improve and tendencies towards victimazing himself should go away. That's based on my own experiance. That's what I expect from myself and wish I expected from my father, instead of jumping into deep and dangerous waters with him, every time the storm hit. Comparing to him, I have a pretty stable life and it gets better and easier the more I learn. It's a hard work, but it can be done and it should be expected from us. [info] None [info] 1566414379

It was March, so well after the applications period had closed. Ideally I’d have taken more time to actually select and apply to my ideal choice, but because of the time crunch I had to reach out to my old prof to see if she’d let me apply late to her department’s grad program.

Robbieccfc [info] I suffered with my mental health in school. By 16 I’d had multiple suspensions, I didn’t work towards any exams and I was spiralling down. I was admitted to a mental health unit and was there for 7 months. I was diagnosed with bipolar, medicated and eventually discharged at the age of 17.On the day I was discharged I decided that I would go back to that mental health hospital but on the right side of things. I went back to school, got strong A levels, went to a very good university and recently graduated with a first class degree in psychology. I have just landed my first full time AP job and I hope that within the next couple of years or so I’ll get on to the clinical psychology doctorate.

CoyoteLovelyYT [info] So, I'd like to preface this reply with a bit of a personal anecdote. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and a mild case of Asperger's Syndrome when I was a teenager. I struggled a lot with the diagnosis, both when I first got it and having to cope with the knowledge of it's presence, and at many other points in my life when I lost opportunities I never expected would be lost (examples, I wanted to enlist in the military or become a police officer when I grew up, both were things I couldn't do with my diagnosis). There were a lot of points in my life that were absolutely devastating given the circumstances around them, and it has been and still is a challenge to cope with everything to this day.One of the videos that always stuck with me that I saw on YouTube was from Game Theory, the episode on the game "Until Dawn". So much of that video resonated with me on so many unique levels because I felt that personal connection to the subject matter, both through the message of the content and the struggles of the characters in the topic.I am opening with that because this video brought me right back to 2015 when I first saw that episode. So much of what you discussed with this game, it resonated with me on exactly the same levels, and based on how you opened the review, it showed it resonated the same way with you. That is a very, VERY difficult thing to accomplish in my opinion, and you did so with aplomb. Damn, this video deserves so much more recognition than it's gotten, because the way you discussed the themes here in conjunction with the game was just... I can't even begin to tell you how amazing it was!I sincerely hope you keep this up, because there is so much here that is working for you. Strong audio quality, excellent understanding and conveyance of themes, and a good approach to the subject matter that can leave a person still able to take away something even if the game doesn't fully appeal to them.Outstanding job man, sincerely!\~ [info] None [info] 1566810441

Sumoki_Kuma [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar about 1.5 years ago and since that day my doctor told me that he doesn't want me to be on medication my entire life, that his goal is to get me to a point where I don't need medication; which is wonderful! But I know that my illness is a proggresive one and that there's a very big chance that I need to be on my meds for the rest of my life.When I was younger and 'dealing' with my issues, I always told myself I'll never be reliant on 'drugs, ' that is until I actually got to the point where I, myself, realized I was sick. When I understood that even though I can be treated, I'm probably going to deal with this my entire life. So when my doctor told me the above is when I came to terms with the fact that my normalcy does rely on the medication I take, and it's done wonders for me! I wake up exited to take my meds because I know that these little chalky spheres are gonna help me think and be an actual person during the day and nothing has felt more worth it.I know it's "odd" to be taking as many meds as our grandparents, but it's honestly a gift to know what is 'wrong' with us so that we can treat it and live better lives in spite of it!I wish you the best of luck, we're in this boat with you 🖤 [info] None [info] 1567348682
Maitasun [info] I’m tempted to say me, then my brother. We switched places as being not only the black sheep but the family’s shame at one time. But man, my cousin is way worse. TD;LR: She is a manipulative bitch and probably a psychopath. Nobody likes her and she is currently destroying her family.She apparently has some kind of mental illness. I really want to believe it, because I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and was told I was lying and it feels awful... but this bitch is smart enough to fake it; if anything, she should be diagnosed as a psychopath. She destroyed the family. Everything has to be about her and if not, she throws tantrums that you can’t imagine. She threats with killing herself (and attempt it), or pee on herself. I shit you not, and she is not a child. She forced her parents to change schools when her friends or teachers didn’t do as she said. She somehow manipulated his father to beg to her ex-bf to be with her again or she’ll suicide. (The parents of the poor boy threatened with sue them if she ever came around him again.) She dropped out high school and know is homeschooled and want to force their parents to pay for University. Knowing her, she’ll will only make them go more bankrupt. Aunt and Uncle where the only loving marriage I saw while growing up and they are on the verge of divorce. My other cousin had to put his studies on hold (he was almost finishing Uni) to take care of her because she wasn’t safe to be alone. She is a manipulative bitch, treats everyone with disrespect, attack’s her mom any time she can, destroying her nerves, put their parents against each other... she even made her way out of rehab one day after being forced in (her parents were destroyed and was such a difficult choice to make, but it was the right one) SHE CRIED HER WAY OUT. “Mommy I love you so much, I’ll change, I promise”.Of course she did not. No one in my family likes her, she is banned from all family reunions, not allowed to be in any of my other aunts/uncle houses,  not even her grandpa wants her at his home. Just the bare mention of her name puts everyone in a bad mod. I really can’t do anything but hope she is really ill and that some therapy + correct meds will make her less of a bitch but I highly doubt it. Apparently, something awful happened to her a few weeks ago and my mom asked me to call her and say I will be there to support her and that I love her (I do, family is family) but instead of doing that I just thought: “Mom, do you really believe what she said?” And I feel awful for not believing her, but the antecedents are to strong to just ignore.

I don't trust myself with a gun on my bad days. I have been suicidal in the past and although I haven't been in a long time, it isn't worth the risk. I've read articles where veterans are upset that their medical marijuana usage disqualifies them for gun ownership but then they mention the illness.

cmcbryant1 [info] I don’t know if it is ok for me to post here. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 3 years ago. For the first time in 6 years I am dating someone. I have laid down “ boundaries “ with him. I would NEVER put my boyfriend through this. I have been hospitalized and I know what to look out for. He is going with me to my doctors and tracking my progress. If I ever was to put him through this he would leave. Though we do have a really hard time with things and we do have intense episodes it is not an excuse to hurt the ones that we love the most. The fact that this person is not taking his disorder seriously is not your fault. I know it is hard but you do not deserve to go through this. It seems like YOU are putting in all the hard work when he isn’t. This disorder is absolutely debilitating sometimes but that does not mean we get a free pass every time. I actually find it very offensive that he is not putting in the hard work like most of us are. This is why people have such a biased option of us some time. You have done everything you possibly could do for him. If he does not take his recovery seriously than you are not to be responsible for him and don’t have to put up with this emotional abuse!!!

Before I lived alone, went to university in town and had a pretty good social life. I was spiraling and didnt even notice until my parents brought me in. I was diagnosed with bipolar mania type two and PTSD. I was manic for a couple months, then the hospital sorted me out. But now I feel like I'm back at square one... I know I am much healthier now, and I'm healing and planning to continue school either in January or next fall... But I can't shake the feeling that everything would have been better if I didn't go to the hospital. Which I know is untrue, I was a danger to myself and I know I wouldn't have either been dead or in jail. I'm just upset, teenage me would have not pictured me here back at home, broke, and sorting out my mental health. I wish so much that I was normal. A lot of my friends ditched when I was hospitalized, I do have a few close ones I'm grateful for. It just hurts to realize that I had friends that only cared about drugs and partying, and not myself. I was raped this past December by my friends boyfriend, I left that whole friend group since they told me I lied about it happening - regardless of going to the hospital, having the rape kit done, and reporting it to police.

Sansophia [info] I'm trying to reasonable, but frankly, I'd do informed consent over this guy and I'd NEVER recommend that to anyone not 100% certain.  Here's the thing, bipolar doesn't make you want to transition. Moreover, when I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2004, it was kinda kinda the go to for "We don't know what the fuck you have." I didn't have bipolar, I had gender dysphoria. I went into suicide watch in 2008 and told them I had gender dysphoria and the doctor, naw, you're just borderline.  If a doctor doesn't take Gender Dysphoria seriously, don't take them seriously. The time has long passed for that crap and you're not doing yourself any favors. [info] None [info] 1568276426
a_throwaway_account3 [info] Thank you for your reply. I always thought that I had some deep issues stemming from my childhood. I cannot express my feelings and I just suppress them. I want them to surface and fix them. I also experienced a major manic psychotic episode. I still remember some parts and they are all my own serious problems. I think somebody needs to listen to me and guide me to be whole again.The reason I am suspicious with the technique is that it's still considered experimental. It may be due to the fact that current meta around the field is psychoanalysis. Gestalt is existential and my therapist has a PhD in philosophy, and master's degree in psychology.Researching around to topic made me realize that I actually have trust issues. I have basically read everything I could about the therapist and the technique. I try to answer whether this will be useful to me or not. Maybe I should stop and give it a try. Worst case is I will just lose a little bit of money.edit: I am diagnosed with bipolar type 1 and I have been taking my medication regularly.

I’ve never felt so balanced in my entire life. Mental illness, motherhood, being a wife, etc etc is pure madness. PM me, I’m here for you ❤️ [info] None [info] 1568605192
alaskagreen27 [info] For starters, the public system is bollocks. Secondly, 10 subsidised psychology sessions are not enough and still very expensive. Psychiatry and psychology go hand in hand.After the Medicare rebate, I pay $115 to see a psychiatrist. But I have to be able to pay $230 before being refunded. Lucky for me I only have to go every couple of months now. Then I pay $75 for a psychology session after the Medicare rebate. I can only get 10 subsidised session per year before the costs goes up to around $150 per session. Then I get to pay for medications. Joy. Luckily I usually only take one medication which isn’t that expensive. I also pay for health insurance - because if I ever need to go to a psychiatric hospital, only a private hospital would provide suitable care. There’s a 2 month waiting period, so it’s better to stay insured if you’re at risk. Public hospitals really only aim to keep people from hurting themselves, or to treat those who are severely ill - they don’t take on patients just to rehabilitate them. I used to be on the most expensive plan because only top hospital cover will insure for psychiatric care. But now you can have one lifetime upgrade without serving the waiting period, so I’ve switched to basic cover.On top of that, mediations can cause side effects which might require you to see another specialist. For me, I have just been referred to see a dermatologist because my medication causes next level acne. Yay, more $ for specialists. I couldn’t imagine having to pay for my medical expenses while unemployed and on government welfare. I’ve heard of people spending about 25% of their welfare payments just on medication alone. I also couldn’t imagine being treated in the public system - imagine the waiting list and frequency of appointments.Also, before you are diagnosed properly, some medications can be more expensive because you are not covered by the PBS scheme. For example, a few years ago, before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was given an antipsychotic by a public hospital. This is a typical treatment for acute mania, but I wasn’t diagnosed yet and the hospital wouldn’t diagnose me after seeing me in emergency once. They only gave me about a week’s supply. I went to my GP for more, but she couldn’t diagnose me either so I had to pay $40 for a box of medication before being able to get into see a psychiatrist a month later. This is the type of medication which I only take in a time of crisis - and is generally only prescribed to bipolar and schizophrenic patients. You can only imagine the positions people are in when they need to take these kinds of drugs. I also see a GP who doesn’t bulk bill. I used to though. As someone with a lot of medical problems, I’ve realised that you often get what you pay for with GPs. Bulk billing GPs are usually ok strict time limits, or get booked out.

blissedofff [info] I overdosed in 2011. My roommate found me and drove me to the hospital. When I awoke, I was transported to a facility for a 72-hour hold ordered by the court. I was furious that my attempt failed. My dad drove 8 hours to pick me up and when he saw me, he cried. I’d only ever seen him cry once or twice before that. He was so relieved and hugged me in such a tender yet fierce way. A couple of years later, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Knowing more about myself, and why I am the way I am, makes things a tiny bit easier. Whenever those intrusive thoughts sneak back in, I think of my dad and I also snuggle with my kitty. She needs me, but not nearly as much as I need her. She makes me wanna stick around :) [info] None [info] 1568703979
Porkjungle [info] Stress has a heavy influence on episodes. Same with diet, sleep, and exercise. I'm sure hormones play a role, I've had symptoms since puberty and being a teenager was the worst.

Beouve [info] I cannot thank you enough for this comment, really, thank you.On a rational level I know what you're saying, I'm a psychology student, so I know those stuff, but it makes me suffer a lot. I feel like something's really wrong with me and I cannot be loved, and I'm scared of myself because if I try to be loved and fail again I might hurt myself or even worse, and I'm very scared.I don't have the strength to change right now. I might have one day, but now I know I don't have. I feel completely useless, like I'm wasting resources like water and air for nothing. I feel weak, my body feels weak, I barely eat, and my mood swings a lot.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so sometimes I feel like I have energy, like I might finally do something, change and everything, and then it makes me so very anxious and then I have a breakdown, and I feel even worse because I was so stupid to think things could be better.I feel like I'll never be able to be loved, and that I'm a failure as a man. I might die tomorrow due to an accident or something and I couldn't even do my job as a human being and as a male, which is to build a family. [info] None [info] 1569124173
orbitalLlama [info] Dude i'm in a similar boat to you, i've had to stop using drugs since I was diagnosed with bipolar. It sucks but its just something you have to do. Drugs are fun but there not worth ruining your life over, doublely so for people like us who have so much more to loose. When drugs make up your entire world its hard to picture a life without them but given enough time away you come to see how delusional of a way of thinking that is.

elqueco14 [info] Oh great job bud, super proud. Although I never said it wasn't my fault, I just thought it was funny how they acted like everything was cool for a few days.

urbanclictionary [info] Never had one before that! For this one I was suicidal and manic. I couldn’t sleep, but I also couldn’t get myself out of bed to do the simplest things like eat. I’d brush my hair every once in a while and go to the bathroom but that was it. When I did get up, it was to go running at like 2AM. For miles at a time. I decided to take a medical leave of absence once I found myself holding my bottle of benzodiazepines and sobbing and debating on downing them just to stop the things I was feeling. When I got to my out patient program I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD and haven’t had a psychotic episode like that again since. Went back to school and you wouldn’t have known I had a severe mental illness unless i told you. Graduated with 2 degrees and about to apply for grad school. Super weird. Any time someone gets a ouija board out I nope the fuck outta there [info] None [info] 1569164489
BeautifulGhost [info] From what I've learned with my doctor and research over the years it's a lot to do with medication and our unstable lifestyles when we stray from routine. Most of the medications cause weight gain and during episodes it's easy to stray from a healthy diet to over eating or not eating at all. I've had bipolar since my childhood but it wasnt treated until 7 years ago. I'm a rapid cycler so the ups and downs can sometimes change in as little as minutes. When this happens I CRAVE sweets. I can't control it and I'll cut anyone down who gets between me and the vending machine at work lol! My psychiatrist believes it's due to the instant release of dopamine that sugar gives us. Like a quick fix and a way for me to try and stop my sudden shifts. My metabolism is fast, my weight stays around 125lbs and I'm 5'6. My concern is all the sugar intake will cause me to have diabetes, it's a misconception that people who are overweight are the only ones who get diabetes.  Bipolar and diabetes are so toxic together because just like our mood shifts with bipolar our sugar also shifts constantly with diabetes. 3 years ago I went to a hospital because I was in a lot of pain and had a serious flu like cold.  I was also dizzy and my equilibrium was off. Once the doctor returned to the room she asked me how long ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She then went on to say that "sometimes, when those who suffer from this disorder have episodes, they often make things up in their heads that seem real but aren't." She gave me a xanax and released me with a pamphlet stating I had been treated for psychosis. My sister was with me and she about lost her shit in the room when the doctor said that to me. 3 days later I couldn't breathe and my mom rushed me to urgent care. I fainted when they took my blood pressure and was rushed to another hospital where I was admitted for a pneumonia, kidney infection and an unknown virus. They couldn't stabilize me and my doctor spent over 3 hours at my bedside trying to figure out how to treat the virus they had never seen before. It was so bad he started preparing my parents for worst case scenario and had a priest visit. I pulled out of it and was discharged 3 weeks later. Moral is a lot of doctors and providers write us off as being psychotic before actually treating the symptoms. I still remember hearing the nurse outside my room say "just a heads up this ones bipolar" and giggle to another coworker. When doctors dont give proper health care that can cause early death as well. [info] None [info] 1569165572
niccckiies [info] Same here! When I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, it made so much sense to me. But when I told anyone I was close to, they said 'that doesn't make sense'  (except my husband because he gets the brunt of the crazy. I have practiced reigning myself in over the years. As a teen I was a maniac and I got into loads of trouble but as an adult I am a mostly functional student, wife, parent, pet owner, etc. Before I was medicated I would lash out frequently but my family was on the receiving end. My friends and acquaintances wouldn't know that I'm like that. [info] None [info] 1569198379
grapesofwhine [info] Reverse ejaculation. It's a side effect of some anti psychotic medications.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***So I'll try to make this short:I basically don't want contact with my mother anymore.My parents ignored my mental health problems when I was younger. I've had to deal with them on my own and they blamed laziness and a lack of trying for me dropping out of school and other problems that resulted from it. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder after I ended up in a mental health clinic (you can guess why) and they still don't really take it seriously/act like it never happened. Anyway, they did help me out financially when I've had problems.Awhile ago I inherited some money, it's not too much but enough that I don't have to worry too much about money for awhile at least anymore. I've had some debts I paid off with it resulting from manic decisions and being unable to work.So my mother had her own debts (~4000) and decided this was the time for her to get what "I owed her" back. She did inherit more money than I did, btw.So she hit me up and *demanded* I paid off her debt because she helped me out all these years without wanting anything in return. (which isn't entirely true) she also brought up gifts that were on the more expensive side to justify this. In particular a vacation she gifted me (I in no way asked her to do this!) after my stay at the clinic to try and get my mind off of the things that happened that resulted in it.I was dumbstrucked to be honest.I was just getting back on my feet, rented a new flat, got a new job, started medication (finally and for the first time) and even though those 4000 $ was admittedly a small percentage of what I got it still was money I needed. I had no savings whatsoever and she knows that.And even though I'm doing much better these days I don't trust myself around money and am extremely fearful of losing it so I try to save it and not touch it in case I get manic again and end up needing it for worse times.I was just so hurt and to be completely honest it doesn't help that I do hold a bit of a grudge for how my parents mistreated me while growing up. I just know that things could've turned out differently had they acknowledged my problems sooner. I had to look for therapists myself, I barely made it out of bed for weeks at a time and they blamed it on me being lazy, I wouldn't eat for days because I was depressed and they'd tell me it was good because maybe I'd lose weight. Stuff like that...I ended up paying because honestly I just didn't want to argue about it but since then I just can't stand being around her anymore. Some people have told me I'm ungrateful and that I should just forget about it but I feel like I just can't.So AITA here?*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

lexior [info] I lived in Finland for a very long time and grew up there intermittently. From my experience:The social pressure that if you don't drink (enough) you are viewed as weak, especially amongst "the boys" (mostly in the youth culture I've noticed this)The fact that kela Will not provide me with English forms because I have a Finnish passport and speak the language (I speak it decently, but I don't think anyone speaks kela)As a child, the schools very tolerant behaviour towards bullying. I was locked into a bathroom for half of the day by a classmate and no action was taken. I was also on multiple occasions told by teachers that it was my fault for being strange or out of the ordinary. I hear these types of stories a lot from Finnish friends. The lack of information provided on the social structures aimed to help youth unemployment is abysmal. Yes, you have places like osaamo in Helsinki, but there are very very few ways to get informed about things you can do as a twenty something struggling to navigate life.The absolute fucking mess that is the mental health treatment. It took me two months to get into crisis counselling through my doctor, after which it took another two months to start any kind of treatment. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I had prior diagnoses from the NL clearly stating I had complex PTSD. I was put on medication without proper explanation as to why. Then admitted into aurora for day therapy for two months. After which I was deemed cured and handed a prescription for quetiapine and peragablin and sent on my merry way. From what I've heard, this is not at all uncommon and Finland still suffers from a backwards thinking when it comes to mental health. The bureaucracy absolutely does not help and the devastating rate of successful suicide attempts is testament that this should be talked about.The Finnish Postal service could suck my dick if I had one as well.Don't get me wrong, I love Finland, the beauty and the people, but there are issues that I think especially outsiders ignore because Finland really is viewed as this utopia where socialism meets capitalism in this beautiful marriage of alcoholic coffee drinking Adonis bodied sauna goers.

ketterno [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar, while it's not the same it's fucked me up dramatically. It's turned me into an absolute dirt rat because I have no motivation to clean anything ever and I'm so ashamed of it now it seems impossible to turn things around. Then when I'm in my manic stages it's not any better because all I seem to manage to do is go out to recklessly spend money and get drunk.

Hospitals have come a long way and everyone there is going to be focused on helping her. It will be temporary and is the safest thing for everyone.Be strong for her, make a desicion to have her hospitalized. This is coming from someone who needed my parents to make the decision.

Kindheartedspirit [info] I lived with my mom for 18 years of my life and during the last 6-7 years of my stay with her, it was awful. *I* diagnosed my bipolar disorder at 16 years old. When I was 17, my mom tried to get me to do Confirmation(a Catholic thing for those who don't know) and I told her I didn't want to because I didn't believe in God. Of course this led to fights with her. I even went to question my Confirmation teacher during my first year with him because f*** it's not worth my time and there's logically unsound ideas in Catholicism that I kept pointing out. When he finally was fed up with me, I stopped attending only to have to go *back* because my mom kept giving my stepdad crap about it so he asked me to do it for my mom who he later said she is sick in the head (said this in Vietnamese so it's the best translation). I thought it was unfair that I had to do this for her because she stopped being a good mom to me after she had my sisters *who happen to be my stepdad's kids with her*. But my diagnosis of her came out to be pretty accurate because lo and behold, here I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 (which I never thought would be the case until I kept spending lots of money on things I wanted and racking up credit card debts) and the only person I could have reasonably get it from is her. So what you said is *entirely not fair*. There's no reason for you to have to sacrifice your freedom when there's a car *right there* not being used. You're not taking her freedom away because if she wanted to go out, walking suffices. [info] None [info] 1569346301

ailangmee [info] There's an old saying, "if your psych likes you it's bipolar, if they don't like you it's bpd." This is a very old stereotype built on the belief that people with personality disorders don't want to get better, until DBT arrived in 1994 there was no therapy for bpd. I have been diagnosed with bipolar and recognise a lot of the symptoms and behaviours. I also see a lot of myself in bpd. There is a very high chance that I could have both. I work on therapy for both and enjoy the additional support of medication (mood stabilised + antidepressant atm). Life is fluid and changes all the time. We can only do the best we can with the information available.ETA: of course speak to your psych about it and mention your concerns. Tell your doctor all the symptoms you are experiencing.

Zeranonia [info] The suicidal thoughts.When a 5 year-old viciously says he wants to die, holds a knife to himself, does lots of self-harm with his nails, etc... you know that kid’s having a hard time in life. I was that kid.From the age of 5, I was diagnosed with bipolar, and medicine hadn’t helped until my sophomore year of high school. I’ll get to that later; let’s focus on the beginning.My earliest memories stem from being around 3-4 years old. So, essentially all my life (I’m nearly 17 as of right now), I’ve suffered to some great extent. I’ve been in and out of mental institutions, and I’m currently in a school located at a mental institution aimed at extra help. All of elementary school, I’d scratch myself to draw blood, I’d smash my head into the desk, I’d threaten myself, and I’d be just overall very noncompliant. Middle school was only separate from elementary school by not knowing anyone, since we moved states. So, I was far less open to people. When I was acting this way, so few people could understand me, and just... left. They didn’t know what to make of this kid being so angry and different. I hated myself and always wished I was dead, as to escape what felt like an endless nightmare with no escape. No one could figure me out, and so I was left friendless and hopeless.Mid-sophomore year of high school, I get my shit together. Medicine finally fucking worked and I could have a conversation with someone with a hint of normality. But I’ll be graduating this school year with a 2.0-ish GPA... half of what I deserve.I got straight A’s in my junior year, and expect to do fairly well for my senior year. I even have an IQ of roughly 132 - but my GPA simply can’t reflect that because I fucked my early high school life. Bipolar simply ruined my early life. It’s the reason I’ll never pass on my genes to new life, as to not bring more suffering to someone who doesn’t deserve it. It’s the reason I nearly died from suicide attempts numerous times. To this day, although I’m doing significantly better, I still hate my life and would prefer death, and so few understand it - all the more reason I don’t share my burdens too often. But I still am extremely pessimistic and nihilistic. Growing up like that made me stuck with a miserable mindset, and I don’t think that’s changing. It only has gotten worse, though it’s manageable. That’s something, at least.I realize that this is more “my life story so far” than “your normal lifestyle that shocks others,” but whatever. I completely acknowledge millions of others are waging, or unfortunately, have failed in waging this same war that I’m in, the same war I’ll die having gone through all my life. To anyone else with Bipolar, I wish the best on your battle against it. [info] None [info] 1569784534

Right before I was diagnosed with bipolar, my husband paid attention to the words of the song (even though he'd heard it many times) and when he got a moment, he texted me and told me to check it out. "I just really feel like this song is about you. It makes me sad." Life was so hard at that time. And that little moment made me feel that, despite my believing I wasn't worthy of it, he really loved and thought of me. Have since branched out to more of her stuff and she really gets it.

raeburnandwesley [info] 1. I’m in experimental psychology and am currently working at a university. Right now my main research focus is on the development of temperament in infants and small children, researching trends in behavior and brain structure/function that could serve as potential indicators for psychopathology in adulthood.2. Ah that is a good question. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 when I was 18, right as I was beginning undergrad. I had no idea what I wanted to study in school and my symptoms were growing out of control. That year was very difficult but I somehow managed to complete it, albeit with subpar marks. Soon after the beginning of my second year of undergrad I experienced the most severe depressive episode of my life. I was hospitalized and forced to withdraw from school. I started taking lithium at this time and took a year off school. During that year I spent a lot time learning about my illness and realized quickly how fascinated and interested I was in it and in psychopathology as a whole. There was power in understanding and I decided that I wanted to study psychology. In addition to this, I responded extremely well to my medication and soon my symptoms were much more manageable and I was able to return to school. I owe it to my medication and excellent treatment that I was even able to make it to grad school. Grad school itself was extremely strenuous, even with my symptoms at a manageable level. If my condition had been anywhere near as severe as it was at age 19/20 I definitely would not have been able to do it. My incredible mentors and colleagues and the fact that I was truly doing what I was passionate about and what I wanted more than anything was what got me through. I really enjoyed working in a lab. Lab work and learning were incredibly empowering for me and served as escapes. I am so proud of myself for what I’ve been able to accomplish as far as my schooling and thankful for what it allows me to do today. tl;dr With excellent treatment my symptoms were much more under control by the time I was in grad school. I had a huge love of what I was doing and a great support system. It was very difficult, and there were some bumps along the road, but that is how I survived. :) [info] None [info] 1569911926
-fucklife- [info] Hey, I went to a psychiatrist at the beginning of the year. My doctor had prescribed prozac, but it had negative effects which led her to think I might have bipolar. She referred me to a psychiatrist where I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and have been on several medications to help treat it. Bipolar is a lifelong disorder but can be managed with medication and therapy. I would recommend taking notes about how or what you want to say. And maybe track your moods before you go.

My parents weren’t really about it and raised me normally, but as an adult I fit all the criteria for aspergers as well as the criteria for bipolar type II. [info] None [info] 1569960028
spacegirlvisited [info] When I told a friend of mine that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder he said, "Careful with medication, exercise and diet are better than any medication on the market. Honestly think it cures any mental illness symptoms. I’ve been doing yoga too and that’s great."  Thanks for the tip, once I stop my medication I'll be sure to let the voices know.

ana30671 [info] My initial diagnosis was done after seeing my gp and asking to see their in house pdoc. I had no longstanding history of counselling. The psychiatrist went over basic diagnostic type questions as an evaluation, with our interview probably taking no more than 30 minutes. I was diagnosed with bipolar. When I went to my second psychiatrist questioning the diagnosis 6 months later, again our meeting was short, us going over symptoms, and was diagnosed again with bipolar. Current pdoc was even quicker, when he asked about my symptoms and I described how things have been for me and within a few sentences he said basically "oh yeah that's definitely bipolar".Psychiatric illnesses don't have specific tests, so it's not like you can expect it to take hours or days to be diagnosed. There are specific diagnostic criteria that the doctor looks for to make the decision. 20 minutes seems reasonable to me, that gives the two plenty of time to discuss previous and current symptoms and life experiences. If either of you are that dismissive of the idea just speak with your general practitioner about how you can get a second opinion. [info] None [info] 1570147386
recoveringPSteacher [info] Yeah, I agree with this. I’m from a rural area. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1998. I was scared as shit to tell anyone — my parents thought it could be prayed away or just ignored it all together (I was in college). While there’s still a stigma associated with mental illness, I don’t feel like I have to “hide” my diagnosis. I teach high school and have even shared my diagnosis with my students in an effort to remove shame and stigma. My students (and their parents) have always been very supportive, and it often opens a dialogue with students who suffer from their own mental illnesses. [info] None [info] 1570149371
Anxietyfuckedmeup [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and began Ability which did nothing for me. Then I went on to take seroquel which improved my stability with the trade off of making me quite tired and lethargic because I needed quite a high dose. I have since been put on trileptal as well as a low dose of seroquel. Long story short, seroquel high dose made me a zombie but made me not go back to the hospital. Lower dose is great for me.

Emhollrah [info] I decided against having kids long before I was diagnosed with bipolar. I have considered adopting an older child because those are the least likely to get adopted and for some reason I love teens &amp; tweens, but I have developed a serious health problem that will shorten my lifespan shall we say. Instead I became a Big Sister and got five bonus brothers out of it! [info] Clinically Awesome [info] 1570162630

BeatnikMona [info] Me too! Ten years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I basically noped out of my doctors office and never went back. I went years without therapy or medication and I ended up doing a lot of impulsive stupid shit—it’s like I would do a years worth of stuff in two months, I can’t even describe it. I came across Crazy Ex Girlfriend because I like musicals, and I related to Rebecca SO much it was uncanny (I even moved somewhere for a guy that I wasn’t in a relationship with completely out of nowhere). I, too, was inspired to get an appointment with a therapist, and now that I’m medicated, my life is so much better. This show is so much more than a musical comedy for me, and I’m so happy that there are others who feel the same way and were able to get the treatment that they need. [info] None [info] 1570269041
Chirpasaraus [info] I’m not from California originally, but I lived there from 2008-2010. I was put on a 5150 in 2009 at the age of 23. If you were held at Langley in Feb, hey, maybe we shared a room.I’m absolute in my belief that 5150’s are not the answer for every person that’s experiencing mental health issues, including psychosis. It definitely wasn’t for me. I completely agree with one of your comments that first line of defensive should be intensive outpatient first, not an involuntary hold.The first time I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was locked up on a 5150. Here’s a tip for doctors. If you want to ensure that someone fights hard against believing their bipolar diagnosis and if you want to set them up for months of noncompliance to medication, put them on a 5150 when you make the diagnosis.I have never fought something so hard and become so enraged as the time someone took away my personal freedom and held me against my will due to a label of “insanity.” Was I psychotic? Probably. Was I a danger to myself or others? Not in the slightest. I was not suicidal nor had I threatened violence against anyone. Therefore I feel like my 5150 was completely unjustified and unhelpful. Hospitals are not the best places for mental health recovery. You’re in an unfamiliar place, surrounded by strangers, many of whom are deeply experiencing their own mental trauma. You’re literally stripped of your clothes and personal belongings. You’re untrusted to be alone, have shoelaces, toothbrushes, and you’re constantly being watched. Being under lock and key against your will is only adding to the injury. This environment is completely unhelpful and I would argue, further traumatizing, to someone struggling with mental health problems. In truth, the 5150 only adds to the problems. For me, it helped amplify my paranoia against people who cared about me, it ensured my resistance to medication, and deepened the depths of my sadness, my aloneness and despair. I would abolish that legislation in an instant if I had the means to. No one else should go through what I did. Good luck with your work. [info] None [info] 1570272283
eggplant3000 [info] Yes, I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and put on Wellbutrin and lamictal and looking back the lamictal actually helped a ton with my adhd because mood disregulation is a big problem for me. Wellbutrin is also prescribed for adhd as well, which helped I’m sure. I eventually went off of it because my new school psychiatrist said he didn’t believe my diagnoses, which was really, really upsetting even tho he turned out to be right. I was only diagnosed a little over a month ago with adhd. [info] None [info] 1570388626
DisturbedLee [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar as a kid and more recently, last six years or so, bipolar with psychosis. So I mostly have psychosis episodes while in a bipolar episode but sometimes out side of them as well.  I'd been on different meds for various mental issues since a was a young child. I know they work and can be very helpful. I personally don't like to take medicine anymore though for various reasons. I like to learn about the issues and how they work and how people deal with them, and that helps me understand it better and be in more control of it. One thing I really need to work on is that sleep routine. It's a mess, but I have a hard time going to sleep sometimes and other times I have a hard time waking up. Meditation used to help really well. I'd meditate for 10-15 minutes before bed then listen to a sleep story and be out in minutes. It doesn't work so well anymore. Eating better is one thing everyone tells me I need to do. And I would if I could, but I just can't afford it. If I eat, I eat as cheap as possible most of the time. I eat one meal at the end of the day, or if food is low I'll eat once every couple of days. So that is a pretty big problem, but I've done this for so long it's just become normal for me and I forget it's a problem. I'm at the point I don't desire food until it's in front of me. I'll work on my sleeping habits, try to get back in control of that. I'll probably get back into a meditation routine as well to help. The eating situation will have to stay as it is for now.

realcalidairy [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar, and there are some times where it gets rough. However, my wife just said this to me two days ago, "it's okay that your like this, a lot of people have this problem" and encouraged me to be more accepting of myself.

cometostay [info] I'm going to take a slightly different attitude on this. I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2, and it's been one hell of a ride. I've been seriously suicidal and in very dark places. The right meds made all the difference for me, and I'm doing pretty well now.I'm also a mental health counselor. There's this idea of the wounded healer in counseling, and it essentially means that a lot of people with mental health issues or have been through some shit in their lives end up in helping professions because they can better empathize and relate to their clients, and they often want to help others in the same way they've been helped. It can turn problematic if someone doesn't deal with their own issues prior to trying to help others and can be an issue if someone becomes impaired and doesn't do anything about it.But honestly, I'm a better counselor because of what I've gone through myself.

thefriendykas [info] I was taking Modafinil 100mg for a while, before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 rapid cycling about a month ago.Honestly I was only taking 100mg to 200mg per day on days where I felt sluggish. Occasionally even when I felt good but knew I had a long day ahead.It basically feels like someone is keeping your eyelids open with those eye clamp things lol, but your still technically tired which is a strange feeling.I'm personally trying to stay off them while they get to my therapeutic dose of Lamictal. I want to see how it goes with out any help from other pharmaceutical drugs.I have been taking some herbal stuff for alertness and cognitive function.Been going well so far but it's a lot less edgy and not nearly as intense.I'm taking rhodiola and lion's mane.

A therapist and psychiatrist can do wonders. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1. I ended up on the right cocktail of meds and life has been good ever since. I’m not saying this will fix you but it’s a start to getting better. I have no friends my family isn’t supportive of me. That’s ok now. My therapist has taught me to worry about me.

MoistFlatulence [info] I mean, I did, but I didn't take it for granted. I used the time I would have spent working towards my study, I drank maybe 8 times over 4 years and didn't touch any drugs. I felt horribly guilty they were investing so much in me. I was diagnosed with bipolar half way through, I was extremely lucky to have that extra support.My parents are a lot older than most and know that they won't be alive to support me and my sister if the shit hits the fan hence why they doing everything they can to set us up now. I'll likely be their care takers in what's hopefully more than a decade's time. I'm 24, they're in their early 70's.

littlestarfire89 [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar and then told its borderline, then to top it all off when I finally get the courage to see a therapist after trying to cope with the disorder myself, it seems that they missed over the complex ptsd. A lot of my borderline tendencies were causes of flashbacks. I could have learned to handle the last decade of my life more delicately than I had. I missed out on a lot because of no one recognizing the differences within situations.  No one helped walk me through dealing with certain emotions or even acknowledging what those emotions have/had been. It hurts knowing my life could have been different. Its difficult to deal with now. Life could have been different but make the best of what is there now. I wish you the best, honestly. [info] None [info] 1570831829

SagiTsukiko [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teen despite not having manic episodes of any sort. I was abused and traumatized, and surprise, i acted like i was abused and traumatized. I learned how to control myself through dialectical behavioral therapy and processing what's happened to me on my own using the skills i learned there. I basically learned coping skills and social skills I was not previously taught because I wasn't socialized well as a child and did not have any healthy models for emotions. Explicit discussion of psychiatric diagnoses was banned in the group i attended.  As an aside, I really hate how literal children will be diagnosed with a "chemical imbalance" and get doped up with neuroleptics and lithium when they're actually being abused at home. Never met a kid with a happy home life during the 12+ times i was involuntarily committed as a teenager. [info] None [info] 1571091682
caramel_kiss [info] Um okay, do you have a medical degree? Because the professionals I've spoken to with medical degrees have said psychosis is a symptom of bipolar. I'm bipolar, I am diagnosed with bipolar with psychotic features which is a real disorder. Psychosis is not a bad thing, so why are you so strongly rejecting the notion that bipolar people are psychotic? A lot of us are, it's just another medical symptom.

mayidescend [info] I got diagnosed with BPD as soon as I turned 18, the psychiatrist i saw refused to diagnose BPD or any other major disorder until official adulthood- so I got diagnosed with basically everything else instead until then (it was annoying).At age 19 I started going to a different psychiatrist and decided not to inform her of past diagnosis to see if what I was diagnosed with truly was right. I even saw a therapist who I practiced the same thing with.I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, with small mania symptoms (the grading scale each of them used had mania with bpd 1).I learned how to manage my symptoms through therapy and eventually, at 20, was taken off medication (which I’ve been on different medications since age 11), and later in the year was released from therapy after being in it on and off since age 6/7. I wasn’t fully better, but I had the necessary skills to become better than I was in the past.Im nearly 22 now.I go to the same Psychiatrist every 3 months now. Just to make sure I’m managing myself alright: and She says I’m showing more mania signs off the medication, but all together, all my symptoms have gone down drastically to the point of me being considered “healed” if I maintain it for two more years.I still have bad spells, but I also have pretty good days as well. When I notice myself getting low, i practice what I’ve learned. Same thing if I notice myself getting too high and want to avoid a ‘crazy ‘spell.We are human beings and we are designed to adapt and change.We are adapting and changing.Kudos to you, and I wish you the best luck on the rest of your journey.Xo [info] None [info] 1571192803

EnvyEarthworm [info] Holy.shit. SO BAD. So I have an autoimmune disease. The early symptoms were hypersomnia, and then severe insomnia, and pain. I would also turn blue. When I was a young teenager, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was treated with zoloft, and started becoming suicidal. So they switched the meds, and I became worse. The doctor referred me to a psychiatrist and she said BPD. I ended up taking DOZENS of different drugs with no improvement. At 18, when I could legally make my own medical choices, I stopped all treatment. Funny enough, I got better. I was still in pain, and severely tired, so I went back to the doc. He saw the medical chart and said "You're fat and depressed, and that's why you're in pain." It wasn't until I moved, changed my name, and refused to show anyone my past medical chart that I was finally taken seriously. Really though, plenty of doctors used to see my chart and think that I was a drug seeker, that I just needed more mood stabilizers, or that I was (and I quote) a hypochondriac. Doctors say the most fucked up shit when they think you're crazy. The wrong diagnosis delayed a real diagnosis for years. [info] None [info] 1571244030
holdmydietcoke [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for almost 4 years now, it gets easier I promise.  It can take a while to stabilize and/or find the right med combination for you.  The most important things that help me are being self-aware and just overall trying my best.  When I'm experiencing the irritability, the best thing I can do is excuse myself from the situation, take a breather and let myself cool down.

MistressVelveetaVida [info] Ok I think I might have some perspective on the meds thing at least. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 15. It was bad. I'm almost 42.  I've been trying to find meds and combos that work until about 2 years ago when I when to a psychiatrist who did something call a "gene sight" test. Basically they take a cheek swab and send it into this lab and they then send your doc the reports of almost every drug for this and tells you which ones most likely won't work, ones you should not take, ones most likely to work and if the levels of medication you're on is too high, too low or just right. I was very surprised with the results, my doc ended up changing a few doses of my meds, stopping some and trying ones from the list of most likely to help. I cannot express how much this has changed my quality of life. Have a sit down with your doc and lay ot all on the table. You may require inpatient treatment for a short period of time to safely change medications. I wish you the best of luck [info] None [info] 1571364479
mostlygray [info] I don't recall.  I want to say .1mg but I could be way out of line. It was a minimal dose once a day ostensibly for bipolar (poor diagnosis).

Don't even get my started on Klonopin.  That one made me go damn near insane.I was diagnosed with bipolar because I was in a good mood at the time of the interview but complained of stress.

lifewasjustabridge [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2. If I'm going to be honest it can at times be a very serious sickness and can require a lot of medical care as well as a strong support system- meaning loved ones including yourself. the best thing to keep in mind is that bipolar is an illness that has symptoms which can alter a person's decision making, their characteristics and their habits. It's important to remember that at certain times the person may be acting in a way that just isn't them - it's the illness. And in those cases helping that person to seek treatment or see a doctor is the best thing you can do. It can certainly be managed with the right treatment and hopefully this person you're seeing is taking care of their mental health.Best to you both [info] None [info] 1571621906

Christine_McPherson [info] Hey guys. So I was diagnosed with bipolar II at the end of last month and my psychiatrist has put me on fluoxetine after lamotrigine. I had to stop taking lamotrigine because I couldn’t remember when or how to take it. Today marks week two of my dosage and this morning I took two 10mg pills instead of just one, but now I’m feeling a little bit paranoid and wondering if my psych put me on fluoxetine to see if I’m really bipolar?I’ve been in denial about my diagnosis from the get-go, mostly feeling as though I was over exaggerating everything even though all that I told my psych and therapist was true. In our last meeting, my psych said that she would screen me for adhd. Coupled with some friends doubting my diagnosis as well, I’m feeling like a big old fraud. But what I find most concerning is that I haven’t been prescribed an antipsychotic to go along with fluoxetine. I haven’t experienced any hypomania though, and I have been in a depressive slump due to some external factors. Could it be possible that my psych is just prescribing me fluoxetine without an antipsychotic to test if I am bipolar or not? [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1571662934

derf0925 [info] The best thing for me was to just relax and try to stop thinking so much (it sounds stupid but trust me) and then I would try and make a detailed list on what your doing or want to do so that way if your mind races off you can be like "oh here's what I was thinking of" other people don't have to understand it as long as you can look back at it and remember what you were doing it's all good. As far as motivation goes I just try and enjoy the process and the outcome as much as possible. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 when I was 6 but as I grew up I realized I just didn't really communicate with people and had to start forming morals and guidelines for myself.

Magpiedove [info] People always need some 'power moves' to make some difference. It is truely painful, and sometimes it doesn't work out as it planned and s\*\*ts get screwed up. But there is always a lower floor. I feel thankful for those people who make posts about their incomparable depressing life and sometimes they make some memes out of it. I appreciate these people not just because they showed their inner confidence, but also it's the sign that they are looking for help because there is some hope left for themselves. Every time i see such people, i exhale with relief.I'm 19 years old, and I too, have the exact same problem as you. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and several other minor mental health issues for over 3 years and since then, i have to take medications everyday and sometimes have to go see the therapist. I cut all contacts from everyone i knew from elementary school to college, because i lost faiths in social life, and i am currently resting from the college after 2 months of massive stress.The only people I still have high hopes only exist on the internet. I also crave from love and attention since my ex kicked me a year ago, but my anxious ass can't control my body. I'm still trying my best to pull my stuffs together. And I can see that you are also trying so hard not to give up on yourself. I sincerely thank you for still trying your best and not giving up on yourself. World is already a cold place for such people like us, and that is why I want you to be a little bit more patient.It is painful to just stay and watch the process, yes, I understand.

cacophonica [info] I think you're very pretty, honestly a 8-9/10. You sound like someone who has thought long and hard about their appearance, and I think you're psyching yourself out. It sounds like your yo-yo weight gain and loss is due to stress, as well as the hair and nails issues. Body dysmorphia is rough. Sounds dumb and obvious, but have you considered therapy? When I was diagnosed with bipolar, therapy was the only thing I could do to manage disordered or obsessive thoughts having to do with my appearance. I've had body dysmorphia since I was 9, and so far therapy is the only thing that helps. I think you should try wire-framed glasses or any accessory with gold. You have beautiful olive skin and I feel like you'd feel like you look brighter. [info] None [info] 1572224304
hatefulharpy [info] Absolutely. Sometimes it will be minutes or even hours between feeling absolutely okay or absolutely losing my shit and ready to pull my hair out or breaking down into hysterics or feeling numb or ready to lay down in the middle of train tracks. Doesn’t help that I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 as well but... The tried and true method that seems to help is the distract -&gt; relax -&gt; cope from distress tolerance in DBT. I haven’t learned everything about it yet but there is a DBT workbook you can purchase (or find the PDF version online). [info] None [info] 1572240220
wolfboy42 [info] It can be, but it's different for each person.  I was diagnosed with bipolar II, which was mild enough that the doctor put me on antidepressants to get through the lows along with guided mindfulness meditation sessions.  My manias only amount to me needing very little sleep, talking a mile a minute while jumping from topic to topic, and losing weight.  Sometimes I also become very irritable and get angry over what seems like little things in hindsight.  That's my least favorite symptom, but the mindfulness meditation helps manage it well.  I also think I get on my wife's nerves more during those times, but she is awesome and understands what's going on.Edit: added mindfulness treatment as I forgot it was something that was originally used but that I use on my own now.  Also added irritability as a symptom.Edit 2: As another user pointed out, Bipolar II doesn't experience true mania.  It's also not the symptom that I went to the doctor for.  At the end of the day, make sure you are open and honest with your doctor or therapist so that they can help you. [info] None [info] 1572322445
lsmels [info] Hi I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2 and GAD. I take seroquel XR and took it all through my pregnancy and currently while BFing. I was on 200mg but dropped it down to 50mg. I'm also prescribed klonopin as needed but I'm much more leery to take this if I know I'll be feeding soon and I only took it 2 or 3 times during pregnancy. My psych is super conscientious about meds and pregnancy and made me nervous about benzos while breastfeeding. My psych, OB and baby's pediatrician all know about the seroquel and didn't have an issue with it, and I didn't notice any withdrawal symptoms in him after birth. I also used to take lamictal and my psych didn't have any issue with that but did tell me to start taking a folic acid supplement along with my prenatal due to he chance of neural tube defects.

shamy52 [info] I've done reasonably well on Lexapro for years so I think I'm OK there.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 less than two weeks ago (although I'd had my suspicions for several months) and so far I'm loving Seroquel.  :D  I feel like I spent 20 years begging doctors to give me a pill to make me sleep (I took Ambien as a young woman and hallucinated but it worked, I fell asleep and woke up rested!)  Finally, Negrete the PA gave me Seroquel and I've slept like a baby since.  I'm hoping I can stay on these two long term.  :)I don't remember why I was so sad the day of the Magic MRI but it was probably situational, having to do with the clusterfuck that is living with MS.  I know it was after my divorce so probably I was sad about *that* heartbreak or maybe I was sad because of the rebound relationship I had after that or maybe it was a family situation... it's great that I can't remember what it was because that means the situation resolved.  :P [info] None [info] 1572552354
caraconcerta [info] Why not both? WLS is a tool to help us realize our limitations, therapy is a tool used to help realize our mental limitations and overcome them. They can peacefully coincide and work with one another, no? They certainly have for me thus far. I am diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder, had binge eating issues and the first two months have been nothing less than unendingly agonizing. But that being said, it was the care I got through bariatrics, my psychiatrist, and my therapist that made the difference. I mean, that's what hospitals strive for right? Coordinated care? That's why nutritionists work with bariatrics, and most programs have us go to support groups. I'm sorry therapy did not work for you. That is unfortunate. I am glad that the surgery is treating you well mentally and physically! [info] 25F | VSG 9/9/19 | 5'8" | SW: 310 | CW: 217 [info] 1572552778

littlehoneypossum [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar at the beginning of the year and I definitely recommend seeing a doctor about it! Even if you don't get on medication or anything like that, it's nice to know what is actually going on up there and with a diagnosis you can be given access to a registered nurse who can help you with therapy and medication (if you choose to take it). After a few months of mania and no sleep I remember taking seroquel for the first time and being like "ohhh... being tired feels... nice". I'm not on it anymore but I still think the diagnosis and the nurse are both helpful in my everyday life. PM if you wanna discuss more! [info] None [info] 1572566883

Gateway2000PC [info] Just want to say that i relate and fit squarely in this discussion.  I was diagnosed with bipolar at 22 after a breakdown due to a stressful work situation and i flew into a rage triggering lots of hostile emails and faxes (which were an in thing back then)I was put on all these bipolar meds lithium depakote and anti depressants.  I got fatter and angrier but not really better.  At one point i was almost 300 lbs.   i was up to 6 meds a day.   I finally got off all meds myself and had some rocky times before i leveled out in my personal life. Still any kind of stressful associations were tough — work, church , friendships.   a psychologist i met with for a long time finally diagnosed me with BPD in 2013.  Just so i wouldnt get hurt if i needed government benefits he didnt remove the bipolar DX.  Unfortunately - i got a bit borderline with him (LOL) and didnt continue treatment.  I have been through about 28 therapists over the years.Since 2016 - i have taken one med - Risperidone and i would say it helps to take the edge off but it is not a cureThe one thing i have done well is manage my own litte part time consulting business but when things get to stressful or i do work outside my normal routine — a borderline episode springs into beingAbout 6 weeks ago i started DBT therapy.

diverted_siphon [info] When I was your age I was briefly convinced I was asexual, I struggled with my identity and why I didn’t conform to social norms particularly the pursuit of emotional and sexual relationships. 5 years later I was diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder type 2, and ADHD. I wasn’t particularly gender conforming(I’m skinny af, I have long hair, occasionally wore women’s clothing for the luls, didn’t engage in typical masculine behaviour, etc.) I have no doubt I would have been pressured to trans if I grew up now. Almost 10 years since my diagnosis and something like 5 or 6 different drugs later I’m mostly stable and somewhat successful, not what I could have been if I was neurotypical but those are the cards I was dealt. Drugs aren’t the answer and I can’t give you specific advice towards seeking care, but there’s a few things to note, and I owe a debt to Cree culture here: Mental health should be approached holistically, that is physical, psychological, spiritual, and cultural. You should seek a psychiatrist and a psychologist who work together to assess and monitor your health, I’m very pro pharmaceuticals but you need to take them as prescribed, and under supervision, they are dangerous but modern psychiatric drugs are amazing. Unfortunately it can take months to even get a referral to a psychiatrist, and longer to find one that works with you. They might not seem to “listen” or provide advice, but their job is to treat your body and right now you’re still growing and a mess of hormones. It does get better though. It’s anything but easy, and you’ll never be normal, but you’re not alone and you can live a fulfilling life. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions or need to vent. In the words of Red Green, I’m pulling for ya, we’re all in this together and keep your stick on the ice. [info] None [info] 1573197215

Kaniela420 [info] I've never been officially diagnosed with 1 or 2, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar 3 times by different Dr's and therapists. I can tell you though that I most definitely am more inclined to believe I am bipolar 1, as I experience auditory hallucinations at times, and some pretty ghastly psychosis experiences. But, I've never been hospitalized for it, and apparently a lot of folks read that in a description and believe that to be a pre-requisite for a diagnosis of bipolar 1.I think I'm just better at suppressing my actual thoughts and feelings when I know I have an audience that has the authority to lock me up against my wishes. Probably my misspent youth doing illegal shit and evading cops.  My depressive phases, quite the contrary to what most people describe with 1 and 2, are actually relatively short. I'd say on average maybe 1 to 2 weeks, although I have had a depressive episode last upwards of a year once or twice. My Mania, on the other hand, is frequent and has a mighty large reserve tank when the gas runs low. My longest manic episode I would say lasted more than a year. As I don't have much of a frame of reference for the depressive side, (besides loss of interest in hobbies/things I've enjoyed, staying in bed and staying in my sweats and not bathing for a week at a time, isolating myself from everyone I know and becoming quiet and distant), I'll give you a rundown of what mania/hypomania looks like, for me.It starts out; everything is fucking AWESOME! I have so much energy and I feel so good, I really need to get this house clean! Oh wow I finished the house in no time! You know what, I should really clean out my closet and get rid of a bunch of shit I don't wear.... You know what? I'm having such a great day, and it's so beautiful out, I should have a Corona! Wow this beer tastes good, I think I'll have 1 or 2 more. Hmm.... I have a pretty nice buzz going, but I really feel like having a shot. I'm gonna go for a drive to the next town over that has the only liquor store in the valley open on Sundays and bump some gangsta rap. Man it sucks being in such a celebratory mood and not having anyone to hang out with, I'm gonna start blowing up Facebook with funny commentary and trying to hit up all my long lost friends on chat! Oh my God I have such a great idea on how to effectively make our partnership with our global convergys reps more cohesive! And while I'm at it, I'm going to put a training together on how to use our engineering coverage maps, I guess that means I'll have to learn how to ACTUALLY be what I always claim to be on my resumes, "proficient" in PowerPoint! Fuck it, I'll figure it out, I'll just wing it! Oh shit only 2 hours before my husband gets home and he doesn't like it when I drink, I wonder if I have time to pop in to the bar around the corner and have a couple crown and cokes and make it back here before he gets home... I just want to socialize a little bit! Next morning, after blacking out and getting maaaaybe 3 hours of sleep. "Oh damn. I think I might still be a little drunk. How did I even make it to bed last night? Why is my husband sleeping on the couch? No time to deal with that dfamay, gotta get ready to go get dis bread!" *Spends a COPIOUS amount of time fixing hair and makeup and getting those wings JUST RIGHT. Takes forever picking out a necklace and boots to accessorize perfectly* "well shit. I'm 10 minutes late as usual. Where are my damn keys!?" *Gets to work, spends entire morning meeting interrupting everyone and trying to make sure I command the most attention and have a funny comment or anecdote for every single topic that is mentioned.* *Starts on PowerPoint for that great idea I had last night. "Oh you need me to help you work your follow-ups? Sure! Bring em on! Gosh our servicing partners have a lot of questions, but I absolutely can NOT leave any of them unanswered. But the more I answer them the more they private message me and only come to me with their questions... Oh well, this should help get me some recognition so I have some visibility for that promotion I always say I don't want..." Before long I am over extended and HIGHLY annoyed and snappy and bitchy with ANYONE that tries to transfer me a call, as if it's their fault I'm busy...Aaaah home after a long day, time to pick a fight with my husband and be annoyed by my son's existence. I need some alone time. I'm gonna go see if there's any leftover fun drugs I can crush and snort. God my life is so MUNDANE and eventless. You know what would make me feel better? Some retail therapy. I'm gonna buy a bunch of clothes online and then because I can't wait I'm gonna go to a local store and buy a cute new outfit! None of my clothes fit me anymore because I've already dropped a fuckton of weight because I'm manic, plus I just cleaned out my closet today, I've earned it! This goes on, and on, and ON, for days or weeks, my fuse gets shorter and shorter and I fucking RAGE and go mad hoss at the slightest inconvenience. Then, thanks to good ol lack of sleep and photo editing projects, I start hearing shit. "What is that sound? Why does it sound like 2 morning radio DJ's talking? I don't have the radio on... Why is it so muffled like I can't ever make out what they're actually saying??" Then, the visual fuckery comes into play. -ESPECIALLY- if I am home alone, which I fucking HATE being home alone as I am convinced that the bad man has been laying in wait, waiting for the opportunity for me to be alone so he can rape/murder me. Throw that in with the eye fuckery and the muffled voices of 2 dudes in another room... We've got ourselves a party! I once carried a 9mm throughout the house all night and all morning long, convinced that there were people in the house that were going to get me. I saw someone's glasses reflecting in the moonlight watching me from the park across the street... I even called the cops and made them patrol my house. Twice. My house is fucking tiny. With paper thin walls. I can't believe they didn't haul my ass off. The best one was my most recent psychosis though, where I became convinced that my hairline was receding and that it was caused by scalp ringworm I must have gotten from my son or our dog. I walked around the house, spraying the walls with bleach water, I thought the cobwebs were mold or some sort of fungus that wanted to collect my hair. The spiders in the shower were watching me in eager wait to collect my hair, I saw them eating it, or making a web with it, I wasn't sure which. The flies were working with them, it was a covert op where they would dive bomb me, snatch my hair and give it to the spiders, who would then in turn give it to the mold monsters. I wore a beanie inside at all times, to try to protect my hair. It went on for several days, and didn't stop until my husband came and collected me out of the front yard, where I was sitting, picking ringworm pebbles out of a beanie I had just pulled out of the dryer, refusing to go inside because I didn't want to lose any more of my hair... He had to walk me around and make me point out the things I was seeing, so that he could explain them away for me. THAT. was a real muthafucka of a psychosis. Worst one yet, though thus far I've only had about 4 major events since I was diagnosed. As I get older, my symptoms get worse, even with medication. My rage gets more severe, my fuse shorter, the flight of rapid fire ideas, becoming early overwhelmed, crippling fear of calling places for bills, Dr's appts, basically any grown up obligation. And the presence of those auditory hallucinations definitely grows more prevalent. And so, yeah.... That about sums it up... Sound anything like your thing? Lol [info] None [info] 1573310303

Medical bills are expensive.Then they drove me two hours away in handcuffs after i said i would comply with everything, had me involuntarily committed to a mental ward even though I did everything i was asked, meaning i would need a doctors note to leave instead of being able to check myself out after 72 hours.I was malnourished and didn't eat a vegetable for two days because they messed up my order. I had diarrhea for the 6 days i was there and a week afterwards.I was treated with disrespect. I asked for a lawyer every step of the way, saying I am an America Citizen and i would like to exercise my right to a lawyer because i am afraid i am not being treated right. The police said since i wasn't under arrest, i couldn't hire one.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, as a man. My father does not have bpd and i have not displayed any symptoms. The doctor says its because: i spoke to quickly and i had a "manic" episode during a time when the day and night are of equal lengths, so now i have to deal with that nightmare.Call someone. Don't call the nonemergency line.I wasn't allowed to go outside and they chose my diet, then wondered why I had a vitamin D deficiency. I don't know what i did wrong. I begged them to help me understand. They just told me im crazy.Every one of my actions has logic and reasoning. I try to practice mindfulness and i have gotten very good at it.I would like help finding a lawyer with a cheap or no consultation fee.

AquinoLoayza [info] Apologies, I got trapped in a book.May I ask how long she has been seeing a therapist? Either way its clearly going to depend on her situation.When I was diagnosed with bipolar as well as frequently having panic attacks, I did not get support. What I got was people telling me I was weak and useless. Obviously thats not very productive.I would say that if you listen, just listen, that will be a fantastic way to support her. Some do not et it, sometimes all it takes is listening, without judgement,to change a life. Even save it.Edit: You are a very good person for standing by her, when so many are left to pull themselves out. We developed as a species together, we form bonds because it assures survival. Over so many, many generations, thats not something that just goes away. When it does , tho, thats when issues arise. Someday we will better understand whats going on, and how to treat it properly. Until then, we are stuck with one another. [info] None [info] 1573430531
jncummins86 [info] Although I appreciate the sentiment, I can say with all honesty I have no alternatives than to keep taking what I’m on. I have been diagnosed with bipolar since 2009. This year is the first time I’ve ever tried lithium and this is the first time in my entire life that I am feeling “normal” emotional range. Unfortunately, given all I went through these past two years and the consequences of trying pregnancy safe alternatives after the no meds at all attempt, I am certain I will attempt suicide if I get that low again. On the flip, I am almost certain I will lose my marriage with the next extreme mania. Lithium can do a lot of harm during pregnancy. But I’m told by both my psych APRN and my OBGYN that through monitoring more regularly and closely and maintaining my health otherwise it is possible to deliver a happy healthy baby with no side effects from it. TBH, I’m amazed at how calm I have been posting this and responding... each passing day I realize more how much it’s important for me to stay on my meds the way they are.I hope you are able to find what works for you. It’s almost as unhealthy TTC while mentally unstable as it is to be on meds that MAY have effects... the struggle to know what’s best for you is real. Much love to you. [info] None [info] 1573431262
SartesLazyEye [info] Hello! I am diagnosed with bipolar 1 and ADHD. This is actually a rather tricky situation, a huge side effect of attention stimulants is that they can cause irritability, mood swings, and excitability--which are all bipolar symptoms. However, if your mood symptoms are properly stabilized with a mood stabilizer, then you shouldnt be susceptible to those side effects. I personally am on lamictal, hydroxizine, and abilify. And adding adderal literally changed my life for the better. However, one thing i did experience was when i started i became a little hypomanic, then slightly emotionless following that peroid. However, now all that stabilized and i just get high attention and productivity, with our any impact on my mood [info] None [info] 1573432723
cupcakesprinkle [info] BPD and Bipolar disorders are both misdiagnosed in Autistic adults often. If you don't feel like you fit the criteria for BPD, I really wouldn't take that to heart.I was diagnosed with bipolar II, but I really don't think I fit the diagnostic criteria. My therapist who specializes in ASD in adults told me that happens a lot.If you need someone to PM just to chat about this and stuff, I'm here! [info] None [info] 1573500391
q1w2e3dude [info] Sounds great man, on my journey I've noticed mood swings and PMO are definitely related, probably something to do with our brain chemistry - or simply walking around with empty balls all the time.I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and even went on medication for some time, but since I started my nofap streaks I've been much more stable and can deal with life issues in a much more balanced manner.Cheers bro!!

uglydunce [info] Personally, I think overtime everything just gets so much worse. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 15 and I thought my diagnoses was a bucket of fuck because I couldn’t pull out a single symptom of mania/ hypomania in myself.. (They were there, and other people saw them.. Just not me).. But as I aged the symptoms became stronger to the point even I could notice them.. Just be sure to tell your psychiatrist about any new developments or any new way you’ve been acting...So they can adjust your medication and everything.. I’m only 17 so my advice isn’t the best... But I hope things get better! [info] None [info] 1573505952
taylynnmorr [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about 3 years ago and once my psychiatrist told me about it (I had only really seen or heard of bipolar disorder from media perspective) I knew the symptoms related to me pretty dead on.  I started a medicine called Lamictal, which has very mild side effects compared to Lithium.  The meds work well and although nothing is perfect it has helped me a lot!  Hope this helps [info] None [info] 1573615931
coconutfi [info] That’s exactly what happened to me.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 20, but in hindsight I definitely had symptoms even at age 15-16.  Not frequent, but significant enough for me to recognize it as the disorder. [info] None [info] 1573780336
Emshelles [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar post partum, but it really reared it’s head during my pregnancy. There were so many times I did things they confused me, I got very paranoid of the world and irritable. It caused a lot of strife between my husband and me. Then after delivery I had PPD at 1 month, 8 months, 13 months, and 19 months when I weaned her was the worse. It led to me losing my job. That’s when I got diagnosed and out on Lexapro and Latuda. I’m terrified that to get pregnant again I would go through all that but some medications are safe during pregnancy and I trust my psychiatrist to guide me. It can be done as long as you have a plan, a loving patient partner, and a great psychiatrist. [info] None [info] 1573792835

Falcom-Ace [info] I've had about 5 or 6 psychologists and psychiatrists. It was the third one who told me about the diagnosis, so I'm not sure which of the first two actually did the diagnosis and what specifically led them to that conclusion. My third one and I talked about it and went through a more formal diagnostic process with my being involved, wherein he told me that I was very obviously a "covert" schizoid.I'd originally been in therapy for a really bad depressive episode, then later I was diagnosed with bipolar NOS. At some point the PD got tacked on. [info] None [info] 1573843815
Tak5035 [info] Yeah, probably lol! I'm going cold turkey right now from a 20-24 gram a week habit. I've been using every other day for 8 solid months now and it's really getting old. I'm manic as fuck when I consume it, and not manic in a good way. I get so hyped up and want to do this and that and just everything but I end up at the end of the night depressed as fuck knowing that I couldn't complete 10% of what I wanted. Now take everything I say with a grain of salt because I've been diagnosed with bipolar so this isn't entirely from the phenibut but it's definitely worsening my mood swings.I never personally pushed my doses past 4 grams every day but I did take very large doses just to experiment. My largest dose was 11 grams all at once. My personal sweet spot was around 5-6 grams at a time but I couldn't use every day at that dose because I was already deep into withdrawals at 4-5 grams every other day. I'd wake up on that 2nd day after consuming 5 grams and I'd feel like such shit, no motivation, angry, accelerated thoughts, and the weeks I'd take a little bit more were the weeks where I started experiencing delusions and even auditory hallucinations when trying to fall asleep.I'm 48 hours into the cold turkey right now and I feel like complete and utter shit. My mind is racing, I have too many thoughts coming into my head and can't concentrate on anything. I'm depressed as fuck, no motivation to do anything and the world just looks so dull and bland that it's revolting/scary.I'm going to take you into my mind a little more now. I'm having thoughts rushing through my head right now about the time I took phenibut (4 grams) mixed with a little alcohol when I was out with my friends at a local event at my local state park about 2 weeks before the 4th of July. I remember so fucking much that I hadn't remembered or thoughts about until right now. I remember how the wind felt brushing up against my face, I remember the kids running around near us, I remember that I didn't have a care in the world and that I didn't want the fireworks to end, I remember I had off of work the next day and just the thought of that was overly exciting to me, I remember the ride back home and the shit-talking that went down between my friend and his girlfriend, I remember they were going at it lol, it almost got to the point where he pulled the car over to slap her across the face (he's not abusing her, at least as far as I know). I remember that I just wanted to drive some more so I told my buddy to head on some backroads we hadn't ever been on.I then, come to this subreddit tonight and I see some of you beautiful motherfuckers bragging about how much phenibut you've consumed. I viewed this one comment, it said (or something similar to), "I bet most of the people on here that have taken 10+grams have also shot up heroin, I know I have". My mind then flooded back to the time I took 11 grams, thankfully it was a shitty experience (anything over 7 grams is sleepy time). I also started gagging, just the thought of having to swallow 11 grams of that shit is beyond disgusting. But even with the gagging that came over me, I said to myself "let's just try one more monster dose", it'll make you feel like you did back in July and then we can say goodbye to phenibut for a while". "Do you know how many fucking times you've told yourself that, you fucking dipshit." To which I respond, well I really don't think you guys want to hear any more of the dialogue that goes through this brain.And I could go on and on about the delusions I've experienced over the past month. I don't know what changed, no delusions at all for the first 7 months but all of a sudden a little over a month ago I went completely bat shit crazy. I didn't even really increase my dose by much (was probably around 25 grams a week at that time).All in all, phenibut was magic at first, and slowly but surely over the past 2 months especially has turned into a nightmare that I hope ends in a few days. If the delusions worsen I might pussy out and take 3 grams just to slowly taper down enough to sanely come off completely. Good Riddance.PS - To the people on here that can take 6+ grams every day and come off just like that with zero delusions and zero auditory hallucinations, I wish I had your brain chemistry! :( [info] None [info] 1573875537
Gonzo0120 [info] An unlikely combination of paper, cotton, chemicals and racism, my dude. That is why it was/is illegal.

CloofWatershit [info] When I was diagnosed with bipolar II, my parents and brother relentlessly bullied me into thinking it was just a teenager phase. That was when I was 12.

My mom started to realize it was much more than a phase at that point but my brother and father kept going with the phase thing.

WinSmith1984 [info] I only had one and that's how I was diagnosed with bipolar. So, I wasn't on medication...not much of a choice, I fucked and wanked my way through it everyday until I was too tired and fell asleep, and that for 2/3 weeks. As normal sex wasn't enough, I opened up on all my dirtiest kinks, and got lucky with my so as she was comprehensive. She was pretty tired after that episode though lol.

vaultdwellernr1 [info] Similar story here, highest weight ever 173 kg (381), lowest weight in my adult life 99 (218), CW 125 (275). I’m 5’5. I had WLS 3 years ago and lost some weight but after a while it started creeping back up. I’ve struggled with eating disorders my whole life, was an obese child and developed binge eating disorder as I was getting in my teen years. In my twenties I was diagnosed with bipolar and that played into the whole mess of it all for sure. Some medications early on were so wrong for me but luckily things are much better nowadays. I haven’t been on keto for that long, and i’m not jumping on the scale as a priority, as i’m trying how it feels and i must say it feels great! The gravings are non existent, which is a shock to me! I am usually that person who is always snacking and thinking what to eat next even as i’m still finishing my previous meal. I used to eat a lot of sandwiches (european style open ones with rye bread), my whole day could be coffee and a couple of sandwiches breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack... i thought i’d be graving that dark ryebread so much, but i’m not. I’m not thinking about sweet things either which is a big surprise. I feel more energetic, i’m going for walks just because i feel like it, where as just a while back i was thinking ”do i have to walk?!”. After WLS i used to have dumbing if i ate something disagreeable, and it feels horrible, while doing keto it hasn’t happened at all. It’s still a learning experience for me, but it is very doable and remember to use an app for calculating your macros and calories. I even bought a kitchen scale for the first time in my life to get the carps right. It’s easy to underestimate the amount you’re eating i’ve noticed. All the best on your new keto life! You’re not alone! 🥰 [info] None [info] 1574059508
miyaav [info] I was a good, smart kid during my school days. I often worked alone on a group assignments because after some reminders, nobody responded. Getting into  university I was still somehow that textbook smart-type of person, but slowly I took an easy way out to only take the smallest responsibility in a group assignments. Perhaps it was actually just a part of something bigger, not sure. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a couple of suicide trials in my second year of uni.I still like studying, learning a lot of things, but I don't have a job, I do things but I just don't know, maybe I am a coward,. Sometimes bad bad bad thoughts passed inside my head. I wished I could have the totally opposite experience, being the naughty, lazy, useless kid in my early years and worked hard after that. Instead of being a good kid during childhood and was ruined by my broken self in the final four year of what society saw as the most important aspect of education. Because the stories are always about smart, succesful, rich people reminisced how they used to be a fool, etc in their early years, not useless adult reminisced their successful childhood.

thesesharpobjects [info] I have a child. Almost 2, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder this year so I didn’t know about it until AFTER. That being said, I think there’s a lot that comes with being a parent in general but even more when you’re a bipolar parent. It really comes down to 1. Do you want children? 2. Are you willing to take medication to remain stable? 3. What are you going to do on a ‘bad day’?  4. Are you willing to potentially pass on your bipolar genes to you children? 5. Do you have a good support system?These are probably things I would consider when deciding on being a bipolar parent. There’s a lot more but it’s a start. I have great days, I have bad days, sometimes I have REALLY bad days. On really bad days, I’m lucky to have family that will happily take her for a couple hours so I can recharge. An understanding partner, an outside support system and caving out a little time for yourself makes all the difference. It’s a tough choice for you to make, but I regret none of it. Being a parent brings me a lot of joy. [info] None [info] 1574443533
BlueVentureatWork [info] Hi, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 24, spent 2 years in therapy, and only started studying psychology when I was 26. I'm 30 now and in a PsyD program. It is certainly possible to be a counselor/therapist, but I think I've learned 2 major things. 1) I have to take care of myself first (staying in therapy, working on homework, paying attention to self-reflection) and 2) our experiences only benefit those who have similar experiences as us. There are many people who suffer in a way that is different from the way that I have suffered, so I have to be careful of projecting my own issues onto my clients. That being said, it is a worthy endeavor, and it has helped me find peace in my own life. I wish you the best of luck! [info] PsyD Student (Clinical) [info] 1574444732

TeaspoonOfSugar987 [info] Oh that’s a relief to know, I hate how it can take up to 6 weeks to have the positive effect. I was just worried you May have been on them a bit longer and still having those kinds of side effects. Fingers crossed things level out for you sooner rather than later. It’s frustrating how some might work really well for you and some might not too.I was on lexapro for 12-13 years then suddenly they stopped working for me and I needed to be put on a SNRI instead of a SSRI. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last year (honestly given how long I have exhibited symptoms it should have been picked up at least 8 years ago) and was put on a mood stabiliser too. It took quite a while to get the dosage balance right for me (like 5 months) but I FINALLY for the first time in a long time feel like a mostly well functioning adult. Given I am 32 that’s a big deal! [info] None [info] 1574542958
Overclockinggirl [info] I am so sorry you’re going through this and it probably breaks your heart that you cannot physically get to her because of your disability. My mother was disabled and I know it would’ve broken her heart if she couldn’t get to me to help me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 2 years ago and it is a tough battle but I am doing ok now. I will say that hospitalizations were 100% necessary about 4-5 times in my life. I tried committing suicide twice and failed, obviously. Then voluntarily committed myself after that because I realized I couldn’t go on living that way. Unfortunately, even after being hospitalized twice during that severe, 2 year long depressive episode, it didn’t get me to a euthymic mental state. Now that I am on the correct medication (mood stabilizer and LOW dose of an SSRI), I feel better than ever. I can say first hand that alcohol does not mix with bipolar disorder. I am struggling with that reality now but I’m working on it. I would say your best bet would be to call 911 or perhaps, if she is more stable today, the non-emergency number for the location she lives. I’m sure you can google it and find their number. Explain the situation and see if they can help. You could also try contacting NAMI (National Alliance of Mental Illness). Also, don’t beat yourself up and try to take care of yourself. It can be very draining trying to help someone with mental illness. I have lost many wonderful friends and even immediate family members because they weren’t able to balance their own lives and try to support me and help me. Deep down, I am a very happy, loving, calm, friendly person. However, when I am either manic or depressed, I’m a totally different person. It can scare people away and make them feel uncomfortable. If you have any other questions, feel free to direct message me. I hope this helped. [info] None [info] 1574551417

frankyu7 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after being being admitted into inpatient mental health at a hospital after attempting suicide.I remember that time in my life being the darkest series of experiences I remember, but somehow being put into a psych ward, I immediately felt relieved of all my woes.. well after my surgeries and everything lol. Fast forward to today (it happened maybe 4 years ago). I somehow ingrained it in myself that isolation and being alone from everyone I know and the world is what gives me peace of mind. I’m much happier now and I even have a great loving girlfriend and a good job.

dionthesocialist [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2009. I can say wholeheartedly that someone mentioning something about me that's a symptom of my disorder is not something I should expect anyone to avoid doing. It's outright impossible. I've been in a lot of communities surrounding mental health, and never before have I heard that we should be shaming people for unknowingly mentioning a symptom.These convos have been very, very weird to me. My mental health journey has been going on for ten years and this week I've heard so many off the wall takes, I truly couldn't believe what I was reading.Edit: There are lots and lots of things that can be symptoms of mania. You can't take "talking over people" as a valid indicator that Mauro was suffering from a manic episode, nor is it reasonable to expect that no one should ever mention that anyone talks over others.

BubbleTeaRex [info] I was just talking to my bestie about this. I have been diagnosed with PTSD. She told me she had PTSD for a week after she broke her arm in Hawaii. In her mind, she is just better and stronger than other people with PTSD, and their inability to “get over it” is directly caused by their own shortcomings. I explained that what she experienced likely was post traumatic stress. But it was not a disorder. She can relate to some of the symptoms someone with PTSD might also relate to, but something that goes away on its own and does not greatly impact your ability to function normally is, by definition, not a disorder. We have been friends for over 15 years and I’ve NEVER talked about mental illness at all. I knew she wouldn’t react well to it. I was diagnosed with bipolar a couple of days ago after refusing / avoiding any kind of treatment since I was first evaluated for bipolar at age 12. I was worried she would find out and make assumptions, and I wanted to explain my experience before that happened. She told me that bipolar is caused by what you put in your body and that I shouldn’t be seeking treatment. Instead, she told me to use herbs and essential oils because those are just as effective. She’s currently in school to become a paramedic and doesn’t even believe in science based medicine... I’m worried our friendship is doomed.
