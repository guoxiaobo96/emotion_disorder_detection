cfabbro [info] Ditto... I'm not allowed back into the USA because I'm on a list (they wouldn't say which one, but I suspect DHS).  Supposedly since I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder, until I can prove that I am "not a threat to [your] country" I cannot get passed the border.  This, despite the fact that I was diagnosed while living in Florida, and lived there for 3 years afterward.  Go go gadget indifferent Bureaucracy! [info] 1223092271
thetruthisoutthere [info] So true. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder a year ago and I was so embarrassed when people at work asked me why I was off work for so long (about 3 weeks). People with bad backs or whatever don't feel the shame. [info] 1249581381
