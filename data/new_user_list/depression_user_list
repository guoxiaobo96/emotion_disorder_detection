JeebusWept [info] Also, when I was 22 (I'm 28 now) I met a woman over the internet, she was 9 years older than me. I went to her place and we got it on, and we ended up in a relationship and living together. I should interject at this point that she was completely nuts. Like batshit, insaniac nuts. Anyway, time went on and we ended up having 2 kids together. Our relationship was dead in the water by the time my second kid was born. We went to counseling, etc but it wasn't happening for us anymore. We hadn't had sex in 6 or seven months and basically all she did was yell at me, and sometimes became violent and mentally abused me. I used to feel physically ill at the thought of going home from work. She wanted me to do all the housework in *addition* to working 15 hour days as a forklift driver - I was whoring overtime like a mofo just to make ends meet, not that I minded it was better than being at home.(I had left college to work to support them at this point.) She started to put on weight. She tried to turn my own family against me, my mother and father and brother, and became violently frustrated when they called her on her bullshit. She was trying to isolate me, break me. One day I came home from work - the kids were in the living room, alone (one three, one less than a year) and she was in the bedroom masterbating with a vibrator. She said she needed satisfaction and I couldn't give it her. I was completely distraught, I love my kids more than anything, but I had a vision of this misery stretching on and myself becoming a shell, a wretched, grey, shuffling man. I was diagnosed with depression and medicated. I started losing weight and got ill a lot.I had started watching porn for release, maybe because of the depression, I don't know. I got them from a guy I worked with. One day, for a joke, he gives me a tranny one in an opaque blank case, the disc itself had the printing on, some fucking ladyman with a big dick rubbing it. Sick stuff. Anyway, the next day I left it on the kitchen worktop while I showered before work, I wanted to give him it back, it was 6 AM, usually my ex and the kids got up around 8, but this particular morning my daughter, the elder one, got up, went in the kitchen and found the DVD and started playing with it in the bed next to my ex. Needless to say my ex discovered it and went fucking ballistic, hitting me when I was in the shower. Fair enough to be honest. She had a history of never letting things go but for the first time she felt like she had the upper hand - I'd actually done something instead of her over-inflating trivialities. She told all my family and friends that I was into tranny porn and basically painted me as some kind of demented sex case.I have never felt so alone.At this point I spilled my guts to a work colleague, whose response was simple - "Get out of there". Her instability around me was starting to damage the kids.So I did. I got an overdraft at the bank and used it as a deposit on a one bed flat in town. The day I told her she threw all my stuff in the street, punched me, hit me with a fishing rod and tried to destroy my passport. I kissed me kids goodbye and left.This was two and a half years years ago.I stopped the depression meds, I went back to university, finished my degree and I'm now in a good career in purchasing. I have a new girlfriend who is normal. I've put weight back on.I haven't seen my kids since then. I'm starting legal proceedings soon. The eldest one started school last month. My ex also doesn't let me parents see the kids, which upsets my mother.This is the most shameful thing I have to carry.I love you J &amp; R. [info] None [info] 1220702122
