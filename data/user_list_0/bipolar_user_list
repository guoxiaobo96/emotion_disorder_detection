screamomixx [info] I need someone to talk to. TLDR; I just need anyone to listen to me vent about stupid shit and help me make a really hard decision.  Sunday I lost my job, had to move out of my ex-boyfriends, and found out my "best friend" lies on a semi-constant. I don't know what to do about any of this. I moved back in with my mom but it's a super shitty situation here. She's been sick for a long time but now she's just recently decided to stop taking narcotics and the withdrawals are turning her into something I didn't even know existed. I'm so fucking depressed that I don't even know what to do with myself. I've gotten the offer of a one way plane ticket to Massachusetts, but I don't know if it's the right thing to do. I need help getting my mind off of everything and someone to talk to. I don't know what else to do. I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1 for 5 years, now and my medicine just doesn't feel like it's working anymore. [info] None [info] 1420770358 [info] test
buttscrew [info] I can actually kind of talk about this from an experience I had. In 2007, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was forcibly medicated in a psychiatric hospital. Being a broke college kid at the time, and having no health insurance when I was discharged after ten days in the hospital. I couldn't afford the $700/month for the antipsychotic medication I was prescribed.   I suddenly stopped taking the medication and have a ten day black spot in my memory. I have heard a few accounts from my family of my actions during this time. I was alive and moving but no one was home. When I regained consciousness I was back in the hospital on day 7 of another 10 day stent. I complained vocally about this feeling of numbness at first, however, quickly got used to it and forgot what it was like to feel. Things seemed so foreign to me. I had a hard time doing simple tasks like driving without huge feelings of paranoia and a reduced sense of direction.When I awoke, I was numb. I had a very distinct feeling of disconnection in my brain. Everything I knew about myself, the city I lived in, and myself as a person was gone. I could actually feel a disconnection in my brain. Two years into therapy I had a therapist suggest that this what I felt in my head was brain damage that occurred from my manic episodes.I went through more therapy and went through all five stages of grief for myself. I buried who I was and adapted to this new form. It wasn't all bad, the brain is a very powerful organ. I had a good job and a nice bit of money saved up. I could tell something was off about me though, the suggestion of brain damage was constantly on my mind as I felt this disconnection from others. During this time, I didn't establish very many meaningful relationships. I was perpetually single and had only gained a few acquaintances from my job. There was something that other people had that I just didn't seem to get. I really didn't think about it all that much and just kind of chalked it up to my disorder and the damage it had done. I had been living in this state of emotionless being for 6 years at this point. In June of 2013, I started a new medication and ceased my long lived relationship with the antipsychotic. One night, I was standing in my room looking at a picture and it a moment, it happened. The hemispheres of my brain realigned and I was overcome by emotion. I felt a rebirth, my brain had a familiar sense of the world again. In a instant I was teleported back to who I was at 21 years old just in my 28 year old body. Now, I identify as having two "selves", the person I am today, and the person who I was during those 6 years of non-emotion. This quick transition didn't come without it's own challenges. Skills and habits I had developed while working almost vanished entirely. I had to relearn (and admittedly still am) stuff like personal financial responsibility but, at the same time things like driving were back to being familiar and absent of  fear. My map of the town I lived in was back inside my brain.  My break in consciousness I did wholeheartedly think of as a death. I had known and accepted this although it took years of therapy to do so. Denial is a powerful force.    Now, I feel as though I am whole again. Even if the last few years have been a lot rockier than their predecessors. Self is absolutely a series of not only memories but emotions and sense of being.    TL:DR I was reincarnated in my own body.Sorry if this got a little off topic. It's kind of a hard thing to explain.Edit: Also, I have been knocked the fuck out before and I pretty much equate that to death. [info] None [info] 1417528893 [info] test

ChaosTheRedMonkey [info] It's a trend that applies to many mental conditions and I am always a bit surprised that apparently people have a hard time reconciling the trend with Autism. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder pretty early (around 4th grade so like..8 years old?). The doc who diagnosed it was a bit stumped on how to treat me because it usually wasn't diagnosed that early, and suggested I get evaluated later in life to be certain about the diagnosis. 20 years later it still fits.Anyway, I remember when we first started talking about history of mental illness in the family my dad said something like this: "Well none that I know of, unless being an alcoholic counts. But its hard to be sure. My folks and their generation tend to be tight lipped about that kind of thing, and would rarely get checked out. So at most we might have stories of "Weird Uncle Billy who was always a bit odd" or something."So yeah, definitely an awareness and openness shift has impact stuff like this.

jamie_jamie_jamie [info] TL;DR- A horrible hallucination and a dead guy under a train.Most terrifying would be one of my hallucinations. I was diagnosed with bipolar type II and a symptom is hallucinations. I was living out of home with my boyfriend, we were laying in bed and I was trying to sleep but the streetlights were bright and we had shitty blinds. Our bed is parallel to the wardrobe which had mirrors for the doors and at the end of our bed was the TV. I was facing the wardrobe with my head on his chest, and I kid you not, there was a pale woman behind me just sitting there staring at the TV in the reflection. She was in a white torn up nightgown kind of thing with long stringy, oily black hair, and her skin looked like she was covered in bruises. I turned around to look behind me and I couldn't see her but when I turned to look at the mirror again I saw her again. It scared the fuck out of me. My boyfriend who has hallucinations as well helped me get through the fear. Now I know that it's all in my head and can't hurt me, but having my first one was horrible.The other thing was that I mum and I saw cop cars hanging around the train station near our place, so being the sticky beaks that we were, we drove down to have a look, as we were driving past I looked under the train because curiosity, and for about 10 metres there were human remains.

Truthful_lie [info] Feeling trapped Hello fellow Redditors,Long story short, I had a psychotic episode in 2014, went to the psych ward, but did not follow up after I was discharged because I thought it was just a nervous breakdown.  8 months later I ended up in the psych ward again and this time I was diagnosed with bipolar 1.Since the relapse I have been feeling hopeless and that life is not worth living.  On top of that, I am underemployed and hate my current job and I have no clue as to what other jobs I can do.  The world seems so fast paced that I can't keep up with it.  If I had passion for something, it would solve the problem I currently have : seeing life as a pointless endeavor and having to slave away at a job until I retire and die.

Juneau_Fire [info] Bipolar and BPD dual diagnosis (TW) Hi all awesome people. Just wanted to get some stuff out and see if if anyone else had similar situations. I was diagnosed with bipolar II around six years ago, went through Psychs and GPs etc and ended up taking Lithium for a few years. Within the last year I found that lithium was 'greying' me out. I had no creativity and no interest in the stuff that was supposed to be fun. I am quite musical and also have synaesthesia so I found lithium really affected my music writing ability. Recently however I have had some difficulties and been referred back to a pdoc. He has asked all the same questions and given an added diagnosis of 'emotionally unstable BPD with impulsive type'. I'm not disputing the impulsive type, but I am nowhere near an emotional person. In fact, I have been told I am cold sometimes and don't react correctly in some situations. I am in a relationship with the most awesome and understanding guy ever, and he thinks I am generally emotionally stable. It's really thrown me off to be given a new added diagnosis. I just wanted to know if anyone else has had this issue. Thanks in advance. [info] None [info] 1423003181 [info] test

I do have some hypomanic episodes that last a few day but my depressive episodes are more accentuated. I'm also incredibly angry and negative right after waking up which makes me think about some neurochemical imbalance. I started going to therapy due to a long history w drug abuse and after a few years of rehab I actually felt mental illnesses getting worse. Currently I'm at a pretty good place regarding my mental health and I'm no longer taking any meds (at one point in my life I was taking around 6 different pills a day).

Manassisthenew6pack [info] When I was 20 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after having a psychotic break and needing to be committed, after that I ended up dropping out of college and basically looking to drug use as the only novel thing I did that gave me an identity. I moved back to the small town I was originally going to college in, and began attending a technical school where I would binge on adderall the night before an exam and stay up for 12 hours straight to pass the exams. Because I liked adderall so much I made an appointment with a psychiatrist, who proceeded to give me mood stabilizers but wasn't convinced I needed adderall. In the process of getting adjusted to mood stabilizers instead of the anitpsychotics I had been taking (and stopped taking), things had to get worse before they could get better, and my moods got into new weird areas, to the point where I wasn't comfortable just drinking my feelings away because they would come roaring back when I was drunkest. In light of this, I went to the gym nearly every day, no routine just going as hard as possible for 2ish hours a day trying to exhaust myself. That was all about 8 months ago, I've just been working in fast food since that happened, and my use of everything has precipitiously fallen off to nill at this point, I'm even on a five week quitting smoking streak right now. Lifting just keeps me sane I guess. [info] 165x1 [info] 1418328453 [info] test
lady_stardust_ [info] Myself. I was in a string of bad relationships with people who brought out the worst in me. I’ve had very low self esteem my entire life despite excelling in school and being (I’m told, but still sort of don’t believe) witty and fairly good-looking. I also struggled with undiagnosed bipolar disorder for ten years. This translated into accepting awful treatment from people who claimed to love me. Sexual and verbal abuse, cheating, alcoholics, run-of-the-mill jerks with stagnant lives. Don’t get me wrong, I was a shitty partner too. I was often emotionally unstable, selfish, and had bad habits of my own, like smoking weed and cigarettes constantly, drinking too much, and eating mostly junk food. I was a broken person and I fell in love with other broken people.After ending my last relationship in the midst of my first full-blown manic episode, I finally had time to be on my own. Being single for the first time in almost a decade allowed me to step back and look at the patterns in my life for what they were. I was diagnosed with bipolar and started treatment but I couldn’t come to terms with it and was struggling to figure out what my life would look like in this new reality. I also still couldn’t shake my unhealthy habits and didn’t really want to. My current partner helped me accept my mental illness, quit smoking cigarettes, and deepen my interest in healthy activities like writing, cooking, and exercise. He helped me change my relationship with alcohol and weed, which I now use in moderation rather than to numb myself from reality. He also provides thoughtful, nonjudgmental alternative perspectives that help me to reframe life challenges and work through them rather than avoiding them or feeling helpless. My personality hasn’t changed fundamentally; it’s more like I’ve finally been able to let the best parts of myself come to the surface. I feel stronger with him. He’s helped me shed the things in my life that I always knew were weighing me down.Plus the sex is ridiculous. [info] None [info] 1528572063 [info] test

Before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was having periods of extreme delusions and that all my friends hated me. My SO couldn't understand because he got nothing but love from them and why I wasn't registering the same way. I would say mean things about them to my SO but he knew that I didn't mean it. I mean, I felt deep down that there was some sort of conflict in what I was saying and what was going on in reality but I couldn't sort the difference between the two. Which one was true and which one was false. I'm just glad I never said anything to them because they are really good friends. I had a really bad manic breakdown last week where I was paralyzed at work I was freaking out so bad. I told my good friend about it the next day, we work on the same floor together, and she told me to contact her the next time that happens so she can come over and take care of me. I was like, I hardly wanted my SO to know that I was in that state let alone her. She let me know that was for her to decide and that she loved me. What an angel.

lordmania [info] Venting: Mania induced psychosis causing temporary amnesia. I'm diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features and I'm having a really difficult time. Work has been hectic and stress very high. I can't currently afford to see a psychiatrist so I've been unmedicated for 14 months now. I keep slipping into long manic episodes that last weeks to months that eventually end up in me slipping into psychosis and being hospitalized. The worst of this is the temporary amnesia though. I recently lost my love to overdose and my cat to cancer, and every time I return home from the hospital I forget that they're both dead. I search for them, panic because I can't find them anywhere, and usually end up realizing they've died once I see my cat's urn on my bed frame (I snuggle it to feel calm, I know it's weird). Seeing her urn then, in turn, reminds me that my love is also now dead. This ends up in me crying uncontrollably until I disassociate. Rinse, repeat, every few weeks. It's like I keep reliving their deaths over and over and nothing I do seems to stop my brain from resetting. I wish I could afford a psychiatrist and medication again, because I can't take anymore heartbreak.I just don't know what to do. Anyway, sorry this is so melancholy.

ignoremypresence [info] Explaining your past So I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years and things are going great. We love each other deeply and she’s aware of my bipolar and all that it entails. The beginning of our relationship was incredibly rocky, I had just gotten sober after years of alcohol abuse and at the same time I was diagnosed with bipolar and began medications. Needless to say, I was a dick. But she stuck through it. The problem I’m facing is not only managing my ups and downs, but the events of my past coming back and hurting us. It started initially when I failed to mention that I had had sex with an acquaintance of hers who she who she was interacting with due to her mutual friend groups. Similar situations like these would happen on occasion but the most recent one was I was discussing with a friend of hers, who too is bipolar, about the manic and unprotected sex I had before I met her. I’m clean, that’s not the issue. She’s explained that the issue isn’t the actions themselves, but the fact that she has to hear them through others. It doesn’t help that we went to college together and we have a lot of mutual friends. So the problem I’m facing is basically how do I explain to her that I’m not trying to hide anything from my past, but it’s just that there’s so much and it never occurs to me to bring it up. I love her, and she loves me, and we’re planning on getting married but she doesn’t want to be hearing about my past through the grape vine. At the same time I feel uncomfortable talking about everything I’ve done in my past before I cleaned myself up, it’s embarrassing and it isn’t who I am anymore. Do I just sit down with her and tell her everything, no matter how uncomfortable? What have you guys done?This is just a mini long rant and just curious if anyone has similar situations.

It took a couple months for me to finally start feeling happy (peaceful) again. I never once decided not to take my medicine at will (once or twice I would forget if I had a busy morning) . The biggest advice and fact you should know is if you are not getting your proper sleep , you medicine will not work . You must let your doctor know your sleep amount and if your having issues. There is help and it does take time and patients . I hope it gets better for you !  [info] None [info] 1424881660 [info] test
-A-Unique-User-Name- [info] Speaking from personal experience only... the first medication I took was a SNRI and it triggered a manic episode. I had the same question about whether it was only a s/e of the medication but I was diagnosed with bipolar anyways. About a year later I experienced another manic episode while I wasn't taking any medication. Maybe you have to wait it out to be sure which it is?I think I remember reading somewhere that if it was just a s/e, the manic episode will end pretty quickly after discontinuing the drug, while if it was BP the manic episode may last longer.

TheEpitomeOfSin [info] Hiding PTSD from my family? I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 disorder a year ago when I was 21, I'm 22 now was still struggling with issues not related to the bipolar, so I went back to my behavioral specialist to discuss.1 week ago today I was diagnosed with complex PTSD due to a combination of emotional abuse as a child and a serious sexually physically and verbally abusive relationship when I was in college. I never told anyone not even my best friend about just how toxic this relationship was so no one knew except for me and him. And even still This diagnosis came as a shock to me. Because I never thought I could be diagnosed with PTSD...When I was diagnosed with bipolar I kept it hidden from my family for awhile due to them invalidating my mental health struggles frequently. I was prescribed prazosin for the PTSD and I totally forgot about it when I asked my mom to pick up my prescriptions. She asked what i needed it for since it's commonly a blood pressure medication, and I instinctively  lied and told her it was for sleep problems.I hate lying to my family I walk around feeling so guilty... but I also don't want them to know about my relationship history. And if I tell them I was diagnosed because of my childhood trauma they'll say I'm exaggerating and being dramatic.., so now I don't know what to do... do I tell them? Do I just keep it hidden? Has anyone here been in a similar situation and could give me pointers or help?

I was diagnosed with bipolar/BPD over 4 years ago, and since then, this urge to spend money is out of control. I am an impulsive/spontaneous person by nature, and it's heightened by the BPD, so I know that my spending habits are worsened by my impulsivity.

mygodshessohot [info] A little help? I feel like I'm watching my life take place, without ne making the choices, like it's on autopilot. its been this way my whole life. allow me to explainI've always been amazing at improvisation. I think fast on my feet, and never have any trouble coming up with ideas. It's to the point, in fact, where sometimes I dont know what I'm even going to say when I start talking. It's just these words come out and I had little input in their construction. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and adhd, but for a number of reasons I think these are misdiagnoses. (I'll get to that later)The me inside my head is a completely different person than the person who chooses what I say. my mind is always racing, hyperanalyzing every situation. My inner self is cold, rational, and cares for nobody, not even myself.prime examples of both emotional response when I should have one1. I was raped as a child, it never was remotely traumatic whatsoever2. Family and friends die, I feel nothing, besides a slight "oh well" at the fact that I wont see them again3. It was possible I had cancer. Didnt care. didnt end up having it but stillAs for my diagnosed illnesses, I simply dont think they are plausible. Certainly not bipolar (I simply don't feel, and haven't as long as I can remember).ADHD has a little more plausibility, as ky sctiond are almost always an impulse, like I said, but inside of my mind I am very calculating.It's a little misleading when I say I can't feel. I can feel brief glimpses of euphoria and rage. As a result, I attempt to induce these states often. I have been told I have major anger problems my whole life, and have infrequent anger outbursts. As for euphoria, I seek thrills and hang out with friends to satisfy that need.I have never felt sadness, though, nor have I felt guilt or remorse. Its sickening and empty. Sadness is also the only emotion my autopilot cannot fake, so I have to do that consciously (with varying results  )thanks for listening, also is there a name for this?

SalsaMan69 [info] the pichu main's response:&gt;A lot of you guys already know that I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I have told a hefty majority of you guys in private. Basically what that means for me specifically is that I have long periods of hallucinations and delusions where I am made to think things that are not true. I have been struggling with this since late last year, and really it's only gotten worse sense.&gt;I have a person who follows me around named Connor. I know for a fact I have told several people about him before, specifically Anna Zotta and Derf. He used to just follow me around and ridicule me but recently he has gotten much more threatening and he forces me to do things that I do not want to do.&gt;Another big symptom I have been having is more on the delusion side than the hallucination side. I have very vivid dreams that eventually turn themselves into false memories where I think things have happened to me when they really haven't. Talk to any of my close friends (Alex Nesler, Anna Zotta, 4%, Sp1nda, April Shaw, etc) and they will know that I am constantly out of my mind with crazy theories and stuff, and I thank them for not judging me and just telling me simply I'm being delusional.&gt;The past two weeks I have honestly been scared for my life. I was told that I was the target of a government experiment on the viability of the Esports industry and using influential people to control masses of the population. Connor told me I had poison in my blood that they could activate to kill me at any time to make me die. &gt;They needed me to become a very important and followed member of the community so that I could control people for them. I know I'm an asshole for throwing you guys under the bus like that but I was honestly scared for my life. I needed to get enough fans so that I could make them vote how I said or go to certain events that I wanted them to go to or whatever.&gt;So the only way I could think of to get a lot of fans was to capitalize on my knowledge of the inner workings of melee and my ability to hack the game. With the intent of making a name for myself as a low tier hero so I wouldn't be killed, I made a hack that would make Pichu's hitboxes bigger and stronger if you held the stick in the bottom left corner of your controller and held the L button while you started a match as Goggle Pichu. &gt;I tried to tell quite a few people I was cheating, but every person I told thought I was being delusional and that I had actually deserved the wins. People I told include April Shaw, 4%, Derf, cWeb, and Walt. They all wrote it off as me being delusional, but I couldn't prove it to them without the government figuring out I was warning people of their plans to control them, so I didn't dig into it deeper.&gt;I know this doesn't excuse my actions, I just had a lengthy phone call with my doctor and I have an appointment lined up for Tuesday at noon. I should have told more people even though I thought it would kill me to do so, I should have recognized I was being delusional. &gt;I am making plans to apologize individually to each and every person I beat with the hacked character and to pay 1st place payouts to every person who's bracket I ended with my hacked character. I don't expect forgiveness for this, but I felt I needed to explain my thought process. I have been banned from most of the NEOH/PGH events until I have turned 18 and have made reparations. &gt;Sorry for being a fuckup [info]  [info] 1467503295 [info] test
MyNameMeansPretty [info] I found this tonight and I am now both happy and very scared I grew up with one parent who has severely hoarded since I was about 5 years old and another who survives/enables. There are countless layers to that story. I left many years ago and have never set foot in that space again once I realized how detrimental it was to my mental/physical health. I had tried for many years to address the issue and the effects with both parents to no avail, often losing contact for months at a time because of it. I am an only child. I am not close to my other relatives, partly because of the secret I always have had to keep, partly because of the dissonance sown by my hoarding parent, and partly due to some shame/animosity that they knew and let me live like that. I have been diagnosed with bipolar as an adult. I experienced a divorce last year. I have no children. I rarely speak to my family, but my divorce had softened my defenses and this quarantine has made me lonely and sentimental. My parents love me, but that love is both nourishing and toxic due to their mental health issues and my own. Finding this forum will be good for me, I think. It will not be easy for me to deal with the things I have denied and suppressed but it is ultimately healthy to deal with those issues, and I appreciate the existence of a space to meet others with similar experiences.

purplebromine [info] Lamotrigine and appetite changes I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in late January this year after a disrupting hypomanic episode. I was put on valproate (depakote) starting at 500mg and then raised to 1000mg. It didn't do much for my mood but made me gain 15kgs of weight in six months instead. I wish I was exaggerating. I feel so fat, and people keep asking me if I am pregnant.I talked to my doctor about it and he decided to switch me over to lamotrigine (lamictal). I am starting with 50mg once a day for two weeks and then titrating up to 50mg twice a day (for a total of 100mg per day). I started taking the medication on Thursday and I feel like my appetite has reduced. It's not that I don't feel hungry anymore, it's just that I don't have as much of an interest in eating for pleasure. I am actually eating less and I am really pleased with this!

ABraThatMeows [info] I'm So Conflicted... Hey! New here...So a little boring back-story: Growing up I was always made fun of for being fat, so when i was about 14 I started a cycle of not eating/binge eating and lost 40lbs. I'm still at that weight (135), which is much healthier than the fat weight. I still binge eat quite frequently and I've been diagnosed with bipolar which doesn't help all my body issuesMy problem is, I love the way curves look on other women. A curvy body type is my ideal--and i don't just mean boobs and a butt. I just think it's a lot prettier. I have no boobs, and I'm 5'6" at 135 and look pretty skinny. You can see my ribs at my chest when I stretch a little. I want the curvy body type but every time I get a little chubbier,I freak out because of all the bullying I went throughI'm just unsure of which direction to turn in. Should I just accept being skinnier or allow myself to gain a bit of weight?

shitjoesays [info] My ex committed suicide in front of me in September 2007. I didn't see your previous post (wasn't horribly active on reddit at the time), but I'd like to share my experience with you if you don't mind. Sorry in advance for the wall of text.I was a mess after. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around the same time, so I was put on medication. It made me numb. My mom said she didn't see her daughter anymore, I was a shell of my former self. I stopped going to church and stopped answering phone calls and text messages from my friends and family. I dropped out of school and pretty much fell off the face of the planet for a few months. I felt that his suicide was my fault (didn't help that he and a few of our mutual friends felt the same way). We'd been together for 2 1/2 years and had broken up only a few months before he committed suicide. I thought I was going to marry him, we'd started planning and everything. And he took that from me in the blink of an eye. He even told me when he called me to come over thay night that he wanted to talk about getting back together. I was (obviously) foolish enough to believe him, mostly because I was still in love with him. He used my feelings for him against me, much like he had for most of our relationship. He was never wrong, and I was never right. My feelings were regularly dismissed or even made fun of for the last year of our relationship. Our "friends" regularly told me I needed to back off and give him space. In hindsight I understand, but at the time I was just confused and upset. No, I wasn't perfect in our relationship (far from it actually), but he made me feel even more crazy than I actually was, and that wasn't okay. I tell you all this so you can understand what happened in the months after his suicide.I started using again in the days after his suicide to escape the reality of what I was feeling. It was much easier to just forget I even had emotions rather than actually deal with them. I checked myself into rehab (again) before I had to have my parents or roommates do it for me.I couldn't go to his funeral. His mom asked me to come but I just couldn't trust myself in that situation. Not to mention the fact that I had actually seen him die, had held him as the life left his body. It took three rather large police officers to pull me away from him. I kept telling myself that he was going to wake up, that the bullet hadn't actually gone in and he was just unconscious from the shock. I blacked out when I saw the coroner, and the next thing I remember is waking up in my old dealer's house three days later. I don't know how they even let me go, but apparently they did. For a solid year after I believed what he told me. It was my fault he committed suicide. It didn't matter that he was sleeping with not only both of my best friends, but his boyfriend as well. In the days after his suicide they found he was HIV positive. He came from an extremely religious family, and if they had found out they would have disowned him. To this day I don't know if his parents even know. I was lucky that he had told me he was saving himself for marriage so I wasn't exposed, but both of our friends and his boyfriend tested positive a few months after. I couldn't care less about our friends, they got everything they had coming to them. But his boyfriend was innocent.  He had no idea any of us even existed. And his life was dramatically altered because of my ex's selfishness.After that year, I suddenly got really angry. I would lash out at anyone I felt had disrespected me, and I did a complete 180 on how I felt about his suicide. I went from blaming myself to hating my ex. I truly believed that he could have changed his circumstances,  and therefore he was incredibly selfish for doing what he did. It wasn't until I met my now husband in May 2009 that I really started to heal, to forgive my ex. He was sick, and for whatever reason he couldn't reach out for the help he needed. And I didn't see the warning signs, no one did. He had just gotten a promotion at work and moved into a much nicer apartment in a better neighborhood. He hid it very well, and I was too wrapped up in my own head to even realize there was a problem. If you've made it this far, thank you. If not, I'll put a TL; DR at the end. I told you all this because I want you to realize you're not alone. And if you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to pm me.TL; DR my ex committed suicide right in front of me. In the days after his suicide I found out he was sleeping with three different people, two of them my former best friends. [info] None [info] 1430836482 [info] test
Throwaway420414 [info] Diagnosed Bipolar and on Lithium. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few months ago and have been on lithium since then. Honestly the lithium is great, I am stable for the first time in my life and can't say I feel all that much emotional blunting. One thing that's been eating me up is what I'm going to do once the shit hits the fan. Going off of my meds is not an option as my lows consist of seeing and hearing things during panic attacks. Being on lithium requires constant monitoring of blood levels and kidney function etc. which is obviously not feasible in the face of collapse. I'm considering an exit strategy for when I see the writing on the wall. Anyway, don't know why I posted this. Just needed to get this out there I guess.

cantinflaughs [info] [ADVICE] Destroyed marriage while manic, now may have to live together during separation. Good or bad idea? I was diagnosed with bipolar last year and I've since had two really bad unmedicated manic episodes, where I was very untrustworthy and destructive to my marriage. I spent a lot of money that wasn't mine, and subsequently had sex with someone for money to make the money back. It's awful I know and I am beyond ashamed, I feel guilty and devastated.When I "came to" and realized what I had done I almost threw up. My husband of ten years left me, and told me he needed time away from me. It's been a little over 4 months now and we just started being friendly again. Texting and chatting, we've started couples counseling and he's asked for 6 months to heal and decide what he can and can't forgive. I feel so terrible I'm just grateful for any  chance and any timeline. I've demonstrated a commitment to change by going to  therapy twice a week for the past 3.5 months and have fully immersed myself in learning everything about bipolar, keep a journal and a mood diary, take my medication religiously, started seeing a new psychiatrist who is taking me off SSRIs bc they make me manic and putting me on lithium. I also developed a wellness contract with my therapist that outlines what I need to do to be well like exercise, track my moods, and what I need to avoid, like heavy drinking. Ive also identified my triggers and my delusional thinking (I was raped and when I was manic I thought that I had to take advantage of my super power to disengage during sex to make money-Im not justifying it, I get its problematic but thats what I thought) and identified emergency plans for what happens if I exhibit certain behaviors. In other words, Im doing everything I possibly can to battle my disease and make sure I never go off the deep end again, and manage my illness and be my own caretaker.Before this all happened, we were living in a 2 bedroom with my sister but when the shit hit the fan I moved out to my moms and continued to pay rent. Now, my sister wants to move back home bc her boyfriend has stage 4 cancer and she wants to be closer to him and have my moms support at home. My husband and I understand and are now trying to decide how to navigate what comes next.One option is I move in and take the spare room, which, best case scenario slowly and naturally brings us closer together, or, alternatively, worst case scenario, rushes a delicate process and results in anger and resentment because its too much too soon. Hes reluctant to live together but not unwilling, I just want to be sensitive to his boundaries and make sure Im not interrupting his healing process. Then again, maybe this isnt a terrible idea as long as I treat him like a roommate and stay out of his way and maybe this is fate?? I dk, which is why Im here. I love him so much and our relationship was really good before I became bipolar, and Im really sad and feel really guilty for all the pain and suffering Ive caused.

KevinLeeMcLary [info] How Do I Tell the Difference Between a Manic Episode and Things Just Being Better In My Life? First time poster here,I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago, but never experienced a ton of mania, simply because my life was in shambles. Now that I have seemingly pulled myself out of that I find that I don't now the difference between having a lust for life and a manic episode. Example: Recently, this girl and I have admitted to sharing a keenness for each other. Since this occurrence, I have stopped eating for the most part, and I sleep about 60% less than I did before. I find myself constantly daydreaming at work. She and I are taking this way too fast, but it seems so right to me.  At this point, I'd like an outside opinion on this. I honestly don't know if I'm going through a manic episode or if I'm just elated with passion. Any sort of feedback would be really helpful. [info] None [info] 1447441154 [info] test
anonwasawoman [info] I was diagnosed with an eating disorder (a type of anorexia) three or four years after I was diagnosed with bipolar, but I'd been living with it for about five years by then. I agree with you, my bipolar definitely fed into the eating disorder. I've been in recovery for about nine months now, but every day is still a freaking struggle. It's really tough to get yourself to eat when you're still dealing with all the bipolar nonsense. Kind of nice to see I'm not alone in that, though. [info] None [info] 1427663263 [info] test
Gijsss1 [info] Thanks for that reply, I appreciate it.Personally 2 reasons are the ones why I’m drawn to psychedelics, the lack of purpose which I mentioned and also wanting to face my subconscious, with which I mean my unprocessed emotional trauma’s.I do have to admit that 10 months ago I was diagnosed with bipolar, if i’m completely honest.Having said that, I wouldn’t ever have even considered psychedelics if I felt like I couldn’t handle them or wasn’t stable enough.Among bipolar patients i’ve also read of mixed experience.Would you recommend I steer clear of psychedelics if I’m bipolar?

ecstasysnorter [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a little over a year ago, and basically there are periods in your life wherein you can't distinguish between reality and fantasy. I genuinely believed that I got possessed by a demon, that the government was transpiring against me, and that my life had become a reality show and every single thing i did was broadcasted live. This lead me to be afraid of taking showers or even pooping, and i had to do all my bathroom duties in pitch black with a single flashlight. I would also be alone in my room talking to mirrors and black tv screens with the perception that demons and God were talking to me through them. Very difficult and blurry times for me but I got through it, and it's made me stronger. After about 6 months of recovery, i'm in a much better place now and everything's pretty chill. Lead me to lose some friends though but then again fuck them. [info] None [info] 1526735555 [info] test
