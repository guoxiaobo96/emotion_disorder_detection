aliengames666 [info] I had doctors and therapists tell me it was possible I was bipolar for a long time, but I just never really took it seriously and had one REALLY incompetent therapist  who told me I was just very “deeply feeling” while I was tearing my life apart. Later the same therapist also related me some very inaccurate information about bipolar. Weird how therapists can be so incompetent sometimes. Years later I was institutionalized for attempting suicide because a girl I was interested in didn’t like me back. I was diagnosed with depression while I was there, put on anti depressants, and like instantly went manic while in the psych ward. The next day I met with a new psychiatrist and she nailed me as bipolar immediately, stopped the anti depressants, and put me on lithium that night.My mom is probably also bipolar and she was prescribed anti depressants and she’s manic as hell rn. We’re estranged, but I told her I was bipolar and she said there was no way she was. She’s gonna damage the F out of her brain if she’s actually bipolar.
ladycielphantomhive [info] I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 13 but got a diagnosis of bipolar depression at 20. My psychiatrist said they don’t diagnose under 18 almost ever.
fearfuleyes [info] 22 here. I felt like I wanted to die last year. I literally stopped going to college and put all my efforts on my mental health. I was diagnosed with depression and some very mild kind of bipolar disorder. I’m spending lots of money and time on this. I see my therapist every week and psychiatrist every month and also take meds that have changed my life completely. I consider this is the best investment I could have ever made and I’m very relieved that I started paying attention to mental health so young I’m going back to college in August.
WiseWoman7 [info] I was diagnosed with depression in my sophomore years and back then there were almost no meds to be that effective. I should have been diagnosed as bipolar and received proper treatment. It’s rough to get the right diagnosis and I’m so proud of you and what you’ve accomplished in the last few years!! I think any of us with bipolar disorder can take from your experience that there IS a good life for us out there if we just keep looking and working for it. Congratulations on your engagement!
fandroid-leda [info] So it's not just me... I've been diagnosed with depression/anxiety, PTSD, OCD and borderline at various times when certain meds wouldn't work and my psych wanted to redirect my treatment. With BP2, we have a lot of overlap with other illnesses. Any question over the BPII diagnosis is because I'm "high functioning" (externally) and my hypomania doesn't express as extremely as is genuinely attributed to people with BPII. Everything else is BPII, especially meds. I can't take just anti-depressants without a mood stabilizer without crashing and if I have too much of an SSRI in my system, I do get hypo. Currently on a Lamictal, Buspar and Lexapro cocktail that makes things more manageable but still requires I do a lot to maintain. Do you find yourself needing structure a lot? That's one area that highly impacts my affective state more than factors you often see in borderline.
roboraptor3000 [info] Opposites! Well, I was diagnosed with depression, but my hypomania was written off as anxiety (I do also have pretty severe anxiety, but still). Turns out those antidepressants were just making everything worse!
donteatmee3333 [info] Yeah I could see my younger self saying something like this. I was diagnosed with depression early
Brewskidog93 [info] Ugh I'm so sorry people can be so unhelpful and thoughtless. I lost my best friend of 20 years to a several month depressive/suicidal episode pre diagnosis. I was diagnosed with depression at the time, which she was aware of. She herself has lupus, which is another often debilitating invisible disease. Long story short she had an event she invited me to in another city (she lives a few hours away) and I had RSVP'd yes originally because that's what BFFs do. A month or two prior to the event I still hadn't been able to really leave my house except to go to work as a zombie and I just wanted to die, so I wrote her and asked if it would be okay if I skipped the event with lights and people and staying in a hotel and all the things that add needless stress. She cold shouldered me up until the event and I thought she was just stressed so no biggie - stress flares her disease too, so I get it. I brought it up again and offered to hang out with her just one on one to celebrate a few months later and get quality time in, and she flat out told me she wouldn't "accommodate" me anymore and she broke up with me. Like said we are no longer friends. So I explained in greater detail the depressive/suicidal episode and how I physically and mentally wasn't up for being social and friendly to people I barely know, and she didn't believe me. Thought it was a complete cop out. I was sitting there already wanting to die and now my best friend for two decades was telling me I was full of shit. She knew I had mental health problems but I guess that meant nothing to her. I "accommodated" and helped her through so many episodes with Lupus over 20 years. But it just couldn't go the other way because it wasn't believable. It's been a little over 3 years and I'm still angry about it, the double standard. My coworkers are more "accommodating" than my best friend. Sweet. I hope to run into her at something (her husband is still friends with mine) so I can maybe try again to explain. Not to be friends because that's over, but to hopefully get her to realize that mental health problems are real, that being bipolar is no joke and often invisible because of the energy we put in to protect our friends. That energy we use to protect or shield friends and coworkers completely drains us when we are on the low side, and sometimes we just don't have any energy left to even protect ourselves. We need people that don't judge. That try to understand because the crushing guilt from not being able to physically and mentally make social events is not at all helpful when you are one push away from self harm. I probably won't talk to her ever again, but I do know I am really done with the "flake" label. There is nothing flaky about me and the most hurtful part is that after 20 years I can be brushed aside so easily when to that point I never once bailed on anything. She didn't even ask if I was okay. Just friendship off. Big hugs to you, OP. So many of us know how you feel and have unfortunately gone through something similar. I do hope you know you are believed and supported ❤️. 
corrosivesoul [info] There is also cyclothymia, which is on the bipolar spectrum, but not as severe as bipolar. I think it's telling that you say "I have a feeling I'm kind of cycling." I think for most of us, it's pretty clear cut when we are cycling, not a vague feeling. Even if it might sneak up on us a little, it becomes painfully obvious at some point. For me, going into a depressive phase is like being on a broken elevator going straight to the bottom of the shaft. Hypomania feels like runaway train I can't get off of.I experience hypomania as the following - sometimes, it is a feeling of euphoria, like I'm floating. However, I'm also volatile in that state and it doesn't take much for me to flip into extreme irritability and outright rage. I also have a habit of having some really great ideas, executing on them for a week or two, enlisting people to help make these things a reality, buying books or supplies on it, becoming intensely working on it to the exclusion of all else, then seeing it fall apart when I cycle into depression again. I also tend to have a lot of energy, psycho-motor agitation, and will run just fine on 3-4 hours of sleep (I do sleep more hypo than other do). Also, one trigger I've noticed is if there is a big outing or important event coming up, like going to an amusement park or having a work review. This will usually throw me into hypomania.(the above symptoms are without medication, things are much, much milder on meds)I also don't usually experience "normal" periods, which is a little unusual for bipolar, as I understand, and also cycle pretty rapidly (1-2 weeks hypo, 4-6 weeks depressed, as a very rough estimate). Also, generally speaking, bipolar moods often don't always correspond to life circumstances. If I'm not on meds, I could hit the lottery and still be looking for a bridge to jump off.(since being on meds, my rapid cycling has been condensed down to a day or two if I'm having any problems with it at all, which is not common)Also, I was diagnosed only after being in therapy for a while and my therapist seeing the same patterns of behavior over and over in my personal history, as well as going to their office both hypo and depressed. Another marker is usually an adverse reaction to anti-depressant therapy alone. When I was younger, I was diagnosed with depression and given anti-depressants. They put me into a nearly constant extreme irritability and sometimes rage. My combination of meds right now can sometimes cause a mild hypomania, but it's manageable and doesn't really interfere with anything.Good luck on getting an accurate diagnosis (I mean that positively, not sarcastically. :) ), and I hope you get a handle on things, whatever is going on.
ch1kita [info] the chicken or the egg!! I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ADHD for years, so i've been on adderall for 8 years or so. Now it just so happens i have bipolar 2, so now they want to give me mood stabilizers and have my bipolar 2 taken care of so they can decrease my adderall. I'm terrified of them decreasing my adderall meds =( absolutely terrified because sometimes it's the only thing that helps me even move. But what if this is the right move? What if i don't have ADHD and I've been bipolar this entire time and it's the reason I can't focus? BUT WHAT IF I HAVE BOTH!?!?.....DUN DUN DUN! \*suspenseful music\*
libraryreaper [info] Hypomania can be subtle and it doesn't always present in obvious, "classic" ways. It can be even more complicated when you consider that mixed features are not uncommon in bipolar disorder, which can somewhat disguise the symptoms. I wasn't properly diagnosed with bipolar II until my 40s, even though I was diagnosed with depression at age 14. Part of the reason is that hypomania often feels dysphoric to me, like a really agitated, irritable, dark kind of feeling. My mood shifts a lot during these episodes, but overall it feels bad, so I tended to internalize it as just being part of my depression and anxiety.So, it's definitely not always as straightforward as it seems in textbooks.
georgiaokeefe123 [info] I agree with all of this. I totally agree that my mom feels like it’s her fault, I remember when I was diagnosed with depression when I was 12 and I read through her texts and she was blaming herself for all of it, even though the doctors told her it was a chemical imbalance. She gets so sad every time I’m sad and it just makes me feel worse because it’s not her fault at all. She doesn’t understand the severity of it and I haven’t worked up the courage to give her all of the information about the illness. I hope your mom grows in her understanding.

ManicTypist [info] Oh man, so yeah, I was diagnosed with depression in high school and put on prozac right away. Then... it was like my brain broke. I was so numb, so I was onto another medication and my symptoms got worse and worse until finally I was (literally within 2 minutes of *not even seeing the doctor*) diagnosed as bipolar because I went into rehab for addiction. Then began the fucking brain-breaking thing that was trying about 10 different psych meds and none of them worked. I stuck with Viibryd for a while and then ended up in the psych ward many years later (so recently as of today). Now I'm on a mood stabilizer and I'm wondering if I have BPD instead of BPI because my moods change from crying one second to being elated another to total anger where I see white. I'm afraid to tell my doc that because I don't understand BPD so well, other than it's super difficult to live with. So for now, I'm BPI/BP NOS (seriously that's on my chart). I swear to god though, the changing up of all the medications fucked with my head. Like, legit broke my brain.
desertdigger [info] I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety and my husband and I were in financial stress for about 3 years. I was overworked and had a bad commute. Even though we were beyond stressed and worried about if we would be able to afford our apartment, we **NEVER** treated the other's family with such disrespect. If I was not having a good day and we had plans with his parents,  I wouldn't go because I knew I would be bad company. I understand the stress, but she knows how she functions and needs to talk to her therapist about skills to better manage her anxiety. I agree with the others,  she's not taking responsibility for her actions she's making excuses.
ccoasters [info] I was diagnosed with depression because I was pretty young to be diagnosed as bipolar. Got manic and tried to kill myself. In the hospital, my mom did a shit ton of research because my diagnosis didn’t make sense to her. She’s the one who explained to my negligent doctor why she was so wrong about my diagnosis, why it only made sense that I was bipolar, and is the reason I got on better meds. I was still diagnosed as bp2 for years before it being corrected to bp1, but I owe my mom a lot for that.
linebreaker-bot [info] >Hi. I was thinking about things and doing research and came across info on HSP's. I was thinking I might be one and wanted to see what people on here think. I feel like I have extremely high emotional sensitivity. I can feel others' pain and know what they r feeling without them saying anything. I also take on others' pain and problems and they become my own. I then end up putting in tons of effort trying to solve them and fix their pain. To the point, it causes me severe anxiety and emotional anguish every day until I succeed. I also have had people tell me my reasons for being upset aren't good reasons. Today I was looking at a pic of a cat that I had that passed away almost six years ago and started thinking about him and then suddenly couldn't stop crying.&nbsp;>I also have started crying or laughing from stuff I read, see online, or watch on tv. Or see in a videogame. Or even from some random thought i have. I also can't stop saying thank you and sorry and constantly feel the need to explain my actions or how things work and give excruciating detail to the point I constantly get told to just get to the point. I also feel like I may have some physical sensitivity. I can't wear clothes made of certain fabrics, such as wool because they make me itch. For 26 years of my life I pretty much never wore long sleeves unless they were very flowy or were a jacket or coat, even in -40 degrees with windchill and snow everywhere weather because the material touching my skin bothers me.&nbsp;>I also refuse to wear long johns, don't like scarves, and won't wear socks higher than crew cut. I also only will wear bikini cut underwear. I hate high waisted pants and my sister made fun of me for how I wear my pants but I can't stand anything pushing into my stomach or being up in my crotch. There are also certain sounds like things scratching/rubbing against carpet and velcro that actually make my ears hurt and make me just want to do anything to either stop or get away from the sound.&nbsp;>I also think cilantro tastes like soap and am told I am a picky eater. I have nasal and throat allergies. I also have a huge list of medications I have severe reactions to to the point doctors don't even believe me when I list them off and put down why I can't take them. I know they don't believe me because the last time I was in a hospital I got my medical records and it said in there " she listed off a bunch of medications that she "can't" take". I have been in the ER 5 times due to serious life-threatening reactions to medications and was once hospitalized for a week due to serious life-threatening reactions to a med I was on.&nbsp;>My dad forced me to see a doctor as a kid and I have been diagnosed with depression, adhd, PMDD, asperger's, and bipolar. But none of these doctors really listened to me and all of these diagnoses were based off of stuff my dad said. my dad was always there at my appointments and he was physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive so I felt I had no voice to say what was really going on and basically got forced to take a bunch of drugs I didn't want nor felt like I needed. all these drugs just gave me new problems as I proceeded to have side effects or severe allergic reactions to pretty much everything I got forced to take.&nbsp;>and its not just psyche meds that bother me either, I can't take penicillin or anything ending in cillin or I will get a rash. also, Vicodin apparently puts me right back in the ER with a blocked bladder. one time I went to the ER doctors tried to act like I was faking and gave me nausea medicine and some other thing I don't remember and told me my symptoms would just go away. They didn't and I only got more and more and worse symptoms. it took 3 ER trips before people finally concluded it was the topamax I was on despite all of the doctors knowing what meds I was on. I once had a doctor in a mental hospital force me to take a med I know I have a bad reaction to since apparently minors have no say on what goes in their body.&nbsp;>I even told them to call my dad and offered up another med for "anxiety". they were really just mad because I kept repeating myself because they weren't listening to me. Oh and also some things that others might view as trivial such as a break up can easily lead to me crying everyday for hours for months on end. my record is 6 months straight of crying. anyways I guess this about sums it up. What do you guys think? am I a HSP?sorry for the long post but I wanted to give as much information as i could think of.&nbsp;Hey /u/ichigo_wildblossom, it looks like you posted a wall of text.

owlfoxer [info] Yeah. These meds only manage BP. I also take trazqdone bc I have sleep problems (Pretty much everyone with BP does. )It is hard to say whether they have gotten worse or not. I would say that as I have gotten older, the disease has become a bigger part of my life. So I would say the illness develops more into defined cycles. I would say my cycles have wrecked a lot of experiences— especially with employment. I hope that the older I have gotten, the wiser I have become and am trying to learn how to accept and manage the disease. I was exactly like you. Recurring bouts of depression and experiences of hypo mania which I didn’t realize either. I was diagnosed with depression. So I didn’t get correctly diagnosed until later.  Side effects are hard in the beginning. Be patient. Adjusting to them might take a month or more. But you need to stick with it. The meds caused me to become super tired. The meds help slow your mind down - because after all — racing thoughts are not normal. Pm with any questions you might have.
Unknown3Fortune1Rye [info] Can you elaborate more regarding what condition do you mean that’s not proven?I’d set myself as an example; I’m living a very perfect life according to my standards, I have everything that I ever wanted. However, I’m not feeling okay and I was diagnosed with depression..
ladycielphantomhive [info] I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 13 but got a diagnosis of bipolar depression at 20. My psychiatrist said they don’t diagnose under 18 almost ever.
MessyConstellations [info] You mean how I became ugly? Well, to start off, I started to gain weight to the point that I weight 20 pounds more than an average teen, zits started to come out and it doesn’t help that I have a tendency to scratch them which leads to me having injuries on my face, scars or even trails of blood, I’ve been wearing braces for 8 years now and I use baggy clothing to hide my breast because I was made fun of that in secondary school.And my mental state is no better, I’ve been struggling with a low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and I was diagnosed with depression on December.So yeah, I decided to start dieting and do exercise to at least be able to change my weight.
diego-fer [info] I think it does!.So far I'm really scared about myself, I knew that something was different... I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder and once those symptoms were over I found that I behave in the way that I describe in this thread.Sometimes I don't know if the way I behave is because I have something like ADHD, because I'm lazy and learn how to procastinate like a pro, or for some other reason...Anyway I'll talk to my psychiatrist to see if I can get an exam for ADHD although in my country it's really hard to get those kind of exams and they usually take a really long time to give you an appointment.
Jassyladd311 [info] Awe I'm so sorry. A lack of sleep and nothing in the stomach can turn the nicest person a little grouchy. Everyone feels irritable once in a while especially when you're growing up. You're so young and are going through a very difficult time through puberty which is not fun or forgiving on anyone. Good job for diffusing and going to your room. Getting away from people and into "your space" when you become irritable is a good thing. Everyone lashes out at people once in a while. It's a part of family and being in such a closed space all the time especially when you're most likely not even getting time away at school. Your day got a twist with your mom being upset about a family pet death. That doesnt help your day. And even if death doesnt affect you that much your mood can be affected by those around you. I doubt your an asshole. Yes its rude to lash out and you dont want to make it a habit but learning to diffuse yourself and not lash out is a big part of that and you did a good job. Next time bring a snack up there, eat, diffuse, and get a couple hours of sleep. You'll feel better when you wake up. I was diagnosed with depression as a young teen and have learned effective coping mechanisms through therapy and life.
HelpThereIsPainHere [info] Hello, I was always a quiet kid. I was diagnosed with depression as a kid, two more times as a teenager, and once as an adult.I struggled with suicidal thoughts for a long time.I started a new job recently, I got rid of my last roommate.All at the end of 2019Things changed. I felt different. I started acting different. I know I'm probably still depressed and slowly recovering, but I am different now. I am happy, I feel emotions, I love, I love my boyfriend a lot, more than I thought I did. My depression was keeping me from enjoying everything.I thought it was a chemical imbalance since I have been this way since I was small. But, I think I was in a shitty situation. The situatuin was a long thing.My family, my friends, my job/school. Everything sucked, it all made me depressed Im 2000 miles away from it all, me and my boyfriend, in an apartment with nice things, I work 3 days a week but make enough to pay bills.I am happy for the first time.I think people can recover. Chemical imbalance or life long (small, simple) trauma, I think it is possible. I'm sure more traumatic things are harder. The most traumatic thing to happen to me is a car accident, 4 years later it still hurts but I can get in a car, I can drive, it's not too bad.I hope others can find the kind of peace and happiness I have found.
sangriasky [info] I'm so so so happy for you, this is a big step towards recovery, and I'm glad you talked about it openlyI've been diagnosed with depression 6 years ago (I'm 20) and I still can't accept it, can't admit it in front of myself, I avoid the word 'depression' like a plague, I don't know how to talk about it with my family, I lost friends because I couldn't explain my behaviour, all of this is making me feel worse and worse, nothing good comes from hiding and denialI hope you'll treat yourself with compassion and love  ❤️
Inner_Examination_90 [info] Hey, I can promise you that no matter what it feels like. there are people who care about you. I have experienced those feelings before and almost committed suicide. However, I found someone to talk to and after I was diagnosed with depression and people found out, they were so amazing. I was so supported.People care. Even the ones that you think dont. they do.
Lifelacksluster [info] _Just_ gotten? I honestly don't want to nitpick. I saw this was your second post in a short period of time... I was diagnosed with depression too... and it's quite the rollercoaster ride for me... I wanted to understand how you are feeling lately...
8bit-meow [info] I absolutely love it, too. Everything is much more mild and it doesn't seem to aggravate my moods (I'm diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder). It actually seems to help them. At first I started breaking out and was retaining a lot of water but that has subsided and these pills seriously a godsend. It's good to know I'm not the only one with wacky bleeding whenever. I took this forum's advice and bought the cheap HPT strips just because things are so irregular now just to make sure everything is fine. Thanks for your response! 
situationtypedill [info] I was on venlafaxine for about a year because I was just diagnosed with depression at first and it would make me have even worse depressive episodes
shadeyrain [info] Years ago, when I was still in highschool I got my first betta fish with my own money(not forced upon me by my unknowing parents). I was so depressed at the time, and I left him to rot for a while. After I was diagnosed with depression(at the ripe age of 17) my therapist recommended I take on a responsibly like a fish or rodent. When I went to check on my betta, he was nearly dead. No fins( he literally was just a body. He barely could move) from fin rot, tiny bowl and barely fed. I did some research and found out how much more bettas needed. I worked on that betta for months to regrow his fins, make him feel better and gave him something bigger than a half gallon bowl. Every day, changed his water and medicated him and just monitored him hour to hour for months. I got that phrase a lot. "But it's just a fish"He was the most beautiful fish I've ever owned. I had him for nearly six years after that. He survived through all that and turned out to be this beautiful thing in my life. I was devastated when he died, cried for hours. I haven't loved any other betta the same way. But I cherish that my fish get me through the hard times, motivate me, inspire me to keep beautiful things alive. It's embarrassing sometimes to admit this, but I will never forget what my fish hobby has given me in my very depressed life. SIP Spectrum.
Hardy326 [info] Around the age of 10, My great uncle passed away after being in and out of the hospital for about 3 years. Every day he was in the hospital, I was so afraid to come home and possibly have to hear he had passed,my last week of 5th grade,I got home and that fear came true. After that, I became very fearful about many things,such as friendships falling apart and people passing away that I would lose my mind emotionally if given the slightest bit of bad news. I saw a psychiatrist and we worked through it. This was the end of my battle... or so I thought.My sophomore year of high school, I tried to call my grandad (mom’s side),who I had built a relationship with over the course of a year. When it went to voicemail, I just decided to wait. We eventually got a call telling us he had a heart attack and passed away in his bathroom. This really effected me, to a point where I began pushing people away,for fear of dealing with these issues again.In the mean time,we moved my Grandmother (Dad’s side) into our house,so she wouldn’t be lonely. When she moved in,it was a bit of a toxic environment that began brewing. There were arguments about many different things almost weekly, to a point,I began to isolate myself from my family. So I graduated high school and got my first job. I was scheduled to work a 4 day stint from Friday to Monday,well Thursday I get a call asking me to come in and cover for one of my co-workers. I agreed to take his shift. That day,my grandmother was hospitalized and she passed away Sunday night. I never got to say goodbye.When I found out she had passed, I lost my mind. I broke the foot board of my bed in half and had a mental breakdown, this was the first time I had ever called the national suicide hotline. I went to work less than 12 hours after she passed and was mocked and ridiculed like most other days. The next day (Tuesday), I talked with my family about setting up my first appointment with my old psychiatrist, and then the date was set.I was mortified about my appointment,to the point, I tried to avoid it in any way possible. But when I got back to the office, it was like when I was a kid,before my life came crashing down. We had a good chat and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I remember her saying those words and not knowing what to think. Was I crazy? How would it affect me? Was this something that I should keep secret? I had to figure out the answers and soon. So from May to September of last year, I went and saw my psychiatrist on a biweekly basis. I took medication to help. I felt like things would be okay, and then she retired. I thought there would be a referral to someone else,but there wasn’t, I was just put out to pasture with a few pill bottles. In October, I had another bad mental breakdown, I couldn’t find any will to move forward with life, so I set up an appointment with a therapist.When it came to therapy, I wondered a lot about what it entailed. What would I do if it didn’t work? What comes after it? Any more pills? So,I went to the first session with an open mind. I found that it helped a good bit, but I needed to find a psychiatrist, so after months of looking, I found one and I have an appointment set for the 19th of next month. But,how am I doing now?In short, depends on the day. Some are great and I love them,but most are unfortunately ,challenging to get through. The way my brain is set, I hate myself with an immense passion, and I’m trying to fight back against it. I am fighting, which can be considered a victory in it’s own right.If you make it to the end of this, I just want to say, that YOU ARE WORTH IT. I at times am very tough on myself, and I don’t want any of you,my friends, to suffer like I allow myself to. Love you all. Take care.
unipos [info] You're getting a lot of shit but I hope you won't be discouraged. This subreddit unfortunately has a lot of victim mentality and saying anything in the direction of encouraging people to try a bit harder is interpreted in an extremely negative light.I'm a fat lazy slob, a negative person with a fatalistic attitude. I've been diagnosed with depression, ADHD, psychosis... . I've let myself slide into a miserable state. And the only one I can blame is myself. The truth is I don't even try to make my life better very often because I forget I can. But when I see a post like yours, I remember again that I can try and I can do. Even if it's just small baby steps.The only thing I wish is I had brave people like you in my life, reminding that I can do better and when need be sometimes remind me of uncomfortable truths.But I can see why people often don't bother. Because they get shat on and accused of not having empathy. You have my upvote.
CosinesCosines [info] I can kinda relate to this. I was diagnosed with depression and my docs kept only suggesting medication and therapy to help. Neither worked. I come to learn on my own that simply cutting out certain people who were my stressors helped tremendously. All the therapists I've been to only tried to teach me skills on how to deal with said people when they actually should've told me to just leave them.
McSwearWolf [info] Looking over your post history .... I am not a doctor but before you do this, please have your hormone levels (thyroid) checked out. It can be a factor. Source: I am diagnosed with depression but also had my PCP run thyroid levels several times, and it turns out I have ‘T3 sick syndrome’ / Euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) which is a state of adaptation or dysregulation of thyrotropic feedback control wherein the levels of T3 and/or T4 are abnormal, but the thyroid gland does not appear to be dysfunctional. Thus, my issues were misdiagnosed for years. I have a masters in psychology as well, and I know bipolar is very real, but I also think mental healthcare is a real mixed bag. I received different diagnoses from several different experts and I found out about the thyroid issues myself from doing my own research. PS: meds do not work well for people with thyroid issues. Really tricky. As for your grad program... can you take some time off? Talk to your advisor. Explain you are seriously ill at the moment and you need HELP. I hope you’ll stick around and see if you can find more answers. I’m rooting for you.
oofecalmatteroo666 [info] Just curious how old are you ? I was diagnosed with depression at like 16 at first then by 20 phase II bipolar. Honestly if you got diagnosed in the past with just depression with no extreme behavior like violence , stealing , over spending etc... I highly doubt that would change now . You could be considered bipolar with small bouts of mania like maybe talking fast extreme energy maybe more irritable insomnia. I get what you’re saying tho the connotation of being bipolar always seems worse than depression . Don’t be scared . I’m 36 and I will warn you be careful about drug and alcohol abuse, it’s common with bipolar . I went to a great school but truthfully that was my downfall the drugs . Just Be mindful of behavior then you will be ok 
Teefdreams [info] Yeah, not great to keep going to psychiatrists in search of a specific diagnosis.   Howwweeeever, I was misdiagnosed. 17 yrs ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Which, like, I was depressed and having severe panic attacks. They just missed the hypomania. And they didn't ask me if I could hear my neighbours thoughts at night so I didn't tell them.   SSRIs don't really work for people with BP. It's one of the things that psychiatrists look for when they diagnose. SSRIs generally send us manic or don't work at all.  The other stuff sounds more like hypomania?  Edit: Someone else has mentioned BPD. Definitely worth looking into, especially since you mention a traumatic childhood.  And another thing, are you always absorbed in something when you don't sleep?
Exoen [info] I didn't have PTSD but I had nightmares every night when I was diagnosed with depression and took antidepressants. I was also scared to fall asleep. Eventually I was diagnosed as bipolar and switched to mood stabilizers and it went away for most of the time. I don't have enough information to give advice, but from my experience it got better with different medication and therapy.I hope you find your thing too.
LlZARD99 [info] Thank you.  I've been diagnosed with depression, but I haven't had these intense feelings since I was in my 20s. I'm 47 now.
CreepySignature [info] Yeah typically they might say the birth control to see if "balances" your hormones. There's a degree to which I think having small ups and downs is "normal". My counselor outs it this way, when you're in your high energy, hypomanic state, you're using up all your "good" brain chemicals and then you crash which leads to the depression. Until you get a counselor and/psychiatrist my suggestion for you would be notice these high energy, hypomanic moments and try (if you can) to reel it in and do something that's the opposite of what your high energy body wants to do. I know I will sound like a broken record, but try something like meditation where you HAVE to be still and calm you brain down. There are plenty of apps like calm, headspace, etc. That have some free guided meditations in them. My other suggestion would be just to go walk. Don't make yourself do a project or try to complete something. That sort of feeds the beast from my experience. As far as the depression goes, same thing, try REALLY hard to force yourself to do some of the things you might do in a hypomanic state. I feel like as cyclothymatics (is that a word? Lol) have the ability to manage their moods a bit more without medication than say bipolar 1 or 2. BUT with that being said, you absolutely need to seek a counselor first and foremost when you are able to. AND DON'T TAKE SSRI'S OR ANTIDEPRESSANTS WITHOUT BEING LOOKED AT FOR BIPOLAR. Zoloft fucked me up for 2 years while I was on it because I was just diagnosed with depression and anxiety.
snickeringdoodle1 [info] Sadly I can relate, I tried to get medication for my depression but they wouldn't and the doctor said I just have stress... Even though I've been diagnosed with depression. I often don't feel like I have good enough of a reason. Even with everything falling apart I still feel like I'm overreacting. Hang in there.
MaltaMassive [info] I feel this on so many levels.I had counselling last year for depression and I take antidepressants. I was diagnosed with depression but it’s caused and triggered by extremely low self esteem. Do you ever do something really great, like a big achievement, and only get 30 seconds of joy before it’s ‘okay what next?’. My expectations are unreachable and nothing is ever enough. I’m never enough.What’s your relationship with your parents like? My issues have been ingrained from my childhood. My mum has always made me the black sheep, and I was never enough of a daughter for her. Here I am at 28, carrying that around in every aspect of my life.
Reasonable-Tart [info] I once mentioned that I wanted to die during middle school.I've also confided to them that I've been diagnosed with depression.Other than that, I once accidentally showed my self harm scars but they didn't comment on it.
SubMeTender [info] Well it’s overdue that somebody replied to this. I’m guessing you are in a different place but I do have something to say about this. It is not so much addressed to you as it is something I think it’s relevant in a broad sense.  I bring it up only because there are myths, stigmas, and misunderstandings that lead a lot of people to reluctance about this topic.Our capacity to experience joy can sometimes be compromised, and this can have far reaching and profound effects on our interpretation of events, circumstance, and our very lives. Sometimes these things can be improved by a change of routine, perspective or condition. But sometimes the issue is simply chemical.  The mechanisms to pass these signals are impeded and nothing we do outside of addressing that issue will help. It’s rarely cut and dried, and it is often a mix of things.  But it is important to investigate all of them, because the weak link in the chain can prevent any progress at all.I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 47. I probably had suffered from it for at least a decade. I contemplated taking my own life for at least two months before I sought help.  I was prescribed a daily medication, and although that on its own did not “fix” me, it restored the tools I needed to address my problems. It did not alter my personality, and side effects were short lived. I will have to take it every day for the rest of my life. But diabetics have to take insulin. It is not a failure or a character flaw. It is a chronic illness and mine simply requires medication.This is not a blanket endorsement of medication, and not everybody responds to or tolerates medication in the same way.  Just don’t write it off. Include it in your investigation of treatment options. It may take time and trial and error to find the right one and the right dosage. See it through.Anyway, I hope that the emotions or lack thereof that you experienced that day have passed. If not, don’t put it off. Look into it and address it proactively. You may find that you are able to find joy in even the most mundane aspects of life.Peace and love!
antsinyurpants [info] I’m sorry about your circumstances. I ended up trying to find a medication that would help me. I tried 3 of them and then decided it wasn’t working out for me. Getting myself into a routine has helped as well as figuring out the underlying reasons to some of my most distorted thoughts. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety
sadatquarantine2020 [info] I have a gut feeling that I'm bipolar. I have been diagnosed with depression last year, but I noticed I experience during years a HUGE swing mood. I spend weeks or months depressed as fuck and suddently I become angry or super active and make the worst decisions possible. I want to go to the doctor to find out if I'm right.
3NicksTapRoom [info] Everything with quarantine and the economy has me depressed also. I have been diagnosed with depression but I’ve always felt it was mild. Now it’s head on. I don’t want to live. I fear living life like this for two years much greater than I do from dying of the virus. What blows my mind is how much people like living life in quarantine. I can’t even fathom being happy in these circumstances.
bookishrory [info] Same...Everyone deals with shit differentlyHeckSame person can deal with shit differently in different times.I used to be like that.I was diagnosed with depression at 16 but I'm pretty sure I've had it since I was 12.But from 12-16 I was very creative and very good at school.I used to work to ignore the negative thoughts. And when I couldn't work I would write poems or paint or read books.Now I can't do that which sucks so muchI'm just failing at everything
Born-Pea [info] So, I’ve been on both sides of the coin. I was diagnosed with depression at 7 and been on and off medicine since then (I’m almost 20 now). I’ve gone through suicidal thoughts, mild self harm and 3 therapists, not wanting to get up and just feeling empty and worthless.Since a few months ago, for some reason, it’s like my depression went down. I feel pretty happy. I’m currently on no medication, and haven’t seen my therapist due to lockdown. I remember thinking for years I wouldn’t be in the mental state I am now, but here we are. I still feel weird sometimes, have fall downs and tend to be negative, but overall I can say I’m pretty content with my life. Still don’t have many friends, cut down a few, doing pretty bad in college, living with a psychologically abusive person and feeling alone, tho. I don’t know what advise to give, as everyone’s situation is different, but being ok is possible, hang on :)
PeacefulWoodturner [info] I am a germophobe as well. I am diagnosed with depression and OCD. There are only two effective ways to address this and usually happen together. First is medication. Second is cognitive behavioral therapy. She can be helped, but it will take a lot of work and be very hard. However, it can be done. Please find a psychiatry practice that has experience with these types of disorders and be prepared to work hard. You (plural) can do this. Please don't give up
_floof_poof [info] I was diagnosed with depression from the doctor but he basically dismissed everything else. Thank you for the advice
TheStockyScholar [info] I just wish this wasn’t so hard for me. I used to be so fit and felt great but my life went to hell...it’s basically the last mountain I have to climb over and I just keep failing.I don’t understand why it’s so hard, mentally. I tried everything, Nutrisystem, Slim4Life, weight loss metabolism booster injections, it all felt like hell.The last thing that worked was a 1200 calorie diet I did when I was 12 and I did very well on it. Then I went downhill when I was diagnosed with depression at 20. Idk, man. You make it look so easy.
sueecidle [info] Hello. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a while back. I get anxious as heck when I hear loud noises as well. Sometimes my dad comes home from a long day at work and gets irritated at the slightest things. I understand that but my body’s response is anxiety. I become hyperaware of my surroundings.When my mom becomes annoyed at something, she tends to slam things - plates, doors, whatever. Sometimes she does this without being angry as well. My mind still panics. My anxiety heightens and my hands tremble. Difficult to breathe. List goes on. Some context, she used to cane me when I was younger. Scream, slapped, everything you can think of. Sometimes I think this made me who I am today. Though I wouldn’t want to blame her. Idk.
I-m-smbdy [info] I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few months ago. I had my two worst panic attacks in the three days before the SATs. Managed to score 2030. Not sure if that deserves gold, but homemade pizza from my mom was pretty awesome!
gwynnie0811 [info] I would struggle less with words if I were writing a review of a beauty product. But it wouldn't be well-written. Writing about depression and anxiety would be difficult and slow. I wouldn't know where or how to begin. How would I structure my content. I would also agonize over the choice of words and getting the tone right. I was diagnosed with depression 11 years ago. But it's only recently I started to act on my suicide ideation. Like researching methods to end my life. Amassing prescription anti-emetics if I decide to poison myself. Finding a spot to throw myself off a building. Writing a will and a farewell note. The last time I felt close to normal was when I did my masters 5 years ago. My classmates said I had a photographic memory. My brain was different then. 
TheMediaBear [info] The best thing you can do is post on social media "I have been diagnosed with depression"  It's what I did, against the opinion of my wife who felt it was a bad mark against her and our life together. But you know what?  As soon as I was brave enough to be open about it I was amazed by the reaction. 2 of the people I worked with where taking  Sertraline, 3 more had taken it.  I had friends Facebook messaging me about it asking questions about their own situations.    I even had someone come up to me in the street and thank me about being so open about it and it pushed them to seek help.  I didn't know them at all but they'd been told about me via a friend.   You'll also find a weight lifted from your shoulders from not keeping the secret anymore.   As for your parents, some people will never get it, no matter how bad it gets, they can't process it. That's their issue, not yours.
saskiasensei [info] And I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety already
KaiSea182 [info] I feel this way too. In sixth grade I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. In seventh grade I was diagnosed with ADHD and OCD. I’ve also been struggling with a few addictions lately like eating paper or drinking my own blood. I’ve always wondered what if I don’t have these things. What if I actually have something completely different, or like you said it could be from poor habits. But listen, you might have doubts, but your mental illness does not define you. Who cares what you have, as long as you’re a great person and take care of yourself. People get misdiagnosed all the time but that’s not the point. Work hard to achieve your goals and don’t worry about it. Personally I find coping mechanisms much more helpful than meds. I’ve took six medications and none of them ever worked. But my habits, my hobbies, my mindset, that was much more effective for me. Hoped this helps!
LakeForest3 [info] It is possible, for awhile I was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia.  Really it doesn't matter too much because anti-psychotics also treat depression.  If your mood is poor try abilify, it works wonders for mine.
General_09LT [info] It’s a long story, i hope you get comfortable while reading this, please please please read to the end. Back in 2012 when I was 12 in 6th grade, i was always quiet and shy in elementary,I still was in middle and high school... and I still am as an adult. Back then what I really wanted was for people to like me, I see all these kids be wanted by others, people becoming the popular kids, and wanted to be friends with them because A: i wanted to be popular too, and B: they seemed actually really cool to me. But because my life role is being the loser, no one wanted to talk to me or has liked being around me.....and it still is like that to this day wether I’m at work or anywhere really. Anyways, back to 2012, Everyone was making a bunch of new friends, having a girlfriend, people loved to be around them, and I wanted all of that too. So I joined the school football team, joined band, tried to be the class clown and tried to make friends...all in the hopes that maybe one day, people will like me. In 7th grade 2013, I was still unable to achieve that but kept doing football cause most of the football players had girlfriends and I hoped that I would too, well that didn’t happen. People on the team also didn’t like me simply cause I was the school loser. The coaches would tell people to pick who they want to be on their team, and I was ALWAYS, the last one chosen. Nobody wanted me. And no matter how hard I tried to impress them, to actually let them know that I’m not as bad and stupid as I seem, they would always call me names, pushed me around, knock over my stuff, frame me for things I didn’t do, it was bad. Even OUTSIDE of fooball, I’d be the last chosen person for a group project, no one looked forward to talking to me, and the reason was because the popular kids were in football, and they were spreading rumors about me. It was like having a paper on my back that said “kick me”, except there was no paper, like a bad omen. Foolishly I still stayed on the team for the remainder of middle school in hopes to earn respect and get that girlfriend I always wished for, but I got neither. (This was before I knew how getting a girlfriend actually works) One day 8th grade in early 2014, after watching youtubers become famous, I made that my dream, to become a popular gaming YouTuber, something I put my heart into. I worked hard trying to make content, eventually one of the football players caught me looking at my channel on my phone, and told everyone in the school about it. I was made fun of for the rest of the year about it. And that was the day I got depressed. My dreams were absolutely crushed, demolished, burned into smithereens, just like that. I was mortified, and was bullied for a super long time which made things even worse. If I wasn’t a loser back then, then I certainly was one that day. Late 2014 a freshman and all the way to 2018 as a senior, I had no one to talk to but 4 people who actually took the time to get to know me unlike everyone else who assumes I’m the weirdo. A lot happened though in those 4 years, disappointed people I looked up to, was still picked on, let down the band directors who had faith in me, got screwed over by the school district messing up my classes, 3 heartbreaks, it was rough. Even at my job I don’t say anything cause everyone there is super toxic.( i work at a car shop) I can’t trust anyone, I never talk unless I absolutely have to, and I bottle up my sadness and anger, and put on a mask to pretend I’m fine. I almost got myself into a food disorder. We have this thing where someone stands outside and put air in peoples tires for free. Summer of 2019 I did that for 6 hours straight, 6 days a week, in the burning sun with no shade. I had the thought by not moving around much I would gain weight so I would only eat as little as 200 calories. Until after 2 weeks I got tired of the pain and forced myself to eat more, then was aware of what was happening. It was horrible on my knees, had my knees wrapped and in a brace for 2 months cause the pain of getting up and down repeatedly for 6 hours a day was brutal. I was basically the guy who did the work that no one else did. I never felt so useless in my life, I hated myself so much too, I told myself I wasn’t good enough and I will never be, and that I wasn’t worth it and I should take my own life. Eventually I got out of that mindset after I took matters into my own hands and threatened to call HR about it. They finally put me in a better position. But my depression, anxiety, and self hatred got worse and worse, and still is to this day but I’m still learning to control it. How I realized I was depressed? So keep in mind I didn’t have much people to talk to, and still don’t. Sometimes people come to me when they need someone, but I can’t go to them because “I need to man up” “I got to get over it” etc. Like damn, I didn’t tell you guys that, why do you need to say that to me? Anyways because I can’t talk to literally anyone about stuff, I have to be the doctor, AND the patient to help myself. One day in high school after I accepted the fact I’ll be alone for the rest of my life, I realized something was off, that I wasn’t as calm, quiet as I used to be. I had my parents take me to a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, severe social anxiety and self hatred (low self esteem). Medications haven’t helped at all despite having maximum dosage, so I’ve had to teach myself how to control my emotions, learn to bottle everything up, make myself away that suicide shouldn’t be my death. But my mind was still getting toxic one day I shut myself off to everyone. That lasted for a year until I recovered from that.I admit I’m not in my best mindset, I’m still trying to recover, again I have to doctor myself, but hey, at least I’m trying. The good thing is I’m making little progress. I am learning healthier ways to control my emotions and healthier habits instead of bottling things up making everything a loving nightmare. I can say I am Better than I was last year, it’s not easy doctoring myself, but I hope I’ll get though it all.Thanks
wordvomitonthedaily [info] I totally get some of the things you're saying. I'm diagnosed with depression. It's been a little more than a year but I've lost so much of myself. I have nights where I cry for hours and feel so insanely bad. My family sucks at communication and it hurts. Especially when you're crying in front of your mom and she just refuses to acknowledge it. I have endless issues. Ive been self harming too, tried overdosing once and suicide lingers in my mind. Times are hard. But just as I pick things up, all the bad shit I thought I let go off comes back. I relapse all the time. I just can't outrun any of it. I experience a sadness which just breaks me. And I'm alone because of it. I can't seem to trust my family and I just feel like I need an escape.
dylan-dylan-dylan [info] How sad i am and the dark thoughts I’m still thinking and the bad actions i’m still doing. I was diagnosed with depression and my parents know that but they’d rather think it’s gone now then to help. I have a therapist but i’ve been lying to her about how I’m actually feeling so she thinks I’m getting better. I know that defeats the purpose of therapy but the last time i was genuinely open about my feelings she broke the confidentiality and told my parents about my suicidal thoughts. I understand why but i just don’t want to go through talking with my parents about that again. They were so uncomfortable with it. My parents are divorced too so i didn’t just have one conversation with the both of them together, i had two separate very uncomfortable conversations with people who don’t understand my thoughts very well. Theres been multiple occasions where my mental state became very obvious to my parents, like when my mom found a rope in my closet and a blade on the bathroom floor, but that situation was easily escaped by just using the excuse “it was from a while before, I’m better now”. For the blade incident, she checked my wrists but not my legs (i used it on my legs) so i simply said it wasn’t mine and i didn’t know where it came from.
bluetypes [info] The other commenter is right that depression and suicidal ideation are not always linked. Based on the way you're describing your experience, though, you sound pretty depressed to me. Before I was diagnosed with depression, I thought you had to be like staring at a wall, just like numbed out, to count as depressed. But actually feeling extremely sensitive, going from feeling angry to sad, and generally feeling like the stakes of life are so high and you're sure you're going to fail -- these are all parts of being depressed too.Also, I'm sure you've had people tell you not to compare yourself to others, but it's so true. Where there's smoke there's fire. Especially with pain -- pain is literally just the feeling of pain. How is it possible that the pain you feel is actually not as bad as it feels? If some people aren't hurt as much by the same things, well, that's great for them, but that doesn't real change your situation. Just remember that even Anne Frank, in her diary, says that other people have it worse than her. The question isn't where do I fit on the scale of people having a bad time, it's just am I in pain, and what can I do about it.I can tell things are really hard for you right now. But don't forget you're someone who has loved and dreamed, and hopefully still loves and dreams. Life is way, way more than some hoops to jump through to just be good enough. Feeling that way isn't as easy as flicking a switch, but it's still true.
EmmaB2 [info] Yeah, this exactly. I have been diagnosed with depression, so this sums up how I feel perfectly
MajestyMad [info] Yes. Graduated in the top 10 of my graduation class of 600+ students. Had scholarships and bursaries, won film festivals and was involved in many extra curricular activities. My mental health had been shaky on and off since around age 14. By the time I was 22, and hadn't got the help I needed. I was diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder.
big_damn-heroes [info] Hey hey hey. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety recently and started on Prozac about two months ago. I was also lashing out at my boyfriend and picking fights because I had it in my head that he was going to leave me because I was depressed, so I was trying to force his hand so he'd leave me and I'd confirm my thoughts that I was worthless and didn't deserve to be in a relationship.He knows something's up and he's struggling to deal with it because he doesn't want to lash out at you and tell you that you've been hurting him. Come clean and tell him how you're feeling and tell him why you think you're picking fights. Get help and include him in the journey.
purpletortellini [info] I've never really experienced other people brush off mental illness this often. Whenever I tell people I have social anxiety or depression (but really you don't just tell anyone this of course), they usually find a way to connect with me on that level. "I get anxiety sometimes too!" Or "I was diagnosed with depression XX years ago!" Also, therapy seems to be extremely common.I feel like people who don't take mental health seriously these days are becoming a minority. Maybe it's the area I live in?
hastrek [info] I have told my boss (because it was affecting my work very apparently) that I have been diagnosed with depression. I haven't yet faced any repercussions, probably because my employer is aware of mental health issues in the field I work in.
TrumpdUP [info] I do understand that as I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I was merely sharing how I have set my life up to help me out as much as possible and it is working. I am the happiest I’ve been since ever. I’m not saying that this is a fix for everyone. I’m saying what has NATURALLY helped me and helped me not have to take pills anymore. Just wanted to share for people who may relate or find some help from it.
dozer00 [info] I was diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, OCD and AvPD years ago.I'm 24, I have no job, I'm not indipendent and I live as an hikikomori since I was 15 but for my State I don't have requirements to be recognized as Disabled and receive an economic support or work support.
narr1 [info] Oh my fuck, I can't deal with this anymore. I feel horrible, all the time; my diabetes is slowly killing me and I couldn't care less, everyone thinks I'm doing OK now, but I'm not. I was diagnosed with depression 3-4 years ago, I can't really remember, but I have been depressed probably for the past 8 years. So since I was 15, as I'm 23 now.
sensitivesliceofpie [info] When I was diagnosed with depression I learned who my real friends were. My two “best friends” decided that I was doing it for attention and that they shouldn’t be friends with me anymore and I was “too much for them to handle.” There were only a few that were really there for me, and now because of corona I only have one or two that check in on me every few weeks.
Kelly_Louise [info] First of all, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I know how scary and hard it can be. But it gets better! My fiancé has cirrhosis from drinking and cannot ever drink again. He was only 26 when he was diagnosed. The thing that helped him the most in getting and staying sober was having a strong support system. People that he knew would never leave him even if things got really hard. He never went to AA or any other support group, but I think he could have benefited from it. He was also prescribed antidepressants by his doctor, and the doc also highly encourages him to see a therapist. I think he should have started seeing a therapist as soon as he was diagnosed, I think it could have helped a lot. (but I’m not really one to talk since I haven’t seen a therapist in years and I am diagnosed with depression)My fiancé is soooo much happier and healthier now that he has been sober for 3 years. He tells me all the time he is so much better off. Of course it was really hard at first, he lost a lot of “friends” (drinking buddies). But now our life has stabilized again and things are really good. There is a light at the end of the tunnel! The first and hardest step is admitting there is a problem.
oofiies [info] That's exactly it. I have horrible issues with being sure of what I'm doing in practically every aspect of my life. I've been with my therapist for 3 years and most of the time I never say anything that has actually affected me, apart from some ranting about small issues. I just don't want to think about the bad stuff. I'm just worried it's not going to be valid. Looking at everyone else who has C-PTSD I wonder whether I'm overreacting or I'm too sensitive. My therapist also doesn't like to diagnose, which is why I got my diagnosis from my (not seeing anymore) psychiatrist, and I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD. I've just actually started doubting my diagnosis after I posted something on the depression subreddit, in which people told me I should get reevaluated because it doesn't sound like depression. They suggested things like BPD, bipolar, and C-PTSD. I do have a lot of gaps in my memories, a lot of the time when I have issues in the household I forget about it 5 minutes after it happens. I dissociate a ton at school too. I still have trouble staying "grounded". Most times I just try to slap or hurt myself in different areas of my body and it kinda works, but doesn't do it entirely.
Oreo1123 [info] Unfortunately yes. I was diagnosed with depression about 9 months ago.
EllietteB [info] I'm sorry, but I did actually say it in my original post. I mentioned trauma several times, included complex PTSD (which is PTSD that develops when a child experiences continuous trauma throughout their childhood), and I said I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders.I do know where you're coming from and why you also reacted that way, but I never claimed to be a "normie". Bipolar is a condition that includes depression, which is why I made my post. It makes sense that my doctors might just have assumed I have "normal" depression.I can't read people either due to my GAD and crippling social anxiety. I always think people are judging and hating me thanks to that. Can't help it. It's part of my condition. I'm just asking you to please read posts before making comments that could end up causing more harm than good. Please try be respectful and mindful of other mental illnesses.Don't worry though, sometimes I'm the same when I hear "normal people" say they're getting"anxiety" and can't differentiate between worry and anxiety.
Stella643 [info] I was diagnosed with depression but I can tell you what it’s like without anxiety. Although this answer is probably affected my my depression and ADD (basically ADHD without the H and was officially diagnosed, not a bullshit self diagnoses.)I pretty much don’t think. If I wanna do something, I will just do it. Not even a normal amount of thought, let alone the constant going-over-it-in-my-head I hear about for anxiety. This causes a problem when I do something or say something really impulsively. And I can’t bring myself to care Aaron all when I’m in the moment. Only after I do something dumb will I think I’m an idiot who isn’t even worthy of speech. But in the moment it’s like I’m a monkey. Want the fruit, go get the fruit. Screw anyone who says you can’t.Basically, ADD (impulsively) + depression (lack of caring) = no thinking when I do things.
_spaghettirat [info] Thanks for the detailed advice! I hadn't seen any more simple services like that yet, just full houses n stuff (plus i thought you had to have full dinnerware n furniture n a tv to move out for some reason). To answer your questions, I had to leave school in year 10 (medical reasons), and I'm Australian. I do get government payments, and I've been saving for over a year. Getting a job once I have somewhere to live won't be an issue.As for why I'm leaving, there's many complicated reasons (prepare yourself for rambling). To put it simply the rest of my family are in a cult, and I've seperated myself from that, when I did so the only reason I didn't get kicked out onto the streets is because I agreed to follow some rules that are very damaging for me mentally (basically still be a part of the cult in the way i live and act). Problem is, I'm trans, plus very much gay, and that ain't ok apparently. Because of my past, I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, I have an eating disorder that sent me to hospital and I'm autistic. So, we out here havin some trouble with findin a reason to live when i just want to be myself, ergo, moving out. Do you think taking only one dog would be easier? The dog that's legally mine is slightly smaller, and I can make sure the other one goes to a good home.
RhubarbSurprise [info] From my experience it's both. In my life there has been a phase or two, where it was very difficult. I was diagnosed with depression at a young age and put on medication. It did take months and it did take a couple of years to get better, but it was worth it. If you get help, whether its through your family and friends, professionals or the internet, you will slowly but steadily be equipped with the tools to handle your situtation. Depression might be with you forever and creep out once in awhile, but you can learn how to manage it. You control it, it doesn't control you. You might need to fight for awhile to win back the control, but it will be worth it, to be back in control, I can promise you that.
candlelightandcocoa [info] Thank you so much! And being a homemaker is valuable, I'm sorry if my post made it seem so. There's a lot of pressure from society for SAHM's to stop being SAHM's when your kids are older. My youngest child is 13 so I no longer need to 'stay home with him.'  I'd really like to see a therapist if it isn't too expensive, and if I can get my husband's support. I hope he does, because this (my depression and anxiety) affects HIM just as much as it affects me. I want to get formally assessed for adult ADHD, and anxiety disorder. I was diagnosed with depression by my general medical doctor for my Wellbutrin prescription, that was all the help I've had so far. Wellbutrin doesn't really have much of an affect on my moods or ability to executive function. I still have brain fog and am terribly forgetful. Almost like early dementia, but it's more because of my emotions on overload. :(
H8303518 [info] "Yes I am, because I have been diagnosed with depression"Now lemme just say, don't self-diagnose yourself with mental illness, there's so so so many biases that come into play and there's this thing in psychology where if you look up the symptoms you are likely to also display the symptoms. Just all round, not a good idea. **Also TRIGGER WARNING, TALKING HEAVILY ABOUT DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE**Around 13-ish I said this. I had been suicidal, intensely so for 2 years at this point, and never told anyone. That day in school I simply could not put on a face to show i was not hollow. I couldn't. The "depression voice" (if ya'll don't know, in depression it's very common to have a "voice" criticising you, it comes seemingly from the external, ex. YOU are worthless, however it's merely an adaption of your own stream of consciousness, non-depressed individual can have this type of voice as well), anyway so the depression voice was calling me selfish etc. etc, as it does. I was on the brink of tears, my friends noticed obviously. I don't recall how, but I know they were asking if I was okay, me not trusting my voice anymore I wrote on a napkin some shit like "I feel insane" or "i feel mental" and then the tears properly came out.They took me outside of the dining room, and asked why, what's wrong etc. And then I cracked. Completely and utterly sobbing. "I want to die, *I want to kill myself*, I don't want to be here, I don't want to be alive." I really only coherently got out the I want to kill myself part, and in the mean time the voice was saying *You are so weak for telling them, you are nothing do you think they care?* SO, still while sobbing one of my friends said "Is this a prank?" and the other remaining one said "my mum has depression, I just don't think you do". Which at this point I want to insert that this is a reasonable response for 13 year olds, obviously, I really don't blame either of them, of course there are better points that could have been said but they were young and in my heart I have tried to forgive. So at that point I freak out *See? They don't believe you because they don't care. Look at yourself wanting attention*. Still sobbing I tell the lie. I just wanted them to believe me that's all. It was so hard for two years being so young and wanting to die, I didn't even believe something was wrong because depression does that to you. And to hear from someone else that what I was feeling wasn't real? Fucking hurt at the time. It would hurt now if I got that type of response and being a 13 year old kid...damn.Damn.*Liar. You want attention so badly you'll lie for it? Fucking amazing. How selfish can you get?*And, they still didn't believe me. So now I had given the voice a few more names to call me and two people who didn't believe me, when I first and finally told someone. For that reason I didn't tell anyone for a further 6 years. I didn't get help. But damn was that a justified lie, because I needed to be believed at the time. And I understand and forgive myself for lying. It was okay, me.&#x200B;I am doing much better now, recently y discharged from mental health clinic so am MUCH better. Still working on my journey and the ghosts of the past. xx
mentalhealthmaster [info] I just wanted to add that I think phrasing is incredibly important. There’s a huge difference between saying, “What you’re going through sounds like what I went through, and I was diagnosed with depression” and “You have major depressive disorder.”I’m a clinical therapist by day and it’d be incredibly unethical for me to diagnose on Reddit or even to imply a diagnosis, so I’d say the same applies to everyone. Anyone can read info online or pick-up their own copy of the DSM-V, but no one is in the position on here to do a proper assessment. It’s walking a fine line between providing information/support and conversing as a clinical professional would. I’d say the most important part of this is it’s a reminder to remain aware of our words.
ItzNice [info] Missed school because I fell asleep at 4am from insomnia. Been anxious all day because of stress from missing classes I'm behind in. I've stayed in bed for about 6 hours straight now and haven't eaten anything since yesterday. I'm currently in a fight with my ex, but I can't bring myself to leave her, I've been dependant on her for close to 3 years now, but I think I really need to leave her for good. On the bright side I found some good music.As of now, I'm a little over a month clean of self harm. I don't take any meds but I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and bulimia. I have terrible mood swings that stop me from making friends, because one simple thing they say can set me off. Overall, I'm doing shitty in the social department, but not too bad in the "I want to fucking die" department.
weedbetterknot [info] Were you on heavy drugs when you were diagnosed?  Is that what they're basing your diagnosis on?When I was using I know I wasn't myself. I did and said things I would never have done sober but I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety before I used. I stopped on my own because I hated who looked back at me in the mirror.I take a SSRI daily now, I hate being dependent on a medication but it really does help. If I go a day or two without it there are very obvious side effects. If you want to stop your meds I'd definitely explain this to your doctor so you can be properly weaned off.Your sobriety is an amazing accomplishment and shows how strong you are. If you want to step away from medication just do it properly so you don't get hurt. If you do need medication however that doesn't make you any less of yourself. Good luck.
1MILVoltage [info] I was diagnosed with depression in February, I'm on meds but these things still happen, so I don't know what to think, thank you for your answer.
r0s3w4t3r [info] I’ve been seeing my therapist for over a year. We just talk about my week and my emotions behind it. She never diagnosed me but after a year with her I decided to try medication and my psychiatrist diagnosed me with CPTSD. When I was younger (before seeing my current therapist) I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. It felt like I’d always be stuck that way, but when I began to look into CPTSD (even before my diagnosis) everything began to click. I pretty much decided there was no way I didn’t have it. I felt relieved because my depression and anxiety were symptoms of something I can heal from. (Granted I wasn’t going around declaring I had cptsd through self diagnosed. But after the official diagnosis I felt more comfortable with identifying with it, and posting on the cptsd subreddits.) I say research. Research and research and learn and learn because even professionals get it wrong sometimes or they don’t see the full picture. And even if you don’t have it, you may still have some symptoms and therefore can learn plenty on how to manage those based on the information given. I’m now in CBT as well as standard therapy. Me looking into cptsd was nothing but helpful for me. I’d say go for it but also educate yourself on other possibilities.
idkwhattoputlol69 [info] Even if it is just teen angst or smt, any suffering is real, and doesn't deserve to be ignored simply because you aren't diagnosed. I'm also 13 (albeit 14 in about a week) and I've been diagnosed with depression, but before I was I definitely had the same feeling of 'this seems worse than normal' but you don't want to assume and seem like a dick. Obviously it's best to get diagnosed from a professional but right now that's kinda difficult cause of corona and everything. I think that no matter the cause of ur suffering u are still totally valid for getting help.I'd be glad to chat with you about it if you'd like! :) But dont feel pressured!
AChangeOfSeasoning [info] Mental disorders are supposed to severely affect your life. I was diagnosed with depression because I attempted suicide a couple times. I didn't bother to look into a couple other things that I thought I had because, by definition, they were not severe enough to seriously hinder my life, even if it sucked mentally. Not sick enough is a real thing. If your life isn't severely impacted, it's not a mental disorder.
GwenCocoUgo [info] This won't be the best advice here, but this is what I did regarding the first part of your issue - your parents not wanting to take ADHD seriously. Take from this what you will. I was diagnosed at 17 as well. Exact same situation, and I was sent to a doctor by the school GC and so what followed was that I wasn't allowed to have sessions with the GC anymore either. What I did was stopped giving a fuck. I spent hours doing what I wanted to, which was watching TV. I didn't attend any classes first semester of college, and failed 3 of my 5 classes. I hated that, but I was still not caring. I wasted so much time it's unbelievable. Second year, I was put on academic probation and I was eating 200 calories a day (ED). went into treatment for ED after nearly fainting twice a day after 2 months of eating 1000 calories a week. Nobody had any choice then. I was either going to take antidepressants, or be dead. The doctors talked to my family. The treatment continued. I was 19 at the time, and had just survived an almost dangerous ED. Doctor visits continued, at the school clinic and for the first itme ever my family was spending money on my mental health because it was physical health as well. There I was diagnosed with depression, Anxiety, OCD and ADD. An entire year on drugs was not fun, and I don't even really remember it... but guess what, I was going through the motions of life. Getting up, going to class, etc. I finished uni in 6 years, but I finished ffs. It's been a struggle. It'll be a struggle for years to come I'm sure. Anyways, what's that got to do with you? Well, you could start by letting your mind take over. Just let all the horrible shit happen. It's kind of good to get all that out of your system young. LOL. BUT, do you honestly want to go through this? Do you want to wait until you're almost dying to get help? Dude, you're a kid and you already are more self aware than half people twice your age. You deserve to have a little help here. That help is either meds or a therapist. Do whatever you can to either convince your parents, or just go after it yourself. About the job; it's a communication issue. Make it a game for just this one day, see how bad you can actually get! Like actually try to be bad. Then don't try. Compare the two. Count how many blonde people you see. write it down! You're not a cashier now, you're just playing around. After you're done, go to your boss and compliment him on something. Thank him for giving you a chance. Butter him up. Then tell him you feel like you'd be a better fit somewhere else, and you'd like a chance to prove that to him. Make sure you know what you're signing up for tho! You've got this
fiiola [info] I've been diagnosed with depression about 8 years ago, doctors didn't help and the only thing that gave me some will was a friend that was always there, for that I tried my best.Now I'm not one to run away from my problems or bad thoughts, actually that's kind of the issue my mind never really switches off, drugs never even once crossed my mind until this month where the mental break down was so severe, I swear to god I never experienced anything like that, the physical pain that came with it was unmatched I was physically ill, that was the first time ever I actually begged a friend to get me something, anything to just calm and sedate me. With the lockdown that was not possible and I just rely on sleep meds ( I couldn't sleep for a whole week) and NGL the fact that drugs seem appealing for me at this point makes me disgusted with myself, I am aware that I'll fall into a strong addiction, that will only make my problems worse.
suckmycolt [info] I was diagnosed with depression at like age 4.
ale6898 [info] I'm glad you're still here!! Thanks for sharing this. I was diagnosed with depression at age 10 so I kind of get how you feel, personally depression makes me feel trapped 24/7
veryconfusedpersonnn [info] I really took this to heart. I’m just so scared to tell someone. I am diagnosed with depression. And I’ve been in psychiatric care. But this is different. I’ve tried getting help before and each time has failed me. I’ve gotten the police involved but then my mom told them I’m delusional and they believed her. Then I got cps involved but they stopped looking into the situation and just dropped it. I went home after school and then got screamed at even more by my parents. They believe in the whole “what happens at home stays at home” order. I can’t live like this anymore. I’m just..out of words. So out of words idk what to type because I can drag on and on.
akaleelei [info] I got a dog after I was diagnosed with depression to be an emotional support animal. At first I got him to just have companionship and to force me to go on walks and just that definitely helped. Having him gave me a purpose in life. After I was diagnosed with anxiety too I started looking into psychological service dogs and tried training him to help with my social anxiety. In my research I learned that dogs can be trained to do a ton of helpful things for people with mental illness. Like helping to remind you to take your meds, getting help for you, disrupting panic attacks etc. I would like to get him professionally trained now to help me. But even without the training having a dog has been a great experience even though he's a lot of work. Do your research before you get a dog so you know what you're getting into and see if it's a good choice for your situation.
pinkishb [info] Yeah, I feel like I've observed my whole life and never really participated, but I've pretty much always been ok with it. I never thought it was a problem. I've always been ok with being the only person in my life. I love doing things alone. When I'm with others, especially groups, I very much struggle to find meaning in the interactions so I basically just observe, but not in a sad way, I just don't feel the need to participate unless I'm doing so in a way that is meaningful/helpful. I was diagnosed with depression a few years back and I've been "managing" it ever since. But the funny thing is, when I look back to when I was a child, I felt the same. And even looking into the future, if I end up with someone, or have kids or whatever, I feel like it won't change the core of my default mode. But like I said, I'm not unhappy with it. It just is what it is and I don't mind haha
ARC-6909 [info] Yeah but at least I didn't have to deal with "fake friends" at the school i graduated from...was sad I didn't graduate with my true friends. And the worst part is i felt like I had depression then my friend (one of the fakes) had the audacity to tell me "I'm choosing to be depressed. I need to snap out of it." Turns out I wasn't i had it since about 13 wasn't diagnosed till 18 or 17 so yeah wasn't fun and I never told my parents about how I felt because of her. But who in their right mind wants and chooses to be depressed. and how does one simply snap out of it because if you can snap out of it....it's not really depression. ((depression is literally have 2+ weeks of sadness and hopelessness etc) didn't help that I'm high functioning autistic ((found out the same time as I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety so that was fun going through that)) I've had many hard punches in life....still do but I still haven't bounced back yet someday I will...I hope so at least but hey my pain is my inspiration and outlet for my writing so I wouldn't trade it for anything ((many say my writings short story and poems are raw and really real....it's like NF 's raps weird how there is a rapper with those initials...he uses his initials actually because his name is so hard to say which I find creative and his raps I'll want are extremely raw like no sugar coating at all the best part is he's a clean rapper. He never says yes he uses hell but in the term of the underworld so he's a good one to listen to his music helps me in life)) mainly his songs from the search...especially time because my parents went through may rough patches!y last two years ((11-12) of high school and it was hard on me....my short story was the outcome of it. I seem so happy if you know me well that if you were given one of my darker writings you'd be surprised that I wrote it. But yeah dogs and males are the ones I trust most...females have to earn my trust...oddly enough i was bullied throughout elementary and middle school yet not in high school. But that was a very nice pace until the bitch came ((a very sucky teacher who didn't follow the instructions for my iep) biology was the worst class ever. But I'm actually going to get a job after the whole epidemic calms down at an anime story (hopefully because why not)) or at GameStop either one works for me. Sorry for the long rant. I just have a passion for some things...however the pain i go through is my inspiration for my writings i have...I never would have thought that writing is my passion if it weren't for the pain plus I'm a firm believer no matter how awful the situation you endure happens for some weird reason so that one day you may run into some who is going through that you have someone you can give advice to so they won't feel trapped or alone. An example of this would be the rapper NF many relate to different raps because of how raw it is ((no sugar coating)) I can relate to many of the ones about depression and mental health due to having mental health. so there's that but I feel for you about losing your pet ((which is what I'm trying to say in my weird language)
AMonsterMask [info] Yikes. My dad is the same way, surprisingly, the only differences being that he's the extrovert, and I'm the introvert. He always tries to relate his problems to mine, and even told me that I'm going through a "phase" when he found out that I was diagnosed with depression. Still, it doesn't seem like just a parent thing. I'm confident that there are others out there with decent, understanding parents that will just listen when you need an ear and hug you when you need a shoulder. I won't try to give you any advice, since I know that you didn't really ask, but I will say that I'm here if you ever need to vent or anything. If you're comfortable doing so, feel free to message me, friend.
korasi_khan [info] I was diagnosed with depression/social anxiety around your age. I'm 20 now, a junior in college, and to be honest... It really hasn't gotten better. No friends, no girlfriend, unable to talk to anyone, feel miserable, lonely and helpless all the time. (Mostly because I stopped treatment). I know you didn't need to hear that, but I have some advice for you.\- Therapy DOES work. You may have not have found the right therapist yet. Keep looking until you find one that clicks with you.\- Medication is worth giving a shot. It's not scary, it just rewires your brain a little bit. They had me on Zoloft, and it was somewhat effective. It works for some people.As for getting better.....For most, it never truly goes away. The symptoms might be minimized, but I feel like mental illness always lingers.It's good that you've stopped denying you have illness, that means you are already on the right track to recovery. You will feel better if you reach out for help. It may be a slow and gradual process, but you will feel better with the right treatment.I'm sorry if this answer didn't help. Let me know if I can answer any other questions.
exuberantfish [info] Not not clinically diagnosed but I am diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, ocd, and adhd. It doesn’t matter though because there’s really no treatment
buffalopantry [info] Okay first of all woah there. I was diagnosed with depression and had no interest in a noose or some shit. That's a big stretch.Second, and I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it is treated as a mental health issue and physically transitioning is considered the treatment for it. I really don't know too much about the process but I'm pretty sure trans people have to see a psychologist and also present as their preferred gender for quite a while before any docto will start with the physical parts.
jp_slim [info] > If you really think this video describes anything like severe depression, than I'd argue that you've never experienced it. [...] Obviously I could be wrong about you and perhaps you have been extremely depressed.Yeah, I've been diagnosed with depression and have had therapy which kinda worked, and taken anti-depressants which didn't work for me. What actually worked for me is to do exactly what this video talked about, without knowing that this book or video existed. I started doing most of this about six or so months ago and the symptoms are still hard to handle some days yet most days are manageable.> I could just imagine Mick Mulvaney quoting this video and telling mentally ill people to just "improve their ship" a concept so offensive it might as well be up there with bootstraps. I see where you went with this and I hadn't considered it. Thank you for sharing your thoughts!> Not to mention it's getting posted all over facebook by people who don't normally post this kind of stuff (a sure sign there is something wrong with it). I'd like to hear you elaborate on this point, because it makes little sense to me.
ajago12598 [info] It's certainly not the worst thing in this thread, so therapy hugs to all y'all, but it really sucked making my parents cry. I was diagnosed with depression within the past 5 years and my parents really didn't have a clue because I suppress the FUCK out of my emotions and self-soothe. They found out from my ex (boyfriend at the time) that I was suicidal and wanted to OD, and they were so, so upset. For context, my parents lost one kid in utero (I was supposed to be a triplet) and another was stillborn. My dad was talking to me about it, trying to understand what was going on and he starts sobbing. He's like a big dude, always has his shit together so it was so hard to see. We just sat on his bed crying on each other for a while. My mom tells me that she and my dad are always concerned when I'm away at school. She texts me and my siblings goodnight every night as a way of checking in on us, because as far as she knows, I could've killed myself. I'm getting treated now, and honestly it's not really effective, but I hope it's putting their worries at bay.
383CI [info] I was just diagnosed with depression two months ago. Trust me.....go and get help. You will be amazed how much better you will feel. It’s like a weight has been lifted off your chest. My depression came out as anger and confusion and not being able to comprehend anything when I was going through a phase. Everyone is different.
Technomancer_AO [info] This. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety really young but I think I started showing signs of something much more complex than just depression and anxiety (suicidal and self injurious behavior almost daily, psychotic episodes triggered by intense distress where I would be extremely paranoid and delusional and would occasionally hallucinate people and sounds and events and even things that couldn’t possibly be real like glowing lights and monsters, abysmal self esteem and the thought that I have nothing that defines me as an individual, a huge fear of being abandoned to the point where I would literally do anything to keep people in my life no matter how toxic they were or how much they didn’t want to stay, frequent feelings of intense euphoria, a constant feeling of emptiness, impulsive behavior, depressive spirals where I’d skip school and sleep constantly, eating disorder tendencies, relationships marred by tons of fighting usually started by me, obsessive thoughts, etc.) in middle school and my parents just told me it was part of growing up, just get over it, etc. and finally I had a psychotic episode in front of them and they took me to a psychiatrist who didn’t think to do a screening for mood disorders or personality disorders, and ended up putting me through tons of different types of antidepressants and antipsychotics, of which only two worked: Lithium and Quetiapine. I’ve now been on Quetiapine for five years and none of the dosages I’ve taken recently have truly been fully effective. I still have many of these symptoms as an adult, I never “grew out of it.” It got tons worse in high school and it got to a point where I couldn’t function at all and nearly failed a grade. I never got diagnosed with any personality disorder or mood disorder which I’m now thinking I should because I’m starting to feel like I show signs of either Bipolar Disorder or BPD or maybe even something else. Parents, please don’t ignore your kids. Don’t insist that their diagnosis (if they have one) is their diagnosis if they start showing signs of something else as they get older. If they feel like they need to get screened for something else, whether it be Bipolar Disorder, Anorexia, BPD, DID, anything they think or you think they might be struggling with, please get them screened. I attempted suicide 3 times by the time I was 16 and nearly died after overdosing on Tylenol because no one listened to me. Please please listen to your kids. And if you are an adult who is struggling, please don’t hesitate to get a proper diagnosis and get help. It’s not a bad thing. My therapist is like my best friend and she has helped me immensely and I’m hoping to bring up the idea to get screened for either Bipolar or BPD soon.
angers-a-liar [info] Ok I am a teenager so you might not even listen to me but that’s normal and I don’t find it childish. Sometimes when people are depressed they just wanna go home and and let everything out alone. I was diagnosed with depression and anyway sometimes when I’m at my friends and I feel depressed I just wanna go home. Sometimes I don’t even feel like they hate me I don’t even pay attention to them I’m just sad I feel so empty. I just wanna go home and lie down and cry alone. And I just don’t wanna be near them I mean I love my friends obviously they mean everything to me and I wouldn’t be here without them but I just idk don’t wanna be around them. I just wanna be home. So anyway I think it’s a normal feeling for people to feel when you’re that upset.
Iamahighlighter012 [info] I've been diagnosed with depression  a few days ago that's why I'm asking. I'm not trying to be rude. I just think sometimes environmental factors play a role and I'm just curious what others have to say. 
Princess-Nik [info] I know exactly what you mean! I was diagnosed with depression at 12 so it’s all I’ve known and thinking about living a life where you don’t wake up some days and just cry all day without reason.
Hey454 [info] Hello , i just wanted to ask a question. I have been in 100 mg of Zoloft 200 mg lamictal 150 luvox everyday and i didn't feel any better on them . I am diagnosed with depression ,anxiety and OCD what do u think the problem is?
isilnoir [info] There's always hope, seek help please. I was feeling the same way. I know it's hard to do, but even stepping to an counselor's office in your school is a step on recovering. I was feeling the same, and I decided to see the counselor in my uni and she advised me so well, I went to a psychiatrist and it all went well. I'm feeling better now. It feels like there is no hope but believe me, there is. There is really hope. If there are people (i mean your parents) who don't believe your struggle, then screw them, and find other people to talk about this to. I was in my very high point of my life when I felt like you do, I finally had the job that I wanted since I was a child, I was making money, I had friends, I had family, I was doing great. But I felt so utterly depressed and I wanted to kill myself so much I always thought about death. I didn't tell my parents. I realized that I'm in depression while I'm trying to explain my situation to the counselor in the uni. When I told my tutors (I'm a research assistant btw, and I was then as well) that I'm in depression, they were like "why would you be in depression your life is good it makes no sense". They acted like I'm in depression because I'm a brat, because they didn't understand how it can happen. I understand them, though. I was prescribed with prozac, and it made me feel so much better. While I was recovering, I talked with my professor and explained how I was when I was thinking about killing myself and how I was in depression, but now recovering. She looked at me with empty eyes, not understanding. People cannot understand how it feels unless they have been through depression. I didn't understand it before, as well. I couldn't comprehend how a person can be depressed so deeply that they want to kill themselves, not until I was diagnosed with depression. Then I understood. Don't be mad at your parents because they don't understand you, I didn't tell mine because I knew they were going to act the same way. They've never been through something like this. Just seek out help from another individual and don't lose hope. You can always DM me when you feel like you hit the bottom. I'm not a professional of course, but it's nice to have people to talk to sometimes. &#x200B;&#x200B;
petulafaerie [info] I had known there was something "wrong" with me for a long time before I received any official diagnosis, but had not given the "wrongness" a specific label before I was diagnosed with depression in my early teens.Around 10 years later I finally sought professional help of my own accord because I felt like I was getting worse (I didn't like the woman who diagnosed me for several reasons and had never had any therapy until this point in my life).  When I did I was diagnosed with depression, general anxiety and social anxiety.  I guess while I had never given myself a specific medical diagnosis, I had always known there was something about me that was different to "normal" "healthy" people.  So I think trust yourself, if you know something is wrong with you then there very well could be, but go and speak to a professional to understand what that wrongness is and let them diagnose you correctly.  
anrachna [info] Hi. I'm a 23/f and I often experience the same issues. I was diagnosed with depression & anxiety when I was 18. I can go weeks w/o showering or brushing my teeth sometimes (while still cleansing myself almost everyday for work) just because I often am too mentally drained to summon the energy I feel like I need to actually shower. It's honestly illogical and extremely hard to explain, but depression can really just prevent you from caring for yourself in any form. I've been at home for the last 2 months bc of our state lockdown and being furloughed from my job, so I've actually had to set myself reminders/rewards to shower, eat, brush my teeth etc. just so I don't let myself just sit here. its really hard so I feel for your sister and its actually comforting that I know someone else deals with things like this. I would say the only way she'll do anything for herself is if she wants to. so i wouldn't "force" her anymore. I understand it comes from love, but in the end she'll feel more judgement from you guys, her family, than love and might potentially push you away which will do even more harm. I would ask her personally if there is a way you can help, and if not ask her if shes comfortable talking to someone who can. I don't know your family dynamics, but I would want someone to talk to me directly about their worries for my health instead of just rushing to help. I COMPLETELY understand the  concern and frustration and you are a very caring bro it looks like, but she has to want to have the help first. I would say you can negotiate with her as well? maybe instead of a full shower, she does (what my fam calls) a "bird wash" literally from the sink. Idk, if she wants to talk to someone abt the lack of energy and stuff, you can have her talk to me? im no therapist of course but I know EXACTLY how she feels and that's more than what you guys have rn.
LilyofManyVallies [info] I was first depressed at 12. It started off with existential stuff- you know, kids finding out that life is hard and that- it ends and we dont understand the reason for anything. That everyone goes through life alone and scared. I couldnt stop THINKING. And eventually I became suicidal. I had a plan, but I kept it all togethet and eventually the episode passed.I didnt have another until I was 15. It wasnt as bad, but its also when the hallucinations started. They were really rare at first, once every 4-6 months or so. The first one was a cat. I was on vacation with my family, I had just taken some cold medication or something (I forget what) and I woke up to get some water and there was this black cat in the room with me. I spent like an hour searching the condo for the cat, and nothing. I figured it was the drugs and just went back to bed. I didnt have another for about the 4-6 months and because they were so rare I just tried to dismiss them. Its my usual response to life- denial until I cant any longer. I had the occasional episode of hypomania (I technically have schizoaffective disorder) which caused me problems when I was younger with impusivity. But also, I spent my senior year of high school on and off hypomanic and it was the only year I made straight As. The lowest grade I had was a 99.7% because it was the first time in a long time that I felt that I had consistent energy. I went to college the next year. My freahman year was stressful but I kept it together. My sophomore year was when things got really bad. I started getting really depressed again. It got to the point where I almost completely stopped going to classes. I basically stopped doing anything but laying in bed, in pain, wishing I were dead. It then got to the point where I realized that- there were only two options, either I kill myself or I get help. I decided to get help. I went to my schools counseling center and started seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with depression. They put me on antidepressants. I had hope for the antidepressants, I really did. I took them faithfully. I thought that I finally had something that would make me feel good about life again. But things just got worse.I started getting really paranoid. I thougjt people were planning on hurting me. I couldnt leave my dorm without having panic attacks, because I would see people laughing to each other and I thought they were laughing because they had finally figured out how to kill me. The hallucinations revved up. I stopped sleeping too because the hallucinations were worse at night and I felt that staying up was safer. I was hearing voices around me saying that I was evil and deserved to die. I started thinking that there was some evil inside me, and that I had to cut it out with knives. That if I could just bleed the rot out of me than anything would be fine. So I started self harming.Eventually I was put on a low dose antipsychotic which- immediatey started helping. I started leaving my dorm. The voices started going away and the paranoia decreased. The thought that people wanted to hurt me just stopped happening. I started going to class and I started doing well. My psychiatrist started completely phasing out my antidepressant with an increased dose of the antipsychotic and I eventually started feeling like I had my life back. My diagnosis was changed to bipolar NOS and it was assumed that the psychosis was from the antidepressant. Things were good for about a year and a half. I still had the very occasional hallucination and I had side effects from the medication- but for the most part, I got by. I was still having mood episodes, but they were much more manageable. I had help and it was great.But then a year and a half ago things started getting worse. I was having hallucinations more and more. Some nights I was having such intense ones that- I stopped sleeping again. Eventually I started hearing voices telling me that the meds were bad. God talked to me and told me to stop taking tjem, that I only needed to believe in him and that he would provide for me. I wanted to believe it so badly, I hated that I was still getting hallucinations AND had to take this medication that made me feel a little dull. I wanted to believe rhat nothing was wrong with me and that- all my issues from before were sort of- that the treatment that I already done had cured them.I started getting really sick really quickly after stopping my antipsychotic. As I said, I stopped sleeping mostly. I slept as little as possible. The hallucinations got so much worse. I stopped speaking too because whenever Id open my mouth my pitch would be off and I just- my words felt mixed up and I was afraid if I scared someone they would send me to a hospital. I wanted this all to work out and I knew it wouldnt if someone sent me away. I stopped going out again anf I started getting really paranoid. I stopped eating, bathing, and stopped doing homework. I almost completely cut myself off from people. I kept a journal back then (which I deleted a few months ago) and my words were... scary. They were a whole bunch of basically nonsense about jesus and demons and poison and WHY WAS EVERYONE OUT TO GET ME. And it was all jumbled and I kept saying how scared I was and why everything couldnt just leave me alone. Everything was disjointed and lots of it was hard to make sense of. But mostly it was a lot of fear and me asking why it wouldnt stop. I thought that god was talking to me in various forms of media and- it was all so confusing.I had an appointment where I aaw my therapist and she was super scared. She basically... she had no idea what to do. She kept asking if I wanted her to call someone. Begged me to go to the ER. And when I said I wouldnt she basically forced me to let her talk to my psychiatrist. She called my psychiatrist and I had an appointment with her a few days later.I went there and she basically said I was in HORRIBLE shape and that she really didnt want me to have to go to the hospital because- somehow I was still passing my classes and I had made it- well. I hadnt told her that I was a danger to myseld (I dont think- I think I tried to make aure I didnt, because I just was really scared about being hospitalized- but I dont remember for sure because its all a little blurry). She gave me a choice of going to the hospital or making several close appointments in a row with both her and my therapist and restarting my medication.I did the second thing. I restarted it. It was really really hard for me to do but I didnt want to go to the hospital and I knew that- if I didnt start it again there was a high likelihood Id be involuntarily committed... because that had been floated. She had said she didnt want to do that if she didnt 100% have to because of my situation and because its also trauamatic. So, after spending a couple of days freaking out every time I HAD to take it, and spending a couple of days throwing it up because I thought it was poison and I was just sooo confused- well. Eventually I started it again. My symtoms started calming down again. I started seeing a new therapist because mt other therapist said that she felt I needed more care than she could provide, and things were ok for a while.I was diagnosed with schizoaffectice bipolar type at this pointBut I dont like taking it. I didnt like taking it. I didnt like feeling trapped in sickness. I wanted to prove to myself that I was ok.So a few months ago I stopped it again. Things were fine for a while. I was watched closely by my psychologist and while- she HATED that I was doing this AGAIN... she said shed be there with me during it.Until things got bad again. I started thinking that people were trying to hurt me again. I thought that my body was rotten and that the demon was marking me to make me some sort of conduit between the spiritual world and the real world. I thought I had a special mission and that no one could understand and that the world was against me.So. I let a little of this slip. And though I was trying to keep it secret because I didnt think anyone would understand... she got it out of me. And she called mt psychitrist again.Rinse and repeat of the time before, though this time I wasnt as far gone. I was warnes that I needed to STOP doing this- because I was harming my brain... and so... yeah.I stayed on those meds for like, 3 months? Until I had to move home. I moved home at the start of this semester and they keep wanting to cut all my meds down. Its been super frustrating and I am scared of what will happen. But I told my last psychiatrist when I left that I would try to listen to my psychiatrists in the future and NOT mess with my medication on my own. So I am trying to lisren because that psychologisr I was seeing was REALLY GOOD and I felt like she really did want to help me. But its been hard because I dont feel like they really... know me or my situation. I feel like they are experimenting on me. Im on 1/4 of the medication I was on a few months ago and its been progressively harder to function consistently. I see a new psychiatrist in december that I saw over the summer a few years ago. I trust her more than I do the people I just saw. So I just have to make it until the middle of next month and then maybe, maybe things can be okSorry this is so long. Just thought Id get my story out there because thats probably the most comprehensive way to answer all those questionsOh and about your other questions- I have only started being more open about my diagnosis- but I still only tell it on a I feel- would be good for this person to know basis. I have a hard time accepting my diagnosis and the need for treatment. It definitely sometimes gets in the way of school- but I try not to let it. And most of all, I am scared but still hopeful
pychiticatitsfinest [info] Dang, this is exactly how I feel. I was diagnosed with depression and have some family issues and I don't wanna live but at the same time, I don't wanna do it at my own hands.It seems like you have had a rough time for quite a while, but I must ask, is mental illness a taboo because of where you live or something more specific in your life?
jaanegreeen [info] Ask the doctor that suggested it.He should be able to give you a number or website to go to.I was diagnosed with depression from a giant test my psychiatrist gave me before our first appointment like 7+ years ago.
iamunrelenting [info] I've been in therapy for over a year and I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and Bipolar disorder
illuminatorparadox [info] I got you fam no worriesYou are not aloneI am diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder and feel like i am never going to heal again and that the people around me dont unterstand me...But there are people who feel the same as me and that is fucked up but you also dont feel so lonely anymore
HarlsnMrJforever [info] I'm 35f and feel like there's still something as Asperger's or ADD or something like that I'm undiagnosed with.   I have been diagnosed with depression and GAD (general anxiety disorder). I just don't feel like that covers everything.
sunshine682 [info] Yup I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety until the age of 29 when I was diagnosed with bipolar and BPD. The symptoms of bipolar and BPD got increasingly worse until I could no longer hide them.
ioMoon78 [info] I'm sorry that you are going through this.  You will get through this....it will take time and effort on your part,, but you will survive and it will get better. I have been in your shoes....feeling stuck and lost, feeling like I'm way behind everyone my age, feeling alone and misunderstood.  It is great that you have your bf, who understands you, cares for you, and is a shoulder to cry on. When I was going through it, I had no family, friends, or a partner to be there for me in the ways that only a partner can---intimacy.  I'm not talking about sexual intimacy, but emotional intimacy, which is important always, but especially at a time like this. It's okay to feel how you're feeling. There is a reason for it. What has helped me immensely is to "be" with my feelings. Recognize them. Acknowledge them.  Work through them----otherwise they only get bigger and more destructive.  My journey has been ten years, from the time I was diagnosed with depression, to now, but all that led up to it before I got depression is what started to lay the foundation for my depression.  So my advice to you is to face your feelings.  Finding a good therapist is key.  I saw several therapists until I found the right one. I've been seeing her for almost 3 years now, and she has helped me to get through my debilitating emotions.  Now I understand my emotions and why I feel the way I do, and this has helped me to manage depressive episodes much better.  I also am on medication, and I have been since the beginning. I have a stable regimen, and it works for me.  Together with therapy, I have improved so much.  Not everyone likes taking medications, but sometimes you need it to balance the chemicals in your brain that affect mood.  But whether you take medicine or not, therapy is key....a good therapist to help you in the ways that YOU need.  What I needed from my therapist is to help me to understand my emotions and where they were coming from. She also allowed me to release my thoughts and feelings in a safe place where I didn't feel judged and received affirmation or correction of my feelings. It sounds like you had a terrible experience because the therapist you went to was the wrong one for you. I encourage you to keep looking for one that is able to help with your needs. Not all therapists are created equal. They have different approaches, techniques, and views on mental health, and that impacts the kind of treatment that you will receive. Keep being strong and pushing forward. You will get through this.
Necroncryptek10341 [info] I was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago. Got on antidepressants, and have been barely managing it. I wanted to talk about this, but I don't really have friends to talk about it with. Frankly I understand your confusion, and am sorry for that. But don't assume you know me.
unsungzero1027 [info] I just want to say, your dad is amazing for what he did. Bringing you the articles to help you see if wasn't just you he was at least actively making an attempt to help you. For a lot of us we didn't have that. I told my dad I was diagnosed with depression and GAD and he basically told me what do you have to be depressed about? Granted, he wasn't wrong... Nothing was horribly wrong with my life so from an outside view it wouldn't make sense that I was depressed. I just chalk it up to him growing up in a different time and having a much different upbringing (his dad was a very bad alcoholic. He never beat the children or my grandmother thankfully) and grew up working class poor where as I was a middle class white kid growing up in the suburbs. Anyway, sorry got the random venting. Music is very tied to emotions and depending on what memories it brings up (in this case, his suicide) it will reflect in how you feel listening to the song. I don't really listen to much Linkin Park anymore, but other bands music I listened to when I was going through depression, or that talk about depression, cause me to feel very anxious so I completely get what you're talking about.
crowned_freak [info] Sometimes when someone is depressed or suicidal, they don't necessarily want to be helped. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety last year and for me, its the very little things that matter. I have a sister who is worried about me just like you are. Families are like that. And its natural for you to be worried and pressured into helping her. And for me I really don't want a shoulder to cry on. I don't want to share my problems. But its feels really great that my sister still gives me my space. All I wanna hear is, "It's okay to feel that way and it is completely normal. And whenever you need us, we're here." And just this assurance helps me to cope with my depression. Its not always the big things. Just assure her that you will be there for her always.
Alonuget [info] I also self harmed around that age and felt I was not getting the support, attention, and love that I needed. At the time they diagnosed me with Oppositional Defiance Disorder and the therapist basically taught me how to internalize those feelings I think (I cannot remember the process). I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for the past 10 months. The last 6 weeks my relationship has been in question and it is killing me. I've experienced a lot of time for reflection and I think I'm going through more than anxiety and depression. I think maybe OCD/ROCD, and maybe BPD. But the potential to go in and talk to someone about all the crap I go through, all the horrible thoughts (intrusive thoughts), worrying about my relationship, feeling a need and lack of control, questioning myself and my feelings, being terrified of my bf meeting someone better, and constantly from the beginning feeling I didn't deserve to be with him, etc. will be greeted with "Oh, no, you're just a terrible person who wants to think about awful things and who is emotionally abusive and controlling".Almost 10 months ago the intrusive thoughts and constant worry about the relationship really kicked in and tortured me when I had a health scare. I was considering suicide because I felt I wasn't worthy to be with my bf (in large part due to the intrusive thoughts and anxiety that plagued me). Those unwanted thoughts led me to believe I was a terrible person that shouldn't exist and that I definitely didn't deserve to be with my bf. I considered breaking up because I couldn't handle the guilt or suicide because I was so awful. At the same time I didn't feel he was being as emotionally supportive as I needed him to be, which was very distressing. When I started treating the depression a lot of the intrusive  thoughts got better, or easier to ignore I guess. However the thoughts and worries concerning my relationship persist and really break me down.Part of the reason that I am considering therapy now is that my current relationship is barely even existing and I'm losing hope of it working out. If I can get a diagnosis and then manage the turmoil inside of myself then I have this feeling that maybe he will accept me. Maybe he will give me forgiveness and understanding. Maybe he will accept me and give me love in spite of it. I'm terrified because without any diagnosis of something that would cause intrusive thoughts or the intolerable anxiety and jealously I feel he will just pass me off as a crazy ex and realize he deserves someone so much better. We've been together almost two and a half years at this point. It's been hard sometimes but I don't want it to end, he's been the best to me out of any of my boyfriends and he means a lot to me. So the lack of a diagnosis is terrifying, and getting a diagnosis sounds terrifying. I search and search for therapists and can't decide who looks like the best, and I'm so scared to schedule something and be judged. I used to rely on my bf for emotional support and encouragement and now I'm struggling to do anything that is anxiety inducing. I want to know how to better deal with all this chaos, but it's terrifying.
spookysadghoul [info] Family had a history of depression and anxiety. My parents would never admit to any mental health issues they had.I was always mocked especially by my parents that I was the "sad" or "fragile" child.I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 21 (2013) after a family assault, job loss, general feeling of worthlessness (no uni, no licence, no job). I have been on and off medication since then. More recently I have been told by a psychologist that I have OCD tendencies.My current job (although I am grateful I have one in the job market) can be very detrimental to my mental health. I was planning to see a psychologist this year, but COVID-19 has made that idea go out the window.
waterforbreakfast [info] I’ve tried out a couple subjects such as novels, newspapers, magazines, children’s books, but none of those really speak to me. I always feel weird when reading How To’s or self help books. These types of books want to show me how to get better at something, and I feel it’s not a bad thing to be better at something, yet I lose interest in reading these things as well! It might take a little extra for me to find something worth reading as I have been diagnosed with depression, but that’s exactly why I want to find something to read, so that I can pass the time.Long time ago I also thought that history novels might be the way to go, struck me quickly as boring however. Nice that you’ve found something more your taste!
smilleeymilleey1 [info] Disclaimer: This is my personal experience, and its hard to place my depression on a spectrum since everyone experiences things differently. I did have thoughts of suicide. Sometimes I still do. I think that the biggest part of dealing with depression is \*accepting\* it. Now, I don't mean to accept it in such a way that it has power over  like: "I was diagnosed with depression, and its a disorder that not even professionals can effectively treat" but with a different set of eyes. Accept it by saying, "yes this is something that I am DEALING with." If you can tell yourself every day that you are getting through it, dealing with it, and handling/becoming accountable of your depressive state then you eventually become aware of \*how\* you are dealing with it.. Once your conscious self is exposed to how your dealing with it, youll be able to accurately identify your coping mechanisms. Those mechanisms are likely un-healthy and therefore enabling those depressive habits. Its a journey for sure, but by becoming mindful of your feelings and how you handling those feelings can lead to a beautiful awakening. Again, this is my personal experience and it is what worked for me.. Depression is on a spectrum and while medications did not work for me, it might be true that for someone else, its what they needed.
golden_boy [info] Learning how to think differently is the entire point of treatment. I've been diagnosed with depression, bipolar, anxiety, and a couple other things in my life, and actively working on coping skills, deprogramming destructive habits of thought, and seeking professional help are the reasons I'm functional. You can't "just" change with a snap of your fingers, but most of the line items you mentioned are precisely the things that need to be worked on over time. Treating these things as fixed and unchangeable is factually incorrect and deeply harmful to long term progress.
Anon10062019 [info] Caller 2, I am diagnosed with depression too and my psychiatrist told me to stop with the alcohol. I was pretty dependent on it before and when I was able to stop I felt my overall mental state improve. Quality of sleep improved as well.
makeeh [info] I'm also 19, i also played video games for most of my life, around 2018 i realized that i didn't like playing video games anymore, i have no friends, no life. I do have a job and an income, but they bring me no joy. I was heavily bullied and ridiculed at school. I was diagnosed with depression when i was 12 or 13 if i remember correctly. I too have a lot of moments when i really realize that everything i didn't want to be, i've become. Just know that you are not alone in this situation. My biggest fear is that i will be forever alone, and die alone, but that also seems like the most likely case when i look at my situation and that always makes me die inside a little bit more.
mya-is-confused [info] Well, the quizzes were what I turned to at first too. They are based off of symptoms of depression, so if you answered the questions thoroughly and honestly they may be a good indication. However, they dont take place of a diagnosis.I went to the hospital to see a psychiatrist 8 months ago (seems extremely but i was desperate) and got recommended to see a counselo I was diagnosed with depression and worked with that therapist for 7 months before she got a new job.
meowdrian [info] I have been diagnosed with depression, but I’ve never heard of this being a sign or symptom.
Will_Trent [info] No longer trying to get out of the spiral. Just staying semi-manageable. I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 16, but it began when I was in fourth grade. I'm 50 years old now.
braidedblasphemy [info] I have been diagnosed with depression and I’m currently on medication for it. I can confirm this is exactly how my life goes. I’ll have a couple of good, inspired days, then a few bad days where I constantly fantasize my death. I’m just waiting for the ratio to tilt in my favor. I’m beyond ready to get back to my life.
SLYTHERINQUEEN666 [info] I'm diagnosed with depression, but I'm taking care of it. It's impossible to tell you how better I am now compared to when I discovered that I have depression.😁
Batstronaut [info] I've been doing what I can to get more experience with various hobbies. I've been cycling. A lot. 36 miles is a quick run and 75 miles is a fun outing. I've been learning guitar for the past two years, self-taught. I learned how to build a computer and play video games every now and then. I've finished High School with my diploma but I still feel this way a lot. I was diagnosed with depression at 16, and have been in and out of an existential crisis that's too hard to explain through writing since 8th grade.
yeeyeesuckmypeepee [info] my work ethic is terrible and always has been. I'm not really a good student but that wasn't a problem for me until this year because usually I didn't need to study. Now my parents are afraid I'm going to fail out of freshman year :). I don't think this is entirely an IQ thing though, because I was diagnosed with depression a few months ago and I have tons of smart friends who are really good at school.
MelodyTheScreecher [info] I'm diagnosed with depression and everytime I find someone like that I wanna kill them because its not cool to fake it
cynthiabrooke25 [info] I scared a lot of people away because of my mental health. I have had severe anxiety for as long as I remember. I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety when I was 22. I am 23 and getting help has changed my life. I recently feel freed because I no longer have friends I have to keep up with. I have my very few and they are there when I need them and vice versa. Life can be amazing with or without others, the amount won’t matter in the end, just the quality. You WILL find someone who understands you enough to want to help you and listen and be there. I found mine and I have put him through the ringer because of my mental health. For SOME REASON he is still here and I thank him everyday for that. You will find someone, friend or romantically who will make nobody else matter bc they’re your person. Give it time and in the meantime work on loving yourself and finding who you are and finding things that work for your mental health. I chose meds after a several years long fight against them. My whole life has changed and I can’t imagine it another way
alessia___000 [info] Basically I had very very bad anxiety and one day I got a reeeally bad panic attack and had to leave early, after that I started having as much as 5 anxiety attacks per hour wich was pretty bad. Since I had so many anxiety and panick attacks I had to constantly interrupt lesson to ask to go to the bathroom to lock myself in a stall and calm myself. The bathrooms in my school have windows so I used to open them cause that makes me feel like I can breathe better when I'm having an attack. After about one or two weeks the teachers started making jokes about me "constantly going to the bathroom", calling me names, making me stand up in front of the class while having a meltdown and not sending me to the bathroom, humiliated me in front of the class, just made me feel really bad because I had this condition. I tried several time to explain it wasn't a physiological thing but it was anxiety but they wouldn't listen. After a while I was diagnosed with depression too but they didn't seem to care, plus they complained about it to my parents too so they started making me feel bad about going to the therapist and stuff and it got worse. It's a little bit more complicated than this but long story short they just kept telling me it was all in my head and that I was a nuisance to everybody in class and in my family
asiandepressoo [info] sorry about this, but I'm just a bit sad because my parents don't take my mental health seriously. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have been given medicine by the GP, but since that's happened they think that after taking it for a few months, I will be cured, and the don't understand that it doesn't work like that. I am always told to pray whenever I feel upset and whenever I try to open up to them about my mental health deteriorating, they just try to change the subject or they ask me "What do you have to be sad about?" and it's just upsetting. Not to mention, I feel like such a disappointment for dropping out of university due to my mental health. I can feel that they're disappointed in me, it just sucks because I tried my best but they think I could have tried harder and stayed, even though I have told them that I was so close to taking my own life. I am doing better now.Stay safe everyone.
awkwardregular10 [info] Hey, my parents dont believe in mental health either. I was diagnosed with depression roughly 3 years ago and I have been on meds since. I have also been seeing a therapist.Everyone responds to zoloft differently It works really really well for me. I wish I had started earlier. I havent seen any side effects. However, zoloft alone is not enough. Therapy or self help workbooks, adopting good habits is also very important. Working on your habits and thoughts is crucial. But till you get to therapy  zoloft might be a good starting point.
RepaidPancakes [info] I have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety and OCD.I feel like they can be quite contradicting, where I'm anxious because I need to do a ritual, but I'm also anxious if people are around because of fear of being judged.I can never win.
inthefamilyofthings [info] I'm sending love, hugs, and calming thoughts. I think its wonderful that you have such supportive family.  Try to let go of the shame if you can.  You seem to be feeling guilt that this is happening to them, but that guilt is a weight you don't need.  This is happening to you right now.  If someone had been hit by a car, they would need to spend their energy healing, not feeling guilty that the car hit them.  You've been hit by a metaphorical car. You seem like you have it together, but you didn't mention seeking a medical opinion, and I would.  I thought my depression had reached epic proportions a few years ago.  It was hard to breathe and I was exhausted that I feel asleep at my desk.  I was severely iron deficient.  Severely.  I had to have an IV.  Thyroid, pre-diabetes, iron deficiencies can all mask as depression.I'm reading this and it sounds so familiar.  Is it possible that it's not just depression, but rather burn out?  I have been diagnosed with depression, but part of the clinical cause is burn out.  So, part of the problem here is the solution is not necessarily the same for both, and taking some time off work is not enough. Often, those of us who are prone to burnout seem to take treating depression as a challenge.  It becomes another job, another stressor, another set of worries.  This is a huge problem because it is the stress and the pile of work that has put us in a constant state of high alert which led to depression in the first place.I'm sorry I have nothing better because I'm just starting to work through this myself.  So instead of doing all the things, I'm picking one thing a day and I'm going to do it because it's good for me.  Not because I should, or because I'll enjoy it, or because it's a job.  I can usually do one thing.I apologize if I've read to much into what you've said.  Sending love all around.
HerDiamonds3 [info] Im so sorry you are going through this. I was 13 when I was diagnosed with depression. You described some of the feelings I would have. You’re a child, of course you want attention and to feel loved, I need that as an adult. It isn’t for attention, you just want someone to take the pain away and make you feel like you again. Keep trying with therapy, get a different therapist if needed. You are so worth the time and effort
Stress-Levels [info] I've been diagnosed with depression for just over two years, after two suicide attempts, dropping out of university and just working full time I feel better. I remember a nurse said to me "You're always gonna have depression but you're not always gonna be depressed" and even though that sounds kinda politically incorrect and a bit messed up it's something that has stuck with me.
Sunshinegal72 [info] I was 16.  I told my mom that I didn't feel like being alive anymore because of the things happening in my head.  She made me a doctor's appointment the next day where I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and prescribed my first SSRI.  She then got me into a therapist.   That was 13 years ago.
184Wicked [info] It doesn't have to be. If you're NEET but you still maintain your health by excising, eating well or spending time getting better at your hobbies etc then it's not necessary a bad thing. But stereo-typically speaking, depression or anxiety gets in the way. I'm diagnosed with depression but I don't feel that bad about being NEET. Because I'm using all this free time to try and better myself, I exercise pretty much everyday (Hiking/cycling). I enjoy the outdoors and leave the house quite often so I'm not really a shut-in NEET. Of course it would just be great if I could maintain a job, I just keep quitting. I've been NEET on and off over the years. Being NEET and living at home has it perks, but it would also be nice to be independent. I'm lucky I have a somewhat wealthy family as well.
fiftylevenpatients [info] I definitely have intrusive thoughts.  I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, though anxiety is usually a minor player, decades before ADHD so I have always related them to this. Almost all of my thoughts are along the lines of self deprecation so I immediately thought depression, despite therapy and antidepressants I have not been able to get a hold of them. This is interesting.
MagicCandy [info] One of the worst things about ADHD is a lot of people still don't believe it is "real" and a legitimate disorder, one that is quite debilitating in so many aspects of life.... And also the stigma of it only affecting boys or children. =/ Hell, even I sometimes second guess myself or have self doubts.. I was diagnosed with depression too and that was when I was 17 years old and I'm 30 now and only got diagnosed with ADHD last year... and then anxiety was added a few months later... even though I've had that all throughout my childhood into my teenage years and adulthood. It makes me feel really flawed as a person too because I'm the youngest and my two older sisters seemed to turn out fine and got successful careers, got married and moved out... while I'm still suffering and living with my mom. It's not that I don't want to live with my mom because I like living with her and my dog at home but it's the GUILT that I feel that constantly bothers me. She keeps questioning when I'll find someone and get married. It's also not seeing any meaning to living and not wanting to get married.. and the cost of living as a single person would end up as a trigger, just making me more likely to drive myself to suicide. I already feel alone as it is, alone in a crowd, alone no matter what. My childhood wasn't exactly great either when it comes to my parents' toxic relationship and all the emotional abuse and neglect.. so yeah.. Isn't it crazy coincidental too how I ended up in a relationship years ago that lasted for 6 years with someone really emotionally abusive, neglectful and toxic?.. I have been single for 4 years now and would rather keep it that way. I also find it interesting how I never entertained the idea of getting married.. when I was much younger.. and thought life seemed pointless because everyone just goes to school, gets a job, works until retirement and then dies. But maybe that was always just my depression talking... If I ever find little moments of joy then I don't even feel like I "deserve" it because I have become so used to this depressive state... It really sucks struggling to just do basic tasks like waking up, getting out of bed, brushing your teeth, keeping a routine, eating food.. let alone memorizing useless information in school and having to socially interact with people with a smile on your face just so you get money to live.. especially when it's an invisible disability. I was able to do that stuff with a "structure" that was enforced upon me but I never realized all these years just how much extra effort I had to put into doing things than the average neurotypical person... just to achieve mediocre results.
Manda_Meme [info] Since I was diagnosed with depression, my spelling schedule is fucked up, I sleep too much and without a  regular clock. Sometimes i sleep 2 Hours in the evening and go to bed aftwr 2 Am.
Lucian7x [info] I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 4, so I'm pretty fucked up. I have no idea what is it like to NOT have depression. That, and I'm going through bad times right now - I crown 2019 the worst year of my life so far, and we're not even through q3 yet.But still, I hope someday I'll get better. See what's it like not to be one of the accursed.
rosamor86 [info] I started using marijuana after I was diagnosed with depression and bipolar type 2. I don't have access to the strains I want. I pretty much get what I get. But I've noticed that some types are better for me than others. Weed has made my unbearable days bearable and for that I'm thankful. 
regrettablyalive [info] I have been diagnosed with depression and everyday I feel like shit and just taking some drugs and drinking some alcohol, I have been feeling this way since I was like 5 or something. But you don't know what they mean, it could be in the sense I described it or I could be totally fuckin wrong and they might as well be a pyschopath I'm not saying theyre right by being completely happy by tests saying they have depression, I'm giving suggestions to why someone might feel this way. And I know they arent made to diagnose you I never self diagnosed before just suggested that I *might* have it
limbojade [info] My heart has been broken so many times, I’ve just left the pieces where they are and learned to live with it that way. I was diagnosed with depression a couple of months ago, and it’s been so hard. I told my parents I felt that whenever I am saddened, start to cry, etc, I’m a pain to them and it’s just like “oh, here we go again.” They agreed. Sometimes, I just feel like they would be so much better off without me. I feel like a walking inconvenience. I’m not surprised at them agreeing, because I’ve been telling myself that’s what I am to them for years. The only difference is now I have validation.
BetterRemember [info] I begged to see a nose specialist for years from the ages of 13-24, nobody referred me even when I broke down sobbing and then had an asthma attack in front of the doctor because my nose immediately stopped working from the tears.I finally demanded a female doctor at my university clinic and left with a specialist appointment that day. I have severe asthma and all of my previous doctors knew this so not being able to breathe through my nose most of the time was a huge quality of life issue for me, especially since I need to be active to keep my depression under control.I've been diagnosed with depression since 19 and all my previous doctors know that. I told them I wanted to be a proactive patient and stay active to combat my depression and that my nose hindered me every day and I feared sleep.I got to the specialist and he was outraged that things had been allowed to progress so much. I have huge nasal polyps that regularly completely block my nasal passages. Plus the internal structure of my nose is all fucked up to the point where I need not just a polypectomy but a complete nose job.My specialist made a point to ask me if my previous general practitioners had all been men, he told me that his female patients, especially the younger ones, tend to come to him with more advanced issues because they are brushed off for years upon years. I am NEVER seeing a male GP for an ongoing issue again. My specialist said I could have easily had a huge asthma attack and died because of my nose
WatIsThis52 [info] I could have written this post when I was about your age -- or now, for that matter. Usually I don't have much advice for others but I have direct experience with this.This feeling hit me hard when I was 23-24. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 18, but have dealt with it for as long as I can remember. At a certain moment when I turned 23, I left a toxic relationship and then made a lot of realizations about my college years ... I started comparing my college experience to those of others, and feeling like I had "wasted" mine.From 18-22 I was severely depressed and anxious. I didn't get out much. I didn't have many friends. I clung to a couple boyfriends as a source of validation. I was constantly tired and spent a lot of my time sleeping, accidentally sleeping through commitments I had made, and spending many waking hours feeling like I'd kill for a nap.I could go on, but the point is that these years that I felt many people usually have the time of their lives were painful, difficult and confusing to me. I felt like this was a reflection on me -- A "wasted" college experience was more proof that I was an idiot.I spent time feeling sad and fighting feelings of shame. However, something I'm so glad I did was that *I started doing things I wanted to do*.It was really as simple as that. A big part of this was just gaining independence as I got older and stopped relying on other peoples' rules for what my life was supposed to be like. For example ... I loved going to concerts and events, but my ex-boyfriend didn't want me to go to any kind of event if he wasn't with me, AND he was very picky about events we went to.As soon as he and I broke up, I went to every damn concert, event, festival, party, farmer's market, WHATEVER that I wanted to. I'm so glad I did.Honestly, feelings of fearing that I've wasted time still bother me. I'm 28, almost 29 and sometimes I worry I've "wasted my 20s" chasing love. I just went through another breakup a couple days ago, actually, so the feelings have been especially intense as of late. Also-- I've had trouble getting through movies and podcast episodes, too, so don't feel bad about that!I'm glad you posted so that I could have the opportunity to not only give you advice, but to reflect on my own tendencies as well.I look back at my 23-year-old self being so sad that she had "wasted her college years." I would tell her that I hadn't wasted any time, and that getting out and living the life I want to, starting ASAP, is what would end up helping more than anything.You're not too old. It's not too late. You can believe me because I've been in almost your exact shoes!I hope that helped even a little. Feel free to DM me any time ❤️
BananaboiBAMF [info] I have been diagnosed with depression and general anxiety disorder,  I can tell you that watching YouTube and talking to my friends are the only way I’ve stayed sane. If I didn’t have that, and was forced to focus purely on schoolwork and my abusive parents bullshit, I would actually kill myself ngl
justignoreme003 [info] I feel very similar to you and I have been diagnosed with depression. Always a safe bet though to see a doctor.
llx5771 [info] The first time I was diagnosed with depression I was pretty young. But what I can remember is that I managed to find a therapist who understood what I was going through. He managed to convince my so called parents that they should let me try out martial arts, since I had anger management issues as a child. I absolutely loved training and the discipline that came with it. In addition to that I made a lot of new friends and gained a lot of confidence.
LukeGreywolf [info] 25M this actually sounds pretty similar to me, I was diagnosed with depression as a kid. Except I just sorta grew realizing most of the people around me were shit, so I told myself as a kid that I was going to strive for perfection because anything less was settling for mediocrity/failure.In middle and high school I used to self harm, I never cut because that would leave obvious marks, I'd beat myself relentlessly, usually in the head because I was depressed and angry at my own brain for making me depressed. During all of this I was on SSRI antidepressants that just seemed to make everything worse. Every day I berated myself for being a "stupid worthless piece of shit" for whatever slight mistake I made that day. after a close brush with suicide I stopped taking my meds in secret and finally started to improve. After a few months and my improvements being significant enough for my teachers and mom to notice I told my mom and my psychiatrist that I had stopped and that I never wanted to take meds again. That was 10 years ago, I still struggle with hating myself and still have a tendency to go off on myself for the slightest mistakes, but I haven't (with 1 or 2 exceptions when things were really bad) beat myself in 10 years and the nagging voice telling me I'm a piece of shit isn't as loud as it used to be.Honestly one of the things that helped me most just as a person was forcing myself into uncomfortable situations where I had to interact with people, starting with just talking to people at school that also seemed like they were struggling, that led to friends that I could talk to and develop social skills, and eventually worked my way up to forcing myself to go to a few parties to keep pushing myself. (Fun fact, first party I ever went to I was still completely uncomfortable with drinking, but I knew I had to blend in if I wanted to be social, so I picked up an empty beer an and carried it with me most of the night so I wouldn't look like prude) the more interactions you have the easier they get, I'm by no means a social butterfly but now I can navigate most social interactions just fine.I wish I had an answer for you as to why, what I can tell you it does get better.
emmashawn [info] When I was 14 I was diagnosed with depression. My grades were bad and I didn’t pass my year. I was devastated. My state of mind switched and I decided to not care anymore. I skipped classes, made graffitis in the bathroom stalls, did not do assignments. All of those behaviours are very unlike me. The school system failed to support me with my illness, so I refused to cooperate with them.
Torimax3 [info] I've been diagnosed with depression 7 years ago and I can count the times I have cried just because of me and the way I live and feel. I was just never able to cry for myself. When I tried to cry I always had to yawn which Made me feel like a fool and I got embarassed. The first time I really did cry just because of me was when I survived my suicide attempt because I was mentally and physically more drained than ever and I don't know how long I would've kept crying if my brother did not suddenly came to my Apartment and I didn't wanted to cry in front of him, so I calmed myself down. From a young age on I got scolded and told to stop crying. Maybe that's why I can't cry that easily when its about myself. I  don't know.
___THE_guy___ [info] Mental health/illness destigmatization. I'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. The way mental health is treated now is really shitty.
sugarkitten_ [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 12. In fact, in some ways I felt worse than I do now. However it *is* totally possible that he’s just wearing it as a tag. Still, I agree, you should speak to him and let him talk to you about it. Keep a listening ear because if he really is going through something, you may feel very guilty later for not being there for him.
drawstringsweatpants [info] It sounds like you’re having an existential crisis lol. And I am VERY familiar with everything you’re feeling. You’re not alone. I am 27 years old, and haven’t done shit with my life because I’m too afraid to take the steps to make my life better, for fear of failure. It’s like I can’t even do the simplest things or take the smallest steps because I’m just paralyzed. I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety (I think that’s what they call it) at 17 after 2 of my best friends that I had from the age of 13 died from freak accidents. It crippled me. I went into the whole “existential does anything matter, why them? Why not me? Why should I bother” mode for the better part of my early adult life. Let me tell you though. One of the BEST moves I forced myself to make recently (very recently) was to find a therapist. Having someone else to hold you accountable for things helps so much. Someone not a part of your family, or a friend, but a stranger. I’m sure our situations are not exactly the same but maybe it’ll help to hear it from me, a stranger, that it’s really worth it to take the time to talk to a GP and explore medication options. I don’t know how old you are or if I missed that, but I’m pretty sure at 16 you can go see someone on your own accord. Even if your family asks questions, you don’t have to tell them the truth. You can just tell them you’re going for a physical. For the “are you depressed” question. I’m not a doctor (lol obviously) but my guess would be yes.My “depression” looks like this: I am not “sad” and I don’t want to die. I don’t want to do anything, I don’t see the point. I have no motivation to do anything, and at times I feel totally incapable of feeling emotion. I can feel emotion for others but not towards myself if that makes sense. If I do feel emotion it’s anxiety, I have (had, working on finding a medication that helps) constant panic attacks that center around “why am I here, what am I doing, why was I born the person I am”. But I am not sad. I am just “meh” towards everything. I don’t know, I hope this helps you somehow, it helps me to type out how I feel, so thanks for this opportunity to share. You can message me if you want.Edit: I DO want to be a better person and live a better life and make changes. I just don’t have the motivation and quite honestly, I don’t care. If that makes sense. Okay bye
TheWildBlair [info] The reason I noticed something was wrong was because a year ago or so I really got into psychology and honestly for awhile thought I had antisocial personality disorder but realized that luckily I was just not allowing myself to feel bad for people now that I’ve stopped that I can see I obviously don’t have. The way I am doesn’t bother me to be honest I do want to see someone for a diagnosis but don’t really care about therapy although my family seems bothered by my need to be alone and how distant I become. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety awhile back but I’m not sure if I fully agree with it.And I’m sorry that you went through emotional neglect I’m sure you deserve much better then that. (Sorry if that wasn’t good I’m not good at this kind of thing but I try)
Redrogue2291 [info] I can relate. I have been depressed since I was 10. I experienced a lot of sexual abuse from age 11-16. I could not trust my family, and I couldn't be truly close to anyone because of the pain. I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD later. I did the same thing you are doing, but with a different medication. I even made the attempt and took the pills. 4 years later and I'm still here. There are days where I feel like total shit, but I'm glad I made it. Life is not bright and beautiful for everyone, but every day there is opportunity for change. You are most likely going to have another episode, and it will continue until you get the treatment you need. There is always help. I don't know where you live, but the US has many phone numbers to call and speak to someone about your feelings. Don't give up dear, it is possible to feel better than how you are feeling. 
tinytinyspaghetti [info] I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 11, but had it for a year prior as well. Depression and anxiety run in my family, making it very difficult for me to get over it sometimes. I also have a very complicated relationship with my mother which added to the depression/suicidal thoughts when I was younger. I’m 21 now am no longer suicidal but stillhave depression and anxiety. I’m doing very well now and am happy for everything I learned during my teen depressive years. I’m about to graduate from college and will be applying to graduate school next month.
MrsSlibby [info] I'm sorry you're feeling this way, first I just want to say that you're not a bad person. If you're concerned with other people's wellbeing and want them to be happy then you're not a bad person. Secondly,  I'm sorry that your mother is treating you like there's nothing wrong.  Either she is not a very good psychologist or she is in some serious denial herself about her child experiencing these things. I dont think its uncommon for people your age to go through some amount of social anxiety as you're growing up but that doesn't mean you don't need some extra help to deal with it. It could also be a more chronic problem, I don't know you and I'm not a doctor or anything so I can't say. But I was diagnosed with depression when I  was 13 so its definitely possible. I think you should seek help from a psychiatrist if you can. If your mom is against it maybe you could try talking to your doctor or your school counselor and see if they can talk to your mom on your behalf. Sorry this was so rambling. I hope it can help.
chinook2018 [info] Thank you! Honestly my story is kind of depressing but I'll try not to make it too long!I struggled with mental health issues my whole life, I had panic attacks starting at the age of 4 which was later diagnosed as generalized anxiety disorder, I was diagnosed with depression at age 11 and was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. I was bullied a LOT throughout the years and it really really messed me up. I saw various counselors throughout the years and I had terrible terrible self esteem but ultimately it was one therapy program I was in that sent me into a bad spiral.I was already self harming and purging at that point and had attempted suicide a few times, I was 15 and my doctor thought I might have borderline personality disorder so he referred me to therapy. What I didn't know at the time was you can't be diagnosed with that until you're an adult and during my first session the head pyschiatrist flat out told me I didn't have bpd or any of my other issues I had been diagnosed with and all I had were bad self esteem issues. After that I started therapy there. I hate to say it but my therapist contributed to a lot of my issues. She knew I was actively making myself throw up because I told her but all she cared about was whether I was throwing up blood or not and I wasn't so she didn't bother addressing it. She made a point of telling me she didn't want to label me but then when she was trying to get me into a group therapy program there she made a point of saying I was one of the most extreme cases they'd ever had and how I was lucky to be getting in because everyone else in the program had been cutting for so much longer and had actually had to have stitches and had been hospitalized multiple times unlike me. I was told multiple times I was one of the most extreme cases (which was also why I stayed there so long  because most patients were there for 3 months and thats all and at most they extended their therapy by a month or two but they had to extend mine to a year which was very rare) but ultimately I lost my spot there since I missed a few sessions and they pulled me out.But being told how extremely sick I was really really messed me up. I'd only been hurting myself for like two years at that point and had never needed stitches and all of a sudden I started developing an intense paranoia that I needed to get sicker and hurt myself more and more because everyone saw me as an extreme case when I really wasn't that sick and I felt I needed to live up to their expectations so they didn't get mad at me for not being extremely ill. I could barely function some days because all I could think about was how I needed to hurt myself more and more and I'd go to bed having panic attacks because I felt like I hadn't hurt myself enough and I needed to do more, it was a living hell. There was so much that happened with a friend of mine who I had an unhealthy friendship with because of my intense fear of abandonment and my issues and when I was 18 I was finally diagnosed with bpd which explained everything although I felt like I was the worst person to ever live and I felt like I didn't deserve recovery so I kept hurting myself.Then my friend wound up leaving and it kind of shook me out of my paranoia long enough to realize I needed help and I deserved a chance at getting better. So I basically tried to hang onto that glimpse of reality and hung on tightly and I quit cold turkey although it's been extremely hard not to relapse and sometimes I feel like a failure for not relapsing once. I'm in a good therapy program now with a great therapist who knows not to talk about how sick I am or am not. I've also developed a passion for mental health and I want to spread more awareness about personality disorders specifically.So yeah that's my story. It is dark and I wish I could say I stopped cutting because of some sweet beautiful reason but it was literally because I lost my best friend and I was at rock bottom and I had one glimpse of reality that wasn't shrouded by my paranoia and I had to grab onto it and try my best not to let go because I was in such a bad place that I would have fallen right back where I was if I hadn't taken advantage of the moment.
Tomskaa [info] Suicide is never the answer. You have the strength to get through this. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety so I know how you feel man. You didn’t mention seeing a psychologist in your description, so I would highly recommend doing that. I have been seeing a psychologist as well as taking antidepressants and it’s been helping a lot
jenp2323 [info] I'm definitely not saying go to a psychiatric hospital if you are depressed. That's not the point of psych hospitals? I have been diagnosed with depression So i wouldn't say I am an "outsider". I guess my post is more geared towards those who haven't reached out for professional help
windy_beans [info] Oh, no not at all. I hope you don't mind a rather long text.tl;dnr: Can't tolerate people,  alsmot complete isolation, breakdwon, medication. TR: Deprression, Psychotherapy and ClincI find it extremely hard to be in places with a lot of people (not like a sold out stadium neither  10 just in the same room). I seem to see and smell everything. I thee public Transportation for everything (it's quit normal in Switzerland, there is no need for a car in the city)and therefore I see a lot of things, that make me so angry and lost. If someone puts his shoes on the seats or if some speaks obnoxiously loud and (I am absolutely aware that this is what I feel) talks about annoying and (to me) irrelevant stuff, I can't shut it out. OR if I see an elderly woman alone in the city (they are just minding der own business, not looking sad, ill or anything) I could just start to cry because I am convinced that the person is so sad inside. And again, I am aware that this is exactly what I feel inside but that normally does not help a lot. It just confirms my inner feeling of not fitting anywhere and not being able to understand how everyone seems to really want to live. I am very lucky and privileged, I have a very nice job, an amazing supporting family and a hand full of very close and understanding friends and a loving Boyfriend (we've slit up last year).But that brings me to another point where I struggled hard with my strict schedules. I try to be on PT during rush hours and I had to be at home am 05:00 (in the evening) even if I was bored at home and would liked to go shopping or anything else. I just wanted to make sure, I can avoid people and therefore be a little bit less stressed. In the end I isolated my self extremely. I could barely make a date with my friends because it was so exhausting to be out there and  having to absorb everything around you 24/7. No one else seems to notice all the smells, the sounds and all the conversation near by. My friends never gave up  on me but I had huge arguments with my family (consisting of my Mom and my beloved Twin sister who is the bright opposite of me and understands me the most, no jealousy from me towards her, never. She is just the most lovable person out there) since I would cancel most of our family diners on a short-term (we all live close to each other) because I was already worn out by the normal day and knew I would want to leave after maybe 1-1.5 hours. My mum always gets so mad about this, she finds it unacceptable to be invited and the leave quickly. Kinda absurd, because the 3 of us have a very strong loving bond but my mom switches to a very angry sturdy person she normally never exhibits if the topic is about me and my ways of living (not wanting to have diner often with them or cancelling on a short note and not being able to change the day I wandet to do laundry (which would absolutely not be a problem  technically and stuff like that. Chores or ideas that I had in my schedule and the longer I did this, the closer those schedule time windwos became. I am in therapy since 22 Years (I'm 29 now) and it never was visible that I live inside my own space where I could tolerate very few people.I have to say I am a librarian and talking and working with people is not a problem at all, I love all of my colleagues we have a very caring office. So yeah, sorry, getting sidetracked ;-) Suddenly I could not go out with my BF and his friends and then I could no longer go out with him, because I was mostly on diets and I was miserable often around food and just did not want to have to endure that and decided to stay in. And in 2017 my carefully planed and developed Schedule system just broke down within days. I ended up in a psychiatric clinic  (I was diagnosed with depression since I was 12 years old and  on softly changing medication since then) I was very devestated because I do not fit in the depression clinical picture nore in any others. So no medication ever really helped me.Until I've me a fantastic Psychologist  during my second week in the clinic. We had 2 sessions and then he put his note pad down, looked my in the eyes and said "You are not mentally ill, you most certainly do not have manic disorders, you have a very distinct ADHD with a depression because of that. And then I remember taking Ritalin during my professional education shortly and that I was diagnosed when I was in Kindergarden. But it never occured to me, that this would be more than not being able to focus (which I felt was not that bad). He proceeded to give me methylphenidate and within dayys I was feeling so much better.Since then : I have found a new Psychologist and Psychiater who are specialised on ADHD in adults. She changed the medication once and it made so much easier. I am able to tolerate people way more, I can at least bring my thoughts in order. I can decide if a chore is super important or if I could go out with friends and dust the bookshelf the next day.I also have a faint feeling of what it is to be "normal" I noted, how different I see and experience the world.
tristepieceodpizza [info] As far as I am concerned ,it’s almost impossible for an intelligent ,sympathetic , compassionate individual not to be depressed about the reality of this world .I don’t think that depression should be considered as an  illness or that depressed individuals are in need of treatment because there’s something wrong with them .Depressed individuals need medication not because of some chemical imbalance in their brains ,but because, in order to be a fully functioning member of this society ,it’s necessary that you follow the orders and don’t think too much ,which depressed individuals can’t help but do .The doctors don’t cure you from an illness ,but rather they cure you of your own thoughts and individuality ,because the society does not want individuals ,it only wants sheep .The illness does not lie within the depressed .But within those who stare blankly at the sufferings of other people which were prompted by certain individuals’ dire need of personal benefit.Within those who send innocent men to war playing political games.Within those who only care about buying a cool car ,having a beautiful wife and having kids.Within those who only fucking care about themselves and don’t give a shit about the consequences of their actions .Within robots who follow the orders without thinking for themselves . I was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago and I spent a great deal of time thinking that there was something wrong with me because I just couldn’t find happiness in the mundane things when I knew that so many things were clearly wrong with this world .I thought I needed treatment and medication because I spent too much time thinking about things nobody around me cared  about.But then I realized that there was nothing wrong with the fact that I thought about things nobody thought about and cared about things nobody cared about .I realized that there was nothing wrong with me just because I couldn’t  ignore all the shit in this world .I’ve kind of given in to sadness ,I guess.I see the darkness as a friend now.I don’t stop myself from thinking anymore .Because ,even though ignorance truly is a bliss ,I’d rather be miserable to my dying day than become another sheep with no individuality .I plan on sticking around for as much as I can because this world is such a joke to me now so I just look at it and laugh at how stupid everything around me is.
oblivious_pan [info] I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few times by different mental health professionals, but they haven't closely examined how that affects my learning through a psychoeducational assessment. That means there's not enough information for me to have an IEP. Without an IEP, there's no proof that my illnesses interfere with my education in any way.
sprinklesbubbles123 [info] I feel this so hard. I was diagnosed with depression at 14. At 22, I am still struggling very much. It’s hard to develop a personality or interests or qualities when all of your energy is spent trying to make it to the next day, and the only thing running through your head is dark thoughts. As a 22 year old, it scares me. You’re supposed to “find yourself” as a teenager. Develop a stable personality and personal traits. But I missed all of that. I feel so much more immature than my peers because of this.
TSKILL37 [info] In high school I wrote a paper in which the assignment was to be as descriptive as possible. At the time I was only diagnosed with depression, so I wrote about that. I described a nature painting that was in my then therapist’s office and used a metaphor very similar to this. In the first paragraph I described it as bleak and all the neutral colors stuck out. While in the conclusion I described how vibrant it was. It was one of the best pieces of writing I had up to that point, but I never got my grade back or any feedback. She had a weird grading system where we wouldn’t always get our work back right away and she gifted a box of it to us when we graduated. It wasn’t included in my box though. I wonder if she was concerned that I was writing about such a personal thing.Music is always better when in a hypo-manic mood, I’m always very attentive to TV shows, and I fly through books. But when I’m depressed that stuff is just white noise. Thanks for sharing!Edit: I also had the feeling I was bipolar even before I was diagnosed with depression. When I’d tell people, even my doctor, they were worried I was too caught up in self diagnosis. But sure enough it took 2 weeks worth of full blown mania/psychosis to convince them that I indeed had it.
StressedCookie [info] Didn't care. But that mightve been bc I dropped a LOT of bombs at that moment.1. My sexuality2. Birth control implant at 19 in a very Conservative catholic country3. EDI'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety along with it. Maybe she didn't catch it but she says I dont eat when people say how I lost weight after being the fatso.She literally says "It's because she doesn't eat." not cool mum, but I'm glad she doesn't force me to eat and just let me do my own thing.
aestheticautistic [info] This came up in my notifications for some reason and it’s so relatable that I thought I’d written it myself and it was a reply notification lol. Being sad is predictable to me. I’m 22 and I was diagnosed with depression at 12, after 3 years of feeling consistently low. It’s been my normal for so long that anything else feels scary and unfamiliar. I genuinely don’t know what happiness feels like. It doesn’t help that I’m autistic, so feelings are difficult for me to label anyway, but sometimes I feel weird emotions that I *think* are excitement, or pride, or happiness. But I just don’t know. The only emotions I can label are sadness, guilt, anger, and fear. If it’s not any type of emotion relating to those, then I get anxious about the inevitable crash afterwards. Happiness is also depressing because when I feel something nice, I get sad because I know it won’t last forever, but I wish it would. I like being sad because I know it, it’s homey and comfy (but at the same time not), and I don’t want to feel happiness to know what I’m missing.I guess I haven’t helped, but I hope it’s useful in some way to know you’re not alone. Stay safe
elusivebarkingspider [info] I am so sorry she said that to you, I hope you are doing better now.  Your mom sounds like a narcissist from that comment alone. Internet hugs your way!It was my dad who asked me what I had to be sad about and I was like "Well, dad, I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, soooo..." He's nice overall but just oblivious because he's never dealt with it (though my stepmom has it so he really should have *some* understanding).
samreturned [info] Just after first year of uni, I was diagnosed with depression the year after, I stopped being able to perform every day tasks. I was in and out of hospitals and prison cells. For obvious reasons, I lost my job and had to leave uni. I'd like to relive it, knowing my mistakes and making it better
Gx2112xGG [info] I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when i was 12 years old. I’m now a 21 year old grown man and i still struggle with it intensely from day to day. Don’t be scared to talk about it with people who understand and want to help. Although you will be misunderstood by many, don’t let them get to you. Your mind is a very powerful tool and if you let it bring you down, it will destroy you... Keep your head high and thicken your skin. It’s a blessing and a curse in a sense so don’t be afraid to be different in any aspect of your life. Even when your depression makes you feel like you’re useless and nothing, you gotta move past it in order to progress in the future. Sometimes you’ll have no concern for your future and well being and question why you’re here. Just remember that if it seems pointless to live, what’s the point in going out too soon too? Life’s tough and believe me it’ll only get worse, but when you persevere through the troubles it makes you stronger in the end.
horse_at_water [info] My iq was measured after I was diagnosed with depression but not the other mental illnesses, the first time when I was in eating disorder treatment they had a teacher that would give us the work, however I was really depressed and un willing to do any work during that time, the second time when I was in the hospital I was only there for 4 and a half days so I didn't really miss much
alittlebirdy_toldme [info] Well, it's been years since I had any actual interests. I was diagnosed with depression a while back, and my motivation for things is just gone. I've been trying to get back into my hobbies, but they're like writing and things to do by myself. I don't really have social interests. I want to get into hiking, maybe I could make friends doing that.
WonderfullyRhi [info] 12, felt constantly hopeless, learned about depression and looked into it. Immediately decided I needed to nip this in the bud. Told my mom, she was like "you're gonna be going through a lot of emotions like that". When she learned I was feeling suicidal she agreed to take me to therapy. I was diagnosed with depression at 13. I didn't start taking medication until I was 19 and had developed anxiety. 
throwayayayaysya [info] I am diagnosed with depression and ADHD
SlyDysgraphic [info] Hey, you are NOT stuck! even if it feels that way.It sounds like you need a change of scenery. I know change is very hard but, even a small babystep feels 100 times better than living in mediocre hellI have dysgraphia (similar to dyslexia but, writing instead of reading). I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since my teens. ADHD since I was in kindergarten. Have a bachelor's degree in and some education past that. I'm still working on more... slowly.I was right where you were. It's taken 5 years but, I'm in a much better place now.I know you said health care is null right now but, it sounds like you could have ADHD too. It's super common if you have dyslexia.>desperately want to make something of myself but it seems I am not capable.That sentence is a Hallmark of women with ADHD. what do you think are some of the reasons you don't think you are capable?If you don't have access to health care right now please please please at least be a little kinder to yourself.
ZyraReflex [info] Agreed. In high school I was diagnosed with depression and adhd, but it just fucking irritated me to hear people say "oh I wanna die XD" or whatever, and people that just say they have ADHD without any grounds for doing so. Having ADHD doesn't make you quirky or unique. It makes doing work impossible, and makes it way more difficult to achieve long term goals or even remembering short term things you have to do.
nowplayingaudiobooks [info] When I was diagnosed with depression, they put me on welbutrin to help with the fatigue and concentration issues. Helps with weight management and quitting cigarettes apparently too.Lots of people love it. It just made me feel relaxed... didn’t help with anything besides my sleeping problems. Took it at night and slept like a baby. Told my psychiatrist and found out i had undiagnosed adhd lol. i’m on vyvanse now, and that stuff will knock me out if i take a dose lower than 40mg. anyway, got off topic,  yeah its suppose to be good for sexual dysfunction too 🤷🏻‍♀️
soulihide [info] It’s a way of speaking, this person says they are also diagnosed with depression not that they diagnosed themselves. “I am diagnosed with depression”, is the same as “I am diagnosed myself with depression” only the added “myself” is there to show that they too have depression. Idk if I’m explaining this right, but I hope you get it. Also while we’re on the topic, you also seem to be nitpicking a bit. Is that because you feel irritable and just want to lash out, or just because you saw what you thought was a reason to comment?Reddit took forever letting me post this and I had a sort of revelation while brushing my teeth:Depression is hate, hatred towards so many things and most of all ourselves. This hate in turn makes us so tired that when we can’t hate anymore we want to die. Some people have more energy for hate than sadness, and others have less hate but more sadness. Does that make any sense at all?
blackdaisylight [info] Same, I was diagnosed with depression  and had anorexia as well at some point. Same, I'm that self conscious as well and sometimes paranoid about people staring at me or judging me. That's why idk I think he was "just" depressed
willyboy24 [info] Unfortunately I'm quite familiar with this feeling. I can be happier than ever for months, then suddenly just fall right back into the bad thoughts. I've been diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder, and when bad things happen in my life I can get stuck in this state of wanting to die for weeks on end. I try my best to refocus during these times and do a lot of self care. Just do your best to focus on the good things in life, and if that's difficult, make good things happen. The feeling will pass. 
PumaPatty [info] I'm ashamed to write that I used to be a lot like your friend. I have lost two important friendships in the last decade because of this. I am heartbroken but I understand that I wasn't as good of a friend as I thought I was.Your friend probably needs to talk because of underlying problems she has. While it is understandable to need to talk with your friends, it is also important to give your attention to them when it's their turn.In my case, I have been diagnosed with depression and I'm seeing a therapist. I am able to see now that it was my behavior that cut me out of my friends' life. It is hard to deal with sometimes but I have decided to better myself and be more attentive to my existing friends in order not to lose them.So basically, your friend's need to talk goes beyond what you can offer in return. You could suggest she sees a therapist and then take it from there. If nothing else works, I suggest seeing her less often.You are a good person and I hope she realises how lucky she is to have you. Good luck !
PrometheusCat [info] I should probably add a bit of background. My name is Chris. I’m 22 from England. I have struggled with mental health in one way or another for probably the majority of my life. There were times that it got so bad, that I honestly didn’t think I’d be alive today. I have been diagnosed with depression. I prefer to see that as the underlying sadness and such that’s always in the background of my life, but always there. That being said, I sometimes have severe periods of depression that often result in me barely being able to function. In those times, that vary in intensity, I usually cry a lot, and seriously consider, or attempt, suicide. While not actually diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, my previous therapist said that she thought I probably had Generalised Anxiety Disorder, and that I seemed to meet all the criteria for it. Up to that point, the general consensus was that I had ODC, as well as anxiety.However, I still say I have OCD as it’s probably significantly, if not entirely, accurate. Plus, it’s simpler to explain to people. Common issues for me include:- overthinking - self-doubt - self-hatred- feelings of stupidity or incompetence - obsessing over certain things, usually problems I feel I need to solve or understand - extreme regrets over past mistakes - fear (I’m scared of a lot of things, it’s too difficult for me to put into words)- feeling overwhelmed - stress and headaches induced by often minor situationsThat’s the gist of it. On top of that, suicide is a common topic.I will often feel the desire to commit suicide, or more accurately, that dying would be better than my current pain. This is counterbalanced by the fact that I don’t want to die. I want to live. I am also deeply afraid of death. This makes things difficult, as I feel like I can’t escape.
CrypticCorvus1 [info] That's some bullshit. Dont ever let anyone tell you that your issues and what you are going through aren't valid. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and adhd when I was like 8 or 9
rudestboy420 [info] I have a huge circle of friends and i am very liked by them. I have been diagnosed with depression and tried multiple SSRIs yet to no avail. Where to go from here?
bedoge_ [info] Sorry, I don't agree with it. Douche people do this. I was diagnosed with depression and went to therapist. I experience anxiety attacks and that shit is the worst (for me), but shit when I talked to people from my uni or friends I behaved pretty normal. I know that people often hide stuff and I think I'm more emphatic to people with claiming themselves having a mental illness more then I used to be. There's nothing about being lucky to have a therapist. I often feel like shit anyway, after a long therapy but I somehow manage to keep myself of suicide. People after therapy often come with experience and only advice from me is that you should seek for help as soon as possible. Especially professional help, if u can't afford a therapist, there's surely more ways to deal with it, and getting help. There's a lot of sites online. I take ur words seriously, I would help u if I could. I remember when I called my parents and said "Mom, when I comeback, I need help, I've got black thoughts and I'm scared of them. I need a doctor" and we seek together for someone. Don't know if that helped me but shit I'm alive. Only people that annoys me are people that are pretty normal and when they get sad they say, that they're depressed. It's so meaningless because of that and people don't take those words seriously Anyway, what's bugging u? 
thisthrowawayforarsn [info] Thank you, these have helped, I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Its mostly due to a sexual assault. And I'm trying to take my healing into my own hands, as the CBT councelor I have sees me maybe once a month, and is all over the place. I am prescribed anti depressants but they made my poor focus even worse, so I'm unsure about taking them, as I quit them before.
YoungLords12 [info] I am happy that you're able to enjoy things again. What I mean by simply be, is to ask yourself.. are you in a dangerous situation? No? Then continue what u need to be doing, similar to how when you get a cut on ur leg and it stings, but that doesnt mean u stare at it and poke it and reflect in sorrow as to why it happened and why it stings. Same can be said about mental struggles, the more you obsess and try to "fix" what you believe to be wrong with you, the more power you give and deeper the rabbit hole you go. I dont mean to say you should like how you feel when anxiety comes, but what I mean is to give up trying to do things to make it go away or "fix" yourself. Trust me bro, I've been diagnosed with depression anxiety and panic disorder, I know exactly how I sound and when you are in it it's very hard to be accepting towards someone saying all this ^ because it shatters alot of the misconceptions you have about anxiety. In an essence, anxiety/depression is fueled by overthinking and stress and other factors like PTSD. So taking meditation suppresses the symptoms so you feel more "normal" but realistically to truly overcome it and find happiness and I mean true happiness and peace, you need to work on what's happening in your head. No amount of medication is going to rewire how your brain works. I hope you can find the peace and happiness that I did!
frazwood [info] Personally, I would recommend that you deal with your depression first.  I was diagnosed with depression about 2 years ago and through a lot of hard work (therapy + meds)... I am out of a depression cycle.I see the world very differently now.  You might discover that you are actually in love with him.  Or not.  But, now? I'm guessing all that you can actually see is depression.
mourning_star85 [info] Yes yes yes!!!   I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 19, I'm 34. I've been on medication since diagnosis but it killed my attention span after about 2 years. I used to read tons of books, not anymore. I used to paint and draw,  it became impossible.    As annoying and frustrating as it is, I'll take it because the alternative of not being medicated would be worse.     Recently since cannabis became legal in Canada I experimented with different types and found that strains that help with fatigue help to get me motivated but also focused.
haircombsnightmare [info] Hey!I am very sorry you are feeling this way. There is definitely no reason why you shouldn't be a fan, so this is depression speaking for you. I suggest checking out some subreddits like  I don't wanna sound cliche and I don't know your personal life circumstances, but also consider therapy and visiting a psychiatrist.I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Medication helped me a TON. But do get professional help as each person is their own world. And no pressure, but feel free to reach out :)P.S.: sometimes listening to songs by them and reading their lyrics helps me out. An example is [Iljido by Moonbyul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf19tbhfuD4&ab_channel=MamamooArchive) and [Be Calm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksBRHseZL8k&ab_channel=FaceYourself) by Hwasa.
Nohelpforu [info] Yea I got the trifecta of mental health support when I was diagnosed with depression, just still stings being in a position where it honestly feels like i was raised by aliens
kennarae-t [info] I’ve honestly had a very similar college experience. Had friends from freshman year going into sophomore year. I was diagnosed with depression my sophomore year, and nearly failed out because of it. My roommates, people who I considered my best friends at the time offered me no support. Never even got so much as a “how are you doing”. Instead I would get snarky remarks like “well maybe if you went to the gym more...” I lost 20 lbs. shut everyone out. They didn’t seem to miss me at all. It took me months to process what had happened. I always thought that there was something wrong with *me*. I wasn’t “normal” enough to meet their expectations. It was my fault. I finally started counseling this past fall. It has helped me realize that they were pretty shitty friends from the beginning. I still don’t have any new friends really. I have the most amazing friends from high school that have shown me what having truly supportive friends feels like. I’ve gotten to the point where I feel like my standards for friendship are pretty high, because of the lack of support I’ve received in the past. Finding comfort in my loneliness has been a freeing experience for me, because I have learned how to be extremely happy without having friends. (Within driving distance). I picked up a few hobbies that make me happy, and I focus on school and trying to maintain my depression/anxiety.
ElectricalIons [info] I was diagnosed with depression young.  I struggled with math in college.  Part of the reason I struggled, is because of diagnosed clinical depression due to childhood shit. I think the hardest part of math is when you struggle with it, and you stop getting validation for your work. Even when you're trying hard, when you're consistently below the curve (because everybody failed that test), it's not a good feeling. It makes it easy to want to quit.
generic_username157 [info] I’m in disbelief, every single word here describes my situation.My mother is diagnosed with depression.I also hate people that throw the word around.I was diagnosed with depression a couple of years ago, haven’t told anyone yet, maybe one friend, I’m not sure.I also have these little sparks with my friends, but they never last more than a couple of minutes.My guy, I myself know it’s a though spot, just keep going, sure, I’m not out myself, but maybe all we both need is to keep on pushing.
awkwardflea [info] I was on Zoloft briefly a number of years ago, and it didn't work well for me. I was diagnosed with depression, and the psychiatrist was a friend of my (narcissistic) mother. I had a number of competence/ ethical issues with him, so it was bad all around. But the Zoloft made me unable to feel anything, and I just couldn't tolerate it. I've only been suggested meds once since I was diagnosed with CPTSD. The therapist who diagnosed me wanted me to see a psychiatrist for an evaluation because I wasn't responding well to therapy. He pushed a lot and never created safety. Easy solution: new therapist. This all having been said, I'm actually really damn functional. I have a good marriage, friends, successful career, hobbies, etc. I still struggle with anxiety and depression, but I'm in therapy, go for regular bodywork, and practice martial arts. I'm not going to take meds to make myself more pliable for a therapist. So long as I can regulate myself enough to function without meds, I won't be taking any. They don't fix the trauma, but they can help you function enough to address the trauma if that's what you need.
IllustriousConcert7 [info] did you miss the part where I said I was diagnosed with depression, or
Pilleater9 [info] Yeh man, I feel the same way. The part when you smoke and then you just stay quiet because you dont know what to say to people, I can relate so much. I would just sit there, all paranoid, thinking that they are thinking the worst about me etc. That sometimes made me unintentionally "hostile" against them.I had to give up weed about a year ago, I started having really bad panic attacks from it. It was so bad that my mother wanted to call an ambulance. I was sure I was dying or at least going crazy. Protip: drinking a fair amount of alcohol seems to help with this. Before I quit I would drink a few beers before I smoked. I still smoked small amounts tho, lolEdit: I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I am pretty sure that smoking weed since I was 14 pretty much triggered it. At least the anxiety.
Majestic-Whole [info] I don't believe your lazy like the previous comment I would recommend reaching out fir some help maybe a diagnosis.I also work for myself and run a small business and I have been diagnosed with depression I experience real high moments of motivation and accomplish a lot. But when I hit a depressive state I can be really unproductive but I don't want to be that way I almost can't do anything about it in that moment. There's lots of types of therepy out there including CBT as well as medication if you feel you need it or want it. Good luck for the future 🙌
GoopyDumpy [info] I'm in UK, and I'm currently on the waiting list for DBT Therapy. I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, while with the BPD I know I have some of it's symptoms, but not in it's entirety, so i just say I have traits, but I'm going to be assessed this year. It's hard atm because I'm in between therapies (having had therapy in hospital and now waiting for DBT) because where I live the mental health care system always has a long waiting list.
zzyardtop [info] Not really. I was frightened a lot. Anxiety is probably more at the core of my identity than depression. Before I was diagnosed with all my issues I couldn’t dream. I would sleep so heavy that I would fall asleep and be awake a few seconds later. However it was torture trying to fall asleep. My brain would fixate on very violent imagery that would cause me anxiety and physical pain watching them. I would wake up in odd positions with all my blankets twisted and pushed off the bed tho so I’m sure I was having dreams about that. I never felt rested either. Also would have sleep paralysis sometimes. After I was diagnosed with depression and some anxiety, and got some help I started dreaming. They were filled with pretty bad anxiety. I went thru a period where every night I would have a normal dream that would turn into me being tracked down and shot or just murdered. Sometimes multiple times a night. I would be killed and re-spawn somewhere else only to have it happen again. I’d also have intense dreams about natural disasters I couldn’t get away from. I’d wake up exhausted from my brain trying to chaotically throw things at me that I wasn’t dealing with yet. And later with more therapy and help I was diagnosed with ptsd, OCD, and minor ADHD. As I got more help thru the weeks my dreams became more “normal” for me (they’re very random and all over the place but harmless). However, when I have episodes of depression reoccur, I stop dreaming or they go back to just panic filled dreams. And I always wake up exhausted from these.I think part of the reason (to answer your question) is that depression is more often a symptom, not the actual problem. Even tho it may be viewed as THE problem or currently may be the largest symptom. I didn’t know I had any anxiety issues until way later, but almost everything stems from anxiety for me. Edit: clarity
YouShouldReadAres [info] Tldr; it's a long process and takes a multifaceted approach. Depends on where you are / what level of suicidal ideation you're in (annoying interruptions, constantly being thought about, essentially on the level of compulsion that you are fighting with every molecule of your being, etc). Process includes: Redirecting negative self talk, therapy, listing good things about yourself, practicing hella patience with yourself, capturing and really trying to hold onto good events, get a friend to promise to do something horribly rude to your family at your funeral if you do kill yourself, medication, switching up belief systems, etc. In my experience, it can take a long time. I was diagnosed with depression about 8 years ago but have had suicidal ideation for at least 13 years. I still have moments where I am dealing with suicidal ideation on the brink of  compulsion, but it's much less frequent and much more manageable. My struggle with depression has been a real process, and at points hasn't been the healthiest - so please only take from this what seems like it could be helpful and healthy for you.When I was younger, I used to measure how long a continuous suicidal inclination lasted. I would tell myself to get through the next day and see if it was better, if it lasted longer reach out for help or connect with family/friends in a meaningful way. Anytime I wasn't actively thinking about hurting myself, no matter if it was only for a moment, I would re-start my 'clock' and force myself to keep waiting. My mantra for a few years was honestly "Death comes to those who wait" lol. My life kind of de-railed for a bit, some shit happened, and I started manifesting some strong symptoms of PTSD. To get through this, I compromised with my suicidal ideation and took up smoking as a way to kill myself slowly enough that I would have time to stop the process if/when I was mentally healthy enough to do so... Not the healthiest nor advisable path, but also kept me here long enough to begin the process of quitting in earnest and I doubt I'd be here without that compromise... so, yeah... About 3 years ago, I began shutting down negative self-talk and responding to each suicidal thought by listing at least 3 things that I found fulfillment in, thought was valuable about myself, or wanted to stick around for. I tried to make sure that each time I had to go through this process, at least one of the things I listed felt true. This was really hard at the beginning because the thoughts were hella intrusive and on a constant loop so I was constantly trying to come up with good attributes for myself. Part of the hard part of this technique was recognizing when I was having a negative or suicidal thought. Doing this took a bit of discipline and a lot of patience with myself. I found that this process helped greatly decrease how automatic and continuous my suicidal ideation is - however I do still have moments when suicide and self-mutilation is suddenly the only thing I can think about (#triggered, by what? no idea). Those moments are hard to break out of and usually require me to stop what I'm doing, breathe through it, and try and refocus on the present and my reasons for staying. I think what has been most helpful for me, is being fully theoretically resolved to not take my life. This is helpful because the suicidal thoughts start to lose power and become more annoying than anything else. I also have a really good friend who has promised / threatened me that he would piss on my grave or in my open casket at my funeral if I killed myself. He's 100% the type of person who would do that... and it has been a helpful deterrent at times b/c I don't want my fam to have to deal with him whipping out his dick on top of everything else.  I've also found that changing up my beliefs has helped. I used to find solace in Christianity and then nihilism and now rebirth. I hold these beliefs in a very agnostic sense (like I'm 100% sure that my beliefs aren't the full story of what's going on in the world). But my current "belief" in rebirth helps me feel like suicide is futile and giving in would compound my depression onto the next version of my self... idk. That's not to say you should change your religion or anything, just that I found switching things up helpful for me. Also, therapy. Once you've found a therapist who clicks, it can be v beneficial. And meds... those can help too. And tattoos... but that might just be a me thing. I also have a journal where I write down things which have been effective towards improving my mental health so that I don't forget what works when my brain is trying to kill me. Good luck
lokilover49 [info] My family and I had moved into a new house (kind of like a log house but it was big and nice for a 7 person family) and everything seemed fine...until it wasn’t. About 8 months in we all had a complete shift in behavior. My dad was more physically violent, he was much more verbally abusive and would get upset at the most minuscule things. My oldest sister (17 at the time) would drink and blackout so much. My 2nd oldest (16 at the time) wasn’t doing well in school. My two youngest sisters seemed unaffected but anyways around this time I was 11-12 and I was contemplating taking my life. Yes I was diagnosed with depression and although I thought about it, I never had the will or the urge to WANT to take my life. It was a two story house and I would have an urge to get on the roof and jump into the pool, even though I didn’t know how to swim. That sounds bad but my mom was the worst. She was honestly dying no one could figure out why. She felt so weak and would faint for no reason. Everything made her sick and no matter how many doctors we went to, no one could explain why. We all hated each other.Eventually money ran out and we had to move out and find a new home, and suddenly everything was better. Business (my parents own two business) was doing better than ever. Everyone got better, less violent, urge to drink stopped, grades got better, and i wasn’t completely suicidal. It was as if there was a shadow or a presence haunting us and attaching to us. This happened about 8-9 years ago.About a year ago, a man came to my parents. It’s no one we had ever met or even seen before. And he proceeded to tell my dad things about his life, so detailed and random, things that you’d only know if you were my dad. He then asked how he knew this and he told him a higher being told him to come to my dad and tell him this so he’ll believe his next statement. He told my dad that someone that lived in that house prior to us played with a Ouija board, opened a door and invited a demon into the house and got scared and instead of making the demon leave and closing the door, ending the “game” correctly, they took the board and buried it 5 acres deep into the property. Whatever they let in, was still in the house and it was feeding off of us.This was just the overall story of that house. We had so many freaky experiences that immediately convinced us there was a ghost in the house but we never thought demon. TL;DR: my family and I moved to house and ended up hating each other for no reason. We moved and later found out there was a demon in the house from a ouija board someone opened.
kaczumba [info] I was diagnosed with depression in last 10 years and got a diagnosis of bipolar II just a couple of months ago. What actually helped were questions from my new psychiatrist about issues with spending too much money, beginning new hobbies and never learning anything, sleeping less. I hope you’ll find help. Hugs
ZoobyZobbyBanana [info] Edit: Thank you so much for the Reddit silver! When I made this post I was going through a very depressed period of my life, and I was under the impression that this post would gain no traction. Now, with the addition of virtual currency that can't be redeemed, I can achieve my dreams of being a successful and contributing member of this fandom. When I was 12 years old I was diagnosed with depression, and my life has been a downward spiral since that fateful day seven months ago. I would like to thank my Roblox girlfriend and all of my family members on Reddit, since I can't think of my real parents as family since they reject my need for constant attention and wish for me to have a future ruled by monetary values. Love you all UwU
BoseyJ_88 [info] I believe they are just words. I'm not trying to oppress the mentally ill. We dont live in the days where anybody who acted out of accordance with society was deemed "mentally ill". That term is just as bad. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and PTSD or am I just mentally ill instead?
Young_Sliver [info] I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 8, as well as PTSD thanks to an abusive father
lostminty [info] I was diagnosed with depression with psychotic features for awhile
Ballistic_Introvert [info] I’m scared to tell my parents because this isn’t my first time dealing with a disorde mental state. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety back in 2018 and was hospitalized for about a week. They thought that taking away my phone for months (including the entire summer) would solve the problem and it made everything worse because I couldn’t really contact my friends, etc. I also really don’t want to get behind in school. I’m 99.9% positive telling them would result in a trip to the hospital. More than a week since it wouldn’t be my first time :(
Tangerine117 [info] Hello from Southern California, the empire of weed lol. I am dreaming and living in a haze it seemed for the past ~7 months. I quit for one year then quit for 9 months. I was diagnosed with depression and take medicine for it. I am five days clean bro you can do this mate ask for help and it’s not a weakness to break down and just cry sometimes. Message me if you ever Want someone to talk to or need/want to talk!
taitumg [info] I was diagnosed with depression as well as other things for 6 years now and there has only been one out of the many I’ve tried that worked, Zoloft. However I thought I was fixed stopped my meds and relapsed.Tried Zoloft again and now it doesn’t work. It really takes that one medication to work but DONT STOP TAKING IT (unless there are side effects) but to answer your question of what it’s like, it feels like you’re a normal person finally. Sucks to know it’s just because your on a medication but it feels nice to finally feel motivated again. The suicidal thoughts fade away, I finally felt the way I believe a human should feel. Didn’t last tho.
nikkiflip [info] Sure, is there anything specific you would like to know? To start off...I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 18. Somewhere along the line I was also diagnosed with anxiety disorder NOS (not otherwise specified). I don’t have a bipolar diagnosis, so it’s just a suspicion at this point. I find my emotions and reactions out of control a lot of the time. There was one incident where I ran into the street in front of a car because I couldn’t control it. I was aware of what I was doing but I could feel in my head that I wasn’t in control. Almost like I was in the passenger seat in my own body. Also my anger gets directed at myself a lot of the time, since I’ve isolated myself from friends a lot over the past few years.
mdtrxwolf [info] I totally get that. I was diagnosed with depression almost 10 years ago, but started therapy and went on medication 4 years ago. It’s been the longest fucking decade of my life but the last 4 years when I’ve actively decided to put in the work has been life changing. It’s amazing to have hope and optimism and to see the beauty in life again. The work is really hard and it truly fucking sucks but it is so worth it. You’re on the right track! I always think of this quote, “If you’re going through hell, why stop and stay in hell? Keep going.”
Kariered [info] I was in a terrible car accident at 23 years old. I'm 40 years old now.The accident was not my fault. Another driver hit my car almost head on. I was on a highway going 70 mph. My car did not have air bags (wasn't required when the car was built). If I had not been wearing my seat belt, I would be dead.The seat belt broke my collarbone, I broke my wrist, fingers and shattered my kneecap (had to have surgery). It took almost ten months for my knee to get back to something resembling normal. For a good long time, I was scared of driving, of being in a car, anything to do with a car. I still get very anxious about cars, driving and freeways. A few years after my accident, I was diagnosed with depression. It sounds to me like your accident impacted you in a traumatic way (this is normal) and has maybe triggered depression in you. Being depressed isn't really all about feeling sad. It is other things, like having trouble focusing or functioning in daily life and not having motivation. It's not your fault that this is happening. It's your brain/body reacting to a traumatic event that has happened to you. If you think about it, cars or motorcycles, mainly people moving at fast speeds is not natural. Yes, we invented it, but our ancestors would freak if they saw how we traveled around today. I would seek out a therapist or psychiatrist or just go to your regular doctor and tell them what's going on.  You can get treatment for this (medication and therapy), and it could only be temporary. Sometimes therapy and medication will work well and then you can go off of it and be fine.I would do something as life will not just get better by doing nothing about it.
ranfaraway [info] I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety as a child and never learnt to love my body until I was 20. the real trick is to teach yourself to enjoy life as is, sit down and breath.  Breath and let the world be around you, listen to the sounds, feel the air and grass, taste the air and just think about how you fit in to it all and how the only one affected by the way you think about yourself is you.  When you get the grasp of that you can work towards acceptance of who you are and what really matters.  I hope this helps and are welcome to any further questions you may have!
SpaceDust99 [info] Im not sure if it’s normal but I can tell you that I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, social anxiety and even bipolar in the past. Not sure if any of it is true. I stopped trusting doctors since I didn’t feel like anything they did made me feel better. I’m going though something similar to what you are describing. I was kind of “normal” for about 4 months. Found a job, started to enjoy my hobbies more and I actually had hope for the future. Didn’t even think about death, suicide etc. Then out of nowhere, about three months ago, things started to get bad again. More and more depressed by each day and I’m at a point where it almost physically hurts to exist. I can’t understand what’s happening so I can’t explain it but you are not alone. All I can say is that you are not lying, something is definitely wrong...
izthepuzz [info] oh. well yeah.. I have been diagnosed with depression. But, darn. Well this is definetly not the worst symptom. because the pain also comes with some happiness that cant be described
jgteakitty [info] Well, it also gets kind of complicated there for me.... I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 13. So now I'm left wondering is the depression causing the physical issues, or are the physical issues causing the depression?
Unbreakable63 [info] You just nailed it! I understand my friend. I always had a great memory until I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I blame the meds for some of it. I feel like I've lost chunks of my life and can't trust my thoughts...at times.I feel a lot of it is lack of the ability to recall. If someone reminds me of a memory, I start to remember bits and peices but, this will sound weird, I don't remember being there.
geecalla [info] Thank you so much for being the first one to advise. It's hard to go back to zero with another guy and a lot of them are just not serious yet which I'm afraid would cause more heartache but I will try my best. My biggest challenge here is to be consistent fighting myself to entertain his messages especially when I feel so alone. Just recently I've been diagnosed with depression, but since I've taught myself some techniques how to cope up over the years, I am still able to keep my sanity most of the time. Unfortunately I can start my medication only by May for some reasons so it's quite challenging for me.
aglassofsherry [info] I was diagnosed with depression about a year ago, and sometimes I feel like I don't deserve to be called depressed because it's not serious enough, or I'm not sad all the time. So sometimes I'm not sure if I'm faking it or not.
TheLeDoge [info] I'm not sure if I've CPTSD (I've never talked to a psychiatrist about it), but I get anxious when I hear anything resembling an argument. It's mainly due to my mother who fights with my father ALL the time, in her ear-piercing threatening voice which gives me headaches and a sense of dread. It triggers my fight-or-flight response. I'm afraid of all conflicts and loud noises around me now. Is it actually a case of childhood trauma? I've never been physically or sexually abused. I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I don't know if some of the symptoms are actually due to childhood trauma and neglect.
hamsterpopcorn [info] Thinking back, I believe my symptoms started my first year in college. Often times narcolepsy can be brought on by the flu, which is what I believe happened to me. At 18 years old about 2 weeks into my first quarter in college I came down with a really bad case of the flu and thinking back that is when my symptoms started. 1. First symptoms: Suddenly I was falling asleep in class every single day. I tried getting more sleep at night, but it continued to happen. I would fall asleep sitting up and sometimes I would lean forward to try and pay closer attention but my eyes would close and I would be awake but I wouldn’t be able to open them again. It was always the same class around 4pm. My friends would make fun of me because I couldn’t stay awake through a single movie or for more than one or two episodes of a TV show or sometimes I would fall asleep mid-conversation and they would slam books next to me or slap my forehead and laugh because I would try to open my eyes again but couldn’t.2. Gradually or suddenly: How do I say this? It was new, like something that I hadn’t done before, but there were so many other changes in my life while transitioning to college I thought it was associated with those changes. I would say it gradually worsened and concerned me more. At first I was falling asleep every day at 4pm, but then as time progressed it was 2 hours after waking up as well as 4pm and I needed those two naps every day, more if I was short any sleep from the night before. It got to a point where doing simple tasks like putting laundry away or playing with my dog suddenly my body would get really heavy and I would lay down on the floor and sleep for about an hour, especially if this was around 4pm or 2 hours after waking up. I scared my roommates because I would slump over the table while eating breakfast. 3. When I decided to seek help: I was already going from doctor to doctor, but I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, then bipolar disorder and ADHD. Turns out these kind of mood symptoms are commonly caused by narcolepsy, but my doctors assumed my sleepiness was a result of having these mood disorders. No matter what medication I took, the sleepiness would not go away and the depression, anxiety, and lack of focus continued. I gained about 30 pounds from the inactivity, my grades took a deep dive, my social life was dying because I had no energy to go out with friends, and I didn’t even have the energy to take care of myself or clean up my house because I would fall asleep all the time. I had many breakdowns about it and when I finally did go to a doctor seeking answers about this daytime sleepiness, between having to wait for appointments to see my doctors and waiting for insurance to approve things, I was finally diagnosed after 10 months of actively seeking this diagnosis (go to my comments and see one I wrote about an MSLT if you want more details about the diagnosing process). I suffered with narcolepsy for about 3 years before being put on the right medication. It really has changed my quality of life and now even though I experience some tiredness during the day (around 4pm and 2 hours after waking up, of course) I am able to actually fight off sleep and power through, which is something I didn’t even know was possible. I’m looking to lose the weight, get my grades back on track, and finally rebuild my life from the destruction that the mood symptoms caused. It hasn’t been easy and it seemed to come out of left field, but I am relieved there is treatment for what most people don’t realize is a debilitating condition.(Sorry this is long I know, hope I helped :P)
somerandomintp [info] Same here. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I'm quite sure some other stuff is going on in my mind... I started smoking weed with friends, but as soon as I began smoking alone I too discovered how much I love it. I absolutely relate to "accessing the thought channel of god" and being addicted to this kinda state of mind. But I started having quite weird thoughts recently. A few weeks ago I was convinced that my best buddy died or that my best friend secretly hates me and that she has secret intentions with/against me. I also started hallucinating when I'm sober which concerns me a little, but I always know that the stuff I'm seeing/hearing isn't real - probably pseudo hallucinations...
nebulaebattle [info] Not all doctors will take the medication route.  And honestly, that may be better for you.  You are still really young.  Finding a schedule/routine that  works for you, talking to a therapist, adjusting sleep schedule, and adjusting the food you take in may all help.  I’m 21 now, but when I was 16, I was diagnosed with depression.  I’ve tried a couple different meds, but I stopped most of them after a couple months because they don’t help.  In my case, they made me feel really ditzy, or my stomach would ache for days.  I wouldn’t be able to eat.  I just say this because when I was 16, I thought meds would change everything. But I now realize that meds only “enhance” YOU to be better. The meds won’t do anything but harm if you aren’t ready to commit your self to being the happiest you.  You can get passed your depression.  Try to love your self.  (It’s hard for me every day)  Clean your space really well.  Clean your sheets and some comfy clothing into the wash.  Wipe down mirrors, computers, Tv. Pick out an outfit for school for the next day. Think about how your days actually go vs your expectations. Take a nice long shower, really pay attention to inbetween your toes, your inner thighs, behind your ears.  Don’t just bubble up and lean on the shower wall.  Live in the moment. Really pay attention to how it feels to clean your self. I always “meditate” before a shower.  I try to imagine all of the negative feelings I have coming up to my skin from my bones. When I shower, I just wash them away.  You can do it. I believe in you.  
9kindsofpie [info] My mind is also on overdrive all the time and drinking made it slow down for a time. I have long suspected another underlying issue such as ADD, and I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past.  I have often felt like I can be more productive with a lot of the busywork that my job requires when I'm slightly hungover. However, managing the "right" amount of alcohol was a lot of mental energy, and I was never guaranteed to keep it to a reasonable amount (4-6 drinks, yikes). I'm also slower witted when I'm hungover and, as I age, my body isn't recovering like it used to. FWIW I have only ever vomited from drinking a handful of times in my life, despite heavy drinking for 10+ years cumulatively. I've heard that if you suffer less repercussions from drinking, you're more likely to develop a drinking problem. For me, the downsides of drinking far outweigh the very few "benefits".
jaxxtar [info] Yeah, I've been diagnosed with depression
yayabongocat [info] That's the thing...I live in a small town in India and having a mental disorder is like the worst thing that can happen to youI still remember if there would be any news of anyone suffering from depression my parents and the whole neighborhood would start talking about it... not in a bad way of course but like what would have been wrong, maybe he was being abused, maybe he was under pressure and all. One guy in my neighborhood also killed himself because of stress...im pretty sure he was not depressed but how the people made it to beIn my case I'm not suffering from these things at all... In fact, I'm afraid to die but the fact that if I'm diagnosed with depression how it's gonna change my ongoing normal life and moreover the life of people around me scares me
donotforgett [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14. My Nan knew I was going to the doctors but she didn’t know what for so my mum (who also has depression) said, “Let’s just say, like mother, like daughter.” And my Nan started crying and said, “Dear God, she’s pregnant!” Mum was a bit offended to say the least haha! 
shanadowa [info] We where both in the army when we first met. He was drunk and hanct recovered from being dumped like last weeks trash after being engaged for two years.I wasn't of age to drink so I was sobber (I might be able to have been saved some embarrassment for all this if I was) fresh from training and flexing some new found freedom away from a VERY religious home. I was hanging out with my friend and he came over to her barracks room looking to get lucky. He wasn't her type but he was mine and I being in my eerr "soul serching" was let him take me back to my room. Things went as expected til he had a bad case of whisky dick."Well what ever" I thought after he left that morning till he came back that evening to ask me on a date. I said yes becuse that impressed me. I expected him to tuck tail and run but nope. Anyone with that amount of balls deserves another shot. He didn't disapoint that night.We dated for a month befor he shiped to Iraq and I followed a month later. We kept in contact all the time and even worked it to take his break with me where he asked me to marry him.Few weeks later I found out I was pregnant. So his last night before he shiped we didn't have any protection and well...Yeah.And our comander WAS sapposed to test every female the week before and didn't. Failings all around aside that are to many to lost it was a surprise you are 5 months pregnant! And was sent back.Skip forword to when he get back. We get married the week he gets back becuase without it the Army could care less about our relationship and in two months the whole of 4ID is moving states so everyone is going everwhere in a hurry. So a quick trip to the county court whith his NCO and that was our wedding.Went through 2 more deployments with him. Had 2 more kids (all 3 boys if you want a totel) . He ended up re enlisting after we talked about him not doing so. That was a fun day. "Hey hunny, not only am I not getting out but we are not buying the house you have been working on getting the last month becuase we are going to Hawaii. Oh and you will get to bring or 2 kids (at the time) and pets there by yourself becuase they won't have your travel paper work done before I have to be there...." "Umm what?"Like I said only fights caused by a lack of comunacation? He was freaking out becuase it was hard to find a job that did half of what the Army did and he was a young dad, just had a new baby. He was scaredb anyways. I'm sure that would have cuased many a ship to sink if not after I found out I had to give up my cats as he spent their plane ticket money or a rental car so he and his new buddies could go to the beach.But we made it. We made it with his PTSD. Even after I was diagnosed with depression and years later tried to kill myself. We are both broken but without each other we wouldn't be alive.Life has not be kind. We have hard ship after hardship. Big things. Like when he got a herniated disk in his back the Army kicked him out becuase he couldn't make weight. Where we found out that nice big severance bonus he got vanished becuase someone messed up on paper work years back and her was getting paid more then he should have. Even now when we are having to deal with an issue where we sued and never given notice. What do you mean we owe so and so over $12,000?I sit here, can't sleep becuase of stress and anxiety. Broken mentaly and physically from years of not being able to afford either of our meds. Trying to raise a family on minimum wadge.On paper we should not work out. He is intense and trusts no one. Overly paranoid at times. I am more mellow and grounded and a bit too trusting. In short, 2 total opposites with only some shared interests that started dating after a failed 1 night stand. Married after only a year of a long distance relationship. Survived many an obstacle that has broken others. We celebrated 13 years last November and I love him more then that day I said I do.
laceyridley7 [info] That would scare me too! I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder when I was 18. It's been a constant battle ever since. I'll take meds for a few years and be great, but then I'll wean off of them and my symptoms come back. I just don't like pharmaceuticals. They are too harsh on your organs over time and they have horrible side effects. I'll admit that sometimes they are necessary, but if I can get by without using them, I'd rather. I already take Enbrel injections for rheumatoid arthritis, and to me, that is enough crap in my system.
skree418 [info] I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 16. I’ll be 30 in April. So almost half my life.
bitchycatowner [info] I'm happy that you're at a better place now. I definitely have to move forward considering that I have been diagnosed with depression and currently taking antidepressants. It feels good to imagine a life independent of them. 
banni_ [info] I got diagnosed a couple weeks ago at age 20, the psychiatrist gave me a prescription for 10mg methylphenidate (xr) basically right away which I was \*very\* hesitant to take.I'm still not sure how to feel about it, really, however I have to agree with you. I was diagnosed with depression previously and have wasted days of my life for longer than I'd like to admit, upon trying the medication I immediately started getting things done (tidied up my room aswell). I feel less depressed and anxious ontop of everything even when the meds wear off.It's too soon for me to draw a conclusion personally, but I agree with your advice of trying meds!
ToonlinkFTW890 [info] I have been diagnosed with depression. I am on meds, but they aren't helping as much as I would like.
iamtinypotato [info] I was diagnosed with depression at a very young age. Around 11, I think. There were various factors that contributed to it, but depression isn't just caused by something. There never has to be a reason for it, and there isn't always one. That being said, my depression is partly inherited. I have a genetic disposition for it, so I guess I have my relatives to thank for that. I also have had a disability (epilepsy) since I was around two years old. I've had brain injury since I was eleven and depression and disability commonly go hand in hand. Things that have recently contributed to my depression are the death of my aunt in 2017 (she took her life), not having a job, and my current living situation.
IsAAcWeLCh [info] Honestly, and I'll probably be attacked for this, depression is not cutting yourself and attempting suicide. I have been diagnosed with depression and I have never once had a single suicidal thought cross my mind. Life doesn't need to be hard for you to be depressed. You can have a happy life, loving family, supportive friends, a great job, etc and still be depressed. Cutting is pathetic (that's the part that's gonna get me attacked) and suicide is stupid even if you're depressed or not.
amfournda [info] You are being far too defeatist. I was diagnosed with depression years ago too. I submitted my medical application and got a reply from the FAA. They want a bunch of information, but my AME says he definitely expects me to get a class three.I'm going to have to jump through some hoops and prove to the FAA that I'm fit to fly. I honestly expected that and it's fine. I'll do what needs to be done so I can go do the most amazing thing most humans will ever get to do. I think it's worth it, and if you love flying I can't see why you wouldn't be willing to at least try.I'm sorry you are feeling this way, but right now the biggest obstacle to you becoming a pilot appears to be yourself.
paulino1975 [info] Right. Being diagnosed just makes you think that that’s just the way you are and the way you feel isn’t your fault. Even if you are diagnosed it’s very common and usually self-diagnosable. Anxiety is a real thing that everyone has but I can’t bear to use the word anymore because hipster types are just like, “yea I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety.” I get pretty anxious sometimes but I don’t tell my boss I was late to work because I had an “anxiety attack.”
DisappearedAnthony [info] I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed antidepressants. Never came back for more therapy because I don't even know what to ask. I sometimes feel like I'm just in a cage called human body. I have persistent thoughts about having some kind of neurological disorder, so over time I looked at autism, ASPD, bipolar, schizophrenia. I never fit the criteria for these, but I keep coming back to these thoughts.The only real problem I have is being hyperstimulated and apathetic in different times. People just call me smart because I can spit out tonnes of information in seconds, and because I make connections very fast. It's just a manifestation of my hyperactivity though, I'm a pretty average dude aside from that. I depersonalize and derealize as a coping mechanism, it allows me to stay unaffected. Sometimes I would fire up too much about things, then fire up about me firing up, etc. Remaining an observant makes it easier to process life. I can just enjoy thinking, although it does feel like walking on a rope.It all gets worse when I'm apathetic though, then I could slip into depression. I really hope I don't become depressed again. Derealization also helps with that.
Luna320 [info] Thank you , I really hope I can talk to him soon, I need to be careful to try to not get emotional it starts a fight and it's alot harder to get what I actually want across. It becomes alot easier to forget what I wanted to say or say something dumb out of anger. I wanna go into it calmly and know what I want to say. I'll prob have to write out what I want to say since I'm bound to forget something. I hope I can get through because it seems sometimes that it does. I feel like he might take it more seriously if there was a disagnose that fit but I've been diagnosed with depression and general anxiety and those are ones he expects people to get over quickly. Thank you again :)
Anon12109 [info] Thank you for posting this, I feel the same way and reading that was incredibly validating. Here’s 2 top edad stories. Sorry for formatting I use mobile. 1. Finally opened up to edad about how Nmom was treating me and asked to live with him (they’re divorced). He said I can on one condition; that I keep a relationship with Nmom. Uhhh.. okay no thanks.2. Fast forward and living in a different state. Tell edad I’m thinking about moving because the city I live in has a housing crisis, high poverty and segregation. He tells me “It’s not about where you live. You need to make yourself perfect and then you will be happy anywhere”. He lives in a very safe/expensive neighborhood.He’s also told me he and Nmom blamed me for ruining their perfect family when I was diagnosed with depression. Ummm, how many therapists told you my depression was caused by you guys not working on your marital issues?? Nmom is terrible but eDads denial and lack of support is just gross to me.
RuMyster [info] kids have nothing to be depressed about at 14 years old, unless they were raped or abused etc, the amount of people I've known to claim they have depression is just sad, when they aren't. and I do care about people with "legit mental illness" because I'm not a piece of shit, I'm diagnosed with depression so it just annoys me a lot
jenneato [info] Not kidding, the year I was diagnosed with depression I would just lay on the floor and listen to that album start to finish. Sylvia is the song that gets me the most
utterlyuncertain [info] I've been in the same spot for years. I'm now 27 at the same shitty serving job about to be 28. I am skilled in visual arts and only have an associates since everyone tells me it's a waste of money. I'm dating a guy that my entire family dislikes but I dig him but I'm still back and forth with how I feel about our relationship. I've been diagnosed with depression and add recently. I have started gaining weight which is compounding all my issues. I want to be better but I am not sure what to do and I feel like time is slipping away. Do I finish the art degree? Do I start a new degree at age 28? I feel like I have lost who I am. 
WorldWarIIGaming [info] Hello, First time posting here, I have been diagnosed with depression for several years, now doctors think it might be seasonal affect disorder (not sure if that's the right term I don't remember). I have been on medication for about a year and a half now. Enough background, last week a person that I really care about as a friend actually managed to help me. She also has depression but masks it much better and is getting better currently, she actually got through to me and made me feel like someone really cared about me and actually wanted me to start towards a better place. I have started, it's not an easy road at all and I am still in a major pit but at least I am feeling a little better. (I hope I'm doing this right for this subreddits section please let me know if I'm not).
chemisttryy [info] I am a 2w1 and from my personal experience I can say that I kind of become manipulative when I am stressed. It's kind of the last way out.I am diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder and I become a really unhealthy 2 when I feel that I cant cope with my  condition. Also the stress arrow of the two is eight, which is visible in this need of control and aggressiveness. The growth arrow of the 2 is 4, which shows very self aware twos that also nurture themselves However the type 2 is the most generous and selfless of all the types. I have to admit that I have some issues with acknowledging my own needs but I think that if I am not feeling too bad I kind of represent what the two is known for. Others know they can count on me for help and what the people I love need or want is more important than what I need or want.
Loligxp [info] Hey, this feeling that you're faking it can actually be pretty normal, or we are just the same. I too always feel like I'm fake depressed and just too lazy, too stupid and all, but I have been diagnosed with depression.   If you feel like shit most of the time and you relate to these kinda things, don't be scared to seek help from a therapist. Even if it's not depression, your feelings are real and you deserve to feel well, and therapy can help.   I wish you the best.
Leona_K [info] They sent me home to get my medical card and calm down but I have to spent next 2 days in hospital for monitoring. I moved away from my family 1 year ago because they were abusive and tried couldn't handle it anymore. Honestly I don't have anyone else because since I was diagnosed with depression and anorexia everyone started ignoring and avoiding me. I was shocked to see those people cry when I overdosed yesterday so maybe I'll try and reach out to them when I get back to my job. Thanks for caring❤❤
LulaElizabethe [info] I remember an overwhelming emotional response when I had my daughter, but it took months for me to feel a true bond with her and I struggled a lot with PPD. It’s a bit of a long story but I didn’t find out I was pregnant until I was 4 months along. I took plan B hours after the “accident” and bled HEAVILY for a full month, but my little bean was still in there. I took several pregnancy tests because I was experiencing symptoms of pregnancy but they all kept coming out negative. My 7th test was a positive and the next day was confirmed at a free testing clinic. I was 19 and had been assaulted just under 2 years prior and was being quite reckless with drug and alcohol abuse. After I found out I was pregnant, the whole time all I could think about was how my daughter might have health issues because of my poor choices during the first few months when I didn’t know I was pregnant. I felt so guilty and afraid, but when she came out perfectly healthy (and quite big too!) I was overwhelmed with many emotions and remember crying with joy and relief. After that outburst of emotions though, I felt pretty... I guess “numb” can kind of describe it. I loved her but I remember feeling guilty because I was so depressed when other women around me were constantly doting over their newborn. I felt like there was something seriously wrong with me. My daughter will be 7 in January and I love her more than anything. I was diagnosed with depression many years ago along with ptsd and that does make things more difficult but reading things like this and knowing that I wasn’t alone when I didn’t feel that bond always helps reassure me that it’s something that happens to a lot of women and there wasn’t and isn’t anything wrong with me. Sorry for the long comment but I felt like sharing some of my experience. <3
ewokmassacre [info] Yes, definitely. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14.
tonighttheyfall [info] I think the reason I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety was because they were more obvious, as for my anorexia, I am usually at a “healthy” weight so its hard for people to recognize or see that it is something I deal with and I try my best to keep it hidden so that way people, like my parents, wont have to worry more. I dont know why I remember it so vividly, part of me says it was a dream or something, but another part just says its a memory. From what I remember the table was in a little wooden play house and I was also looking at the other kids playing through one of the windows. I from the memory I feel like I felt isolated but I dont know why. It was a mobile game called Kingdoms at War, you could join clans, there was a world chat, you would build your kingdom, all this stuff. I just would sometimes talk to people who were bored in world chat or talk to member of the clan I was in because a lot of them were older than me so I looked up to them.  I feel like it was through that game that I realized I had depression. I have only talked to my sister about our mental health once and it ended badly and I refuse to since. But we did talk about how our parents deal with it isnt the best. Our parents didnt have the best childhood ever. My dad watched his dad kill himself, and my moms family was just a mess. So we feel like that parents cant really understand that our sadness just happens for no reason, and they get frustrated when we cant tell them why we are upset. I remember at one point my dad got angry with me for something he was yelling that he was tired of my “bullshit drama” and he hit me. Since that its been very hard for me to be comfortable around my father. When I send my boyfriend the texts he is usually at work and I feel bad for bothering him but he will try his best to respond and he will ask me whats up or if I am safe and he will call me during his break or when he is on his way home from work. If I am with him he will just hold me or hold my hand and ask if he can do anything and usually I say no, so we will just sit there and watch a show or something or he will make me tea. We have talked before that its really hard to “fix” my sadness and that the best thing to do is just be there so he will do that. Or if I am anxious that I am too upset or too sad or too much of a problem he will reassure me that I am not a problem and that my mental health doesnt make our relationship hard. 
lunamoeller [info] I am so glad to hear that you are getting the help you deserve. Being taken seriously can feel so incredible after years of people doubting you.I never really post anything, but when I got some feedback, it made me cry too haha. I am diagnosed with depression and avpd, so putting myself out there is a RARE occurence.
TheGreatMu [info] Ok so, I was also in the same boat. I was diagnosed with depression but stopped anti depressants about 2 months betore my trip.The trip was very enlightening and fun.If i were to give you advice it would be this:1. Stop anti depressants at least 2 weeks before trip, otherwise you can get serotonin syndrome and possibly have seizures/die.2. Make sure you trip in an environment you trust. I also suggest tripping with someone you can relax around, someone you can be open with.3. Make sure you have the next day free also, when i had my first trip i usually leave a few days as a trip usually has afterglow effects.4. Make sure you are feeling relatively good around when you take it. I have gone against this and taken it recklessly and it was not fun at all...5. Write helpful tips on your hands, like "breathe" "pain is temporary" "i took 200ug acid at 11am". They can help ground you.That's pre much it, at the top of my head at least!If you have any questions let me know bro, happy to help!
sovereign110 [info] I think my "baseline" has gotten worse over time, but I feel better these days than I did when I was younger because I'm actually on treatment.I lived with my dad from the ages of 10-17.  Dad's this sort of moron who doesn't think mental health is a "thing" and it's some kinda pseudoscience.  So despite being a very low-key kid who was drowsy all the time and had rare instances of cataplexy, he didn't give enough of a fuck to take me to any kind of psychiatrist/etc.I was put on an SSRI when I was diagnosed with depression at age 20, and have been on such antidepressants since (I'm 32 now).  Haven't had cataplexy since I was a teenager; it was likely being accidentally treated for a decade before my actual narcolepsy diagnosis.Wasted most of my 20's doing what alcoholics do, and had to drop out of school due to pancreatitis at age 25 (not before totally fucking up my academic record, of course). The daytime fatigue got worse and worse. A neuropsych evaluation confirmed attention deficit when I was 26, and I finally had a couple sleep studies at age 30.  Rapid onset REM and etc. confirmed N, though I was already on effective stimulant medicine for the ADHD.  So symptoms are under control now, though they are definitely worse un-medicated. I just wish the diagnosis came sooner, before the crash and burn, back when I still gave a shit. So it goes.
inadequatepuzzlpiece [info] Hi I am also 24. I have been diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia. Nice to meet you.
Cold_Albatross [info] Thank you for responding. >unless you actually do something to make other dislike youI'm myself. That's reason enough for others. Means I look bitter, serious, angry or depressed. Apparently, society thinks young people shouldn't already look bitter.And if I would smile at the employee that would mean for the layman that I don't have depression anymore and I'm just too lazy or don't want to have a job. Then there's another reason - I seek help from them but I don't get better. Which is like a slap in the face for them. It frustrates them, they get disappointed or angry. >negative self imageI neither hate or like myself. I'm just there, getting feedback from others (doctors and all people who have to deal with me).I'm diagnosed with depression.>know how much negative self image and depression are linked, it's just the experience of depression isn't always as clear as what is typical of it due to the pervasity of it.If I don't fake being normal other people would agree with me that I suck at being a human. That means my experience is actually true.>are you in Australia ?No, I'm from another country
UnderpopulatedPig [info] As someone with an easy job with good pay I find my job to be very meaningless. I’m incredibly bored and just want to quit at times and pursue something else but I can’t because I am the sole provider for my wife, who is a stay at home mom of our two girls. I have been diagnosed with depression before I got married, I don’t know if it’s come back or if it ever went away but I’m seeing myself differently than I use to be and that’s not how I want to be as my daughters grow up. With the stress of living paycheck to paycheck I can’t help feeling like this.These reasons are why I support Andrew Yang! He sees the impact of meaningless jobs, mental health and overall wellbeing. Bernie is cool for wanting a minimum wage increase but I already make more than $15 an hour while my wife makes $0 doing the hard work of raising our kids.  $15 an hour would’ve be good in 2012 or some other time but now it’s time for UBI.
pjuwy [info] My GF of broke up with me after 10 years of relationship. That happened almost 8 months ago. It gets easier in one way, but than again, for this whole time I am looking for something to fill this emptiness inside me that she left. So on the other hand it's unberable and I get hurt every day more and more... Just this evening I had one of the worst depressive episode thus far (and I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for the past 5 years, so that also tells something). There is not some clever advice just sit through it and hope for the best...
Annia12345 [info] I don't get it either.I was diagnosed with depression in high school. A girl I was somewhat friends with was actually mad at me and went around saying I was faking it because I wasn't sad all the time.She constantly talked about her "depression" that hadn't been diagnosed by a doctor and was "sad" all the time.I hid my depression from everyone but my family and a few close friends because I didn't want to attract attention to it. I didn't want people to notice me.It sucks how people do this. There is nothing fun or great about being depressed or having depression.
lemonslip [info] It’s really common.I have immigrant parents who basically worked 3 jobs at my age. Bruh I don’t hear the end of it.Yes my life is significantly better, but it sure as heck isn’t perfect. I once had my father tell me to “just stop being sad” and to “reconnect with god” when I was diagnosed with depression, and then blamed me for my unhappiness. “When I was your age, I did X, Y and Z and I still wanna wasn’t depressed because I had faith in god”It’s okay to be unhappy. No one has it perfect. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
saramajara [info] I mean “good” is relative right? I was trained to be a professional athlete from age 6 to 16. I did not enjoy that. I was gang raped at age 14, I did not enjoy that. I was diagnosed with depression at 14, but had times of happiness in between episodes. When I was 21 a stranger tried to slit my throat and my partner stabbed him a dozen times and went to jail for 7 years for it, and I was left alone, dead broke, without shoes, and in possession of his puppy over 2000 miles from where I knew a sole, without anyone to help, that was not good either. But looking back, the things I experienced and overcame, the connections I made, ect... were freakin awesome compared to what I’ve been feeling the last several years.So I can’t help but feel resentful when you call me lucky, like I had 24 years of bliss. I didn’t. I was just able to manage my depression and trauma, and find moments worth living for and relationships worth thriving for until I was about 24.
haymansafc [info] Before anyone suggests to me "*oh, just change jobs then*"...it needs to be pointed out that like many others here, I have ongoing financial commitments. It's not always as straightforward as walking out of one job and straight into another. I did change jobs nine years ago (give or take a few months) and within months - faced exactly the same problems. Not only that - I also deal with Social Anxiety, which given I deal with, shouldn't come as a surprise. Meeting new people is incredibly difficult. At work, I deal with being 'singled out' on a whole range of things, often the last to know company/business news (proven to be on purpose on a few occasions), stigmatised, mocked, talked about behind my back (which I have had evidence of), misjudged, misunderstood, falsely accused and joked about. Despite all this, working in a relatively social environment which has literally forced me to work on my Social Anxiety (some success, I'll admit), they often wonder why I turn-down offers to go out. On the occasions where I do, I face many of the same issues and made to feel three inches tall. I'm also told, quite often, that near enough everything is my fault, I have to work on myself and only have myself to blame. I listen to advice (often repeated), carry it out, make my best efforts but find it's all for nothing. The situation remains the same at the end of my efforts and then it's merely repeated to me again. It honestly feels as if I'm playing some sort of 'game' of which I simply cannot win. So far, I've been diagnosed with depression on four separate occasions, most people can't figure out why and then roll their eyes when I sink back down into silence, effectively withdrawing from society, within months of coming off medication. If I had considerably more money or a lottery win...basically enough to sustain myself through to retirement...I would quite happily live the life of a hermit. It's certainly the lesser of both evils.
PogothePenguin [info] This is how I feel about 80% of the time. I am diagnosed with depression, but it's more of the lack of feeling. I'm just...living. I understand where you're coming from.  I wouldn't say it's bad, but if you haven't yet, I would talk to a professional. I drug my feet for a long time and she really helped me after a while. I still don't feel feelings and I feel disconnected, but she's helped me come to terms with it so it doesn't weigh me down.
RickMunoz0402 [info] I think the same thing. I was diagnosed with depression last November, but after talking with my therapist from day-to-day, he and I are pretty sure I’ve been depressed for way longer. That makes me think if I have any other undiagnosed issues, and it definitely seems like it.
libelulas3v3n [info] I've struggled with tinnitus since I was 17, the time I was diagnosed with depression. I'm now 24. Honestly, I as well thought I was eventually going to kill myself when it all began. I thought it would never disappear nor get better. Truth is, from e to age of 18 to 24, I didn't notice it. I didn't even remember it. Recently, I became very depressed again, and tinnitus is back. It scared me a lot, since I had almost forgotten about it. I panicked all over again. But I'm trying to get used to it again. There are so many people with this condition that are still able to live their lives. Even me, with more or less struggle. And so will you, believe me. Right now, it's all very new. Eventually, your brain will have no option but to get used to it. Just remember, it's not a threat, you'll be okay.Try to see a doctor. They can help, in case your tinnitus is caused by some underlying condition that may be treatable. There are also hearing aids that can help, if you're eligible. You can search for exercises on the web, that might ease tinnitus.At night, leave the fan on, or a white noise machine. Or even a soft background music, something soothing like rain or other sound of your preference. It will help mask the ringing.Stay strong my friend. We're here for you. Your not alone in this. We all felt like you at once.
Adawg1232 [info] Well that's just not entirely true...  For example, phenibut in most places is not scheduled/illegal and kills anxiety great, almost dangerously so, causing a dependence ridiculously quickly.  Tianeptine, often used for anxiety or depression (which is a horrible usage for it imo because you're gonna feel much more shitty when you get a dependence), is very easily available most places and is basically a full on opioid.  There are millions of example of things that probably should be scheduled and most likely will be in the near future that kill anxiety. And there are also plenty of non dependence forming substances that kill anxiety very well and immediately, like kava, ashwaganda, Magnesium glycinate, etc. But even though these are legal, you should definitely go to a doctor before you put some powder you bought online in your body and develop a full blown addiction or just find that you didn't get the effect you wanted/needed.Imo if you don't have the money to get a benzo or ssri script, or if you're doctor doesn't want to prescribe them due to a personal grudge against them or something(I was diagnosed with depression and a panic and anxiety disorder and my doctor prescribed me ssris for a really long time and every time I told him I didn't get any benefit from them he just either upped the dose or switched to another ssri/snri, but he didn't dare give me benzodiazepines or even something like clonidine or hydroxyzine for whatever reason), then it's fair to consider supplements.  Personally, if I feel a panic attack coming on, I find great relief in this mulungu bark resin extract.
alwayspickingupcrap [info] I was diagnosed with depression for 30 yrs before getting correctly diagnosed with BP2. Over all those years, I thought I was essentially ‘lazy’ and would have ‘weak’ periods when I just gave in to my essential nature (with self loathing). In the in-between times I would ‘pull myself together’ to catch up on my neglected tasks and then work ahead as much as possible to get ahead in prep for my next ‘lazy relapse.’  This was my identity.Maybe with age and exhaustion, the pattern unraveled and now I’m discovering (correctly medicated) I can be someone that I like better.
autumnrowebaby [info] I was diagnosed with depression, bipolar, and PTSD at 18 (very traumatic childhood) and I did great managing it until I was about 25, then it was mainly a struggle. I still managed till I got to be about 33. Now that's the number one thing I struggle with. Trying to get better about it though.
Paws_of_Justice [info] People say Mr Robot is about the grand delusions of its characters but I disagree. Mr Robot is, and has always been, about coping mechanisms.Elliot had dissassociative identity disorder. He fought with his own alternate personalities even though he built them to help him. They are all flawed and make mistakes just like their host. They cannot be smarter than him, they are him. White Rose experienced the trauma of losing her lover due to her environment. She hates her environment and seeks to find a different environment as a result. Elliot created a coping mechanism from within himself to assume control in the real world. White Rose constructed a machine in the outside world that would have solved her problem and let her escape. Elliot hacks people. White Rose hacks time. White Rose's machine is her undertaking, her hard work, and her coping mechanism. Both characters have trauma they are inadequately equipped to deal with. Their coping mechanisms are flawed, and not as effective as they could be.I think this show focuses on mental illness really well and we get to see flawed and broken coping mechanisms of the characters as a result.I am diagnosed with depression and GAD and the show was impactful to me in a way that no other show was.My own coping mechanism hurts my heart, strains my body and despite me knowing how much damage it causes, I don't know how to function otherwise. I have no idea how to have a healthy coping mechanism. I understand Elliot and White Rose having self destructive coping mechanisms. Don't we all?
ReclaimingInsanity [info] Before I was diagnosed with depression and OCD, I found talking about my mental health really scary and hard to accept as well.Like one of the posters above, talking to your doctor about how you're feeling can really help. Writing can really help! On the advice of my consellor I started a diary, and its really helped me cope.
brenna55 [info] No. I was diagnosed with depression. By a doctor. You dont have any say. Stop stalking my posts
elziion [info] I’m a 21 years old lady.Ever since I was little, I was always a kind hearted person that would feel people’s emotions really easily. I grew up with Catholic values, which made me believe to always be kind to each other. There are some values that I refuse. As I got older, I started listening to other’s people spiritualities, and found myself strongly connected to nature, the universe, God, and Ra (I know, it’s weird). My best friend is my soulmate, in a non-romantic way. We connect on very deep levels.So, every since I was a kid, I had always been bullied. For whatever reason. I was the first in my class. I was quiet, and introverted, and shy. I never really bragged, but demonstrated that I could do lots of things, instead. I would always help kids that were struggling, my peers, sang for old people... But since my step father left my mother (my biological father left us when I was 4) I have been diagnosed with depression. It has been 5 years now. My stepfather was my model. He was very observant and would be able to tell, like me, when something was wrong. Sometimes, he was so observant, he would predict possibilities and theories that always turned out to be true. (He called it the Holy Spirit). I developed the same.It caused me mood swings, and eventually all my friends started talking bad about me. I left.They came back a few months later. We apologized, and I started feeling a bit better.Then, I was sexually assaulted by my ex bf. It was three years ago.Ever since my rape, I have been suffering from PTSD, Major Depression Disorder, Anxiety, Suicidal Tendencies, trust issues...I’ve had vivid dreams, sleep paralysis... But, I tried my best not to give up, to hold on, to give myself hopes and dreams...I believed that karma has always had something beautiful for me. And last summer, I met a gentleman. Who treated me well. And because of my mental health, I screwed up. And I saw him recently and he’s emotionally unstable. My best friend is also unsure about my situation, and tonight I told her that I felt like I had no purpose in this world. That I felt empty. That I felt like I didn’t matter...
Yesn1122 [info] I was told, "You arent depressed."After returning home from a doctors visit where I was diagnosed with depression
_Anty_ [info] Sure, I'm diagnosed with depression, eating disorders and social anxiety. I'm very much ready to get rid of all three.And thanks, best 10€ I've ever spent lmao
Thrones1 [info] That is pretty helpful. I downloaded a CBT app to try out. Most everything else I was already pretty versed in but I always appreciate reading through again. Thank you.I think our illnesses are different. I have been diagnosed with depression and not a sleep disorder. The physical exhaustion I’m pretty sure is just a symptom of a low serotonin production. I’m pretty sure that I have BPD after doing some research on it but have yet to speak to a professional. The treatments for it are near identical to depression though so it doesn’t matter too much if I just keep doing my routine of depression relief.
HardgoreAlice [info] Yeah, usually because I am bored. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but it’s somewhat fun.
oxford_serpentine [info] I was too negative for her after I was diagnosed with depressionShe ended the relationship via text message. 
incognitomiscreant [info] What pisses me off is he doesn't know the context behind this. I've been struggling my whole life, I've been diagnosed with depression by multiple professionals over the years. Why can't people just trust that I came to a depression forum to vent *because I have depression* and THAT'S WHY LIFE IS SO HARD FOR ME RIGHT NOW augh I'm so fucking alone
VanillaPupper [info] Hello OP, I often have the same worries. I used to have a toxic friend who made me her emotional vent. Later on, when I was diagnosed with depression, I worried that I would impose the same burden on my current friends. I believe good friends genuinely want to see us become better. They won't mind if we're having an off-day and need to be alone. They won't mind if we need to talk to someone for hours. A close friendship is not all about experiencing the highs together, but also the lows - that's what makes relationships strong. I think the best thing you can do is take active steps to improve your well-being. Listen to their advice - you don't need to follow it, but consider it. Remind them you're grateful for their help. Let them know they can tell you if you're ever being too much to handle and trust that they will communicate this to you if that ever happens. Friendship is reciprocal: check in on them. Be a listener sometimes. If they ever need a friend, be that friend. I think if you do this, it will lessen your feeling of being a burden. I hope I helped!
Unicyclerider [info] As I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety I can relate. Also, my whole life I have not had a decent friend (I'm 30). But don't let that get you down! I can't tell you if life will get better or not, but it will be what you make it (or so I've been told). Don't worry too much about not being in a relationship like everyone else. Take that slow and give it time. You don't want to waste time with someone you think you love (and think they love you) just for them to turn around and betray your trust. Along with that, I didn't have my first relationship until I was 16, who knows, maybe you'll find someone (or they'll find you) before (or after) your birthday. Again, give it time. First, figure out who you are and what you want in life and then go from there. I can understand wanting to be "normal" and not having a mental illness, but (excuse my french) fuck normal! "Normal" people are the ones who make you who you are and you will stand out in the crowned one day! Don't be afraid to cry. Those emotions are just letting you know you are human! Lastly, you want purpose in life? What is it you like to do? What do you want to do when you "grow up?" Start thinking of that know and don't wait until you're 18; 21; 30! At these ages, your depression will get worse if you don't act on them now! Live for you and the rest will come! I hope things start getting better for you and if you ever need to talk or vent, don't be afraid to message me! I will listen and try to help to the best of my abilities! Take care!
Caswerty [info] I'm 17, I've been diagnosed with depression, PTSD and anxiety at the age of 8-9. My dad has to pay for them, and has already been with my psychiatrist and psychologist. He has his own psychologist because he suffers from depression and takes meds, but since I'm a teen he thinks I'm faking it.
hmmmmphhhhhh [info] I was diagnosed with depression in middle school and that’s around the time I started looking for escapes. I self harmed, and had different disordered eating habits. Once I tried drugs I became obsessed with the altered state of consciousness and tried to play my use off as experimentation.
mafiascreation [info] OMG YES!!!! I'm diagnosed with depression as is, so if I don't catch on to the fact that its PMDD time I have a really really hard time dealing with how much more depressed I get.    I'm 28 and was diagnosed around 18.... its been 120 periods, my brain should know better!!! Alas
Kva1234 [info] How can I overcome test anxiety? I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety after my gf tried to kill herself because she tried to blame it on me. Now every time I'm stressed about a test I get anxious. Thanks in advance.
MagpieMelon [info] I agree with you. I also believe that anxiety and depression are symptoms of something being wrong, whether it’s lifestyle or a physical problem, and not just something that people have. I have had anxiety my whole life, I was diagnosed with depression at 21 but had been battling it since 14. I was just very good at hiding it. I was suicidal at 16, and then again at 21. Doctors only ever told me I had depression/was anxious but never gave me a reason why. They tested me for various things and never found anything wrong. It was only when I found out I had celiac disease at 21 that things got better. I’m not saying it was a magical cure, since I still have days where I’m depressed, and I still get anxious. But it’s at a normal level, and is perfectly manageable. It is normal to feel anxious/depressed, what’s not normal is it taking over your life which is what happened to me. People telling me that depression and anxiety were just what I had could have made me stop looking for an answer. And believe me I did want to give up when I was told that this was how it was and antidepressants and therapy were my only options. I went to therapy and I was told o didn’t need to be there because I had no issues that needed fixing, except for undiagnosed celiac disease. I think normalising it to the degree that it has been is very dangerous. It’s not normal to be too scared to pick up a phone or order some food, it’s a sign of something being very wrong. I used to walk into a job that I loved and was very good at, and have a panic attack and be sent home almost everyday. But that stopped once I figured out the problem. It was still hard to go in, and I did still get nervous, but I was able to get through it once I found the problem.
spicybruschetta [info] Nope! I was diagnosed with depression years before it had worsened enough for me to become suicidal.  
PioneerLeviticus [info] I feel your pain. I was diagnosed with depression after my first year of uni and completely fucked my second year by rarely attending and buckling under the pressure of deadlines. I also lied to my parents and told them I was doing well. I even lied to my girlfriend about it.I spoke to my personal tutor about it and he recommended I come clean to my parents and restart the year, so I left in late feb and will be restarting my second year this sept. I feel alot better now that I have a chance to better myself and start again. I'm sorry I know that this won't help you but hopefully it'll be able to help anyone like me who can relate to your situation.I really hope everything goes well for you.
R_Plr42 [info] Anyone can be depressed and it not be easily recognized from an outsiders perspective. A lot of depressive symptoms deal with internal thoughts and monologue that other people may not know about. Can someone seem to have a “perfect” life and still be depressed, absolutely. Just look at all the famous people who have committed suicide from their battles with depression. As far as knowing if you have depression, I was never one to self diagnose. I’d always think to myself “what if I’m faking it” or “what if I make my symptoms seem worse than they are”  “other people have it worse than me.” Then I went to a psychologist and psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with depression. And then a few months later I went to the hospital for suicidal ideations. That was over a year ago and I still doubt myself, I still wonder if I’m faking it, I still tell myself other people have it worse than me and so I have no reason to feel this bad. Even though I wake up everyday and think about how much I want to die, I still have doubts. But that’s just another way for our minds to play tricks on us. Long story short, people who seem to have perfect lives can have depression. And if you’ve done any amount of research on the symptoms of depression and felt you had some do yourself a favor and see a psychologist. Get evaluated. So if you need help you’re able to get it.As a reference; The DSM-V (diagnostic and statistic manual) lists the following and symptoms of and criteria for diagnosis of depression;At least 5 of the following symptoms have to have been present during the same 2-week period (and at least 1 of the symptoms must be diminished interest/pleasure or depressed mood) [2] :Depressed mood: For children and adolescents, this can also be an irritable moodDiminished interest or loss of pleasure in almost all activities (anhedonia)Significant weight change or appetite disturbance: For children, this can be failure to achieve expected weight gainSleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia)Psychomotor agitation or retardationFatigue or loss of energyFeelings of worthlessnessDiminished ability to think or concentrate; indecisivenessRecurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or specific plan for committing suicideHope this helps
jake_1316 [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 12, I resonate with most of what you've described. There are going to be numerous people that don't understand, peers, teachers, your parents, just know that it's not because of anything you've done. All I can offer in the way of advice; prioritize your health, both physical and mental. Do what makes you feel good, keep a healthy sleep schedule and make sure to eat regularly. Everything gets harder if you aren't physically healthy. Given that counseling isn't for you, I suggest journaling. Just as a way to process negative emotion.Hope you're well.
ifookedyouremom [info] I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, honestly today is still somehow the happiest period In my life. I was in a really bad state last night and the depression was definitely higher. But I don’t feel worthless or hopeless, it’s just frustrating to deal with this. Because I really do love her as a friend. And in all honesty I 100% want to keep loving her as my friend. That’s what makes this aggregating, like I said I honestly don’t want a romantic relationship, it’s just more hassle than it’s worth right now. And having feelings that feel inescapable (I know they’re not) is just frustrating to me.
ooga_booga_booger [info] Make sure to get documentation of your illness ASAP and get in contact with the center of disabilities with your school if you feel like you'll need accommodations. It's a lot of hoops to jump through but worth it (if you need it)! I personally did not get accommodations but instead went through extensive CBT and it's starting to be manageable. GET A THERAPIST ASAP! (S)he will help you so much and will help you figure out if you need accommodations or not. From a personal experience, I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, anorexia, and chemical dependency. I went from dropping out of school as an undergrad to undergo rehab and various mental outpatient facilities to getting into four grad schools! You can do it! I am almost certain that you will not be the only one with a mental illness when you're in grad school (a fellow peer of mine also has PTSD). If you choose to talk to your professor about your mental illness, make sure to emphasize how your mental illness can make learning more difficult and ask if they have any advice or additional reading to help bolster your learning. All of my profs have been super understandable as long as they know that you've been doing what you can to keep up with the material. Because i struggled with mental illness, my grades suffered for a year or so, so be sure to mention that in your statement of purpose. I told them how I knew I fucked up but instead of running away, I did what I could to fix my mistakes and move forward. I even called a few schools asking for an interview because what was on the papers (i.e., transcripts) did not accurately reflect on my skills as a potential graduate student. Keep in mind your professors are people too!  Please do NOT think that you are inadequate for grad school just because your brain is wired differently from others. We are all different. You have just as much to contribute to a graduate program as anyone else. Your diagnosis does not define you as a student; your knowledge and desire to learn more will define you as a grad student. If you have any more questions, please PM me. I was in your shoes a year ago and felt beyond discouraged about my future due to my mental illnesses. You CAN do it. I promise. If you don't have a support system, then know you at least have some rando on reddit behind your back 1000%. You might have to put in a bit more work, but it will be BEYOND rewarding. Trust me on that. You totally got this; I have faith in you! :)
texanatheartt [info] Hi. Yes I'm diagnosed with depression and insomnia.
lonelygalaxy_TA [info] You might be treated differently you might not. It depends on the person.For example I was diagnosed with depression, add and anxiety at 14. My mom understood, the rest of my family not so much. However my mom studied Psychology in college so that might be one reason.Its important to have someone to talk to/support you. Mental health is hard but its worse dealing with it alone. If your the mild mannered type then having someone you trust advocate for you is also helpful. Sometimes people like to walk over people with mental illnesses so having an advocate is great.Also its important to take your antidepressants as prescribed. It'll takes a month or so to see if it actually works or if you need to switch to something else. Missing a dose isnt good but if you're the type whose not good with pills/bad memory then talk with your doctor. When i first started I had a hard time remembering to take my pills consistently so my mom had to talk to my doctor about lowering the dosage until i got on a routine. Side effects can be bad for some people but the worst I ever had on antidepressants was change in appetite.Be strong and be educated. The future is brighter then the present. *hugs*
supersaiyanmami [info] All the feels.. Thank you. Their smiles and giggles are the only thing that's keeping me earth side. I try to talk to my mother, but she just doesn't seem to understand my struggles. It's more of "you have kids, quit your bullshit"... Which doesn't help in the slightest and makes me feel more alone. I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, & schitzo. I've always been a negative person and my fiance likes to point out my paranoia as a joke. I also always feel like I'm the problem, they'd be better off without me. I'm always with my children, and it's like pulling teeth to get an hour of silence. I've tried getting into local car clubs, just to get out of the house and because that's something i enjoy, but people seem to be even bigger dickheads out there if your car isn't built to their specific liking.
IndianCasinoEmpire [info] IT does take a while for the chemicals to balance, I was diagnosed with depression too. I didn't use medication because I just felt I needed to find a way to recover on my own (which did make the process longer and probably was a bad move in retrospect but I made it through. I knew quite a few people on medication and it took the serotonin a long time to rebalance. I'd say though, if you are spiraling I'd call someone to come be with you, if that isnt an option then I'd suggest hospital. I've spent time in a psychward too for my own personal saftey. &#x200B;I hate the cliche recommendations of finding new hobbies, get out etc. but its about all there is to do, its what I had to do. I forced myself everyday to do something like read a book, head out, workout. My anxiety isnt fully gone, and I still panic in social situations. Depression sneaks up on me too but its never been to the same extent of nearly completing a suicide attempt of which I have tried three times. When you have times of high energy, clarity, etc while on meds try to switch up routine also set a plan for if things are getting out of hand (wish i did that). &#x200B;Youre not being dumb either, its completely baffling, even recovering is completely weird to me. I didnt even realize I did until recently. You got this though! I believe in you, and reach out to the community if you need help, advice, wish I had more for you but experiment on things; art, blending and brewing your own tea (which I do), writing, yoga, all cliche but sooner or later you'll find your thing to help you through. ALSO DON'T DRINK it makes it worse if youre on meds, my former partner went through some pretty tough times.
smalldoggobigpupper [info] When I was diagnosed with depression at 17, my dad called my mom to tell her my diagnosis. He told me that she said back to him, "Why is she depressed!?! She has this and this...." She also said, "Why is she on these meds!?!"
handyshark [info] You sound a lot like what I’m experiencing right now. I have an appointment with my doctor next week to be screened for ADHD. I do well in school, mostly As. I was diagnosed with depression years ago, along with anxiety. I was able to managed school but nothing else. I switch jobs every couple months, I miss appointments and meetings all the time. But I didn’t really think about ADHD, I thought it was just me being depressed and anxious all the time so I can’t handle my life. Now I’m in my senior year of college and when I look back at my transcript, I realized that I do perfect on classes that don’t have exams and finals. I can never focus on exams and I can barely finish. But for other classes, I managed to spend all my time after school to study and do homework at home, which takes me hours because I keep switching tasks. But I often get it done at some point. At this point, I’m still trying to hold on to my job that I just got 5 months ago. I work in a lab so attention to details is critical. I make mistakes all the time and I’m so afraid they’re gonna fire me because of those careless mistakes.I think the more you need to focus, the more you’ll notice your ADHD symptoms.
inattentiveexecutive [info] I'll go first, with some of my background story.As a kid, I was very disorganized, with  time and in my space, and in school a common thread was that I was  brilliant but that I often got lost in the middle of an exercise  (specially in maths). I was not hyperactive, but I did have a tendency  to daydream and get very distracted in class. My dad's mantra was "if  only you applied yourself a little bit..."During  uni, I had a crisis. I went to the psychologist because I felt  frustrated. I knew I had talents and people kept telling me that I was  very intelligent, but I was incapable of applying myself to something. I  felt like a revved up engine that is not connected to any wheels, with a  lot of potential and little outcome. I was diagnosed with depression,  more specifically with cyclothymia which is a mild type of bipolar  disorder. To be fair, I was indeed depressed, but I always felt like the  depression was an outcome and I wanted to go for the root whatever it  was. I just felt trapped, limited, with a lot of things that I could do,  a lot of things I wanted to do, but with no ability to execute or not  having the opportunities to do so.That  was almost 20 years ago, an it took me about 10 years to overcome my  depression because I declined taking any medication. I was functionally  depressed, I learned to ride the low and high tides of cyclothymia, so I  focused (heh) on understanding myself better, understanding the world,  and figuring out how to cope with my  brain, however it was wired.Nowadays,  and mostly throughout my life in some way or another, I have trouble  following through with anything. I'm much more organized than I ever  was, but my systems break catastrophically once or twice a year,  throwing me into an existential crisis. I have no trouble finding a job,  but I cannot keep one for more than 6 months. My record was 2 years on  the job (on my first job!), but it was a huge drama for the people I was  working with, with constant depression episodes, anxiety issues,  migraines, etc. I've never been fired, but after 6 months I get bored  and start seeing problems everywhere, or just think I need to switch  careers because I really don't like what I'm doing (only to come back to  it a couple of cycles later).I love  reading, but I have trouble reading and I'm a very slow reader. With  non-fiction and academic writing (I tried to follow the academic path) I  have the problem that as I'm reading some article or book, when I'm  just two paragraphs in, my brain starts firing up all sorts of ideas,  finding connections everywhere, and asking me to go deeper into  something or other and just ignoring the piece I'm currently reading.  Obviously, I had to drop out from the academic path because I got  trapped in rabbit hole after rabbit hole and going nowhere. It's still  the most stimulating thing in this world for me, I just have a hard time  staying focused.Living in my head is  just a constant chatter, from morning till night. There is always a  constant thread (more like threads, plural) going on, always coming up  with new ideas. I mostly live up there, even if I'm doing something in  the physical world. In contrast to other people with ADD, I can keep up  with most threads in my head, although I struggle coming down to one of  them. So I can be having a conversation with someone while thinking of  the depths of the universe, and when called on that I have difficulty  remembering exactly what that person told me, but I can remember it  after a minute.I'm a polymath. I'm an  engineer who has also studied social sciences, philosophy, music, design  and many other things. Not out of choice, but because I can't stay in  one area long enough. Engineering is my main skill, the only one I  manage to stick for long. The rest I struggle because I really want to  pursue them, but I cannot fit everything in my life. So I go through  lots of phases where I'm deeply obsessed with something, create plans  for mastery, and then drop it for the next thing. I want to learn  everything, and I want to learn it now.The  worst is that I often feel restless. I might not have to do anything  but my head is asking for action. Sometimes it's cool, it pushes me to  do things and I've achieved a lot of personal goals because of that  drive. But more often I feel paralyzed, wanting to do so many things  that I cannot do just one. Or start doing one only to be attracted to  something else, and then something else. In the worst episodes, it's a  total paralysis and some sort of frustration or anguish, a feeling of  being pulled in all directions at once. I sometimes wake up in the  middle of the night with this feeling, or I'm unable to fall asleep in  the first place.
pretarter81 [info] When I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety
malkie-moon [info] I'm sure there is someone Who cares. And if nobody does care, don't you want to live happily? Maybe travel, have a relationship, go paragliding..?As for the sub full of liars, I can only speak for myself when I'm saying that I have been diagnosed with depression, General anxiety disorder and ocd, But this is just a subreddit for People to seek help and get in contact with others Who May be going through something similar.And if you think that everyone here is only out for attention, why Did you Post anyway? Was it just to make readers feel Bad, that are already having a Bad time?I don't know, maybe it helps you to Talk about your Problems here:/ Luck!
blemishedcucumber [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14 (I'm 25 now) but I missed so much school due to that, so maybe you're dealing with some sort of depression or something? Never hurts to get it checked out if you're able to.
saracore [info] I can completely relate to this. I was diagnosed ADHD as a child and was put on Ritilin from 3rd to 12th grade, made me a full zombie. Then I was diagnosed with depression, then GAD, then eventually bipolar 1. When I got put on lithium, about 2 years in, I started getting the shakes with it. I was going to school to be a veterinarian, and since I couldn't hold my hand still, I had to stop. Even after stopping the lithium now, I still have the tremors and will never be able to achieve my dream of being a vet. It's so hard to come to terms with that, and even harder to find someone who can empathize with this.
HopelessBea [info] I personally told my homeroom teacher that I was diagnosed with depression and she actually became more understanding. She would sometimes ask me how I was doing, but mostly, she was just aware that I was going trough some stuff and she didn't mind if I slept in or sometimes took a day off from school. If you know your teacher is understanding then yea, you should tell her, you don't have to mention hospitalization.
Flashmode1 [info] I have been diagnosed with depression by a MD. It’s not something you around sharing with everyone.
baddast [info] Same as most of the other responses. I was diagnosed with depression.The first good psychiatrist I saw changed my diagnosis to bipolar for two reasons. First he said that the speed I cycle in and out of depression doesn't sound like unipolar depression and second he said that he suspects bipolar because my mood problems started at a very young age.I dunno how true that is though. I've read in a few places that a very early age of onset indicates a chronic illness like bipolar (as opposed to unipolar depression) but I haven't read it in any research articles. Does anyone have any insight on this?
KeepItCool_481 [info] I can relate to a lot of this. I personally have 2 brothers with mild autism (25 and 14 now), but growing up it was mostly just me and my younger, 14 year old brother. We’ve always been a low income family, often times scraping the bottom of the barrel. I have suffered from anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember, (it’s more severe now than when I was younger) and I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago. I feel that my upbringing definitely had a play in my mental health.
DrJoned-15 [info] I'm going to try and say this bluntly but also helpfully and that is that your mom just doesn't get it. My dad had been my idol my whole life, I wanted more than anything to make him proud of me and happy with me to a fault. When it came out I was diagnosed with depression anxiety and bipolar he never looked at me the same. He told me what I deal with everyone goes through and that I was weak for actually feeling it and seeking treatment. There's people out there that have the luxury of being blind to what we go through. They have no idea how hard doing the simplest of tasks can get. But something I've come to realize pretty much in the last hour reading through this thread for the first time is that I'm not alone. We have so many people out there fighting and getting no recognition and I want you to know you aren't alone. My parents have caused a lot of my suicidal thoughts without even knowing. It took me nearly dying in my own house for my dad to recognize it.  I've been on the edge I've been to the furthest reach of it. But I can say being here still and having my life is everything I wanted after I tried.
12086478 [info] My mum broke up with her boyfriend when they were in their early 20s, she had my sister, she couldn't be with him, though she loved him alot.He took the breakup hard and ended up hanging himself behind his family house, his parents found him and a note. The note mentioned my mum, I'm not sure exactly what it said but I know it put the blame on her a little. His family Turned on my mum.Shes never forgiven herself for it, anytime one of us (her kids, there's 5 of us now) talks about suicide, she tells us the story and makes us promise we will never end our lives, that there's always a way to fix things, always somthing good about to happen.I was diagnosed with depression as a teen and she's always been the best with it, always helps,However she's always worried that one day she will go to wake me up and I won't.For that reason, no matter how bad I feel, how hard things get, how miserable life may seem, I will keep going, for my mum, for the person she lost.
swimmerboy5817 [info] Right? I've been diagnosed with depression for almost 6 years, see a therapist every week, a psychiatrist every month, and was even hospitalized for it 18 months ago, yet sometimes I still wonder if I really have depression or I am just a shitty person. 
shortkid113 [info] The weight effects are very different from person to person. Before being diagnosed BP2 I was diagnosed with depression. I was put on SSRIs for over a year. My weight went from normal to -20 pounds to +10 pounds after around a year on one SSRI. Meds can mess with weight, but it varies from person to person. Also, remember you are taking these meds to help you with a serious illness. If a little weight gain or loss is the only problem, maybe learn to be ok with it. It takes time. Most meds will have their ups and downs to them. You should put how your mind and you feel over physical effects like that. Your mind being happy and healthy is more important than physical appearance. Just for info, I'm on welbutrin now after 2 years of trial and error with different meds. I don't have much difference in weight from this med. I have had weight changes with every other med I have taken, but it's well worth it if it might be the one to bring peace and normality back to your life. Although I'm to a point where I would do about anything to have normal thoughts back with a normal mind.
lolidonotknow [info] NTA - I have a similar sleep problem to your husband’s, although admittedly not quite as bad. Ever since late middle school (I’m a college senior now) I would actively avoid going to sleep. I would tell people I’m a night owl/I like to do things late when I know no one will disturb me/I like the quiet. I’d be up til  nearly dawn many nights. I finally saw a psychologist about 3 months ago about some other problems I was having and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, which can affect your sleep. For me, I didn’t realize the real reason I stayed up so late was because the second I wasn’t doing anything my mind would spiral into horrible things. So I would stay up late and try to make myself so tired I would fall asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. I did not realize any of this for over 8 years until my therapist and psychiatrist asked me deeper questions on my sleep problems.  And while I never fell asleep while driving (thanks to anxiety scaring me of if I did), I have driven after being awake for 48 - 72 hours straight on a handful of occasions. I’m not saying your husband has depression or anxiety issues, but along with getting him checked out for a sleep disorder, ask about these as well. Even if he appears to be happy about his life and super chill and not nervous, it can still be a front for what’s actually going on in his head. Not a single friend or family member of mine knew I was depressed or had anxiety. Everyone just said I was irresponsible for staying up so late-so please take him to see a professional. I think the issue is beyond “hey you need to go to sleep”
yeeters-apprentice [info] Thanks, I guess that's one of the things I left out, I'm diagnosed with depression and adhd and take lexapro and adderall for them. They help a bit but this stuff that happened with the girl absolutely destroyed me. She was the first gal I actually liked and she did a 180 on me and cast me aside, and now I'm kind of doing that to my friends. Only, instead of getting popular like her I've become an absolute god at minecraft while still distancing myself from everyone I love and care about. I'm just afraid that college is going to be a repeat of highschool where I'm alone with nobody to talk to or share my experiences with. Hell, if I told anyone any of this in person I'd just be told I'm being a pussy and to suck it up, which is the main reason I've sealed with this shit for so long, I've just tried to suck it up. I'm going to try and start spending time with my good friend again and hopefully that'll motivate me to start talking to people again.
The_Funkefizer [info] Exercise definetely helps me. I have been diagnosed with depression myself and am on anti depressants. I never really exercised untill my depression, but whenever I do I feel better for a while. I find running especially helpfull, I put some music on and push myself to keep on going. I am usually exhausted when I come back, but it gets your dopamine and endorphin levels up so you actually feel better. Works better than any medicine I've tried! 9 out of 10 times I don't feel like it and I really have to push myself. But everytime I go I feel better and it also gives me a feeling that I'm in control of my thoughts.
furrysealions [info] I was diagnosed with depression and was put on anti depressants. I had a couple really bad manic episodes and was checked into a hospital for a while where I was re-diagnosed as Bipolar. I was told that anti depressants made the mania worse and were definitely not for people with bipolar disorder which was the reason why I was going on somewhat of a rampage. ☺️
Moribund42 [info] I am one of these people. I have dysmorphia and feel so strongly that I'm a winged elf/demonic general and that I'm in the wrong place and wrong time. I feel like I should be dead on the battlefield. I've been diagnosed with depression and disassociative identity disorder. I take a handful of medication and have had ECT. My inability to handle reality gets so great sometimes I pull on my hair and scream and cry and harm myself. I've attempted suicide several times and often feel like I can't be saved. It's absolutely maddening, especially when it's so hard to talk about to anyone without being viewed as completely insane or stupid, but it's very real to me. I try so hard to accept reality but just can't do it. I hate the body I'm in, I hate what I see in the mirror. I don't know what will happen to me, I don't know if madness will take me or if I can accept what I really am - no amount of evidence changes this mind that feels so truly to be not human. I have phantom limb syndrome of wings which I can't take away! Laughing at people like us is torturous when we're tortured already... I'm thankful for this question, maybe some understanding can come of it to people who think we make this up for fun or whatever they may believe.
Bluepawsss [info] I'm 17 and have had this feeling for the past 4 days, i'v been through alot in the past years due to the death of a really close family member and moving to high school, these 2 things happened around the same time and they affect me up until now, because of my condition I was put on leave from school, I haven't really has a real friend in a few years which has probably contributed to alot of my issues, thats a breif rundown of my situation. I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and panic disorder
chaseandwin232 [info] Here are some problems with your statements, although I really appreciate you taking the time to put this together. Really, I do. There's nothing in my life that gives me joy anymore. I used to play video games all the time non-stop until like the last month where I've become completely disinterested in them. I'm not satisfied with my guitar playing, but I'm also not getting any better, so that's a dead end as well. The dream I have, ironically, is to play music for a living, but the success of that depends on whether or not people like what I play, and I imagine people don't really want covers of 40 year old songs. And as for my depression, I've been to see 6 therapists and 3 psychiatrists and one outpatient program that includes some of those therapists and one psychiatrist, I'm on 7 different meds, I've been diagnosed with depression, add/adhd, and borderline personality disorder, so that's that
Sh0v3l_Kn1ght [info] I was depressed before the move, and I should have put that in the post. I was diagnosed with depression a few months before she told us about the move. It just made it so much worse and for some reason it's hard for me to take my medication. She knows i'm miserable, and it doesn't make sense to me as to why she would keep saying such things to me. Its ridiculous, and I wish I could figure out why this stuff keeps happening.
KarrieWayne [info] I was diagnosed with depression some years ago and put on medication. It just made it worse and I was on the verge of loosing my husband and thinking of ending my own life. He told me the meds seemed to be making me not give a shit and that's exactly what they was doing. I thought they was helping bc of course they WAS making me not give a shit. But in doing that I was hurting him. A lot. So I stopped taking them and after a year( the time it took to get my brain back to not being dependant on some drug) I was able to put my life somewhat back together. I was able to communicate better with people bc I knew that in order to be happy in life I had to learn to except the things I couldn't change and to taking chances and just be myself. Instead of just keeping my emotions pent up inside I let them out but at a slow rate so to not blow up( to vent I call it) I used to think if there was only a place I could have someone to just listen and let me talk things could be so much better. But there wasn't back then. At the hight of my depression I lost my home and was ready to end it all. The only way I got through it besides my husband was to make myself understand that my depression was coming from in myself. I was making myself depressed bc I felt like my life wasn't what was considered as normal in sociaty. Wasn't what God wanted and had no meaning.  So I decided that I no longer was going to try so hard to fit in. I was just going to do what I felt was right by the 10 comandments and to treat everything in life as I believed god wanted and also that God isn't a way of life but guidelines. I started thinking that if there is a god he only helps those who help themselves. Everything happens for a reason even if the reason isn't for me to benefit or understand. I had to teach myself not to depend on God but on myself. That God is an addiction and a crutch to most people but was not going to be to me anymore. Also that anything the movies and TV had made life out to be was a fairytale and not how ANYBODIES life really was. There are no happy endings waiting around the corner and no light waiting at the end of a tunnel.  It is what it is and if I had the power to change something I didn't like than change it but if I couldn't then except it and move on. Don't dwell on the bad things in life, just let them go. So what if I don't have any friends to hang out with and all people do is make life uncomfortable because of their expectations. I used to worry about what people thought of me and what they said about me. I don't anymore! I don't care and life is so much better for it. If you don't like me, good then that's your problem and you can just stay away from me. I am The one who is important and I am the only one ( besides my husband) I should be making happy. If I get up in the morning  and don't feel like brushing my hair so what! It is my hair and I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks of me bc my hair is a mess. If someone thinks I am ugly then they don't have to look at me. As long as I feel comfortable with myself then that's what I need. And that all we have to look forward to in life is death and to make the best of it before it's gone.  Life is so much less stressful less depressing with this way of thinking for me. I no longer worry about the struggles of the expectations of others. Life is what it is and that's all it is. You get what you put in and if things are not how i want them then only I can change them. No one knows how I feel or do they care. Be me and don't depend on anyone but myself. Make me happy and in doing so I can live. Everyone has their own problems in this life and no matter what I should only care for my own. Just be me😁 life isn't great but oh well it is what it is and if today is bad then there is always tomorrow to hope for. No one really has a pourpose for living we just do. And the only garentee in life is death. So live while you can!
Rhaenysknees [info] I have a couple close friends luckily enough but it just saddens me that no one in my family give a shit, especially when I have been diagnosed with depression and it's not exactly a secret. Plus sitting alone for two hours at your brothers wedding, starring off into the distance and vaguely watching other people dance is usually a good sign imo.
zac_taylor [info] I was diagnosed with depression, PTSD and GAD.
JadeyBear7 [info] Hi there, I'm sorry you're feeling this way, honestly your story eerily echoes my own! However I'm F and now 25, I've just come to tell you it will be OK.I also want to ask if you've ever been to a Dr to speak about your concerns?I was diagnosed with depression and GAD - I am positive that the GAD is a direct result of my upbringing and, like you, being completely invalidated by everyone I trusted. But getting help and advice with mental health is a must for your own health.One thing I'd like you to take away from this comment though is that you are not weak, you may feel it, but the fact that you are still going and also identifying that there is something wrong means you are alot stronger than you realise. You've been able to make it this far, you will make it further. :)And also - if you ever want a private chat to vent I'm always around, I like to try and provide a positive safe space for discussion and venting because I know how hard it can be speaking to reach out to those close to us for fear of ridicule or invalidation 💜
MieczyslawRakowski [info] I was diagnosed with depression and ever since i started taking meds everything is better, talk with your parents you want to talk with a therapist, it will help you, trust me
Kitchen_Moose [info] I'm 14. I was bullied by old classmates last school year. I was diagnosed with depression about two weeks ago. I was discharged from the psychiatric hospital one week ago. I went on a walk about three days ago, and I happened to see them as I passed by. One of them caught up to me on a scooter. Lucky for me, they never liked to be physical, and I knew more than likely I was going to be harassed to try and make me and easy target again. They asked what I'd been doing for the past month. I said "therapy" they asked "Why?" I simply said "depression" They responded with "That shit is fake. grow up." On the bright side, I'm now going to a different school then them, and the kids there seem much nicer.
purpleblah2 [info] Yeah getting immigrant parents to understand mental health issues is hard. I've been through the same song and dance with my mom so many times, that I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety by multiple psychiatrists, that I'm currently on SSRI's, that some things might be difficult for me because of that, and she's just like "Why are you nervous? Just stop being nervous and power through it!"
mustardyellow123 [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 12, and have been medicated since 13. I’m 26 now, and have been hospitalized on two occasions for attempting suicide. I cannot tell you how many therapists/counselors I’ve seen. I think I’m more than sad, but thank you for assuming.
ChaoticBraindead [info] You shouldn't make a be-all end-all excuse as an out for your mind to resolve your cognitive dissonance to justify your actions. I've been diagnosed with depression too, but I'd never use that as an excuse to not do something. That frame of mind even further leads to problems motivating.
timmyunknown [info] I am diagnosed with depression, you going to cart me off even though I was born here?
cursedbymo2 [info] It's not  schizophrenia, doctor said so. It's like my own voice, but of evil me. Yes it wanted me dead so badly, but i resisted and i hear it no more. Voice it's not my problem, it's depression i have now is a problem. I am an vegetable for now, and i'm trying to overcome this state. I was diagnosed with depression with derealization and depersonalization as unusual symptoms but not enough to be diagnosed with anything else including  schizophrenia. this is useless information for you but i'm telling that to prove that i don't have schizophrenia and i will be kicked out of any medical center or any help center. Because i'm not suicidal, not harming anyone, i want to live that life, i have desires and dreams, i just can't achieve them because i am vegetable. Almost anyone will say that i'm doing crap and i need get over it, but i know it's real mental problem but who would recognize that won't help me for free.  I have no idea why i'm telling this, i just want to help myself. I am sorry, because i guess as i said nobody would help me because my problem isn't that serious, so i just wasting everybody's time. Still, i got nothing to do for now.
sanidjain [info] I am diagnosed with depression and social anxiety
alexshldshutup [info] I am actually quick to accept problems too. When I was diagnosed with depression I was just like "okay, that's it then. I do have depression." But until I can know for sure, I'll always doubt myself.You're right, I'm probably not ready to feel better. Every time I display "normal" behaviours I feel like a fraud.
lolliepopp99 [info] I'm 20F, probably should have stated that! I go to college and have a job so it's not like I don't get out and meet people. I struggle with money and time to do things as I am at work/college 6 or 7 days a week mostly. My issue is I am naturally introverted and tend to only have a person or a couple people in my life I am attached to and spending too much time with people other than them makes me tired; also I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I have panic disorder too which makes this more difficult
TastesLikeTongues [info] >Absolute and total copeWhen speaking to uninitiated people, it might help if you explain terms. >The bluepill life probably seems real from your perspective, although behind the scenes, You claimed every man taller than 6'2" fantasizes about killing shorter men. I'm telling you that's just not true. Regardless of whether I have some sort of fantastical dream about romance, women, or human sexuality- you should realize at the very least that belief of yours is literally false. And I doubt I'm the only person taller than 6ft who doesn't want to kill you.>Whites have height and height makes might and might makes right.We live in a world where intelligence is probably more important than height. If you want societal power, and you're reasonably intelligent and work hard, all things being equal, you can get to a position where you'll do well in society- you'll have that "might" you're referring to. You'll be desirable in many respects. And while I do agree that societal conventions, especially those surrounding morality, aren't a product of rational investigation, it seems pretty ill conceived to think its the result of the raw power of height. And ofc. no one denies height plays into attractiveness, but its *a* factor, you could easily make the distinction on interpupillary distance or jawline or nose shape. >The human male caste system is made up of breeders, feeders, and bleeders. The breeders are the apex predators who enslave the feeders and sometimes kill the bleeders for sport. The feeders are average males aka BETA males and they work for and provide for females and the spawns of the breeders. They are the most fearful of chad and the state's intimidation and are the slaves who keep the chad harem/eugenics slave-ciety running. They aren't good enough to be respected and seen as high quality breeding material by women but they aren't ugly enough to be suicidal and nihilistic so they are the perfect slaves because they fear authority and cling to their pitiful lives rather than risk it to escape and become sigmas or die and be set free from their shame. The bleeders are the untermensch, we are killed for sport or kill ourselves or become suicidal and nihilistic "terrorists". Literally lone wolves, they are seen as too weak and sickly for the pack (the cuckolding chad harem of male slavery). Do you have, as I requested, any sort of respected studies published about this phenomenon to rely on? A lot of blackpillers believe this type of stuff, but its largely not in line in with what academics who study human sexuality and relationships believe. >They aren't good enough to be respected and seen as high quality breeding material by women but they aren't ugly enough to be suicidal and nihilistic so they are the perfect slaves because they fear authority and cling to their pitiful lives rather than risk it to escape and become sigmas or die and be set free from their shame. I mean you can be good looking, or at least average and still be suicidal, depressed, etc. I was diagnosed with depression and a host of issues when I was 14 and retroactively told that I was probably depressed even before then. I attempted to take my life several times in my teens, with differing levels of success, and then very recently attempted to do so again. This time I bankrupted myself also. None of this had to do with my romantic woes.And where do asexual people like me exist? Or gay/bi men?>we are killed for sport or kill ourselves or become suicidal and nihilistic "terrorists". In the industrialized world, where are "bleeders" killed for sport? Sure there's serious mental health problems throughout the population, made worse so by the way social media seems to concentrate/reduce interactions, but I can't think of situations where some underclass is killed in any sort of systematized way for the enjoyment of others. There are poor impoverished individuals who serve in the military, there are ghettos where interactions between law enforcement and citizens lead to increased death, etc. but nothing like you've described. >although behind the scenes, all of your non chad friends are getting cheated on or raising the children of other men unknowingly. What's wrong with raising the children of other men? I've dated women who had children with other men. Hell, I'm pretty sure if I ever have a family, asexuality aside, I would prefer to adopt to bringing in children to the world. My life isn't, and most (or at least a significant portion is) people aren't obsessed with sex and the cultivating of future generations that bear their genetic material.>Human sexuality is the root of all evil. All of the evil humans do to other humans is related to sex in some way. I mean I'm shitty sometimes to a person at work or at the store. I'm asexual. Where's the connection? Also, there are far greater moral evils than the stuff humans do to each other. What about environmental damage, non-human animal suffering, etc. A claim that strong and universal is either going to have many exceptions, or its going to be something that's going to be so indirect and diluted that a similar claim could be made about anything. And anyways, that's a pretty poor idea. Better candidates exist, look at moral philosophy if you're interested. Buddhists found the attachment to the ego to the primary source of non-physical suffering. >The only way to have a society where all humans have a reason to live and will be treated with dignity and respect is through guided evolution via the use of artificial wombs, waifubots, genetic modification, transhumanism, and facial surgery. Humans will always be worthless primate scum until we are all asexually reproducing and androgynous. I mean I'm all for transhumanism, but why do you think we're going to be better off in that weird system where we're all some androgynous people using artificial wombs? People are still going to be myopic, ignorant, suffering from cognitive dissonance. All of which suggests that problems in the world ("evil") have their roots outside of sex. And why do you care about reproduction so much? I mean I'm personally an anti-natalist and would be indifferent if life were snuffed out on earth the next day. It seems more like unhealthy vanity to desire to keep the human species existing for the sake of existing. >Until then, we are all born enemies of each other, everyone is a hypocrite, there is no such thing as love, and the blood is on everyone's hands.What is "love" to you and why do you think everyone lacks such a thing? What about platonic love, or the love between friends/family? I'm not a sexual competitor to other men since I'm basically not in the race, but I still love my friends (male/female/etc.). Of course I'm a hypocrite and suffer from moral/epistemic failings, I fail to do many things- but my failings are independent of whether I'm sexually desired by other people. And key is that there's still love. >become suicidal and nihilistic "terrorists". Literally lone wolvesOf interest is that some anti-social mass shooters aren't that ugly. Think of Nikolas Cruz who was responsible for the Stoneman Douglas shooting. He wasn't ugly by any metric. I'd actually say he was reasonably attractive. If you're so concerned about this hierarchy why not go into STEM or Law or some other field where once you pass through its easy to get a relatively well paying job? You'll makeup for your perceived failings by succeeding in that realm. Then you can attract a partner easily enough, you can even go do a paternity test if you're that concerned about raising someone else's child. The problem seems easily resolved.
carleylyn [info] So I'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. But I am not entirely sure I have depression, at least not typical depression. I think my low moods are from a poor ability to self-regulate because of the ADHD. I'll get SO EXTREMELY HELLA SAD and suicidal for like, a day, max two days, then be okay again. I think it's ADHD mood swings to an extreme. Antidepressants still help with the anxiety though so, whatever they wanna diagnose me with is fine.
Angel_ofthe_Odd [info] This is Absolutely very similar to my life. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with depression, put on a medication for it that I have to say works wonderfully w no side effects, diagnosed with high blood pressure caused by anxiety and stress now on daily med (no heart disease or high cholesterol in actuality I’ve got amazing cholesterol levels) all because of the high amounts of never ending up and down cycles of BM and her need for trying to recruit me and my DH as her company to her misery we are not responsible for.
BlueImmigrant [info] I totally get you! I was diagnosed with depression at 4 years old, my parents flipped out and never took me to another psychiatrist again. Because in their mind i wasn't "mentally deranged", i was just spoiled and ungrateful. 20 years later, they are still caught in the same discourse. I love them, but they are pathetic, especially since there is a history of mental illness in my family.Our parents will probably never change their ways. But we can be different from them and learn from their mistakes.
hellawhitegirl [info] I haven't been to the gym since Wednesday and, since they implemented the changes, I wasn't able to get into the class I signed up for 3 weeks ago. Anyways, I workout for my mental health. Going to OTF makes me feel better. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. The only thing that works, other than popping a pill, is my workout. So I look forward to it.Yesterday I could tell I was needing a workout because I started getting stressed and irritable. I ran about 2 miles around our local soccer pitch and realized I can't run outdoors anymore. I was able to get 16 splat points but it took so much. I also woke up this morning with an awful pain in my calves. I used to run outdoors but then got runners knee.So, now I am depressed because if they do close the gym down, I will have no other outlet to take out my anxiety and depression. Running outdoors killed me. I could always buy equipment but it seems like a waste of money if I am already paying the unlimited at the gym.So basically what I want to say is coronavirus sucks. I am sorry to everyone who is put out by it, have lost loved ones, etc.
mostly_ok_now [info] I knew I had PTSD years before I was officially diagnosed. Originally I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. A year into seeing this new Psychiatrist the topic of my trauma came up and I just broke down. I guess I had mentioned the incident in passing but didn't outwardly show how badly it affected me (and my trauma wasn't something as black and white as sexual abuse) so he didn't pick up on it initially. 
balooni [info] Similar story to yours. I went to a Catholic school up until high school; granted, it wasn’t a wealthy school at all (decently poor sadly, I love everyone at that school.) so all the kids were down to Earth and cool. I was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia when I was around 14 and it just really made me start to question the idea of “God is testing your strength.” I can see how people believe that, but from my viewpoint I just can’t imagine an almighty being, who can control everything, allowing mental illness, physical illness, poverty, murder, etc to be so common. It just doesn’t make sense to me at all. Crazy how similar some peoples experiences are. 
Ylong [info] I have been diagnosed with depression recently and i have been taking medication for maybe close to 2 months.although it is just helping a little.you can use medisave to pay for your consultation if you are diagnosed with major depression.(if im not wrong) 
Sarahsota [info] I'm diagnosed with depression and gender Dysphoria but I think I'm coping, I honestly really feel "existentially happy", but I figured I'd respond anyway.1. No, even when nothing requires my attention my mind is racing. It's not constant self hatred anymore though, it's that my mind has very loud mental music going on in there all the time. It's so loud and I really dislike it but at least it's not thoughts of suicide2. Dissatisfied. I'm transgender, so if I had to choose if I was born into this life, I would choose not to be born.3. Usually just the music, I'm not the best person to ask because I'm a music major, so my homework is usually practicing and that's much more involved than just pen and paper homework. In fact, while I'm working in the practice room, my mind is usually quiet. For my music theory homework, it's sometimes the chords I'm writing, or it's quiet.4. Depends. I don't look forward to waking up exactly. I have to get up at 7:30 every day and I have class and practice until 9:30 pm. But I do look forward to the experiences I'll have the next day.
TravelingAunt [info] I was diagnosed with depression and bi-polar 2 about 20 years ago and only about a year ago I was told I had ADHD. I didn't believe my new psychiatrist but then after talking to my therapist I'd had for over a year she said she agreed and reminded me she had said that too upon our first meeting. I'm also irritable but not hyper. I'm stressed out constantly and I am always thinking about all the things I need to do but everytime I'm tested i'm super low on anxiety, but am highly stressed. Well it turns out it's ADHD. The more I talke about it and research it i'm starting to agree. After 20 years it's still new so i'm not 100% convinced but I am not denying it anymore.
tendaga [info] Bullshit. Meds can be well over 25%. In highschool I was diagnosed with depression. Turns out it was bipolar disorder. Until I was properly medicated no amount of effort could pull me out of the hole. Saying it's all about your effort is in a sense victim blaming, it's saying that if they only worked a little harder they'd feel better and that's a crock of shit. Mental illness isn't something you just will away through your own efforts.
iminviolethill [info] Well, my diagnosis changed through the years. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 7 or 8.... Until I became a teenager and mentally I became worse, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and later with bipolar disorder II.Even though mentally I am not doing well I'm still thankful I have a job and I have a decent social life tho
HeUlMi [info] I am diagnosed with depression and my school literally doesn't give a shit but if some girl everyone cares. Take my upvote.
johnlime3301 [info] Finished 3rd year here. I'm so tempted to say yes, but I am diagnosed with depression, and it's up to the point where I am taking a medical break next semester. I'll probably only be able to see your posts in 3rd person.  My main field is reinforcement learning. I have implemented Diversity Is All You Need and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) via PyTorch, one of which is in a public repo and have recently made a video about (this pretty much sums up my understanding of the field).PPO Implementation: [https://github.com/johnlime/rlkit\_extension](https://github.com/johnlime/rlkit_extension)  Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8rPgVFsGgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8rPgVFsGgU)  I have also attended a complex learning lab for 1.5 years, where we mainly covered Strogatz' nonlinear dynamics and chaos. Not sure if that'll mean anything here though...
krahe7 [info] This. So much this. You don’t even have to be touching him if he fights back in it. Just being in the same room nearby can be good. I was in a really dark place before I was diagnosed with depression and I pushed everyone away. But deep in my heart I wanted that warmth of someone being with me. I wanted that person to show that they cared enough to ignore me and be there with me. They didn’t have to be focused on me or talking to me. Just the fact that they would have the care to sit by me and be on their phone and be available would have meant the world to me.
Tayasos [info] I have been diagnosed with depression for 7 years now. At the moment, it's pretty well-managed, though. My meds work great, and I'm not anywhere near how bad I was a little over a year ago. Even at my worst, my sleep was never like this. It's never been great even as a young kid, but it's never been this bad.
xz03yx [info] I've always felt like this. Even before I was diagnosed with depression. My psychologist thinks it's more a symptom of anxiety. For some reason, your brain sees laughter as a red-flag, so reacts negatively. Probably due to bad experiences in the past? I know that's why I do it. I'm currently working on changing my "primitive thinking" (that's what the psychologist calls it) and relearning my behaviours. It's hard but worth it.
AxeGirlAries [info] Hey, I know our body stats aren't the same but our situation is. I'm a 23 year old college student & since June of last year when I took a trip to Portland OR I've been slowly gaining back over half the weight I lost. My flair is now a lie. I am currently maintaining at 165 lb. At one point my lowest was 139. That was a dream. Its been 3 years. And every year around the holidays I derail until May because I have important birthdays in February, March, & April. I was diagnosed with depression a while back. In fact it was depression that kick-started my weight loss. At one point I was so miserable I was thinking about ways to die. I considered going without food or water. One of my biggest points of depression was that I considered myself extremely ugly. Down to my facial structure. So one day 3 of me attempting to starve myself to death I had a thought. "You know. This isn't going to work. You're going to pass out at some point & someone's going to take you to the hospital. They're going to stick an IV in you & undo it all." And then I thought "this time is going to pass regardless of what I do, & even eating doesn't make me feel better anymore. If I'm going to continue suffering I might as well just make it that little bit more worse & try to diet." A week later I downloaded Lifesum & ever since that day I've been doing my best. One of the greatest changes of my life came from my depression. I was at rock bottom & I turned it around. I think we can do this. Lets remember why we started, what pushed us to change in the first place, & keep going. Even if we mess up, that's okay. There's always tomorrow.
FuzzyLittleBunnies [info] I was diagnosed with depression and put on prosaic about 10 years ago. Fast forward to now. My depression is the worst it's ever been. I'm just waiting to get my shotgun back from a friend so I can end it. I don't think it's clinical. But I'm fucking depressed.
TheOriginalFuckface [info] Started angry and I want to explain myself.I am diagnosed with depression.I know exactly what I am talking about here because I go through it every day.However you cannot possibly fathom how it feels.People often chalk it up to being sad but that is far from it.Believe me you can be depressed while being happy.For example I like to think I like playing video games(just 1 example).However ,at the same time it feels like a chore to play ANY games.Being depressed is(in my experience)being tired of all the things that you.Eventually you start hating them.But you still do it.Because change seems even worse.And you end up hating yourself.But sooner or later you start accepting this is how it is going to be.By doing this you start pushing away everyone that tries to make you feel better because you perceive it as change.And then you cry because you want to change but also do not want to.Makes sense?Of course it fucking doesn't.None of it makes any sense.Not even to you.If it doesn't make sense to you how can it make sense to someone else?You cannot understand why someone commits suicide.Because they most likely do not understand it fully either.But when someone commits suicide it is never one thing that made them do it.Things add up and in the end matter even if you and I do not.In the end you stop caring at all.Not one bit.This is how you continue to live.If you can actually calk it a life I guess.And that leads to either a miserable life or suicide.You either don't care so you continue living or you don't care so you end it all.By that point anyone stops caring about so called consequences.Why bother?I chose the first option.Life is miserable and hopeless(no reason we should go into that)and your friend chose the second.You think he made a mistake?Just a matter of perspective. I have never heard of someone coming back from depression and lead a happy life.You can sustain yourself at most and breathe air.Either way you put it someone suffers.Better them than him.That's the only answer there is to his suicide.
thedumplingthief [info] I was diagnosed with depression  and have been taking medication for it. My pi knows about this but does not know the degree to which this impacts my sleep. I fell asleep at 8am and overslept a 11am meeting...
makkkz [info] I second this advice. Before I was diagnosed with depression, I was playing life in hard mode. Evertything was super difficult to do, even showering and brushing my teeth. After I started treatment, everything just seem easier and doable. Nothing changed in my routine, I did.
Nunyabz7 [info] I hear ya. I also feel like I've been this way forever. I was diagnosed with depression at age 12 or 13 and I'm about to turn 34. That's almost 22 fucking years. Jesus fucking Christ. I'm sick of feeling this way and it will never end unless i kill myself.
LadyOfAvalon83 [info] I was diagnosed with depression and several years later it turned out to be thyroid cancer.
mindkingdom [info] Not sure whether I really get it or not..I've been diagnosed with depression and suffer from it, but this image doesn't really represent my experiences. The "falling" part is so weird to me and really makes me uncomfortable. No hate.
dreadfulpenny81 [info] My mom used to tell me to "just suck it up" but then when I was suicidal in November 2016 and ended up in the ER. After that I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and she finally understood it wasn't me being dramatic or something.I hope you're able to find a solution that works in your favor. Good luck!
ba6ee5a [info] It’s normal. After I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety it took me awhile to feel contempt with the idea that my feelings are valid even when others dismiss its validity.Accepting your diagnosis is part of the healing processMuch love! And good luck
lilspertx [info] I've honestly helped alot of people through depression and heartbreaks and I'm now starting to realise that nobody's helped me (yeah I was diagnosed with depression in 3rd grade and it hasn't gone away) I've been alone most my life and it really sucks being bullied because everyone sees how you get picked on and laugh at you instead of helping and I honestly feel like I should stand up for myself so I'm practicing MMA because whenever a girl I like sees me getting picked on laughs at me it really hurts. and honestly I just wanna stop being so lonely.
whatisallthis27 [info] I've had bad PMS for years. Later when I was diagnosed with depression, I realized that I felt down all the time, but felt way too worse during PMS. I have recovered from depression, but my PMS is still there, but not as bad as it used to be. I was deficient in a lot of nutrients (mainly B and D vitamins) which apparently cause these imbalances. There is no definitive answer to your question. There are two things you should do - have balanced meals and exercise and if you can, contact a therapist. When I went to doctors for the first time about my PMS, they also suggested therapy. If you are working somewhere, check if your firm offers employee assistance programs. You can avail them for free. Other than that, track your mood. Everyday. Keep a journal. See how you are doing and then you can get an idea from there.
Sasa2110 [info] My aunt has schizophrenia and my cousin has severe depression, another cousin suffers from mental illness too but his fami doesn't understand that, so he doesn't have a proper treatment. I grown up hearing their families complained that how it's tired and annoying taking care of them. So since I was diagnosed with depression I never told anyone because I don't want my family get into that position. I'm going down really quick. My therapist already that this is a serious problem and I'm in danger, It's not overacting. But I still cannot believe it...
NontransferableChug [info] I know. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety myself and I don't think I'm much of an asshole. I mean I have my moments but don't we all?
soolnov [info] I felt like a failure. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, OCD. I was diagnosed when I was in high school, and I had seen my doctor in the middle of the school day, so my parents planned to take me back to school afterwards. All I could do was cry, and I begged my parents to take me home and let me take the day off.I felt lonely, overwhelmed, and like a failure. My boyfriend is the opposite of me when it comes to anxiety, so he never understood how to help. I just felt lonelier (I still do sometimes because of his lack of ability to understand).After finding this subreddit and receiving support from so many strangers from my smallest victories and even helping others feeling the same way, I’ve felt happier than I ever have before.It’s so nice knowing that people face the same strange fears every single day and the presence of this subreddit on my worst days just makes me stronger.
finalproject [info] My uncle committed suicide after battling depression. It was only revealed to me after I was diagnosed with depression as well.
mjp141r [info] I was diagnosed with depression in the 90s. It was basically the equivalent of being diagnosed with HIV—especially in the black community. When I went to the hospital for my first suicide attempt, my mother lied to my school. My school treated me like shit. I didn’t realize I had rights. No, life is not fair. That is actually an illusion. It’s a myth that the American media tries to sell the American public while it fucks us over. People like us are working to make the world MORE fair. I know it’s frustrating. I’m really sorry that thirty years later, it hasn’t gotten much better. But at least it’s been more normalized and we have forums like this. I would have killed for this in the 90s. What would you like to see more of in your experience?
unlistedartist000 [info] I had seen a DBT therapist back when I was like 12-13 or so. I went to this place called Northwest Passage in western wisconsin and that shit changed my life. It's basically an inpatient program for troubled kids. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ocd, and the main one- ASD, and as soon as I was diagnosed I went right into almost daily therapy. It was fucking amazing. I will definitely look for someone that specializes in CBT.
manicmidland [info] I've been dealing with depression for a long time.  My pre-teen and teenage years were really tough.  I thought it was a teenager phase, by the end of my teens I was diagnosed with depression.  Time does pass by fast, so make sure you enjoy each day as much as you can.  There will always be things we don't like to do, but that is life, do them and enjoy the time you get to choose your activities.  Over the years I have good periods and dark periods. Get exercise (helps with chemicals in brain) talk to parents, research what works and what could work.  I use a light box as mine gets worse in winter.  Look at your thinking process it plays a part as well.I hope that helps a bit.
franczerberg [info] Well when I was diagnosed with depression my mother denied it a lot and was very afraid of the psychiatrist putting me on antidepressants. Maybe Sue felt that same sense of denial? Given how she sorta doesn't hold Dylan to the same accountability of what happened as much as she does Eric, I would imagine her also thinking "No not my Dylan,  not my child".
ChronicNull [info] I feel like this would be a good thing to talk about with her. Also, we're not all given the same circumstances in life. You never know, maybe her parents put her through school, maybe she was raised in a better home that encouraged her to achieve what she has achieved. &#x200B;People with mental health issues \*can\* be genetically predisposed (like people with bipolar disorders), but the main cause for mental health illness is the environment that we grow up in. It's not our fault that we have these disorders, and we can't help that we feel the way that we do. As children we are at the mercy of our parents and our environment; we can't help but to be shaped by these factors in our lives that we \*didn't\* choose. All we can do as adults is try to make something out of it.&#x200B;I'm a nursing student, and in my psych clinical the art therapist said something that will always stick with me. She randomly gave each of the patients a big sheet of paper with half of an image printed onto it, and she made them draw the other half. Throughout the session she said "In life we are all given circumstances that we didn't choose, but we have to make something out of it." That hit me so hard, because no one knows that I am diagnosed with depression, and in that time I felt like one of the patients. &#x200B;You are taking the right steps (by going to therapy) to better yourself and make something out of your life. There are people in their 40's that are in the same nursing class as me, and I'm 21 so I got that going for me. Everyone has their own pace in life. It's not about what you accomplish for others, it's about what you accomplish for yourself and what that means to \*YOU\*. You are still so young, you have so much potential. I believe in you!
SpeakLiesFakeASmile [info] Thank you for sharing your story. First I want to say, I hope you are taking your own advice and trying to get better as well. I know it's hard, even though I'm only young, I'm 16. I was diagnosed with depression at 4, after I told my mom I want to die. Since then I constantly have suicidal thoughts. I haven't gotten help since primary, simply because I see no point in it. But your post, together with some other saying the same message are motivating me to seek mental help. I'm still trying to figure everything out with psychologists and so on, but it's a start. Thank you. You are a lovely person. ❤️
indig0ismfl0w [info] Hey! I got the honor to experience dmt at 14. I was essentially on my own for years due to neglect. I even was taught how to make DMT very young, so I had stockpiles. For your question, I personally think it will ABSOLUTELY help depression. Depression never really goes away.. but dmt will definitely have you believing that love is all that is. It's almost undeniable that light & happiness is in your reach already when intertwined with that chemical. After I smoked it for the first time I was a totally different person. I was excited, finally about life in general. I even understood math with more clarity. I had more clarity overall.I would suggest, do not over do it. This will make everything you experience essentially less sacred, in my opinion. I am diagnosed with depression and panic anxiety disorder. Dmt definitely helped my will to live again. I struggle still, that won't ever go away permanently. I almost messed myself up bad trying to make that happen for a while. Take what you will from it and let the healing start. ❤️ 
BunBun_96 [info] I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and C-PTSD. I need to talk about how I feel but I hate when people are worried for me, it makes me feel like shit. So instead of plainly stating how I feel I make a joke about it. This way I'm letting things out without having people freaking out.
keysarecool [info] No I have bi polar disorder and depression. I was diagnosed with depression due to PTSD at a young age, the bi polar disorder and manic episodes came a lot later in life. Tried to take my own life a couple of times and have done a lot of self harming. I cant really remember the way my doctor explained it to me when I asked the same question.
Unapologetic_infidel [info] I find this depressing if true. For the religious, that is. I'm an atheist and I have been diagnosed with depression but it has absolutely nothing to do with my lack of religious beliefs. Religion is the  ultimate scam. You get promised something nice but won't get it or even know if the offer wasn't a scam until you die. That's truly f* up and needs to be stopped. Religion is like fake ads on the internet and would not in any way help with my depression.
kikil980 [info] Hey I also was going through a really rough time when I was 12. I wasn’t diagnosed with ADHD until this year (I’m 18 now), but I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 12. I self harmed and attempted suicide once. 12 is already a very weird time for kids without mental disorders due to hormones changing, but it’s even worse with other mental health issues going on at the same time. I know it’s hard to have hope, but eventually you’ll find the right therapy, coping, and medication to handle all of this and you’ll be so happy that you stuck through it all. 
TheVectorEffect [info] I have been diagnosed with depression, my previous 2 medicines did nothing, and I can't tell with this new one because of what's going on. She helped me better than any therapist has, and even if she didn't I still miss her because I care about her. All this taught me that people you care about can leave you at any time and that fact has made me hesitant to make new friends because I know I won't be able to take something like this again, and that's assuming I can ever move on from my best friend. I've started having huge trust issues and I feel I should be wary of everyone around me. That fact that I've made this post is ironic in itself.I'm no stranger to suicide, I've tried and failed a couple times. The last time I tried I swore I wouldn't kill myself as long as my parents are around. But when they pass, I'm not going to waste a single second being alive. But even that's a long time from now, and I don't know how to manage till then.
lilmzmetalhead [info] I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety first. I have fibromyalgia due to three separate car accidents over the last ten years of my life, which were ALWAYS caused by the other driver. I have a spinal fusion from the first accident and I was able to work through the "mourning" of my normalcy through my therapist. However, fibromyalgia is now the biggest trigger of my depression and anxiety. I can handle my non-chronic pain triggers just fine now. Fibromyalgia feeds into the mental issues, then the mental issues make the pain worse. It's an endless cycle of BS.
ecosine [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 14 and always equated myself to the stereotype. I’m 19 now and STILL trying to accept the fact that I’m mentally ill. Work with yourself, you got this.
breakfastandbrunch [info] I started a very mild antidepressent a couple months after I was diagnosed with depression. Prior to that, it didn't even occur to me or my parents that I had depression, even though I had spiraled the past couple years to a nearly non-functional state where every action I took was a severely misguided attempt to relieve the symptoms and just live through that day. My therapist suggested I find a psychiatrist to discuss medication, and I was so desperate at the time to just not feel what I was feeling that I went against my initial reaction of 'hell no' and gave it a chance. I'm so grateful I did. It was enough to tone down the really severe lows, so I would recommend at least discussing it on a precursory level with a doctor, even if you decide the risks outweigh the potential benefits. 
GlitterTomahawk [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 12, it never got better even with treatment until I was diagnosed and treated for PCOS, my psychiatrist has my diagnosis code as something like “major depressive disorder secondary to a physical condition” because he so strongly believes the PCOS is the root of the depression.
zephyrlilly [info] When I was in college I had the same issue. I did go there with my best friend and we were roommates but we had a few issues in the very beginning. What I did, and I’m not saying to do this if you’re uncomfortable, was join a club because everyone suggested it as a great way to make great friends. I joined it and didn’t have that spark, it wasn’t until my second year, after my friend couldn’t continue school, that I found someone I clicked with due to the club. But I felt like shit during the first year because of that club and all the drama between one girl and the rest of the team. (it was a women’s ice hockey team). My friend also joined the women’s rugby club and experienced similar feelings.College was a shit time for me, I didn’t even finish. That was when I was diagnosed with depression for the first time and bipolar disorder when I left.
AllReason_NoExcuse [info] And good luck to you. Well, I'm fairly confused as to my case. It began with the doctor suspecting bipolar and sending me off to specialists. While there, I was eventually diagnosed with ADHD, but I felt there was something else, something darker if you will, and so I continued going to the specialist and well after a good while I was diagnosed with depression in addition. But antidepressants made me even more depressed so the next suggestion was BP. I tried lithium but it made my stomach hurt to much so I quit before knowing if there was/would be any effect. Then much later it was suggested I try Lamictal which I'm now on, and quit antidepressants. And things are... better I suppose. At least my mood seems to swing less often and it feels like I now have a "default mood" if you know what I mean.&#x200B;ANYWAY, \*then\* I'm moved to a different specialist (the fifth in three years) who is a psychologist (my first) and now the talk is all about anxiety, and I wonder whether this psychologist thinks it's just anxiety, all of it, or if the thought is that I have anxiety in addition to everything else, or whether this person doesn't actually "Believe" in ADHD (kinda sounds like it) and that ADHD is nothing but a description of other mental processes/disorders jumbled together. Gah.To confuse me a little bit more there was also mentioned the possiblity I could be suffering from BPD. &#x200B;I've told them all that I don't really care what I have or don't have, I just want to feel better. But I have to wonder what's going on with me, lol. ADHD, depression, BP, BPD, anxiety.. gah. I really had to fight for the right to try Lamictal though, because they didn't want to acknowledge the possibility of BP3 (cyclothymia? not sure) because it wasn't  "official".
Sean123Ryan [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 18 and didn’t really do anything about it (apart from drink, smoke and snort everything in site) for 11 years.I’m 29 now and my biggest advice is to stop wasting time and get help. Talking therapy has been my biggest win. Speaking to someone completely impartial and medically trained to deal with people like us is a game changer. Don’t ever feel like it’s a burden on people because I’m sure if your best friend came to you with a problem, you wouldn’t take it as a burden.Surround yourself with decent people, don’t do anything that will make you hate yourself and be open minded. There’s all sorts of things to try. Yoga, meditation, medication, therapist, mindfulness, group therapy. Don’t let the illness win. Kick it in the balls and be a winner yourself
SoggerBean [info] I was relieved that it actually had a name and that I wasn't imagining things. I suffer from depression (bipolar) and also have ADD. The ADD wasn't diagnosed until about 10 years after I was diagnosed with depression.
bookislandgirl [info] Just wanted to say a word. I am skinny yes. I never ever dieted in my life, never exercised, only went for walks because I had to, I was diagnosed with depression at 17 yrs old and taking TONS of meds a day. Yes I do have good genes. But do you know what else I got? I bet you don’t. No one is 100% healthy 100% doesn’t exist. You think skinny people who look like models and lift and do all the woork... and those who are skinny because of their genes don’t have other body problems to worry about? Privileged?This is nuts. Pls don’t think I’m being rude, I am trying to prove to you that all that glitters is not gold.  
Boxers10 [info] You have described high functioning depression to a "T". I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago after a life time of wondering what was wrong with me. It is hard to put on the face every day...a lot of days I just come home and crash, BUT there are good days...just enough to keep me pushing. It was a relief for me to find a doctor that listened to me. It was hard hearing you have "Depression with fear" and the big one was when therapist updated it to "Depression and passive suicidal"...BUT it does get better so hang in there you know what is going on and can work on it. I hope you are younger than me when I found help at 55.
jifjif212 [info] Suicide is too inconvenient for me, there’s really no good way to do it, so until they make one i’m staying alive.Anyway, odds are, someone really cares about you man. I used to think this way, but after it got bad, i finally told my mom, and went and got help. Ever since I was diagnosed with depression, and given proper treatment, i’ve felt so much better and had much less suicidal thoughts.Onto the funeral thing, that is something i often imagined. One night i even planned my funeral on an iNote called “if i die before i get to live”.I highly recommend  if you’re truly feeling like committing suicide, or calling one of those hotlines (i did the text one once, it was pretty okay).
buitestaander [info] My logs look the same and I'm diagnosed with depression
summerserenade7 [info] I'm so glad you're investing the time in your mental health and seeing these doctors, they will help so much in your journey to self-awareness. I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety from the age of eight, and your symptoms sound very similar to what I go through. However, I seemed to be resistant to antidepressants, and after coming off my meds for a year I decided to go back to therapy and a psychiatrist and got a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Apparently no one, including myself, never realized my "up" days weren't just days without depression, they were manic episodes. Some days I was superwoman, and other days I was the grim reaper. I thought my superhero days were just days when I felt like everyone else, all the happy people. I figured functioning people felt like that all the time. My anxiety has progressed into paranoia and agoraphobia. I'm glad that you have a passion for writing because this has been my biggest outlet in fighting my disorder. I think you may have a mild chemical imbalance and that an antidepressant might work well for you, with some cognitive behavioral therapy in combination so you can reconstruct your thought patterns. I wish the best for you, it sounds like you're moving towards a fresh start.
5tupid_weirdo [info] Therapy and medication is a big deal for me. I was diagnosed with depression and chronic anxiety when I was 18- but only because I was legal age to actually go to a psychiatrist without the consent of my parents. I've been suffering from this s*it for at least 10 years now. My advice is: try to stay focused on the little accomplishments, stuff like getting out of bed, going for a walk, drinking water, taking meds. Also my life improved a lot when I got a cat- she just cheers my life sooo much. Also I really got into cooking because I used to eat quick and depressing meals, now I try to make something healthy and tasty and it makes me feel better.Maybe you should try a new hobby, something easy and not super challenging?
snorton034 [info] I am diagnosed with depression and it definitely gets worse when my pain starts to increase.  I have been so frustrated with the number of things I can't do or the things I do that significantly increase my pain.  You are not alone in feeling depressed.  Pain takes a HUGE toll on your mood, your mental stamina, and physical stamina. I hope things get better for you, and that you are able to get the help you need.
3267631315 [info] Our feelings are real; they exist regardless of whether we can justify them.  And knowledge of the reasons for our feelings is *not* one of the diagnostic criteria for clinical depression.  I was diagnosed with depression more than 20 years ago, but it’s only been within the past 5 years or so that that I’ve gained some understanding of its root causes.  I wasn’t aware of them earlier because I had *depressed* them to a level that was “beneath” (i.e. beyond) my conscious awareness at the time, but stored in my body. If it’d been me in your shoes, I would have wanted my friend to listen with an open heart and mind, acknowledge that they didn’t understand what it’s like to be depressed, and ask me open-ended questions in an attempt to better understand my experience.  I also would have wanted them to validate my feelings, which wouldn’t require them to understand or “agree” with them.  I would have felt angry, frustrated & hurt by your friend’s actual response. The fact that your friend hasn’t experienced depression does *not* lead me to conclude they’re “right”, but rather that their opinion re: the matter should be taken with a grain of salt due to their limited experience & knowledge. Finally, your questioning whether you “deserve” to consider yourself depressed and feeling concerned that you’re “cheating” and might just be lazy is what I’d call a hallmark of depression in and of itself! That’s part of what sucks so much about it. May you be as kind to/gentle with yourself as possible. 
randomcarrotaf [info] Yes! I always knew biological kids was nothing i wanted. I felt pretty strongly against IVF my entire life because ive always been a huge supporter of adoption, and i wanted to adopt for as long as i can remember (i think i should add here that i am lesbian, i also dont like the idea of just getting knocked up by a random guy)I always dreamt of adopting a girl, maybe age 8 or 10, from orphanages or refugee camps. The thought of children growing up without a home, without a place of their own, without parents they can rely on in institutions they are shoved into with other children scared the shit out of me when i was a child and i wanted nothing but to help them. I asked my parents about adoption even when i was in kindergarten already and i knew a bunch of things, such as that older children have a harder time finding someone. The Disney film "the rescuers" basically was the last thing i needed to know that i want to adopt a girl that age.When i grew older i realized how badly i behave around children, how i have 0 tolerance for tantrums etc. I was diagnosed with depression and either an attention disorder or dissociation and now i don't trust myself enough how to take care of even myself... also financially it is an issue because so far i had a hard time working regular full time hours - last time i almost ended up in psych ward (almost because they were full and therefore decided that my suicide attempt didn't count as one...), so how i will be able to live financially is nothing i can tell.It still sticks with me that i want to adopt children, and that i dont want to watch them suffer... on the one had, my dream would be being a housewife and caring for those children, giving them what i can, but also it would be an absolute nightmare.
skelefuk [info] because those aren't symptoms of their ptsd they have those psychiatric disorders outside of ptsd. They don't stop being disorders just because you develop a disorder that has depression and anxiety as symptoms. For an example, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and a few years later I developed a severe eating disorder. Eating disorders have depression and anxiety as symptoms but that's not the main part of the disorder and if I were to completely recover from the disorder I would still have depression and anxiety therefore why would my diagnosis change just because eating disorders come with those symptoms as well. Also the anxiety and depression that come with something like ptsd or an eating disorder is different than actual depressive or anxiety disorders.
chef-boy-par-ty [info] I never precisely related it to depression but that would make sense. I have the fluctuating feelings of superiority and inferiority; and it's in the periods of inferiority that I feel deserving of misery. I've got so many mental health concerns that are untreated. I'm diagnosed with depression and I'm certain I must have a personality disorder. It's just untenable living in my current state of flux. How do you cope? 
cassiefinnerty [info] It's not always something external that creates depression, however it can be, I definitely think you should check out youth and adolescent depression resources there is a tonne online or in books, it might help you widen your knowledge on this topic. I get what your saying, it doesn't seem to make sense they are just youths how could they be depressed, in comparison to someone a bit older who has lived through more difficulties, which is in my opinion sad to even think about, but I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 12, and am 28 now. It isn't what's happened in my life Its how my behavioural and emotional response structure of my brain works or well doesn't work sometimes that led to that diagnosis.
AcrossTheSkye [info] 13 years ago I was diagnosed with depression. It took 10 years and several doctors before one asked me how I felt when I'm not depressed and then dug into that for quite a while and then said I think those are bipolar symptoms. It never once crossed my mind because I didn't know about hypomania and the irritable state that can come along with it.
sukaretta [info] The thing is, I’ve been clinically depressed before (about 4-5 years ago, my psychiatrist prescribed me Zoloft and everything worked itself out), so I know exactly how it feels to be truly depressed. This is fairly different than it was back then. I still attend classes regularly (I used to skip classes for 3 semesters straight then), I now have better relationship with my parents, a much healthier coping mechanism, no more outwardly destructive thoughts—quite a turnaround than when I was diagnosed with depression. But now you got me wondering, is it possible for depression to recur just because you haven’t been taking any antidepressants, even without experiencing a significant emotional event?
imlegitcrying [info] They’re kinda,,, they don’t like change at all. They treat me differently than they did before I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, like I’m delicate. I’m afraid that they’ll treat me weirdly
KenozGG [info] Take care of yourself first.  Get healthy and plan for your future.  College nowadays is being able to network.  I am a very awkward person who does not socialize very much so I never took advantage of college life.  I started to head into a depressive state my last year of high school.  Then it carried over to college where I isolated myself and missed out on a lot of stuff.  My first year I was kicked out for failing my classes, went back home and started community College, finished a semester then went back into the same college where I failed again.  Lived in the same neighborhood and went to the community College.  Failed, semester after semester.  I moved back to my parents house where I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, taking medication, have been hospitalized once, finished a program at the local community College.   If you can, learn from your mistakes, I'm just realizing this myself.  We all have struggles.  Get the help you need.Thank you for sharing your story.  You are not the only one who has failed in college.  Learn and don't be ashamed.
TechnicalConclusion0 [info] I have no idea. I once spent an awesome evening with the people I like most. Just general talking, banter, games, all the fun stuff. But about half an hour after it ended late in the evening I was already thinking of killing myself.  Now, months later, I was diagnosed with depression and I'm taking meds. They haven't worked so far.
mixtape2000 [info] im so sorry that you lost your mom. Im only 19, and my mom is my best friend and I don't even want to imagine loosing her. After my grandfather died, I went through the same thing. I completely isolated myself from my friends, and family, and I lost a few of my friends in the process. I feel the exact same way. It's almost like you're having an out of body experience. You feel that you aren't in control anymore, and that someone has just taken over. I don't know if anyone can truly feel happy, but I pray and hope that you find the peace and strength that brings you close to it. I have really bad anxiety, and I was diagnosed with depression last summer. Therapy has been my life saver. Talking to someone who is non-partial and a professional really helped me form strategies that I can use incase my anxiety gets really bad. I hope that therapy can bring you the same.
InvisibilityPowers [info] I've been experiencing the "waking up" feeling for most of my life. "Normal" is a kind of foggy I'm-probably-awake-but-I-could-be-dreaming feeling, and when I "wake up," everything feels vivid and real, which is usually unsettling and sometimes downright terrifying. It's usually very brief, but has happened multiple times over the past couple hours, while I've been here and on PTSD subs.And I just blanked out. Lost my train of thought.I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 18 by a professional I'd talked to for maybe 10 minutes. *blanks out*I've been on medication since, but am starting to think maybe I didn't get the right diagnosis. I'm nearly 40 now.My point being, you make sense. I know the feeling. I think that was my point.
V1nCLeeU [info] This was waaay back in 2002 when I was 16-17 so things could be different now.Anyway, my mom took me there for consultation and I was diagnosed with depression. Just like with clinics in hospitals you just have to go there, sign up for consultation, then wait for your turn. I think usually 2 or 3 psychiatrists are scheduled to handle patients each day.What happens is you go into a room/clinic with the psychiatrist and you just talk to him/her and tell the doctor what's happening to you, how are you feeling, etc. I think there are standard questions psychiatrists have to ask you for them to determine your condition. In my case, my doctor asked how long have I've been feeling this, have I considered suicide, etc. No couches, unlike what we usually in Hollywood movies. (I was kind of disappointed about this part, hehe). I just sat in front of my doctor while I talked to her. I would cry at some points. At one point she would also call in my mom so she could talk to her while I was there. I would say those sessions are a mix of probing and counseling sessions.  I was then prescribed to take Zoloft to treat my depression. I would estimate my treatment probably lasted 10 months to almost a year, which included taking the medicine and a visit to the clinic every other month if I remember correctly. It went well, I got well but I can't say that the depression has completely gone away. Every few years I feel like my depression always comes back, especially in times of stress (unemployment, death of a loved one).
NaomiKatyr [info] I have been diagnosed with depression and Anxiety, and I am like that often.Might be like that.
Amyishida [info] The conversation with my mom when I told her I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety was a hard one. Aside from the fact that we 1) never talk about feelings, 2) Asian culture where we don't talk about mental illness or feelings, the first thing she said after I told her was, "What did I do wrong?"It broke my heart. All you can do is say she didn't do anything and it's just an illness like any other. No one can be blamed for a cold or a broken leg (most of the time). It took her some time to come around but I think the guilt and self-blame definitely played into it. Agreed with everything you said about just making sure you surround yourself with people that support you. Be open and honest about how you feel and what you need. Give them some time if that is what is needed too.
CaptainMrBucket [info] I am diagnosed with depression and GAD and take medication best I can tell you is to keep moving forward. It is hard as fuck I can understand but no one said it was going to be easy. Mental illness is important so make sure you take care of you.Your brain is going to fuck with you consistently. It is an internal struggle I understand but no one deserves to be or feel alone.
amanda1o12 [info] This is great! I feel like you could be talking about me! I was diagnosed with depression and then I got PTSD. After my assault I turned to food for comfort. That was a year and a half ago. I finally realized it was time. In other words, I understand how difficult it can be but it’s amazing what you’re doing :)
Evrlastingbeauti [info] Stress from Mom can absolutely hurt the baby. And how can you properly take care of yourself physically if you can't take care of yourself mentally as well? The risk to baby from anti-depressants is minimal. The risk to your health is not. You want to be the best Mom you can be? Take care of yourself, body and mind. Crying at your desk, in your car, etc. isn't healthy. The stress can and will hurt the baby. I have been diagnosed with depression since I was 4. I only started treatment after a suicide attempt at 15, and that I didn't to l do consistently until I was in my mid twenties. It's taken me years and tons of work to get to the point where I can truly say that I know I must take care of myself first. If I'm running on empty, I can't help anyone else, least of all my child. I'm on three different anti-depressants as well as going to therapy weekly. I've talked with my psychiatrist's, my OB, and a genetic counselor about my meds and possible effects they might maybe have on baby. Low birth weight and possible 'withdrawal' are the worst; and the chance of either is so small. With today's medical advancements and the fact that I'm planning on nursing, I'm not worried about either of these. Please, please, please, from someone who had not taken care of herself in the past and knows what is like, please take the medication prescribed to you. You would not have been prescribed medication without reason. Please take care of yourself and in so doing take care of baby. Feel free to msg me if you want. We are here for you.
jdkyles [info] This could be a passive ideation of suicidal thoughts. I thought the same way when I was diagnosed with depression.
wischmopp [info] Thank you for your advice! I've already tried therapy but was extremely unsatisfied with my therapist. I'm diagnosed with depression and bulimia and he didn't seem to know anything about these illnesses. To "cure" my Bulimia, he just told me that I look good and don't need to worry about my weight and that I should "eat in moderation instead of binging and purging" (lol if it only was that easy). For my depression, he recommended exercise even though I told him ONE SESSION AGO that I compulsively overexercise because of my bulimia. In addition, he sometimes just didn't show up for a session without notifying me. So yeah, that didn't really work out...I've been trying to find a new therapist but that's REALLY hard in my city. I've been on several waiting lists for more than six months now.
Kris10NC [info] I'm in that same boat.  I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety by the time I hit puberty, but only found out I had ADHD in my 30's. (Female and grew up in the 90's, go figure)Have you tried talking to your Dr. about it?
All_Tree_All_Shade [info] You can be depressed without having clinical depression. Just like you can be anxious without having anxiety as a disorder. I get being annoyed when folks actually use medical terms as jokes, ie "this triggers my ocd" etc, but depression and anxiety were both known emotions before being classified as mental illnesses. And yes, I have been diagnosed with depression.
rmariejenkins [info] I strongly relate to what you're experiencing. I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder 9 years ago, but occasionally there would be weeks I felt invincible — like I could be involved in a horrific traffic incident and emerge unscathed — and I was a complete arrogant prick. I knew there was something not being addressed by my current medication and therapy techniques, so I approached my doctor about the possibility of bipolar disorder. I recently got a prescription for mood stabilizers and haven't experienced a manic phase for 2 months. I encourage you to discuss the possibility with your docto
super_g_man2 [info] It went quite well. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I felt a bit bad about lying about my sh, but I was scared about her telling my parents. I'm going to try and stop now anyway. Hopefully the meds work
cajunqueen929 [info] They say you are born with it but as a kid I don't remember being "anxious" but I look back at a lot of issues I had and problems I dealt with as a kid and realize I actually was anxious. I didn't have my first panic attack until college which is when I actually realized I had anxiety. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 15. Now being almost 30 I feel as though my anxiety has only gotten worse due to "adulting" and it's so hard! I am trying to find anything and everything to get better.
kyaluna [info]  I was diagnosed with depression at age 13 so you never know if "moody" is more than it seems.
tamingjackie [info] It seems you've been at least partly diagnosed. Maybe you also have some kind of personality disorder. Depression is not rational. Whether you have reason or not. A personality disorder like borderline or narcissism could be the explanation of some the attention seeking behavior. Maybe get a second opinion on a further diagnosis. I have had several of these thoughts before I was diagnosed with depression and then borderline. Denial is normal. As soon as you can understand what you're working with though, then you can work on changing some of your unhealthy behaviors. I mean none of this as an insult. You could very well be misdiagnosed, and I could be projecting. I would still suggest a second opinion I'm that case, though. 
Chrisrawraw [info] I'm sorry. Please message me if you want someone to just message. I want things to be made right for you. How old are you? Are you old enough to get a job and see a therapist?Just want to make a joke, your parents and my parents should meet up. I was diagnosed with depression and they still don't believe me.
sch0f13ld [info] Yeah me too. I can easily make and hold eye contact, I do have pretty proficient social skills (I think?), I don’t compulsively stim or fidget, and sometimes I doubt if I have sensory issues at all. The only reason I’m diagnosed at all is because I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but they didn’t seem to be getting much better despite therapy and medication.
Safe_Hands [info] Hi, sure. I'm 22, my reason for going is because I'm running out of money soon and I need to either get treatment for my emotional numbness (I confused this with emotional detachment in OP) so I can become functional enough to work, or to get a diagnosis that'll allow me to apply for disability benefits. The method of diagnosis was just talking with my psychiatrist, got diagnosed in second session (not sure exactly what you're asking). I'm unsure about comorbidity. I've been diagnosed with depression, that's it.
Freshhly93 [info] I’ve never seen anything that truly represents or relates to how I was as a kid.I was constantly sick or “sick”. I always had a stomachache but never knew why & it also happened a lot before school. I was constantly physically drained almost everyday. Didn’t want to participate in school, school activities or any activities actually. I was separated from friends and family. I was diagnosed with depression around the age of 8 because of a traumatic experience I had with the way my grandmother died, and that was also around the same time my mother became a alcoholic. I was never fully diagnosed with anxiety til around 15-16. I always wondered why. Why I was different, why I was always sick or in pain, why I was always scared, why it would  always come out of nowhere during certain times.Not until my adult years did I actually realize that it also had something to do with anxiety. It was just my body’s way of expressing it and I never knew how to communicate it because I didn’t even know what it was at that time.I thank you for posting this article, it truly speaks wonders and puts things into a new perspective for those who always wondered “why” and for parents to think outside the box at times when their child says “I have a stomachache” for the last couple weeks even after going to the doctors.
MaceNow [info] I've been diagnosed with depression. Just because I believe it's a disease, that doesn't mean that I don't also believe that there are positive actions one can take to alleviate the symptoms of depression. It's both - it's a disease, and it's also a daily choice. Tiredness... lethargy... poor habits: these things can be regulated through force of action. Are these things much harder to do by a person who has depression? Yes. That's true. We face challenges that others don't. But we're all facing something. This is our cross to bear, and how we bear it.. is up to us.
peachy_4 [info] She could have an undiagnosed disorder!!!Over a year ago, I cheated on my current boyfriend, and when he found out, I "realized" what I did. It took a long time and a lot of effort on both parts to make the relationship work again, but now, everything is perfect. It sounds like your wife is seriously remorseful about her actions, and that's why I say this. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but have recently found that I have bpd. It's not an excuse, and what I did will never be ok, but it has helped me understand some of the reasoning behind it.
Inasss [info] I've been diagnosed with depression and the major causes as per the therapy sessions are my disturbed self-identity and emotionally abusive childhood. The problem with the self-image made me lose all purpose in life to the point of being suicidal.I don't think it would be right to not call it depression because you have a self-identity problem, I think if you do have the symptoms of depression the you have depression, the reason is something you will discover step by step.It's been 6 months for me, and 4 months in we have uncovered a personality disorder that I was keeping hidden really well because I always show a strong and resilient persona but when I allowed myself to be vulnerable everything unfurled and we were able to take on a different approach in therapy.I was like you, started out feeling in control of 90% of what goes on with my life and just needed help controlling my sad feelings, but then as we went on, I discovered that I am emotionally immature in some aspects without me noticing it. It gets me down sometimes because discovering emotional shortcomings only makes me think worse of myself, more than I already do due to the depression. You'll figure everything out with your therapist, just keep going every week and see where it leads you.
weegeekus [info] Hi there, I really feel for you and well done for progressing so far with the DBT and making a real difference to your life.I was diagnosed with depression when I was fifteen (I definitely had it right through childhood). I wasn't diagnosed with BPD until I was in my thirties (although I had that from adolescence). They are absolutely two separate things. With BPD most get depressive moods, while they may feel similar to depression they are generally more transient and are part of the mood swings (of course this varies widely between individuals). In general depression is more long term and is accompanied by other symptoms (appetite loss, sleep disturbance etc.). It is very confusing when the symptoms overlap so much. It is also likely that the causes of the two conditions are different too. To be honest there is a huge amount of overlap between different mental health diagnoses and it can be hard to make sense of it when you're trying to deal with it all. I found this article that may help explain further http://bpd.about.com/od/relatedconditions/a/Bpd-And-Depression.htmBasically, yes, they are two different things, you can have both and it's very common to have both. Do you think you may go to see another doctor about the depression symptoms?
HeavenlyEthereal [info] There’s been a few times. When I suffered a lot of loss at 17 and was sleeping all day everyday. I also cried over everything, I knew something was going on. I was diagnosed with depression When I was 19, I was dating my bf and realized that a lot of my insecurities from my previous relationship were brought into my new one. We fought a lot and I realized a lot of it was irrational. I didn’t want to hurt the person I was with because I was so deeply hurt from my ex. I worked on my anxiety here.And then when I was 22. I moved to a new city for grad school. I had these weird feelings of just being so lost and feeling lost in life. I couldn’t grasp everything around me and all my feelings. It’s an very odd feeling. I’m actually still in therapy with the same therapist. I’m working on depression, anxiety, and overall life transitionsSince I’ve had depression for awhile and can recognize when I’m not doing well, I know to take action! But otherwise it’s because I just feel off or I realize a lot of issues from my past are stopping me from moving forward!
Ickplant [info] You are so right. I was diagnosed with depression, then anxiety, then bipolar, then ADD. Finally found a therapist who asked about childhood trauma, then told me that instead of having a smorgasbord of psychiatric disorders, I had shitty parents and school bullies. Everything clicked that day, the day I started the loooong journey to recovery from CPTSD.
suedecubs [info] I feel the same way. I was diagnosed with depression and the friends who I thought were going to be there for me weren’t, but rather people I had known for like a year than my best friends who I had known for five. It’s kinda hard because I’m still young and in school and I had just slowly isolated myself after trying to reach out and reach for help and the effort wasn’t reciprocated, or their response just sounded like they didn’t really care or it was just a half assed, back hand response. It’s lonely too, but I would rather put my effort into those who do the same, and I guess I’m at that age where I start having to be picky about the friendships and relationships that I foster. It’s kind of the part of growing up that I had forgotten and it makes me pretty sad. When I think my depression drove me away from my friends, I remember how much closer it bought me to my family so maybe it was just my friends. I do think it is growth. When we’re at a place when we actually need them we see beyond just fun times together. I sincerely wish the best for you though. I’m glad you can find positivity and enlightenment in something so many people would find terrifying and jarring.
ash4459 [info] You're the third person I've said this to this thread, but it needs to be said: I've been diagnosed with depression, and I'm honestly not sure if these types of comments would make me attempt suicide again.  I literally cannnot process toxicity in the same way as normal people.So please, think of people like me when discussing how to deal with toxic behavior.  Just because you can shrug it off doesn't mean everyone can.
me_maradona_elvis [info] So glad to hear you’re on the right track to figure stuff out. Since I was a child, I have always been the happy go lucky kinda guy who’s not afraid to make a fool out of myself and just be fun, but that’s all an exterior. The past 6 months has been the hardest period of my life without question. I was diagnosed with depression, had to take a lot of time out of work and have been attending therapy weekly to try and sort myself out. Thankfully it’s been working really well for me. I hope therapy works for you too but just remember that it might not always seem like it is at the time. I wish that I could have shared my experiences with people like Ben who were silently suffering too and maybe it would have inspired him to take the same steps that people like you and I are taking. As the latest Enjoi Instagram post says “if sharing with the whole world that Ben took his life means it starts a conversation somewhere, and that, that conversation saves a life, then I can’t help but think that all of us losing Ben isn’t all in vain.” Let’s be open with people about our darkest times.
kumawo [info] I go to a psychiatrist, I've been diagnosed with depression and ptsd, but my medication doesn't help me, I feel very odd, I attempted suicide twice, so I think I should be dead, I just feel very confused, I forget stuff, whenever I say something, people scream at me, and I just don't understand why
cablespinach [info] Hey, no problem. Maybe it would help if you talked to him and let him know what you're going through. Explain how you feel you might be taking out your frustration on the relationship, and I'm sure it's possible for you to work things out once he understands what it's been like. As for the therapy, I've been there too. I was diagnosed with depression four years ago, and I kept going to therapy without experiencing significant improvement for a long time because my mother didn't want me to take medication. I went through a number of tough relapses over the past couple years, so we decided it was time to give medication a chance, and it has worked pretty well. Talk to your therapist; maybe she can recommend a different treatment that can help you feel better. 
ChubbyBubba91 [info] I've been taking it with no Ill effects. I am diagnosed with depression. Why combine with methylcobalamin?
countastrotacos [info] Yes. I have been diagnosed with depression 3 years ago. This of course has ruined my confidence with women. As well as my looks.
spottieottie93 [info] I had this exact same breakdown when I was younger. I have vivid memories of doing everything that you did. I have no idea why I did it. And I just remember my parents looking at me like something was terribly wrong with me and they were just so confused. I get it. I really do. I wish I could give you some insight on why it happened or what you should do now but, I still don’t know. But I do know that I was diagnosed with depression, ADHD, borderline personality disorder and Bi polar.
orangeshade [info] I've experienced a drug-induced mania/mixed episode for several months after I was given an SSRI. I was diagnosed with depression a few years later before we figured out that happened. Then I had another reaction to a different SSRI where I became hypomanic, and I was diagnosed as bipolar by a 2nd psychiatrist. 3rd and 4th psychiatrists decided that these manic/hypomanic episodes were just medication induced and diagnosed me with depression. They said that it was quite possible I'm bipolar, but until I have a full manic episode that isn't medication induced, their diagnosis is depression.  I believe I've had milder hypomanic episodes that were not medication induced, but they're not sure, so they're not giving the bipolar diagnosis. Because of the possible bipolar coupled with the fact that whenever I've been on solely an anti-depressant I've become manic, I've been on mood stabilizers and anti-depressants for years. Not sure how I'll ever get a diagnosis if I am bipolar if I'm always on mood stabilizers and anti-depressants anyway, but the treatment's the same for now so I guess I don't really care. 
Cherryyana [info] I know what you’re feeling, welcome to the club :) I hate how limited I am too. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety before I was diagnosed with fibro.  Symptoms started for me after my grandmother died, who I was very close to and loved dearly. She was diagnosed with cancer and died within weeks so it was harder than I thought it would be. I defo think my mental health and stress of grief triggered mine. The only thing that seems to naturally help me are salt baths and relaxing/stretching. It’s like a lottery as to when you can do what you want and can’t. I’ve had to be much more open with my loved ones than I’m comfortable with, but it has really helped them to understand my situation and makes it easier for all of us when I’m having a flare.IMO changing how you think and how you see your condition helps as much as physical care, I guess that’s why CBT can help fibro sufferers too. Good luck and stay strong, there is a way around everything.
atticus__ [info] Same with bipolar. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety for years. ADHD was being considered at one point because I started having extreme issues with concentration because my mind was on insane rapid fire. Turned out I spent a lot of time in mixed episodes. I finally found an amazing psychiatrist who gave me the right diagnosis. She said it takes an average of 10 years for bipolar to get properly diagnosed.That being said, looking back after my diagnosis, I couldn't help but think "how did no one pick up on this sooner?" I even went voluntarily to a psych ward once because I thought I had reached enlightenment and was drawing up schematics to program an AI that no one had thought of yet. I felt like god, but I knew something wasn't right. They kicked me out and said I was fine. I was clearly manic.. They let me go and I felt 100x worse going out the door, my life fell apart really bad after that. I have a lot of resentment over it.
panax_ [info] I was diagnosed with depression for a long time. It makes sense because I specifically mentioned suicidal thoughts, and I was so horrified by the thoughts (and it took me such a long time to admit them to anybody) that I didn’t really interrogate them. It was only when I spoke about some more classic checking that was taking over my life did OCD click as a diagnosis. It also gave me the space to talk through various iterations of harm and sexual OCD that I had been ashamed to admit.
jdb2793 [info] Thanks for this message and for the reminder.I am diagnosed with depression so meaning I actually need (not just want) something externally to actually help me cope up with my pain and struggles. I do love myself, and believe me, I have made all your suggestions already. But what’s nice is when someone else can remind me again whenever I’m clouded like what you did. But I already seek professional help since even myself, family, and friends aren’t enough sometimes to help me with this illness. I have monthly psychologist therapy session and will be taking meds again. It’s just nice to have a genuine (and not paid lol) care and comfort from other people. Thanks again!
alt123456789o [info] I used to feel very negative like this, like life was complete bullshit. I was diagnosed with depression at the time, and it's gotten better since then. If you haven't already, get a doctor's appointment and get checked out. Reading up about depression online has helped me understand my thoughts better and what the disease actually is. Hopefully this may help you as well.
LifeWA [info] Hey dude, I was diagnosed with depression around 5 years ago. I started my SSRIs and I would say it took around 8 months to feel somewhat myself again, although there was an improvement after about a month.It’s important to remember that everyone is different, if you don’t see any improvement after a month, talk to your doctor again. It’s also important to look after yourself, eat healthy, make a point of exercising, get into a routine and learn how to be by yourself. I’m hoping to come off meds this year, it would have been a bit sooner, but life gets in the way sometimes
lonelyheart66 [info] The problem is there is absolutely nothing going on and I am not comfortable, makes me very anxious at times with the need to help. I had to care for three family members going threw hospice and held there hand as they past, the last being my wife of 20 years and kind of lost at the moment. Work 60 hours a week just to come home to an empty house.I have been in counseling twice and just didnt get anything out of it. I have been diagnosed with depression and on meds for that along with meds to help me sleep for a few hours a nite. Just a lot of self pity and dwelling on what's wrong and not what's good. I really wish I could meet people especially the opposite sex but my shy and introverted self comes out whenever I am out in public. Few online dating sites but just so impersonal not much luck.
iddybiddybritty [info] Thanks, right back at you! Same with the disappointment after the study. I thought for sure I didn’t sleep for half the naps, but the brain is a tricky bastard! Not sure why Ritalin is the route they decided on. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 5 years ago, still struggling with it so it’s possible that played a role in the med decision (I’ll still be on antidepressants and Ritalin doesn’t interfere with those)? Beats me, but it’s working so far. Can’t remember the last time I had this kind of energy!
AlexHidanBR [info] >If the game is affecting you this much, uninstall it. No game, no matter how great ypu feel when doing well, is worth going through that amount of negative emotions for.I can't bring myself to do that because that'd mean that I give up. And I can't give up, I need to move on, I need to overcome this. When I win, I feel lime a winner, it's euphoric. I just can't. And at this point in my life, I constantly feel depressed about lots of things everyday that being depressed about a stupid video game doesn't seem to make a difference anyway.>Not even just games. Anything in life that makes you feel that badly about yourself needs to be removes from your life regardless of what it is. People, work, relationships, games, events.... If they impact you this much, get rid of them.You can't just "get rid of them". What if you live with abusing parents and don't have the means or resources necessary to move out of the house? You can't get rid of this situation, you need to endure it and adapt yourself in order to survive. That's the same for this fighting game, I can't get rid of it.>Are you on medication? I was diagnosed with depression about 14 years ago and I wont lie, it is an ongoing struggle, but the right medication can do wonders for you. It wont make everything sunshine and rainbows but it can make dealing with negative feelings much more manageable.I've been diagnosed twice with depression, anxiety, paranoid and schizophrenia. Once through a check up by a doctor from an emergency room, and another time by my previous psyquiatrist. I've been taking two medicines but unfortunately they don't work with me so I'm currently decreasing the medication with my current psyquiatrist in order to "clean" my system from those medications and start over with new ones.>You have to help yourself first. Quit the game, remove it from your life and get an appointment to speak to your doctor. Unburden yourself, its hard but it feels great once you do.Like I said, I can't get rid of the game. I MUST get on Gold league or something, I need to overcome those voices that tell me that I'm a failure, that everyone laughs at me because I'm not at Gold league. I even have nightmares with Street Fighter about this, that in the dream I am at gunpoint by someone, hammering in my head "you need to win Alex, no, you MUST WIN you little sack of shit".I am definitely delusional. You can laugh to my face if you want, I deserve to be ridiculed.>Don't hurt yourself or the people that care about you - and no matter how you feel, there are people who care!Now that's debatable. The only people that may care are my mom and dad. What else is there?
meghanhauk [info] Its called high functioning depression. Or more often referred to as "fake it till you make it"When I was diagnosed with depression I was still attending work full time, hitting the gym 4-5 times a week, going out with friends etc. I was also crying on my lunch breaks, would get home and crawl into bed immediately, wouldn't eat and couldn't be bothered to keep up with any hygiene outside of the basics. 
ferociousspot [info] I was diagnosed with depression + anxiety when I was 12 and it seemed to fit until I was around 18-19. I had symptoms that didn’t seem to fit depression or anxiety necessarily (like random bouts of blinding rage, severe panic at the slightest chance of abandonment, intense panic attacks breakdowns and mood swings, dangerous impulsivity, etc.) I started doing some research about these symptoms and when I read about BPD I could relate to every single symptom to a T, and my history of constant emotional/physical abuse from my mom made it make even more sense. I’m just self dx. I’m still trying to get into see a psychiatrist so I can try medication from a BPD perspective, as when I tried medication when I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety it wasn’t helpful at all. I hope you didn’t just mean official diagnosis.
batheinsriracha [info] This may offer you some hope. I was diagnosed with depression as a teen and struggled with it immensely throughout high school and college. I almost flunked out twice because of it, and I attempted suicide. Well, I've since graduated (with shitty grades, but I made it!) and after intense therapy and trying many different medications, my psychiatrist now considers my depression in remission. I do live knowing that it's very possible I will relapse, especially if I'm faced with stress. And I sure have rough days here and there. But mostly, I know that the worst of the worst feelings won't last forever, and I keep myself going with that in mind.I am still tackling my anxiety disorders, though. Those are insanely tough to treat.
butchbitch82 [info] I was NOT diagnosed with bipolar before this incident. I was diagnosed with depression with symptoms of hypomania before. I was diagnosed on the Tuesday following the episode, which ended Saturday night, I guess. I have never had a manic episode like that. I did so many things that were out of character and I do take responsibility for them, but I'm unsure of how I could have expected this.
missgrindhouse [info] haven’t spoken to a doctor about my OCD tendencies yet. I am diagnosed with depression. I always knew I had the tendencies but was able to keep them at bay so I never felt it to be important enough to bring up or even fully recognize them as much of a problem.then the obsessions started.. the intrusive thoughts.. false memories.. I realized I’ve been engaging in the same rituals and compulsions for 9 years but didn’t think of them as more than just “unhealthy habits”. the whole shebang. can barely make it through the day without the extreme anxiety making me want to go over and hurl due to obsessively ruminating. it was like an avalanche of everything at once. i’m hoping to get the proper help for it when I see my therapist.
Dynamic_P0tato [info] I didn't quite *know*, but I did learn that feeling as though your future will contain nothing but bad stuff from age 10 is kind of odd. I was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago and I'm still nowhere near rid of it, although I do exercise regularly now and I haven't self-harmed in 15 months.
LOOOOPS [info] I've been diagnosed with depression, technically a "mental illness." I've tried bunch of medications, cognitive behavior therapy, and group sessions. Nothing has worked.I'm convinced that my depression has nothing to do with mental illness. I just hate the world and no pill or therapy is going to change that.
GiraffevsRaptor [info] I was very ashamed when I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at a young age. I hid it from many people, including family and friends , because to often we hear that emotional troubles are not real and to shrug them off. Eventually I became more open about my mental state, and I've had very great responses from people like high who recognize that the stigma surrounding mental illness is beginning to diminish. I'm trying to find ways get more involved in supporting  anyone struggling without an adequate support system, hopefully I find a good organization soon. Hope your weekend is full of joy!
UndeadKuba [info] > you have a long history of being shit to autistic people> you just hate anyone with mental health issuesNow you're just making things up. You've obviously never looked at my post history. I'm diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder. The issue I have with the article you posted is that it gives the impression that depression is some simple cause and effect scenario where if you fix the supposed cause it just goes away. If it worked like that people wouldn't be depressed. There is a difference between being sad because of a break-up and depression. The approach of just fixing any percieved problem in your life as some sort of cure is worth trying, but doesn't work for most. It's just irritating to see the "fix the root cause" solution over and over again, when for many, the "root cause" is their own messed up brain chemistry. Let me clarify.If it is a symptom of a problem in your life, that isn't depression. That is just you being bummed out. That is easily fixed.If you've "fixed" everthing and nothing changes, surprise! Your brain is probably messed up and you're clinically depressed.
chiralcortex [info] > It's tough because it also affects work and I struggle as well. Not  knowing what to do is tough. I'm always wondering will stimulants help?  I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and fought against medication.  I'm anti-medication but the stimulants help me so much with focus, memory, and general demeanor.  A ton of my anxiety was based on forgetting things and looking like an idiot.  Over time that anxiety has been eliminated.  If you work with your doctor your dose can be adjusted to the point where you don't even notice the medication yet your symptoms should be nearly gone.  You can always quit taking them... and there is a non-stimulant alternative available but it didn't help me at all.  
Gezy152 [info] Amitriptyline and risperdal, 2018 I was diagnosed with depression but I refused to take medication till 2019 will d medication still work?
itto-bitto [info] Spent nearly 5 years together, on/off a couple times. Back in late 2017, I was diagnosed with depression (turned out to be severe depression and a personality disorder). Looking back, I've probably had depression for several years now. But anyway, she couldn't validate my depression. She didn't understand how I had it I guess. She couldn't wrap her head around the fact that depression doesn't discriminate.  She had depression as well and had been on/off meds for it for nearly a decade. I'll spare the details for privacy, but she had been through SIGNIFICANTLY more and worse trauma than I had. Trauma I would never want to see ANYBODY go through. So, to her, it seemed like she couldn't justify my depression or anxiety. She couldn't understand why I was sad sometimes. In her defense, she always at least acted like she could by comforting me in my bad times and she did care for me and love me, I never questioned that. But I could tell she didn't understand how I was depressed. Eventually this got to me and I ended things. There were a lot of other reasons, but that's the most important one to me.
doodongo [info] I do, I am diagnosed with depression and I did regularly to see a therapist. The symptoms of PTSD I have not talked about. I guess I should.
redditusersg [info] I don't know. I know that I have been diagnosed with depression. But I don't know why I'm so scared of how I am in this world and in this body, am I 'stuck' here :(((
ayindy [info] Find a way to distract yourself, here is one of my favourite videos to watch and it instantly calms me down. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd7KC3PaEaAFind a show you love and watch it. You could try and  download an app called pacifica where you can join groupchats or post your feelings and people will respond to you. It also tracks the way you feel and does a check in on you. Meditation or mindfulness can help (headspace or calm app). I have been diagnosed with depression from a young age and I am still dealing with suicidal thoughts but this is what I find helps me but of course it's not the same for everyone but please do give these things a try if you have not done before. 
soap_savon [info] O h  m a n. Okay, so I straight up went to my high school counselor multiple times and said "I am diagnosed with depression and feel suicidal and hopeless all the time, what can I do? I do an hour of yoga once a week and run whenever I can." "Hmm... Well, all bad feelings pass eventually so you need to keep that in mind. Have you tried reducing your stress and exercising?" ... thanks dude, im fuckin cured and all it took was some more goddamn yoga. I then went to university, saw a psychiatrist, and was prescribed medication and advised to seek out a psychologist who specialized in CBT and whaddya know, some good actually came out of it!!!!Edit: I think it's important to note that, while high school admin was worse than useless, every single one of my teachers were incredibly understanding. The hardest part was telling them about it + asking them for accommodations on a case-by-case basis because it felt like I was getting special treatment. At my uni I was given a lette I could email to my profs explaining my situation and honestly that's so much easier - I can just type in a few words, send it, and forget it

Nicotine12 [info] I've been diagnosed with depression, so yeah, I experienced this. And experiencing it throughout as well. I just try to ignore it. If it becomes unbearable, I try to go out and find something else to do. Distraction is a hell of a drug, lol.
