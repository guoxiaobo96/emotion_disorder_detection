donteatmee3333 [info] Yeah I could see my younger self saying something like this. I was diagnosed with depression early
georgiaokeefe123 [info] I agree with all of this. I totally agree that my mom feels like it’s her fault, I remember when I was diagnosed with depression when I was 12 and I read through her texts and she was blaming herself for all of it, even though the doctors told her it was a chemical imbalance. She gets so sad every time I’m sad and it just makes me feel worse because it’s not her fault at all. She doesn’t understand the severity of it and I haven’t worked up the courage to give her all of the information about the illness. I hope your mom grows in her understanding.
owlfoxer [info] Yeah. These meds only manage BP. I also take trazqdone bc I have sleep problems (Pretty much everyone with BP does. )It is hard to say whether they have gotten worse or not. I would say that as I have gotten older, the disease has become a bigger part of my life. So I would say the illness develops more into defined cycles. I would say my cycles have wrecked a lot of experiences— especially with employment. I hope that the older I have gotten, the wiser I have become and am trying to learn how to accept and manage the disease. I was exactly like you. Recurring bouts of depression and experiences of hypo mania which I didn’t realize either. I was diagnosed with depression. So I didn’t get correctly diagnosed until later.  Side effects are hard in the beginning. Be patient. Adjusting to them might take a month or more. But you need to stick with it. The meds caused me to become super tired. The meds help slow your mind down - because after all — racing thoughts are not normal. Pm with any questions you might have.
Unknown3Fortune1Rye [info] Can you elaborate more regarding what condition do you mean that’s not proven?I’d set myself as an example; I’m living a very perfect life according to my standards, I have everything that I ever wanted. However, I’m not feeling okay and I was diagnosed with depression..
MessyConstellations [info] You mean how I became ugly? Well, to start off, I started to gain weight to the point that I weight 20 pounds more than an average teen, zits started to come out and it doesn’t help that I have a tendency to scratch them which leads to me having injuries on my face, scars or even trails of blood, I’ve been wearing braces for 8 years now and I use baggy clothing to hide my breast because I was made fun of that in secondary school.And my mental state is no better, I’ve been struggling with a low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and I was diagnosed with depression on December.So yeah, I decided to start dieting and do exercise to at least be able to change my weight.
Jassyladd311 [info] Awe I'm so sorry. A lack of sleep and nothing in the stomach can turn the nicest person a little grouchy. Everyone feels irritable once in a while especially when you're growing up. You're so young and are going through a very difficult time through puberty which is not fun or forgiving on anyone. Good job for diffusing and going to your room. Getting away from people and into "your space" when you become irritable is a good thing. Everyone lashes out at people once in a while. It's a part of family and being in such a closed space all the time especially when you're most likely not even getting time away at school. Your day got a twist with your mom being upset about a family pet death. That doesnt help your day. And even if death doesnt affect you that much your mood can be affected by those around you. I doubt your an asshole. Yes its rude to lash out and you dont want to make it a habit but learning to diffuse yourself and not lash out is a big part of that and you did a good job. Next time bring a snack up there, eat, diffuse, and get a couple hours of sleep. You'll feel better when you wake up. I was diagnosed with depression as a young teen and have learned effective coping mechanisms through therapy and life.
HelpThereIsPainHere [info] Hello, I was always a quiet kid. I was diagnosed with depression as a kid, two more times as a teenager, and once as an adult.I struggled with suicidal thoughts for a long time.I started a new job recently, I got rid of my last roommate.All at the end of 2019Things changed. I felt different. I started acting different. I know I'm probably still depressed and slowly recovering, but I am different now. I am happy, I feel emotions, I love, I love my boyfriend a lot, more than I thought I did. My depression was keeping me from enjoying everything.I thought it was a chemical imbalance since I have been this way since I was small. But, I think I was in a shitty situation. The situatuin was a long thing.My family, my friends, my job/school. Everything sucked, it all made me depressed Im 2000 miles away from it all, me and my boyfriend, in an apartment with nice things, I work 3 days a week but make enough to pay bills.I am happy for the first time.I think people can recover. Chemical imbalance or life long (small, simple) trauma, I think it is possible. I'm sure more traumatic things are harder. The most traumatic thing to happen to me is a car accident, 4 years later it still hurts but I can get in a car, I can drive, it's not too bad.I hope others can find the kind of peace and happiness I have found.
sangriasky [info] I'm so so so happy for you, this is a big step towards recovery, and I'm glad you talked about it openlyI've been diagnosed with depression 6 years ago (I'm 20) and I still can't accept it, can't admit it in front of myself, I avoid the word 'depression' like a plague, I don't know how to talk about it with my family, I lost friends because I couldn't explain my behaviour, all of this is making me feel worse and worse, nothing good comes from hiding and denialI hope you'll treat yourself with compassion and love  ❤️
Inner_Examination_90 [info] Hey, I can promise you that no matter what it feels like. there are people who care about you. I have experienced those feelings before and almost committed suicide. However, I found someone to talk to and after I was diagnosed with depression and people found out, they were so amazing. I was so supported.People care. Even the ones that you think dont. they do.
Lifelacksluster [info] _Just_ gotten? I honestly don't want to nitpick. I saw this was your second post in a short period of time... I was diagnosed with depression too... and it's quite the rollercoaster ride for me... I wanted to understand how you are feeling lately...
situationtypedill [info] I was on venlafaxine for about a year because I was just diagnosed with depression at first and it would make me have even worse depressive episodes
shadeyrain [info] Years ago, when I was still in highschool I got my first betta fish with my own money(not forced upon me by my unknowing parents). I was so depressed at the time, and I left him to rot for a while. After I was diagnosed with depression(at the ripe age of 17) my therapist recommended I take on a responsibly like a fish or rodent. When I went to check on my betta, he was nearly dead. No fins( he literally was just a body. He barely could move) from fin rot, tiny bowl and barely fed. I did some research and found out how much more bettas needed. I worked on that betta for months to regrow his fins, make him feel better and gave him something bigger than a half gallon bowl. Every day, changed his water and medicated him and just monitored him hour to hour for months. I got that phrase a lot. "But it's just a fish"He was the most beautiful fish I've ever owned. I had him for nearly six years after that. He survived through all that and turned out to be this beautiful thing in my life. I was devastated when he died, cried for hours. I haven't loved any other betta the same way. But I cherish that my fish get me through the hard times, motivate me, inspire me to keep beautiful things alive. It's embarrassing sometimes to admit this, but I will never forget what my fish hobby has given me in my very depressed life. SIP Spectrum.
unipos [info] You're getting a lot of shit but I hope you won't be discouraged. This subreddit unfortunately has a lot of victim mentality and saying anything in the direction of encouraging people to try a bit harder is interpreted in an extremely negative light.I'm a fat lazy slob, a negative person with a fatalistic attitude. I've been diagnosed with depression, ADHD, psychosis... . I've let myself slide into a miserable state. And the only one I can blame is myself. The truth is I don't even try to make my life better very often because I forget I can. But when I see a post like yours, I remember again that I can try and I can do. Even if it's just small baby steps.The only thing I wish is I had brave people like you in my life, reminding that I can do better and when need be sometimes remind me of uncomfortable truths.But I can see why people often don't bother. Because they get shat on and accused of not having empathy. You have my upvote.
CosinesCosines [info] I can kinda relate to this. I was diagnosed with depression and my docs kept only suggesting medication and therapy to help. Neither worked. I come to learn on my own that simply cutting out certain people who were my stressors helped tremendously. All the therapists I've been to only tried to teach me skills on how to deal with said people when they actually should've told me to just leave them.
LlZARD99 [info] Thank you.  I've been diagnosed with depression, but I haven't had these intense feelings since I was in my 20s. I'm 47 now.
snickeringdoodle1 [info] Sadly I can relate, I tried to get medication for my depression but they wouldn't and the doctor said I just have stress... Even though I've been diagnosed with depression. I often don't feel like I have good enough of a reason. Even with everything falling apart I still feel like I'm overreacting. Hang in there.
MaltaMassive [info] I feel this on so many levels.I had counselling last year for depression and I take antidepressants. I was diagnosed with depression but it’s caused and triggered by extremely low self esteem. Do you ever do something really great, like a big achievement, and only get 30 seconds of joy before it’s ‘okay what next?’. My expectations are unreachable and nothing is ever enough. I’m never enough.What’s your relationship with your parents like? My issues have been ingrained from my childhood. My mum has always made me the black sheep, and I was never enough of a daughter for her. Here I am at 28, carrying that around in every aspect of my life.
Reasonable-Tart [info] I once mentioned that I wanted to die during middle school.I've also confided to them that I've been diagnosed with depression.Other than that, I once accidentally showed my self harm scars but they didn't comment on it.
SubMeTender [info] Well it’s overdue that somebody replied to this. I’m guessing you are in a different place but I do have something to say about this. It is not so much addressed to you as it is something I think it’s relevant in a broad sense.  I bring it up only because there are myths, stigmas, and misunderstandings that lead a lot of people to reluctance about this topic.Our capacity to experience joy can sometimes be compromised, and this can have far reaching and profound effects on our interpretation of events, circumstance, and our very lives. Sometimes these things can be improved by a change of routine, perspective or condition. But sometimes the issue is simply chemical.  The mechanisms to pass these signals are impeded and nothing we do outside of addressing that issue will help. It’s rarely cut and dried, and it is often a mix of things.  But it is important to investigate all of them, because the weak link in the chain can prevent any progress at all.I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 47. I probably had suffered from it for at least a decade. I contemplated taking my own life for at least two months before I sought help.  I was prescribed a daily medication, and although that on its own did not “fix” me, it restored the tools I needed to address my problems. It did not alter my personality, and side effects were short lived. I will have to take it every day for the rest of my life. But diabetics have to take insulin. It is not a failure or a character flaw. It is a chronic illness and mine simply requires medication.This is not a blanket endorsement of medication, and not everybody responds to or tolerates medication in the same way.  Just don’t write it off. Include it in your investigation of treatment options. It may take time and trial and error to find the right one and the right dosage. See it through.Anyway, I hope that the emotions or lack thereof that you experienced that day have passed. If not, don’t put it off. Look into it and address it proactively. You may find that you are able to find joy in even the most mundane aspects of life.Peace and love!
3NicksTapRoom [info] Everything with quarantine and the economy has me depressed also. I have been diagnosed with depression but I’ve always felt it was mild. Now it’s head on. I don’t want to live. I fear living life like this for two years much greater than I do from dying of the virus. What blows my mind is how much people like living life in quarantine. I can’t even fathom being happy in these circumstances.
bookishrory [info] Same...Everyone deals with shit differentlyHeckSame person can deal with shit differently in different times.I used to be like that.I was diagnosed with depression at 16 but I'm pretty sure I've had it since I was 12.But from 12-16 I was very creative and very good at school.I used to work to ignore the negative thoughts. And when I couldn't work I would write poems or paint or read books.Now I can't do that which sucks so muchI'm just failing at everything
Born-Pea [info] So, I’ve been on both sides of the coin. I was diagnosed with depression at 7 and been on and off medicine since then (I’m almost 20 now). I’ve gone through suicidal thoughts, mild self harm and 3 therapists, not wanting to get up and just feeling empty and worthless.Since a few months ago, for some reason, it’s like my depression went down. I feel pretty happy. I’m currently on no medication, and haven’t seen my therapist due to lockdown. I remember thinking for years I wouldn’t be in the mental state I am now, but here we are. I still feel weird sometimes, have fall downs and tend to be negative, but overall I can say I’m pretty content with my life. Still don’t have many friends, cut down a few, doing pretty bad in college, living with a psychologically abusive person and feeling alone, tho. I don’t know what advise to give, as everyone’s situation is different, but being ok is possible, hang on :)
PeacefulWoodturner [info] I am a germophobe as well. I am diagnosed with depression and OCD. There are only two effective ways to address this and usually happen together. First is medication. Second is cognitive behavioral therapy. She can be helped, but it will take a lot of work and be very hard. However, it can be done. Please find a psychiatry practice that has experience with these types of disorders and be prepared to work hard. You (plural) can do this. Please don't give up
_floof_poof [info] I was diagnosed with depression from the doctor but he basically dismissed everything else. Thank you for the advice
TheStockyScholar [info] I just wish this wasn’t so hard for me. I used to be so fit and felt great but my life went to hell...it’s basically the last mountain I have to climb over and I just keep failing.I don’t understand why it’s so hard, mentally. I tried everything, Nutrisystem, Slim4Life, weight loss metabolism booster injections, it all felt like hell.The last thing that worked was a 1200 calorie diet I did when I was 12 and I did very well on it. Then I went downhill when I was diagnosed with depression at 20. Idk, man. You make it look so easy.
TheMediaBear [info] The best thing you can do is post on social media "I have been diagnosed with depression"  It's what I did, against the opinion of my wife who felt it was a bad mark against her and our life together. But you know what?  As soon as I was brave enough to be open about it I was amazed by the reaction. 2 of the people I worked with where taking  Sertraline, 3 more had taken it.  I had friends Facebook messaging me about it asking questions about their own situations.    I even had someone come up to me in the street and thank me about being so open about it and it pushed them to seek help.  I didn't know them at all but they'd been told about me via a friend.   You'll also find a weight lifted from your shoulders from not keeping the secret anymore.   As for your parents, some people will never get it, no matter how bad it gets, they can't process it. That's their issue, not yours.
LakeForest3 [info] It is possible, for awhile I was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia.  Really it doesn't matter too much because anti-psychotics also treat depression.  If your mood is poor try abilify, it works wonders for mine.
wordvomitonthedaily [info] I totally get some of the things you're saying. I'm diagnosed with depression. It's been a little more than a year but I've lost so much of myself. I have nights where I cry for hours and feel so insanely bad. My family sucks at communication and it hurts. Especially when you're crying in front of your mom and she just refuses to acknowledge it. I have endless issues. Ive been self harming too, tried overdosing once and suicide lingers in my mind. Times are hard. But just as I pick things up, all the bad shit I thought I let go off comes back. I relapse all the time. I just can't outrun any of it. I experience a sadness which just breaks me. And I'm alone because of it. I can't seem to trust my family and I just feel like I need an escape.
dylan-dylan-dylan [info] How sad i am and the dark thoughts I’m still thinking and the bad actions i’m still doing. I was diagnosed with depression and my parents know that but they’d rather think it’s gone now then to help. I have a therapist but i’ve been lying to her about how I’m actually feeling so she thinks I’m getting better. I know that defeats the purpose of therapy but the last time i was genuinely open about my feelings she broke the confidentiality and told my parents about my suicidal thoughts. I understand why but i just don’t want to go through talking with my parents about that again. They were so uncomfortable with it. My parents are divorced too so i didn’t just have one conversation with the both of them together, i had two separate very uncomfortable conversations with people who don’t understand my thoughts very well. Theres been multiple occasions where my mental state became very obvious to my parents, like when my mom found a rope in my closet and a blade on the bathroom floor, but that situation was easily escaped by just using the excuse “it was from a while before, I’m better now”. For the blade incident, she checked my wrists but not my legs (i used it on my legs) so i simply said it wasn’t mine and i didn’t know where it came from.
bluetypes [info] The other commenter is right that depression and suicidal ideation are not always linked. Based on the way you're describing your experience, though, you sound pretty depressed to me. Before I was diagnosed with depression, I thought you had to be like staring at a wall, just like numbed out, to count as depressed. But actually feeling extremely sensitive, going from feeling angry to sad, and generally feeling like the stakes of life are so high and you're sure you're going to fail -- these are all parts of being depressed too.Also, I'm sure you've had people tell you not to compare yourself to others, but it's so true. Where there's smoke there's fire. Especially with pain -- pain is literally just the feeling of pain. How is it possible that the pain you feel is actually not as bad as it feels? If some people aren't hurt as much by the same things, well, that's great for them, but that doesn't real change your situation. Just remember that even Anne Frank, in her diary, says that other people have it worse than her. The question isn't where do I fit on the scale of people having a bad time, it's just am I in pain, and what can I do about it.I can tell things are really hard for you right now. But don't forget you're someone who has loved and dreamed, and hopefully still loves and dreams. Life is way, way more than some hoops to jump through to just be good enough. Feeling that way isn't as easy as flicking a switch, but it's still true.
EmmaB2 [info] Yeah, this exactly. I have been diagnosed with depression, so this sums up how I feel perfectly
hastrek [info] I have told my boss (because it was affecting my work very apparently) that I have been diagnosed with depression. I haven't yet faced any repercussions, probably because my employer is aware of mental health issues in the field I work in.
narr1 [info] Oh my fuck, I can't deal with this anymore. I feel horrible, all the time; my diabetes is slowly killing me and I couldn't care less, everyone thinks I'm doing OK now, but I'm not. I was diagnosed with depression 3-4 years ago, I can't really remember, but I have been depressed probably for the past 8 years. So since I was 15, as I'm 23 now.
sensitivesliceofpie [info] When I was diagnosed with depression I learned who my real friends were. My two “best friends” decided that I was doing it for attention and that they shouldn’t be friends with me anymore and I was “too much for them to handle.” There were only a few that were really there for me, and now because of corona I only have one or two that check in on me every few weeks.
Kelly_Louise [info] First of all, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I know how scary and hard it can be. But it gets better! My fiancé has cirrhosis from drinking and cannot ever drink again. He was only 26 when he was diagnosed. The thing that helped him the most in getting and staying sober was having a strong support system. People that he knew would never leave him even if things got really hard. He never went to AA or any other support group, but I think he could have benefited from it. He was also prescribed antidepressants by his doctor, and the doc also highly encourages him to see a therapist. I think he should have started seeing a therapist as soon as he was diagnosed, I think it could have helped a lot. (but I’m not really one to talk since I haven’t seen a therapist in years and I am diagnosed with depression)My fiancé is soooo much happier and healthier now that he has been sober for 3 years. He tells me all the time he is so much better off. Of course it was really hard at first, he lost a lot of “friends” (drinking buddies). But now our life has stabilized again and things are really good. There is a light at the end of the tunnel! The first and hardest step is admitting there is a problem.
Oreo1123 [info] Unfortunately yes. I was diagnosed with depression about 9 months ago.
RhubarbSurprise [info] From my experience it's both. In my life there has been a phase or two, where it was very difficult. I was diagnosed with depression at a young age and put on medication. It did take months and it did take a couple of years to get better, but it was worth it. If you get help, whether its through your family and friends, professionals or the internet, you will slowly but steadily be equipped with the tools to handle your situtation. Depression might be with you forever and creep out once in awhile, but you can learn how to manage it. You control it, it doesn't control you. You might need to fight for awhile to win back the control, but it will be worth it, to be back in control, I can promise you that.
H8303518 [info] "Yes I am, because I have been diagnosed with depression"Now lemme just say, don't self-diagnose yourself with mental illness, there's so so so many biases that come into play and there's this thing in psychology where if you look up the symptoms you are likely to also display the symptoms. Just all round, not a good idea. **Also TRIGGER WARNING, TALKING HEAVILY ABOUT DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE**Around 13-ish I said this. I had been suicidal, intensely so for 2 years at this point, and never told anyone. That day in school I simply could not put on a face to show i was not hollow. I couldn't. The "depression voice" (if ya'll don't know, in depression it's very common to have a "voice" criticising you, it comes seemingly from the external, ex. YOU are worthless, however it's merely an adaption of your own stream of consciousness, non-depressed individual can have this type of voice as well), anyway so the depression voice was calling me selfish etc. etc, as it does. I was on the brink of tears, my friends noticed obviously. I don't recall how, but I know they were asking if I was okay, me not trusting my voice anymore I wrote on a napkin some shit like "I feel insane" or "i feel mental" and then the tears properly came out.They took me outside of the dining room, and asked why, what's wrong etc. And then I cracked. Completely and utterly sobbing. "I want to die, *I want to kill myself*, I don't want to be here, I don't want to be alive." I really only coherently got out the I want to kill myself part, and in the mean time the voice was saying *You are so weak for telling them, you are nothing do you think they care?* SO, still while sobbing one of my friends said "Is this a prank?" and the other remaining one said "my mum has depression, I just don't think you do". Which at this point I want to insert that this is a reasonable response for 13 year olds, obviously, I really don't blame either of them, of course there are better points that could have been said but they were young and in my heart I have tried to forgive. So at that point I freak out *See? They don't believe you because they don't care. Look at yourself wanting attention*. Still sobbing I tell the lie. I just wanted them to believe me that's all. It was so hard for two years being so young and wanting to die, I didn't even believe something was wrong because depression does that to you. And to hear from someone else that what I was feeling wasn't real? Fucking hurt at the time. It would hurt now if I got that type of response and being a 13 year old kid...damn.Damn.*Liar. You want attention so badly you'll lie for it? Fucking amazing. How selfish can you get?*And, they still didn't believe me. So now I had given the voice a few more names to call me and two people who didn't believe me, when I first and finally told someone. For that reason I didn't tell anyone for a further 6 years. I didn't get help. But damn was that a justified lie, because I needed to be believed at the time. And I understand and forgive myself for lying. It was okay, me.&#x200B;I am doing much better now, recently y discharged from mental health clinic so am MUCH better. Still working on my journey and the ghosts of the past. xx
mentalhealthmaster [info] I just wanted to add that I think phrasing is incredibly important. There’s a huge difference between saying, “What you’re going through sounds like what I went through, and I was diagnosed with depression” and “You have major depressive disorder.”I’m a clinical therapist by day and it’d be incredibly unethical for me to diagnose on Reddit or even to imply a diagnosis, so I’d say the same applies to everyone. Anyone can read info online or pick-up their own copy of the DSM-V, but no one is in the position on here to do a proper assessment. It’s walking a fine line between providing information/support and conversing as a clinical professional would. I’d say the most important part of this is it’s a reminder to remain aware of our words.
1MILVoltage [info] I was diagnosed with depression in February, I'm on meds but these things still happen, so I don't know what to think, thank you for your answer.
idkwhattoputlol69 [info] Even if it is just teen angst or smt, any suffering is real, and doesn't deserve to be ignored simply because you aren't diagnosed. I'm also 13 (albeit 14 in about a week) and I've been diagnosed with depression, but before I was I definitely had the same feeling of 'this seems worse than normal' but you don't want to assume and seem like a dick. Obviously it's best to get diagnosed from a professional but right now that's kinda difficult cause of corona and everything. I think that no matter the cause of ur suffering u are still totally valid for getting help.I'd be glad to chat with you about it if you'd like! :) But dont feel pressured!
AChangeOfSeasoning [info] Mental disorders are supposed to severely affect your life. I was diagnosed with depression because I attempted suicide a couple times. I didn't bother to look into a couple other things that I thought I had because, by definition, they were not severe enough to seriously hinder my life, even if it sucked mentally. Not sick enough is a real thing. If your life isn't severely impacted, it's not a mental disorder.
GwenCocoUgo [info] This won't be the best advice here, but this is what I did regarding the first part of your issue - your parents not wanting to take ADHD seriously. Take from this what you will. I was diagnosed at 17 as well. Exact same situation, and I was sent to a doctor by the school GC and so what followed was that I wasn't allowed to have sessions with the GC anymore either. What I did was stopped giving a fuck. I spent hours doing what I wanted to, which was watching TV. I didn't attend any classes first semester of college, and failed 3 of my 5 classes. I hated that, but I was still not caring. I wasted so much time it's unbelievable. Second year, I was put on academic probation and I was eating 200 calories a day (ED). went into treatment for ED after nearly fainting twice a day after 2 months of eating 1000 calories a week. Nobody had any choice then. I was either going to take antidepressants, or be dead. The doctors talked to my family. The treatment continued. I was 19 at the time, and had just survived an almost dangerous ED. Doctor visits continued, at the school clinic and for the first itme ever my family was spending money on my mental health because it was physical health as well. There I was diagnosed with depression, Anxiety, OCD and ADD. An entire year on drugs was not fun, and I don't even really remember it... but guess what, I was going through the motions of life. Getting up, going to class, etc. I finished uni in 6 years, but I finished ffs. It's been a struggle. It'll be a struggle for years to come I'm sure. Anyways, what's that got to do with you? Well, you could start by letting your mind take over. Just let all the horrible shit happen. It's kind of good to get all that out of your system young. LOL. BUT, do you honestly want to go through this? Do you want to wait until you're almost dying to get help? Dude, you're a kid and you already are more self aware than half people twice your age. You deserve to have a little help here. That help is either meds or a therapist. Do whatever you can to either convince your parents, or just go after it yourself. About the job; it's a communication issue. Make it a game for just this one day, see how bad you can actually get! Like actually try to be bad. Then don't try. Compare the two. Count how many blonde people you see. write it down! You're not a cashier now, you're just playing around. After you're done, go to your boss and compliment him on something. Thank him for giving you a chance. Butter him up. Then tell him you feel like you'd be a better fit somewhere else, and you'd like a chance to prove that to him. Make sure you know what you're signing up for tho! You've got this
fiiola [info] I've been diagnosed with depression about 8 years ago, doctors didn't help and the only thing that gave me some will was a friend that was always there, for that I tried my best.Now I'm not one to run away from my problems or bad thoughts, actually that's kind of the issue my mind never really switches off, drugs never even once crossed my mind until this month where the mental break down was so severe, I swear to god I never experienced anything like that, the physical pain that came with it was unmatched I was physically ill, that was the first time ever I actually begged a friend to get me something, anything to just calm and sedate me. With the lockdown that was not possible and I just rely on sleep meds ( I couldn't sleep for a whole week) and NGL the fact that drugs seem appealing for me at this point makes me disgusted with myself, I am aware that I'll fall into a strong addiction, that will only make my problems worse.
suckmycolt [info] I was diagnosed with depression at like age 4.
ale6898 [info] I'm glad you're still here!! Thanks for sharing this. I was diagnosed with depression at age 10 so I kind of get how you feel, personally depression makes me feel trapped 24/7
veryconfusedpersonnn [info] I really took this to heart. I’m just so scared to tell someone. I am diagnosed with depression. And I’ve been in psychiatric care. But this is different. I’ve tried getting help before and each time has failed me. I’ve gotten the police involved but then my mom told them I’m delusional and they believed her. Then I got cps involved but they stopped looking into the situation and just dropped it. I went home after school and then got screamed at even more by my parents. They believe in the whole “what happens at home stays at home” order. I can’t live like this anymore. I’m just..out of words. So out of words idk what to type because I can drag on and on.
pinkishb [info] Yeah, I feel like I've observed my whole life and never really participated, but I've pretty much always been ok with it. I never thought it was a problem. I've always been ok with being the only person in my life. I love doing things alone. When I'm with others, especially groups, I very much struggle to find meaning in the interactions so I basically just observe, but not in a sad way, I just don't feel the need to participate unless I'm doing so in a way that is meaningful/helpful. I was diagnosed with depression a few years back and I've been "managing" it ever since. But the funny thing is, when I look back to when I was a child, I felt the same. And even looking into the future, if I end up with someone, or have kids or whatever, I feel like it won't change the core of my default mode. But like I said, I'm not unhappy with it. It just is what it is and I don't mind haha
AMonsterMask [info] Yikes. My dad is the same way, surprisingly, the only differences being that he's the extrovert, and I'm the introvert. He always tries to relate his problems to mine, and even told me that I'm going through a "phase" when he found out that I was diagnosed with depression. Still, it doesn't seem like just a parent thing. I'm confident that there are others out there with decent, understanding parents that will just listen when you need an ear and hug you when you need a shoulder. I won't try to give you any advice, since I know that you didn't really ask, but I will say that I'm here if you ever need to vent or anything. If you're comfortable doing so, feel free to message me, friend.
buffalopantry [info] Okay first of all woah there. I was diagnosed with depression and had no interest in a noose or some shit. That's a big stretch.Second, and I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it is treated as a mental health issue and physically transitioning is considered the treatment for it. I really don't know too much about the process but I'm pretty sure trans people have to see a psychologist and also present as their preferred gender for quite a while before any docto will start with the physical parts.
jp_slim [info] > If you really think this video describes anything like severe depression, than I'd argue that you've never experienced it. [...] Obviously I could be wrong about you and perhaps you have been extremely depressed.Yeah, I've been diagnosed with depression and have had therapy which kinda worked, and taken anti-depressants which didn't work for me. What actually worked for me is to do exactly what this video talked about, without knowing that this book or video existed. I started doing most of this about six or so months ago and the symptoms are still hard to handle some days yet most days are manageable.> I could just imagine Mick Mulvaney quoting this video and telling mentally ill people to just "improve their ship" a concept so offensive it might as well be up there with bootstraps. I see where you went with this and I hadn't considered it. Thank you for sharing your thoughts!> Not to mention it's getting posted all over facebook by people who don't normally post this kind of stuff (a sure sign there is something wrong with it). I'd like to hear you elaborate on this point, because it makes little sense to me.
ajago12598 [info] It's certainly not the worst thing in this thread, so therapy hugs to all y'all, but it really sucked making my parents cry. I was diagnosed with depression within the past 5 years and my parents really didn't have a clue because I suppress the FUCK out of my emotions and self-soothe. They found out from my ex (boyfriend at the time) that I was suicidal and wanted to OD, and they were so, so upset. For context, my parents lost one kid in utero (I was supposed to be a triplet) and another was stillborn. My dad was talking to me about it, trying to understand what was going on and he starts sobbing. He's like a big dude, always has his shit together so it was so hard to see. We just sat on his bed crying on each other for a while. My mom tells me that she and my dad are always concerned when I'm away at school. She texts me and my siblings goodnight every night as a way of checking in on us, because as far as she knows, I could've killed myself. I'm getting treated now, and honestly it's not really effective, but I hope it's putting their worries at bay.
383CI [info] I was just diagnosed with depression two months ago. Trust me.....go and get help. You will be amazed how much better you will feel. It’s like a weight has been lifted off your chest. My depression came out as anger and confusion and not being able to comprehend anything when I was going through a phase. Everyone is different.
angers-a-liar [info] Ok I am a teenager so you might not even listen to me but that’s normal and I don’t find it childish. Sometimes when people are depressed they just wanna go home and and let everything out alone. I was diagnosed with depression and anyway sometimes when I’m at my friends and I feel depressed I just wanna go home. Sometimes I don’t even feel like they hate me I don’t even pay attention to them I’m just sad I feel so empty. I just wanna go home and lie down and cry alone. And I just don’t wanna be near them I mean I love my friends obviously they mean everything to me and I wouldn’t be here without them but I just idk don’t wanna be around them. I just wanna be home. So anyway I think it’s a normal feeling for people to feel when you’re that upset.
Iamahighlighter012 [info] I've been diagnosed with depression  a few days ago that's why I'm asking. I'm not trying to be rude. I just think sometimes environmental factors play a role and I'm just curious what others have to say. 
Princess-Nik [info] I know exactly what you mean! I was diagnosed with depression at 12 so it’s all I’ve known and thinking about living a life where you don’t wake up some days and just cry all day without reason.
isilnoir [info] There's always hope, seek help please. I was feeling the same way. I know it's hard to do, but even stepping to an counselor's office in your school is a step on recovering. I was feeling the same, and I decided to see the counselor in my uni and she advised me so well, I went to a psychiatrist and it all went well. I'm feeling better now. It feels like there is no hope but believe me, there is. There is really hope. If there are people (i mean your parents) who don't believe your struggle, then screw them, and find other people to talk about this to. I was in my very high point of my life when I felt like you do, I finally had the job that I wanted since I was a child, I was making money, I had friends, I had family, I was doing great. But I felt so utterly depressed and I wanted to kill myself so much I always thought about death. I didn't tell my parents. I realized that I'm in depression while I'm trying to explain my situation to the counselor in the uni. When I told my tutors (I'm a research assistant btw, and I was then as well) that I'm in depression, they were like "why would you be in depression your life is good it makes no sense". They acted like I'm in depression because I'm a brat, because they didn't understand how it can happen. I understand them, though. I was prescribed with prozac, and it made me feel so much better. While I was recovering, I talked with my professor and explained how I was when I was thinking about killing myself and how I was in depression, but now recovering. She looked at me with empty eyes, not understanding. People cannot understand how it feels unless they have been through depression. I didn't understand it before, as well. I couldn't comprehend how a person can be depressed so deeply that they want to kill themselves, not until I was diagnosed with depression. Then I understood. Don't be mad at your parents because they don't understand you, I didn't tell mine because I knew they were going to act the same way. They've never been through something like this. Just seek out help from another individual and don't lose hope. You can always DM me when you feel like you hit the bottom. I'm not a professional of course, but it's nice to have people to talk to sometimes. &#x200B;&#x200B;
pychiticatitsfinest [info] Dang, this is exactly how I feel. I was diagnosed with depression and have some family issues and I don't wanna live but at the same time, I don't wanna do it at my own hands.It seems like you have had a rough time for quite a while, but I must ask, is mental illness a taboo because of where you live or something more specific in your life?
jaanegreeen [info] Ask the doctor that suggested it.He should be able to give you a number or website to go to.I was diagnosed with depression from a giant test my psychiatrist gave me before our first appointment like 7+ years ago.
ioMoon78 [info] I'm sorry that you are going through this.  You will get through this....it will take time and effort on your part,, but you will survive and it will get better. I have been in your shoes....feeling stuck and lost, feeling like I'm way behind everyone my age, feeling alone and misunderstood.  It is great that you have your bf, who understands you, cares for you, and is a shoulder to cry on. When I was going through it, I had no family, friends, or a partner to be there for me in the ways that only a partner can---intimacy.  I'm not talking about sexual intimacy, but emotional intimacy, which is important always, but especially at a time like this. It's okay to feel how you're feeling. There is a reason for it. What has helped me immensely is to "be" with my feelings. Recognize them. Acknowledge them.  Work through them----otherwise they only get bigger and more destructive.  My journey has been ten years, from the time I was diagnosed with depression, to now, but all that led up to it before I got depression is what started to lay the foundation for my depression.  So my advice to you is to face your feelings.  Finding a good therapist is key.  I saw several therapists until I found the right one. I've been seeing her for almost 3 years now, and she has helped me to get through my debilitating emotions.  Now I understand my emotions and why I feel the way I do, and this has helped me to manage depressive episodes much better.  I also am on medication, and I have been since the beginning. I have a stable regimen, and it works for me.  Together with therapy, I have improved so much.  Not everyone likes taking medications, but sometimes you need it to balance the chemicals in your brain that affect mood.  But whether you take medicine or not, therapy is key....a good therapist to help you in the ways that YOU need.  What I needed from my therapist is to help me to understand my emotions and where they were coming from. She also allowed me to release my thoughts and feelings in a safe place where I didn't feel judged and received affirmation or correction of my feelings. It sounds like you had a terrible experience because the therapist you went to was the wrong one for you. I encourage you to keep looking for one that is able to help with your needs. Not all therapists are created equal. They have different approaches, techniques, and views on mental health, and that impacts the kind of treatment that you will receive. Keep being strong and pushing forward. You will get through this.
Necroncryptek10341 [info] I was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago. Got on antidepressants, and have been barely managing it. I wanted to talk about this, but I don't really have friends to talk about it with. Frankly I understand your confusion, and am sorry for that. But don't assume you know me.
unsungzero1027 [info] I just want to say, your dad is amazing for what he did. Bringing you the articles to help you see if wasn't just you he was at least actively making an attempt to help you. For a lot of us we didn't have that. I told my dad I was diagnosed with depression and GAD and he basically told me what do you have to be depressed about? Granted, he wasn't wrong... Nothing was horribly wrong with my life so from an outside view it wouldn't make sense that I was depressed. I just chalk it up to him growing up in a different time and having a much different upbringing (his dad was a very bad alcoholic. He never beat the children or my grandmother thankfully) and grew up working class poor where as I was a middle class white kid growing up in the suburbs. Anyway, sorry got the random venting. Music is very tied to emotions and depending on what memories it brings up (in this case, his suicide) it will reflect in how you feel listening to the song. I don't really listen to much Linkin Park anymore, but other bands music I listened to when I was going through depression, or that talk about depression, cause me to feel very anxious so I completely get what you're talking about.
waterforbreakfast [info] I’ve tried out a couple subjects such as novels, newspapers, magazines, children’s books, but none of those really speak to me. I always feel weird when reading How To’s or self help books. These types of books want to show me how to get better at something, and I feel it’s not a bad thing to be better at something, yet I lose interest in reading these things as well! It might take a little extra for me to find something worth reading as I have been diagnosed with depression, but that’s exactly why I want to find something to read, so that I can pass the time.Long time ago I also thought that history novels might be the way to go, struck me quickly as boring however. Nice that you’ve found something more your taste!
smilleeymilleey1 [info] Disclaimer: This is my personal experience, and its hard to place my depression on a spectrum since everyone experiences things differently. I did have thoughts of suicide. Sometimes I still do. I think that the biggest part of dealing with depression is \*accepting\* it. Now, I don't mean to accept it in such a way that it has power over  like: "I was diagnosed with depression, and its a disorder that not even professionals can effectively treat" but with a different set of eyes. Accept it by saying, "yes this is something that I am DEALING with." If you can tell yourself every day that you are getting through it, dealing with it, and handling/becoming accountable of your depressive state then you eventually become aware of \*how\* you are dealing with it.. Once your conscious self is exposed to how your dealing with it, youll be able to accurately identify your coping mechanisms. Those mechanisms are likely un-healthy and therefore enabling those depressive habits. Its a journey for sure, but by becoming mindful of your feelings and how you handling those feelings can lead to a beautiful awakening. Again, this is my personal experience and it is what worked for me.. Depression is on a spectrum and while medications did not work for me, it might be true that for someone else, its what they needed.
Anon10062019 [info] Caller 2, I am diagnosed with depression too and my psychiatrist told me to stop with the alcohol. I was pretty dependent on it before and when I was able to stop I felt my overall mental state improve. Quality of sleep improved as well.
makeeh [info] I'm also 19, i also played video games for most of my life, around 2018 i realized that i didn't like playing video games anymore, i have no friends, no life. I do have a job and an income, but they bring me no joy. I was heavily bullied and ridiculed at school. I was diagnosed with depression when i was 12 or 13 if i remember correctly. I too have a lot of moments when i really realize that everything i didn't want to be, i've become. Just know that you are not alone in this situation. My biggest fear is that i will be forever alone, and die alone, but that also seems like the most likely case when i look at my situation and that always makes me die inside a little bit more.
mya-is-confused [info] Well, the quizzes were what I turned to at first too. They are based off of symptoms of depression, so if you answered the questions thoroughly and honestly they may be a good indication. However, they dont take place of a diagnosis.I went to the hospital to see a psychiatrist 8 months ago (seems extremely but i was desperate) and got recommended to see a counselo I was diagnosed with depression and worked with that therapist for 7 months before she got a new job.
meowdrian [info] I have been diagnosed with depression, but I’ve never heard of this being a sign or symptom.
Will_Trent [info] No longer trying to get out of the spiral. Just staying semi-manageable. I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 16, but it began when I was in fourth grade. I'm 50 years old now.
braidedblasphemy [info] I have been diagnosed with depression and I’m currently on medication for it. I can confirm this is exactly how my life goes. I’ll have a couple of good, inspired days, then a few bad days where I constantly fantasize my death. I’m just waiting for the ratio to tilt in my favor. I’m beyond ready to get back to my life.
SLYTHERINQUEEN666 [info] I'm diagnosed with depression, but I'm taking care of it. It's impossible to tell you how better I am now compared to when I discovered that I have depression.😁
Batstronaut [info] I've been doing what I can to get more experience with various hobbies. I've been cycling. A lot. 36 miles is a quick run and 75 miles is a fun outing. I've been learning guitar for the past two years, self-taught. I learned how to build a computer and play video games every now and then. I've finished High School with my diploma but I still feel this way a lot. I was diagnosed with depression at 16, and have been in and out of an existential crisis that's too hard to explain through writing since 8th grade.
yeeyeesuckmypeepee [info] my work ethic is terrible and always has been. I'm not really a good student but that wasn't a problem for me until this year because usually I didn't need to study. Now my parents are afraid I'm going to fail out of freshman year :). I don't think this is entirely an IQ thing though, because I was diagnosed with depression a few months ago and I have tons of smart friends who are really good at school.
MelodyTheScreecher [info] I'm diagnosed with depression and everytime I find someone like that I wanna kill them because its not cool to fake it
awkwardregular10 [info] Hey, my parents dont believe in mental health either. I was diagnosed with depression roughly 3 years ago and I have been on meds since. I have also been seeing a therapist.Everyone responds to zoloft differently It works really really well for me. I wish I had started earlier. I havent seen any side effects. However, zoloft alone is not enough. Therapy or self help workbooks, adopting good habits is also very important. Working on your habits and thoughts is crucial. But till you get to therapy  zoloft might be a good starting point.
inthefamilyofthings [info] I'm sending love, hugs, and calming thoughts. I think its wonderful that you have such supportive family.  Try to let go of the shame if you can.  You seem to be feeling guilt that this is happening to them, but that guilt is a weight you don't need.  This is happening to you right now.  If someone had been hit by a car, they would need to spend their energy healing, not feeling guilty that the car hit them.  You've been hit by a metaphorical car. You seem like you have it together, but you didn't mention seeking a medical opinion, and I would.  I thought my depression had reached epic proportions a few years ago.  It was hard to breathe and I was exhausted that I feel asleep at my desk.  I was severely iron deficient.  Severely.  I had to have an IV.  Thyroid, pre-diabetes, iron deficiencies can all mask as depression.I'm reading this and it sounds so familiar.  Is it possible that it's not just depression, but rather burn out?  I have been diagnosed with depression, but part of the clinical cause is burn out.  So, part of the problem here is the solution is not necessarily the same for both, and taking some time off work is not enough. Often, those of us who are prone to burnout seem to take treating depression as a challenge.  It becomes another job, another stressor, another set of worries.  This is a huge problem because it is the stress and the pile of work that has put us in a constant state of high alert which led to depression in the first place.I'm sorry I have nothing better because I'm just starting to work through this myself.  So instead of doing all the things, I'm picking one thing a day and I'm going to do it because it's good for me.  Not because I should, or because I'll enjoy it, or because it's a job.  I can usually do one thing.I apologize if I've read to much into what you've said.  Sending love all around.
HerDiamonds3 [info] Im so sorry you are going through this. I was 13 when I was diagnosed with depression. You described some of the feelings I would have. You’re a child, of course you want attention and to feel loved, I need that as an adult. It isn’t for attention, you just want someone to take the pain away and make you feel like you again. Keep trying with therapy, get a different therapist if needed. You are so worth the time and effort
Stress-Levels [info] I've been diagnosed with depression for just over two years, after two suicide attempts, dropping out of university and just working full time I feel better. I remember a nurse said to me "You're always gonna have depression but you're not always gonna be depressed" and even though that sounds kinda politically incorrect and a bit messed up it's something that has stuck with me.
Manda_Meme [info] Since I was diagnosed with depression, my spelling schedule is fucked up, I sleep too much and without a  regular clock. Sometimes i sleep 2 Hours in the evening and go to bed aftwr 2 Am.
Lucian7x [info] I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 4, so I'm pretty fucked up. I have no idea what is it like to NOT have depression. That, and I'm going through bad times right now - I crown 2019 the worst year of my life so far, and we're not even through q3 yet.But still, I hope someday I'll get better. See what's it like not to be one of the accursed.
regrettablyalive [info] I have been diagnosed with depression and everyday I feel like shit and just taking some drugs and drinking some alcohol, I have been feeling this way since I was like 5 or something. But you don't know what they mean, it could be in the sense I described it or I could be totally fuckin wrong and they might as well be a pyschopath I'm not saying theyre right by being completely happy by tests saying they have depression, I'm giving suggestions to why someone might feel this way. And I know they arent made to diagnose you I never self diagnosed before just suggested that I *might* have it
limbojade [info] My heart has been broken so many times, I’ve just left the pieces where they are and learned to live with it that way. I was diagnosed with depression a couple of months ago, and it’s been so hard. I told my parents I felt that whenever I am saddened, start to cry, etc, I’m a pain to them and it’s just like “oh, here we go again.” They agreed. Sometimes, I just feel like they would be so much better off without me. I feel like a walking inconvenience. I’m not surprised at them agreeing, because I’ve been telling myself that’s what I am to them for years. The only difference is now I have validation.
BetterRemember [info] I begged to see a nose specialist for years from the ages of 13-24, nobody referred me even when I broke down sobbing and then had an asthma attack in front of the doctor because my nose immediately stopped working from the tears.I finally demanded a female doctor at my university clinic and left with a specialist appointment that day. I have severe asthma and all of my previous doctors knew this so not being able to breathe through my nose most of the time was a huge quality of life issue for me, especially since I need to be active to keep my depression under control.I've been diagnosed with depression since 19 and all my previous doctors know that. I told them I wanted to be a proactive patient and stay active to combat my depression and that my nose hindered me every day and I feared sleep.I got to the specialist and he was outraged that things had been allowed to progress so much. I have huge nasal polyps that regularly completely block my nasal passages. Plus the internal structure of my nose is all fucked up to the point where I need not just a polypectomy but a complete nose job.My specialist made a point to ask me if my previous general practitioners had all been men, he told me that his female patients, especially the younger ones, tend to come to him with more advanced issues because they are brushed off for years upon years. I am NEVER seeing a male GP for an ongoing issue again. My specialist said I could have easily had a huge asthma attack and died because of my nose
justignoreme003 [info] I feel very similar to you and I have been diagnosed with depression. Always a safe bet though to see a doctor.
llx5771 [info] The first time I was diagnosed with depression I was pretty young. But what I can remember is that I managed to find a therapist who understood what I was going through. He managed to convince my so called parents that they should let me try out martial arts, since I had anger management issues as a child. I absolutely loved training and the discipline that came with it. In addition to that I made a lot of new friends and gained a lot of confidence.
LukeGreywolf [info] 25M this actually sounds pretty similar to me, I was diagnosed with depression as a kid. Except I just sorta grew realizing most of the people around me were shit, so I told myself as a kid that I was going to strive for perfection because anything less was settling for mediocrity/failure.In middle and high school I used to self harm, I never cut because that would leave obvious marks, I'd beat myself relentlessly, usually in the head because I was depressed and angry at my own brain for making me depressed. During all of this I was on SSRI antidepressants that just seemed to make everything worse. Every day I berated myself for being a "stupid worthless piece of shit" for whatever slight mistake I made that day. after a close brush with suicide I stopped taking my meds in secret and finally started to improve. After a few months and my improvements being significant enough for my teachers and mom to notice I told my mom and my psychiatrist that I had stopped and that I never wanted to take meds again. That was 10 years ago, I still struggle with hating myself and still have a tendency to go off on myself for the slightest mistakes, but I haven't (with 1 or 2 exceptions when things were really bad) beat myself in 10 years and the nagging voice telling me I'm a piece of shit isn't as loud as it used to be.Honestly one of the things that helped me most just as a person was forcing myself into uncomfortable situations where I had to interact with people, starting with just talking to people at school that also seemed like they were struggling, that led to friends that I could talk to and develop social skills, and eventually worked my way up to forcing myself to go to a few parties to keep pushing myself. (Fun fact, first party I ever went to I was still completely uncomfortable with drinking, but I knew I had to blend in if I wanted to be social, so I picked up an empty beer an and carried it with me most of the night so I wouldn't look like prude) the more interactions you have the easier they get, I'm by no means a social butterfly but now I can navigate most social interactions just fine.I wish I had an answer for you as to why, what I can tell you it does get better.
emmashawn [info] When I was 14 I was diagnosed with depression. My grades were bad and I didn’t pass my year. I was devastated. My state of mind switched and I decided to not care anymore. I skipped classes, made graffitis in the bathroom stalls, did not do assignments. All of those behaviours are very unlike me. The school system failed to support me with my illness, so I refused to cooperate with them.
Torimax3 [info] I've been diagnosed with depression 7 years ago and I can count the times I have cried just because of me and the way I live and feel. I was just never able to cry for myself. When I tried to cry I always had to yawn which Made me feel like a fool and I got embarassed. The first time I really did cry just because of me was when I survived my suicide attempt because I was mentally and physically more drained than ever and I don't know how long I would've kept crying if my brother did not suddenly came to my Apartment and I didn't wanted to cry in front of him, so I calmed myself down. From a young age on I got scolded and told to stop crying. Maybe that's why I can't cry that easily when its about myself. I  don't know.
sugarkitten_ [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 12. In fact, in some ways I felt worse than I do now. However it *is* totally possible that he’s just wearing it as a tag. Still, I agree, you should speak to him and let him talk to you about it. Keep a listening ear because if he really is going through something, you may feel very guilty later for not being there for him.
Redrogue2291 [info] I can relate. I have been depressed since I was 10. I experienced a lot of sexual abuse from age 11-16. I could not trust my family, and I couldn't be truly close to anyone because of the pain. I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD later. I did the same thing you are doing, but with a different medication. I even made the attempt and took the pills. 4 years later and I'm still here. There are days where I feel like total shit, but I'm glad I made it. Life is not bright and beautiful for everyone, but every day there is opportunity for change. You are most likely going to have another episode, and it will continue until you get the treatment you need. There is always help. I don't know where you live, but the US has many phone numbers to call and speak to someone about your feelings. Don't give up dear, it is possible to feel better than how you are feeling. 
jenp2323 [info] I'm definitely not saying go to a psychiatric hospital if you are depressed. That's not the point of psych hospitals? I have been diagnosed with depression So i wouldn't say I am an "outsider". I guess my post is more geared towards those who haven't reached out for professional help
windy_beans [info] Oh, no not at all. I hope you don't mind a rather long text.tl;dnr: Can't tolerate people,  alsmot complete isolation, breakdwon, medication. TR: Deprression, Psychotherapy and ClincI find it extremely hard to be in places with a lot of people (not like a sold out stadium neither  10 just in the same room). I seem to see and smell everything. I thee public Transportation for everything (it's quit normal in Switzerland, there is no need for a car in the city)and therefore I see a lot of things, that make me so angry and lost. If someone puts his shoes on the seats or if some speaks obnoxiously loud and (I am absolutely aware that this is what I feel) talks about annoying and (to me) irrelevant stuff, I can't shut it out. OR if I see an elderly woman alone in the city (they are just minding der own business, not looking sad, ill or anything) I could just start to cry because I am convinced that the person is so sad inside. And again, I am aware that this is exactly what I feel inside but that normally does not help a lot. It just confirms my inner feeling of not fitting anywhere and not being able to understand how everyone seems to really want to live. I am very lucky and privileged, I have a very nice job, an amazing supporting family and a hand full of very close and understanding friends and a loving Boyfriend (we've slit up last year).But that brings me to another point where I struggled hard with my strict schedules. I try to be on PT during rush hours and I had to be at home am 05:00 (in the evening) even if I was bored at home and would liked to go shopping or anything else. I just wanted to make sure, I can avoid people and therefore be a little bit less stressed. In the end I isolated my self extremely. I could barely make a date with my friends because it was so exhausting to be out there and  having to absorb everything around you 24/7. No one else seems to notice all the smells, the sounds and all the conversation near by. My friends never gave up  on me but I had huge arguments with my family (consisting of my Mom and my beloved Twin sister who is the bright opposite of me and understands me the most, no jealousy from me towards her, never. She is just the most lovable person out there) since I would cancel most of our family diners on a short-term (we all live close to each other) because I was already worn out by the normal day and knew I would want to leave after maybe 1-1.5 hours. My mum always gets so mad about this, she finds it unacceptable to be invited and the leave quickly. Kinda absurd, because the 3 of us have a very strong loving bond but my mom switches to a very angry sturdy person she normally never exhibits if the topic is about me and my ways of living (not wanting to have diner often with them or cancelling on a short note and not being able to change the day I wandet to do laundry (which would absolutely not be a problem  technically and stuff like that. Chores or ideas that I had in my schedule and the longer I did this, the closer those schedule time windwos became. I am in therapy since 22 Years (I'm 29 now) and it never was visible that I live inside my own space where I could tolerate very few people.I have to say I am a librarian and talking and working with people is not a problem at all, I love all of my colleagues we have a very caring office. So yeah, sorry, getting sidetracked ;-) Suddenly I could not go out with my BF and his friends and then I could no longer go out with him, because I was mostly on diets and I was miserable often around food and just did not want to have to endure that and decided to stay in. And in 2017 my carefully planed and developed Schedule system just broke down within days. I ended up in a psychiatric clinic  (I was diagnosed with depression since I was 12 years old and  on softly changing medication since then) I was very devestated because I do not fit in the depression clinical picture nore in any others. So no medication ever really helped me.Until I've me a fantastic Psychologist  during my second week in the clinic. We had 2 sessions and then he put his note pad down, looked my in the eyes and said "You are not mentally ill, you most certainly do not have manic disorders, you have a very distinct ADHD with a depression because of that. And then I remember taking Ritalin during my professional education shortly and that I was diagnosed when I was in Kindergarden. But it never occured to me, that this would be more than not being able to focus (which I felt was not that bad). He proceeded to give me methylphenidate and within dayys I was feeling so much better.Since then : I have found a new Psychologist and Psychiater who are specialised on ADHD in adults. She changed the medication once and it made so much easier. I am able to tolerate people way more, I can at least bring my thoughts in order. I can decide if a chore is super important or if I could go out with friends and dust the bookshelf the next day.I also have a faint feeling of what it is to be "normal" I noted, how different I see and experience the world.
tristepieceodpizza [info] As far as I am concerned ,it’s almost impossible for an intelligent ,sympathetic , compassionate individual not to be depressed about the reality of this world .I don’t think that depression should be considered as an  illness or that depressed individuals are in need of treatment because there’s something wrong with them .Depressed individuals need medication not because of some chemical imbalance in their brains ,but because, in order to be a fully functioning member of this society ,it’s necessary that you follow the orders and don’t think too much ,which depressed individuals can’t help but do .The doctors don’t cure you from an illness ,but rather they cure you of your own thoughts and individuality ,because the society does not want individuals ,it only wants sheep .The illness does not lie within the depressed .But within those who stare blankly at the sufferings of other people which were prompted by certain individuals’ dire need of personal benefit.Within those who send innocent men to war playing political games.Within those who only care about buying a cool car ,having a beautiful wife and having kids.Within those who only fucking care about themselves and don’t give a shit about the consequences of their actions .Within robots who follow the orders without thinking for themselves . I was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago and I spent a great deal of time thinking that there was something wrong with me because I just couldn’t find happiness in the mundane things when I knew that so many things were clearly wrong with this world .I thought I needed treatment and medication because I spent too much time thinking about things nobody around me cared  about.But then I realized that there was nothing wrong with the fact that I thought about things nobody thought about and cared about things nobody cared about .I realized that there was nothing wrong with me just because I couldn’t  ignore all the shit in this world .I’ve kind of given in to sadness ,I guess.I see the darkness as a friend now.I don’t stop myself from thinking anymore .Because ,even though ignorance truly is a bliss ,I’d rather be miserable to my dying day than become another sheep with no individuality .I plan on sticking around for as much as I can because this world is such a joke to me now so I just look at it and laugh at how stupid everything around me is.
sprinklesbubbles123 [info] I feel this so hard. I was diagnosed with depression at 14. At 22, I am still struggling very much. It’s hard to develop a personality or interests or qualities when all of your energy is spent trying to make it to the next day, and the only thing running through your head is dark thoughts. As a 22 year old, it scares me. You’re supposed to “find yourself” as a teenager. Develop a stable personality and personal traits. But I missed all of that. I feel so much more immature than my peers because of this.
aestheticautistic [info] This came up in my notifications for some reason and it’s so relatable that I thought I’d written it myself and it was a reply notification lol. Being sad is predictable to me. I’m 22 and I was diagnosed with depression at 12, after 3 years of feeling consistently low. It’s been my normal for so long that anything else feels scary and unfamiliar. I genuinely don’t know what happiness feels like. It doesn’t help that I’m autistic, so feelings are difficult for me to label anyway, but sometimes I feel weird emotions that I *think* are excitement, or pride, or happiness. But I just don’t know. The only emotions I can label are sadness, guilt, anger, and fear. If it’s not any type of emotion relating to those, then I get anxious about the inevitable crash afterwards. Happiness is also depressing because when I feel something nice, I get sad because I know it won’t last forever, but I wish it would. I like being sad because I know it, it’s homey and comfy (but at the same time not), and I don’t want to feel happiness to know what I’m missing.I guess I haven’t helped, but I hope it’s useful in some way to know you’re not alone. Stay safe
samreturned [info] Just after first year of uni, I was diagnosed with depression the year after, I stopped being able to perform every day tasks. I was in and out of hospitals and prison cells. For obvious reasons, I lost my job and had to leave uni. I'd like to relive it, knowing my mistakes and making it better
horse_at_water [info] My iq was measured after I was diagnosed with depression but not the other mental illnesses, the first time when I was in eating disorder treatment they had a teacher that would give us the work, however I was really depressed and un willing to do any work during that time, the second time when I was in the hospital I was only there for 4 and a half days so I didn't really miss much
alittlebirdy_toldme [info] Well, it's been years since I had any actual interests. I was diagnosed with depression a while back, and my motivation for things is just gone. I've been trying to get back into my hobbies, but they're like writing and things to do by myself. I don't really have social interests. I want to get into hiking, maybe I could make friends doing that.
throwayayayaysya [info] I am diagnosed with depression and ADHD
ZyraReflex [info] Agreed. In high school I was diagnosed with depression and adhd, but it just fucking irritated me to hear people say "oh I wanna die XD" or whatever, and people that just say they have ADHD without any grounds for doing so. Having ADHD doesn't make you quirky or unique. It makes doing work impossible, and makes it way more difficult to achieve long term goals or even remembering short term things you have to do.
nowplayingaudiobooks [info] When I was diagnosed with depression, they put me on welbutrin to help with the fatigue and concentration issues. Helps with weight management and quitting cigarettes apparently too.Lots of people love it. It just made me feel relaxed... didn’t help with anything besides my sleeping problems. Took it at night and slept like a baby. Told my psychiatrist and found out i had undiagnosed adhd lol. i’m on vyvanse now, and that stuff will knock me out if i take a dose lower than 40mg. anyway, got off topic,  yeah its suppose to be good for sexual dysfunction too 🤷🏻‍♀️
soulihide [info] It’s a way of speaking, this person says they are also diagnosed with depression not that they diagnosed themselves. “I am diagnosed with depression”, is the same as “I am diagnosed myself with depression” only the added “myself” is there to show that they too have depression. Idk if I’m explaining this right, but I hope you get it. Also while we’re on the topic, you also seem to be nitpicking a bit. Is that because you feel irritable and just want to lash out, or just because you saw what you thought was a reason to comment?Reddit took forever letting me post this and I had a sort of revelation while brushing my teeth:Depression is hate, hatred towards so many things and most of all ourselves. This hate in turn makes us so tired that when we can’t hate anymore we want to die. Some people have more energy for hate than sadness, and others have less hate but more sadness. Does that make any sense at all?
blackdaisylight [info] Same, I was diagnosed with depression  and had anorexia as well at some point. Same, I'm that self conscious as well and sometimes paranoid about people staring at me or judging me. That's why idk I think he was "just" depressed
PumaPatty [info] I'm ashamed to write that I used to be a lot like your friend. I have lost two important friendships in the last decade because of this. I am heartbroken but I understand that I wasn't as good of a friend as I thought I was.Your friend probably needs to talk because of underlying problems she has. While it is understandable to need to talk with your friends, it is also important to give your attention to them when it's their turn.In my case, I have been diagnosed with depression and I'm seeing a therapist. I am able to see now that it was my behavior that cut me out of my friends' life. It is hard to deal with sometimes but I have decided to better myself and be more attentive to my existing friends in order not to lose them.So basically, your friend's need to talk goes beyond what you can offer in return. You could suggest she sees a therapist and then take it from there. If nothing else works, I suggest seeing her less often.You are a good person and I hope she realises how lucky she is to have you. Good luck !
rudestboy420 [info] I have a huge circle of friends and i am very liked by them. I have been diagnosed with depression and tried multiple SSRIs yet to no avail. Where to go from here?
frazwood [info] Personally, I would recommend that you deal with your depression first.  I was diagnosed with depression about 2 years ago and through a lot of hard work (therapy + meds)... I am out of a depression cycle.I see the world very differently now.  You might discover that you are actually in love with him.  Or not.  But, now? I'm guessing all that you can actually see is depression.
Nohelpforu [info] Yea I got the trifecta of mental health support when I was diagnosed with depression, just still stings being in a position where it honestly feels like i was raised by aliens
ElectricalIons [info] I was diagnosed with depression young.  I struggled with math in college.  Part of the reason I struggled, is because of diagnosed clinical depression due to childhood shit. I think the hardest part of math is when you struggle with it, and you stop getting validation for your work. Even when you're trying hard, when you're consistently below the curve (because everybody failed that test), it's not a good feeling. It makes it easy to want to quit.
generic_username157 [info] I’m in disbelief, every single word here describes my situation.My mother is diagnosed with depression.I also hate people that throw the word around.I was diagnosed with depression a couple of years ago, haven’t told anyone yet, maybe one friend, I’m not sure.I also have these little sparks with my friends, but they never last more than a couple of minutes.My guy, I myself know it’s a though spot, just keep going, sure, I’m not out myself, but maybe all we both need is to keep on pushing.
IllustriousConcert7 [info] did you miss the part where I said I was diagnosed with depression, or
Majestic-Whole [info] I don't believe your lazy like the previous comment I would recommend reaching out fir some help maybe a diagnosis.I also work for myself and run a small business and I have been diagnosed with depression I experience real high moments of motivation and accomplish a lot. But when I hit a depressive state I can be really unproductive but I don't want to be that way I almost can't do anything about it in that moment. There's lots of types of therepy out there including CBT as well as medication if you feel you need it or want it. Good luck for the future 🙌
YouShouldReadAres [info] Tldr; it's a long process and takes a multifaceted approach. Depends on where you are / what level of suicidal ideation you're in (annoying interruptions, constantly being thought about, essentially on the level of compulsion that you are fighting with every molecule of your being, etc). Process includes: Redirecting negative self talk, therapy, listing good things about yourself, practicing hella patience with yourself, capturing and really trying to hold onto good events, get a friend to promise to do something horribly rude to your family at your funeral if you do kill yourself, medication, switching up belief systems, etc. In my experience, it can take a long time. I was diagnosed with depression about 8 years ago but have had suicidal ideation for at least 13 years. I still have moments where I am dealing with suicidal ideation on the brink of  compulsion, but it's much less frequent and much more manageable. My struggle with depression has been a real process, and at points hasn't been the healthiest - so please only take from this what seems like it could be helpful and healthy for you.When I was younger, I used to measure how long a continuous suicidal inclination lasted. I would tell myself to get through the next day and see if it was better, if it lasted longer reach out for help or connect with family/friends in a meaningful way. Anytime I wasn't actively thinking about hurting myself, no matter if it was only for a moment, I would re-start my 'clock' and force myself to keep waiting. My mantra for a few years was honestly "Death comes to those who wait" lol. My life kind of de-railed for a bit, some shit happened, and I started manifesting some strong symptoms of PTSD. To get through this, I compromised with my suicidal ideation and took up smoking as a way to kill myself slowly enough that I would have time to stop the process if/when I was mentally healthy enough to do so... Not the healthiest nor advisable path, but also kept me here long enough to begin the process of quitting in earnest and I doubt I'd be here without that compromise... so, yeah... About 3 years ago, I began shutting down negative self-talk and responding to each suicidal thought by listing at least 3 things that I found fulfillment in, thought was valuable about myself, or wanted to stick around for. I tried to make sure that each time I had to go through this process, at least one of the things I listed felt true. This was really hard at the beginning because the thoughts were hella intrusive and on a constant loop so I was constantly trying to come up with good attributes for myself. Part of the hard part of this technique was recognizing when I was having a negative or suicidal thought. Doing this took a bit of discipline and a lot of patience with myself. I found that this process helped greatly decrease how automatic and continuous my suicidal ideation is - however I do still have moments when suicide and self-mutilation is suddenly the only thing I can think about (#triggered, by what? no idea). Those moments are hard to break out of and usually require me to stop what I'm doing, breathe through it, and try and refocus on the present and my reasons for staying. I think what has been most helpful for me, is being fully theoretically resolved to not take my life. This is helpful because the suicidal thoughts start to lose power and become more annoying than anything else. I also have a really good friend who has promised / threatened me that he would piss on my grave or in my open casket at my funeral if I killed myself. He's 100% the type of person who would do that... and it has been a helpful deterrent at times b/c I don't want my fam to have to deal with him whipping out his dick on top of everything else.  I've also found that changing up my beliefs has helped. I used to find solace in Christianity and then nihilism and now rebirth. I hold these beliefs in a very agnostic sense (like I'm 100% sure that my beliefs aren't the full story of what's going on in the world). But my current "belief" in rebirth helps me feel like suicide is futile and giving in would compound my depression onto the next version of my self... idk. That's not to say you should change your religion or anything, just that I found switching things up helpful for me. Also, therapy. Once you've found a therapist who clicks, it can be v beneficial. And meds... those can help too. And tattoos... but that might just be a me thing. I also have a journal where I write down things which have been effective towards improving my mental health so that I don't forget what works when my brain is trying to kill me. Good luck
lokilover49 [info] My family and I had moved into a new house (kind of like a log house but it was big and nice for a 7 person family) and everything seemed fine...until it wasn’t. About 8 months in we all had a complete shift in behavior. My dad was more physically violent, he was much more verbally abusive and would get upset at the most minuscule things. My oldest sister (17 at the time) would drink and blackout so much. My 2nd oldest (16 at the time) wasn’t doing well in school. My two youngest sisters seemed unaffected but anyways around this time I was 11-12 and I was contemplating taking my life. Yes I was diagnosed with depression and although I thought about it, I never had the will or the urge to WANT to take my life. It was a two story house and I would have an urge to get on the roof and jump into the pool, even though I didn’t know how to swim. That sounds bad but my mom was the worst. She was honestly dying no one could figure out why. She felt so weak and would faint for no reason. Everything made her sick and no matter how many doctors we went to, no one could explain why. We all hated each other.Eventually money ran out and we had to move out and find a new home, and suddenly everything was better. Business (my parents own two business) was doing better than ever. Everyone got better, less violent, urge to drink stopped, grades got better, and i wasn’t completely suicidal. It was as if there was a shadow or a presence haunting us and attaching to us. This happened about 8-9 years ago.About a year ago, a man came to my parents. It’s no one we had ever met or even seen before. And he proceeded to tell my dad things about his life, so detailed and random, things that you’d only know if you were my dad. He then asked how he knew this and he told him a higher being told him to come to my dad and tell him this so he’ll believe his next statement. He told my dad that someone that lived in that house prior to us played with a Ouija board, opened a door and invited a demon into the house and got scared and instead of making the demon leave and closing the door, ending the “game” correctly, they took the board and buried it 5 acres deep into the property. Whatever they let in, was still in the house and it was feeding off of us.This was just the overall story of that house. We had so many freaky experiences that immediately convinced us there was a ghost in the house but we never thought demon. TL;DR: my family and I moved to house and ended up hating each other for no reason. We moved and later found out there was a demon in the house from a ouija board someone opened.
ZoobyZobbyBanana [info] Edit: Thank you so much for the Reddit silver! When I made this post I was going through a very depressed period of my life, and I was under the impression that this post would gain no traction. Now, with the addition of virtual currency that can't be redeemed, I can achieve my dreams of being a successful and contributing member of this fandom. When I was 12 years old I was diagnosed with depression, and my life has been a downward spiral since that fateful day seven months ago. I would like to thank my Roblox girlfriend and all of my family members on Reddit, since I can't think of my real parents as family since they reject my need for constant attention and wish for me to have a future ruled by monetary values. Love you all UwU
lostminty [info] I was diagnosed with depression with psychotic features for awhile
Tangerine117 [info] Hello from Southern California, the empire of weed lol. I am dreaming and living in a haze it seemed for the past ~7 months. I quit for one year then quit for 9 months. I was diagnosed with depression and take medicine for it. I am five days clean bro you can do this mate ask for help and it’s not a weakness to break down and just cry sometimes. Message me if you ever Want someone to talk to or need/want to talk!
taitumg [info] I was diagnosed with depression as well as other things for 6 years now and there has only been one out of the many I’ve tried that worked, Zoloft. However I thought I was fixed stopped my meds and relapsed.Tried Zoloft again and now it doesn’t work. It really takes that one medication to work but DONT STOP TAKING IT (unless there are side effects) but to answer your question of what it’s like, it feels like you’re a normal person finally. Sucks to know it’s just because your on a medication but it feels nice to finally feel motivated again. The suicidal thoughts fade away, I finally felt the way I believe a human should feel. Didn’t last tho.
mdtrxwolf [info] I totally get that. I was diagnosed with depression almost 10 years ago, but started therapy and went on medication 4 years ago. It’s been the longest fucking decade of my life but the last 4 years when I’ve actively decided to put in the work has been life changing. It’s amazing to have hope and optimism and to see the beauty in life again. The work is really hard and it truly fucking sucks but it is so worth it. You’re on the right track! I always think of this quote, “If you’re going through hell, why stop and stay in hell? Keep going.”
Kariered [info] I was in a terrible car accident at 23 years old. I'm 40 years old now.The accident was not my fault. Another driver hit my car almost head on. I was on a highway going 70 mph. My car did not have air bags (wasn't required when the car was built). If I had not been wearing my seat belt, I would be dead.The seat belt broke my collarbone, I broke my wrist, fingers and shattered my kneecap (had to have surgery). It took almost ten months for my knee to get back to something resembling normal. For a good long time, I was scared of driving, of being in a car, anything to do with a car. I still get very anxious about cars, driving and freeways. A few years after my accident, I was diagnosed with depression. It sounds to me like your accident impacted you in a traumatic way (this is normal) and has maybe triggered depression in you. Being depressed isn't really all about feeling sad. It is other things, like having trouble focusing or functioning in daily life and not having motivation. It's not your fault that this is happening. It's your brain/body reacting to a traumatic event that has happened to you. If you think about it, cars or motorcycles, mainly people moving at fast speeds is not natural. Yes, we invented it, but our ancestors would freak if they saw how we traveled around today. I would seek out a therapist or psychiatrist or just go to your regular doctor and tell them what's going on.  You can get treatment for this (medication and therapy), and it could only be temporary. Sometimes therapy and medication will work well and then you can go off of it and be fine.I would do something as life will not just get better by doing nothing about it.
izthepuzz [info] oh. well yeah.. I have been diagnosed with depression. But, darn. Well this is definetly not the worst symptom. because the pain also comes with some happiness that cant be described
geecalla [info] Thank you so much for being the first one to advise. It's hard to go back to zero with another guy and a lot of them are just not serious yet which I'm afraid would cause more heartache but I will try my best. My biggest challenge here is to be consistent fighting myself to entertain his messages especially when I feel so alone. Just recently I've been diagnosed with depression, but since I've taught myself some techniques how to cope up over the years, I am still able to keep my sanity most of the time. Unfortunately I can start my medication only by May for some reasons so it's quite challenging for me.
aglassofsherry [info] I was diagnosed with depression about a year ago, and sometimes I feel like I don't deserve to be called depressed because it's not serious enough, or I'm not sad all the time. So sometimes I'm not sure if I'm faking it or not.
nebulaebattle [info] Not all doctors will take the medication route.  And honestly, that may be better for you.  You are still really young.  Finding a schedule/routine that  works for you, talking to a therapist, adjusting sleep schedule, and adjusting the food you take in may all help.  I’m 21 now, but when I was 16, I was diagnosed with depression.  I’ve tried a couple different meds, but I stopped most of them after a couple months because they don’t help.  In my case, they made me feel really ditzy, or my stomach would ache for days.  I wouldn’t be able to eat.  I just say this because when I was 16, I thought meds would change everything. But I now realize that meds only “enhance” YOU to be better. The meds won’t do anything but harm if you aren’t ready to commit your self to being the happiest you.  You can get passed your depression.  Try to love your self.  (It’s hard for me every day)  Clean your space really well.  Clean your sheets and some comfy clothing into the wash.  Wipe down mirrors, computers, Tv. Pick out an outfit for school for the next day. Think about how your days actually go vs your expectations. Take a nice long shower, really pay attention to inbetween your toes, your inner thighs, behind your ears.  Don’t just bubble up and lean on the shower wall.  Live in the moment. Really pay attention to how it feels to clean your self. I always “meditate” before a shower.  I try to imagine all of the negative feelings I have coming up to my skin from my bones. When I shower, I just wash them away.  You can do it. I believe in you.  
jaxxtar [info] Yeah, I've been diagnosed with depression
yayabongocat [info] That's the thing...I live in a small town in India and having a mental disorder is like the worst thing that can happen to youI still remember if there would be any news of anyone suffering from depression my parents and the whole neighborhood would start talking about it... not in a bad way of course but like what would have been wrong, maybe he was being abused, maybe he was under pressure and all. One guy in my neighborhood also killed himself because of stress...im pretty sure he was not depressed but how the people made it to beIn my case I'm not suffering from these things at all... In fact, I'm afraid to die but the fact that if I'm diagnosed with depression how it's gonna change my ongoing normal life and moreover the life of people around me scares me
donotforgett [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14. My Nan knew I was going to the doctors but she didn’t know what for so my mum (who also has depression) said, “Let’s just say, like mother, like daughter.” And my Nan started crying and said, “Dear God, she’s pregnant!” Mum was a bit offended to say the least haha! 
bitchycatowner [info] I'm happy that you're at a better place now. I definitely have to move forward considering that I have been diagnosed with depression and currently taking antidepressants. It feels good to imagine a life independent of them. 
banni_ [info] I got diagnosed a couple weeks ago at age 20, the psychiatrist gave me a prescription for 10mg methylphenidate (xr) basically right away which I was \*very\* hesitant to take.I'm still not sure how to feel about it, really, however I have to agree with you. I was diagnosed with depression previously and have wasted days of my life for longer than I'd like to admit, upon trying the medication I immediately started getting things done (tidied up my room aswell). I feel less depressed and anxious ontop of everything even when the meds wear off.It's too soon for me to draw a conclusion personally, but I agree with your advice of trying meds!
ToonlinkFTW890 [info] I have been diagnosed with depression. I am on meds, but they aren't helping as much as I would like.
iamtinypotato [info] I was diagnosed with depression at a very young age. Around 11, I think. There were various factors that contributed to it, but depression isn't just caused by something. There never has to be a reason for it, and there isn't always one. That being said, my depression is partly inherited. I have a genetic disposition for it, so I guess I have my relatives to thank for that. I also have had a disability (epilepsy) since I was around two years old. I've had brain injury since I was eleven and depression and disability commonly go hand in hand. Things that have recently contributed to my depression are the death of my aunt in 2017 (she took her life), not having a job, and my current living situation.
IsAAcWeLCh [info] Honestly, and I'll probably be attacked for this, depression is not cutting yourself and attempting suicide. I have been diagnosed with depression and I have never once had a single suicidal thought cross my mind. Life doesn't need to be hard for you to be depressed. You can have a happy life, loving family, supportive friends, a great job, etc and still be depressed. Cutting is pathetic (that's the part that's gonna get me attacked) and suicide is stupid even if you're depressed or not.
amfournda [info] You are being far too defeatist. I was diagnosed with depression years ago too. I submitted my medical application and got a reply from the FAA. They want a bunch of information, but my AME says he definitely expects me to get a class three.I'm going to have to jump through some hoops and prove to the FAA that I'm fit to fly. I honestly expected that and it's fine. I'll do what needs to be done so I can go do the most amazing thing most humans will ever get to do. I think it's worth it, and if you love flying I can't see why you wouldn't be willing to at least try.I'm sorry you are feeling this way, but right now the biggest obstacle to you becoming a pilot appears to be yourself.
Anon12109 [info] Thank you for posting this, I feel the same way and reading that was incredibly validating. Here’s 2 top edad stories. Sorry for formatting I use mobile. 1. Finally opened up to edad about how Nmom was treating me and asked to live with him (they’re divorced). He said I can on one condition; that I keep a relationship with Nmom. Uhhh.. okay no thanks.2. Fast forward and living in a different state. Tell edad I’m thinking about moving because the city I live in has a housing crisis, high poverty and segregation. He tells me “It’s not about where you live. You need to make yourself perfect and then you will be happy anywhere”. He lives in a very safe/expensive neighborhood.He’s also told me he and Nmom blamed me for ruining their perfect family when I was diagnosed with depression. Ummm, how many therapists told you my depression was caused by you guys not working on your marital issues?? Nmom is terrible but eDads denial and lack of support is just gross to me.
RuMyster [info] kids have nothing to be depressed about at 14 years old, unless they were raped or abused etc, the amount of people I've known to claim they have depression is just sad, when they aren't. and I do care about people with "legit mental illness" because I'm not a piece of shit, I'm diagnosed with depression so it just annoys me a lot
jenneato [info] Not kidding, the year I was diagnosed with depression I would just lay on the floor and listen to that album start to finish. Sylvia is the song that gets me the most
utterlyuncertain [info] I've been in the same spot for years. I'm now 27 at the same shitty serving job about to be 28. I am skilled in visual arts and only have an associates since everyone tells me it's a waste of money. I'm dating a guy that my entire family dislikes but I dig him but I'm still back and forth with how I feel about our relationship. I've been diagnosed with depression and add recently. I have started gaining weight which is compounding all my issues. I want to be better but I am not sure what to do and I feel like time is slipping away. Do I finish the art degree? Do I start a new degree at age 28? I feel like I have lost who I am. 
WorldWarIIGaming [info] Hello, First time posting here, I have been diagnosed with depression for several years, now doctors think it might be seasonal affect disorder (not sure if that's the right term I don't remember). I have been on medication for about a year and a half now. Enough background, last week a person that I really care about as a friend actually managed to help me. She also has depression but masks it much better and is getting better currently, she actually got through to me and made me feel like someone really cared about me and actually wanted me to start towards a better place. I have started, it's not an easy road at all and I am still in a major pit but at least I am feeling a little better. (I hope I'm doing this right for this subreddits section please let me know if I'm not).
Loligxp [info] Hey, this feeling that you're faking it can actually be pretty normal, or we are just the same. I too always feel like I'm fake depressed and just too lazy, too stupid and all, but I have been diagnosed with depression.   If you feel like shit most of the time and you relate to these kinda things, don't be scared to seek help from a therapist. Even if it's not depression, your feelings are real and you deserve to feel well, and therapy can help.   I wish you the best.
Leona_K [info] They sent me home to get my medical card and calm down but I have to spent next 2 days in hospital for monitoring. I moved away from my family 1 year ago because they were abusive and tried couldn't handle it anymore. Honestly I don't have anyone else because since I was diagnosed with depression and anorexia everyone started ignoring and avoiding me. I was shocked to see those people cry when I overdosed yesterday so maybe I'll try and reach out to them when I get back to my job. Thanks for caring❤❤
LulaElizabethe [info] I remember an overwhelming emotional response when I had my daughter, but it took months for me to feel a true bond with her and I struggled a lot with PPD. It’s a bit of a long story but I didn’t find out I was pregnant until I was 4 months along. I took plan B hours after the “accident” and bled HEAVILY for a full month, but my little bean was still in there. I took several pregnancy tests because I was experiencing symptoms of pregnancy but they all kept coming out negative. My 7th test was a positive and the next day was confirmed at a free testing clinic. I was 19 and had been assaulted just under 2 years prior and was being quite reckless with drug and alcohol abuse. After I found out I was pregnant, the whole time all I could think about was how my daughter might have health issues because of my poor choices during the first few months when I didn’t know I was pregnant. I felt so guilty and afraid, but when she came out perfectly healthy (and quite big too!) I was overwhelmed with many emotions and remember crying with joy and relief. After that outburst of emotions though, I felt pretty... I guess “numb” can kind of describe it. I loved her but I remember feeling guilty because I was so depressed when other women around me were constantly doting over their newborn. I felt like there was something seriously wrong with me. My daughter will be 7 in January and I love her more than anything. I was diagnosed with depression many years ago along with ptsd and that does make things more difficult but reading things like this and knowing that I wasn’t alone when I didn’t feel that bond always helps reassure me that it’s something that happens to a lot of women and there wasn’t and isn’t anything wrong with me. Sorry for the long comment but I felt like sharing some of my experience. <3
ewokmassacre [info] Yes, definitely. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14.
lunamoeller [info] I am so glad to hear that you are getting the help you deserve. Being taken seriously can feel so incredible after years of people doubting you.I never really post anything, but when I got some feedback, it made me cry too haha. I am diagnosed with depression and avpd, so putting myself out there is a RARE occurence.
TheGreatMu [info] Ok so, I was also in the same boat. I was diagnosed with depression but stopped anti depressants about 2 months betore my trip.The trip was very enlightening and fun.If i were to give you advice it would be this:1. Stop anti depressants at least 2 weeks before trip, otherwise you can get serotonin syndrome and possibly have seizures/die.2. Make sure you trip in an environment you trust. I also suggest tripping with someone you can relax around, someone you can be open with.3. Make sure you have the next day free also, when i had my first trip i usually leave a few days as a trip usually has afterglow effects.4. Make sure you are feeling relatively good around when you take it. I have gone against this and taken it recklessly and it was not fun at all...5. Write helpful tips on your hands, like "breathe" "pain is temporary" "i took 200ug acid at 11am". They can help ground you.That's pre much it, at the top of my head at least!If you have any questions let me know bro, happy to help!
sovereign110 [info] I think my "baseline" has gotten worse over time, but I feel better these days than I did when I was younger because I'm actually on treatment.I lived with my dad from the ages of 10-17.  Dad's this sort of moron who doesn't think mental health is a "thing" and it's some kinda pseudoscience.  So despite being a very low-key kid who was drowsy all the time and had rare instances of cataplexy, he didn't give enough of a fuck to take me to any kind of psychiatrist/etc.I was put on an SSRI when I was diagnosed with depression at age 20, and have been on such antidepressants since (I'm 32 now).  Haven't had cataplexy since I was a teenager; it was likely being accidentally treated for a decade before my actual narcolepsy diagnosis.Wasted most of my 20's doing what alcoholics do, and had to drop out of school due to pancreatitis at age 25 (not before totally fucking up my academic record, of course). The daytime fatigue got worse and worse. A neuropsych evaluation confirmed attention deficit when I was 26, and I finally had a couple sleep studies at age 30.  Rapid onset REM and etc. confirmed N, though I was already on effective stimulant medicine for the ADHD.  So symptoms are under control now, though they are definitely worse un-medicated. I just wish the diagnosis came sooner, before the crash and burn, back when I still gave a shit. So it goes.
inadequatepuzzlpiece [info] Hi I am also 24. I have been diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia. Nice to meet you.
Cold_Albatross [info] Thank you for responding. >unless you actually do something to make other dislike youI'm myself. That's reason enough for others. Means I look bitter, serious, angry or depressed. Apparently, society thinks young people shouldn't already look bitter.And if I would smile at the employee that would mean for the layman that I don't have depression anymore and I'm just too lazy or don't want to have a job. Then there's another reason - I seek help from them but I don't get better. Which is like a slap in the face for them. It frustrates them, they get disappointed or angry. >negative self imageI neither hate or like myself. I'm just there, getting feedback from others (doctors and all people who have to deal with me).I'm diagnosed with depression.>know how much negative self image and depression are linked, it's just the experience of depression isn't always as clear as what is typical of it due to the pervasity of it.If I don't fake being normal other people would agree with me that I suck at being a human. That means my experience is actually true.>are you in Australia ?No, I'm from another country
UnderpopulatedPig [info] As someone with an easy job with good pay I find my job to be very meaningless. I’m incredibly bored and just want to quit at times and pursue something else but I can’t because I am the sole provider for my wife, who is a stay at home mom of our two girls. I have been diagnosed with depression before I got married, I don’t know if it’s come back or if it ever went away but I’m seeing myself differently than I use to be and that’s not how I want to be as my daughters grow up. With the stress of living paycheck to paycheck I can’t help feeling like this.These reasons are why I support Andrew Yang! He sees the impact of meaningless jobs, mental health and overall wellbeing. Bernie is cool for wanting a minimum wage increase but I already make more than $15 an hour while my wife makes $0 doing the hard work of raising our kids.  $15 an hour would’ve be good in 2012 or some other time but now it’s time for UBI.
Annia12345 [info] I don't get it either.I was diagnosed with depression in high school. A girl I was somewhat friends with was actually mad at me and went around saying I was faking it because I wasn't sad all the time.She constantly talked about her "depression" that hadn't been diagnosed by a doctor and was "sad" all the time.I hid my depression from everyone but my family and a few close friends because I didn't want to attract attention to it. I didn't want people to notice me.It sucks how people do this. There is nothing fun or great about being depressed or having depression.
lemonslip [info] It’s really common.I have immigrant parents who basically worked 3 jobs at my age. Bruh I don’t hear the end of it.Yes my life is significantly better, but it sure as heck isn’t perfect. I once had my father tell me to “just stop being sad” and to “reconnect with god” when I was diagnosed with depression, and then blamed me for my unhappiness. “When I was your age, I did X, Y and Z and I still wanna wasn’t depressed because I had faith in god”It’s okay to be unhappy. No one has it perfect. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
saramajara [info] I mean “good” is relative right? I was trained to be a professional athlete from age 6 to 16. I did not enjoy that. I was gang raped at age 14, I did not enjoy that. I was diagnosed with depression at 14, but had times of happiness in between episodes. When I was 21 a stranger tried to slit my throat and my partner stabbed him a dozen times and went to jail for 7 years for it, and I was left alone, dead broke, without shoes, and in possession of his puppy over 2000 miles from where I knew a sole, without anyone to help, that was not good either. But looking back, the things I experienced and overcame, the connections I made, ect... were freakin awesome compared to what I’ve been feeling the last several years.So I can’t help but feel resentful when you call me lucky, like I had 24 years of bliss. I didn’t. I was just able to manage my depression and trauma, and find moments worth living for and relationships worth thriving for until I was about 24.
haymansafc [info] Before anyone suggests to me "*oh, just change jobs then*"...it needs to be pointed out that like many others here, I have ongoing financial commitments. It's not always as straightforward as walking out of one job and straight into another. I did change jobs nine years ago (give or take a few months) and within months - faced exactly the same problems. Not only that - I also deal with Social Anxiety, which given I deal with, shouldn't come as a surprise. Meeting new people is incredibly difficult. At work, I deal with being 'singled out' on a whole range of things, often the last to know company/business news (proven to be on purpose on a few occasions), stigmatised, mocked, talked about behind my back (which I have had evidence of), misjudged, misunderstood, falsely accused and joked about. Despite all this, working in a relatively social environment which has literally forced me to work on my Social Anxiety (some success, I'll admit), they often wonder why I turn-down offers to go out. On the occasions where I do, I face many of the same issues and made to feel three inches tall. I'm also told, quite often, that near enough everything is my fault, I have to work on myself and only have myself to blame. I listen to advice (often repeated), carry it out, make my best efforts but find it's all for nothing. The situation remains the same at the end of my efforts and then it's merely repeated to me again. It honestly feels as if I'm playing some sort of 'game' of which I simply cannot win. So far, I've been diagnosed with depression on four separate occasions, most people can't figure out why and then roll their eyes when I sink back down into silence, effectively withdrawing from society, within months of coming off medication. If I had considerably more money or a lottery win...basically enough to sustain myself through to retirement...I would quite happily live the life of a hermit. It's certainly the lesser of both evils.
PogothePenguin [info] This is how I feel about 80% of the time. I am diagnosed with depression, but it's more of the lack of feeling. I'm just...living. I understand where you're coming from.  I wouldn't say it's bad, but if you haven't yet, I would talk to a professional. I drug my feet for a long time and she really helped me after a while. I still don't feel feelings and I feel disconnected, but she's helped me come to terms with it so it doesn't weigh me down.
RickMunoz0402 [info] I think the same thing. I was diagnosed with depression last November, but after talking with my therapist from day-to-day, he and I are pretty sure I’ve been depressed for way longer. That makes me think if I have any other undiagnosed issues, and it definitely seems like it.
libelulas3v3n [info] I've struggled with tinnitus since I was 17, the time I was diagnosed with depression. I'm now 24. Honestly, I as well thought I was eventually going to kill myself when it all began. I thought it would never disappear nor get better. Truth is, from e to age of 18 to 24, I didn't notice it. I didn't even remember it. Recently, I became very depressed again, and tinnitus is back. It scared me a lot, since I had almost forgotten about it. I panicked all over again. But I'm trying to get used to it again. There are so many people with this condition that are still able to live their lives. Even me, with more or less struggle. And so will you, believe me. Right now, it's all very new. Eventually, your brain will have no option but to get used to it. Just remember, it's not a threat, you'll be okay.Try to see a doctor. They can help, in case your tinnitus is caused by some underlying condition that may be treatable. There are also hearing aids that can help, if you're eligible. You can search for exercises on the web, that might ease tinnitus.At night, leave the fan on, or a white noise machine. Or even a soft background music, something soothing like rain or other sound of your preference. It will help mask the ringing.Stay strong my friend. We're here for you. Your not alone in this. We all felt like you at once.
alwayspickingupcrap [info] I was diagnosed with depression for 30 yrs before getting correctly diagnosed with BP2. Over all those years, I thought I was essentially ‘lazy’ and would have ‘weak’ periods when I just gave in to my essential nature (with self loathing). In the in-between times I would ‘pull myself together’ to catch up on my neglected tasks and then work ahead as much as possible to get ahead in prep for my next ‘lazy relapse.’  This was my identity.Maybe with age and exhaustion, the pattern unraveled and now I’m discovering (correctly medicated) I can be someone that I like better.
Paws_of_Justice [info] People say Mr Robot is about the grand delusions of its characters but I disagree. Mr Robot is, and has always been, about coping mechanisms.Elliot had dissassociative identity disorder. He fought with his own alternate personalities even though he built them to help him. They are all flawed and make mistakes just like their host. They cannot be smarter than him, they are him. White Rose experienced the trauma of losing her lover due to her environment. She hates her environment and seeks to find a different environment as a result. Elliot created a coping mechanism from within himself to assume control in the real world. White Rose constructed a machine in the outside world that would have solved her problem and let her escape. Elliot hacks people. White Rose hacks time. White Rose's machine is her undertaking, her hard work, and her coping mechanism. Both characters have trauma they are inadequately equipped to deal with. Their coping mechanisms are flawed, and not as effective as they could be.I think this show focuses on mental illness really well and we get to see flawed and broken coping mechanisms of the characters as a result.I am diagnosed with depression and GAD and the show was impactful to me in a way that no other show was.My own coping mechanism hurts my heart, strains my body and despite me knowing how much damage it causes, I don't know how to function otherwise. I have no idea how to have a healthy coping mechanism. I understand Elliot and White Rose having self destructive coping mechanisms. Don't we all?
ReclaimingInsanity [info] Before I was diagnosed with depression and OCD, I found talking about my mental health really scary and hard to accept as well.Like one of the posters above, talking to your doctor about how you're feeling can really help. Writing can really help! On the advice of my consellor I started a diary, and its really helped me cope.
brenna55 [info] No. I was diagnosed with depression. By a doctor. You dont have any say. Stop stalking my posts
elziion [info] I’m a 21 years old lady.Ever since I was little, I was always a kind hearted person that would feel people’s emotions really easily. I grew up with Catholic values, which made me believe to always be kind to each other. There are some values that I refuse. As I got older, I started listening to other’s people spiritualities, and found myself strongly connected to nature, the universe, God, and Ra (I know, it’s weird). My best friend is my soulmate, in a non-romantic way. We connect on very deep levels.So, every since I was a kid, I had always been bullied. For whatever reason. I was the first in my class. I was quiet, and introverted, and shy. I never really bragged, but demonstrated that I could do lots of things, instead. I would always help kids that were struggling, my peers, sang for old people... But since my step father left my mother (my biological father left us when I was 4) I have been diagnosed with depression. It has been 5 years now. My stepfather was my model. He was very observant and would be able to tell, like me, when something was wrong. Sometimes, he was so observant, he would predict possibilities and theories that always turned out to be true. (He called it the Holy Spirit). I developed the same.It caused me mood swings, and eventually all my friends started talking bad about me. I left.They came back a few months later. We apologized, and I started feeling a bit better.Then, I was sexually assaulted by my ex bf. It was three years ago.Ever since my rape, I have been suffering from PTSD, Major Depression Disorder, Anxiety, Suicidal Tendencies, trust issues...I’ve had vivid dreams, sleep paralysis... But, I tried my best not to give up, to hold on, to give myself hopes and dreams...I believed that karma has always had something beautiful for me. And last summer, I met a gentleman. Who treated me well. And because of my mental health, I screwed up. And I saw him recently and he’s emotionally unstable. My best friend is also unsure about my situation, and tonight I told her that I felt like I had no purpose in this world. That I felt empty. That I felt like I didn’t matter...
Yesn1122 [info] I was told, "You arent depressed."After returning home from a doctors visit where I was diagnosed with depression
Thrones1 [info] That is pretty helpful. I downloaded a CBT app to try out. Most everything else I was already pretty versed in but I always appreciate reading through again. Thank you.I think our illnesses are different. I have been diagnosed with depression and not a sleep disorder. The physical exhaustion I’m pretty sure is just a symptom of a low serotonin production. I’m pretty sure that I have BPD after doing some research on it but have yet to speak to a professional. The treatments for it are near identical to depression though so it doesn’t matter too much if I just keep doing my routine of depression relief.
oxford_serpentine [info] I was too negative for her after I was diagnosed with depressionShe ended the relationship via text message. 
incognitomiscreant [info] What pisses me off is he doesn't know the context behind this. I've been struggling my whole life, I've been diagnosed with depression by multiple professionals over the years. Why can't people just trust that I came to a depression forum to vent *because I have depression* and THAT'S WHY LIFE IS SO HARD FOR ME RIGHT NOW augh I'm so fucking alone
VanillaPupper [info] Hello OP, I often have the same worries. I used to have a toxic friend who made me her emotional vent. Later on, when I was diagnosed with depression, I worried that I would impose the same burden on my current friends. I believe good friends genuinely want to see us become better. They won't mind if we're having an off-day and need to be alone. They won't mind if we need to talk to someone for hours. A close friendship is not all about experiencing the highs together, but also the lows - that's what makes relationships strong. I think the best thing you can do is take active steps to improve your well-being. Listen to their advice - you don't need to follow it, but consider it. Remind them you're grateful for their help. Let them know they can tell you if you're ever being too much to handle and trust that they will communicate this to you if that ever happens. Friendship is reciprocal: check in on them. Be a listener sometimes. If they ever need a friend, be that friend. I think if you do this, it will lessen your feeling of being a burden. I hope I helped!
hmmmmphhhhhh [info] I was diagnosed with depression in middle school and that’s around the time I started looking for escapes. I self harmed, and had different disordered eating habits. Once I tried drugs I became obsessed with the altered state of consciousness and tried to play my use off as experimentation.
mafiascreation [info] OMG YES!!!! I'm diagnosed with depression as is, so if I don't catch on to the fact that its PMDD time I have a really really hard time dealing with how much more depressed I get.    I'm 28 and was diagnosed around 18.... its been 120 periods, my brain should know better!!! Alas
spicybruschetta [info] Nope! I was diagnosed with depression years before it had worsened enough for me to become suicidal.  
PioneerLeviticus [info] I feel your pain. I was diagnosed with depression after my first year of uni and completely fucked my second year by rarely attending and buckling under the pressure of deadlines. I also lied to my parents and told them I was doing well. I even lied to my girlfriend about it.I spoke to my personal tutor about it and he recommended I come clean to my parents and restart the year, so I left in late feb and will be restarting my second year this sept. I feel alot better now that I have a chance to better myself and start again. I'm sorry I know that this won't help you but hopefully it'll be able to help anyone like me who can relate to your situation.I really hope everything goes well for you.
R_Plr42 [info] Anyone can be depressed and it not be easily recognized from an outsiders perspective. A lot of depressive symptoms deal with internal thoughts and monologue that other people may not know about. Can someone seem to have a “perfect” life and still be depressed, absolutely. Just look at all the famous people who have committed suicide from their battles with depression. As far as knowing if you have depression, I was never one to self diagnose. I’d always think to myself “what if I’m faking it” or “what if I make my symptoms seem worse than they are”  “other people have it worse than me.” Then I went to a psychologist and psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with depression. And then a few months later I went to the hospital for suicidal ideations. That was over a year ago and I still doubt myself, I still wonder if I’m faking it, I still tell myself other people have it worse than me and so I have no reason to feel this bad. Even though I wake up everyday and think about how much I want to die, I still have doubts. But that’s just another way for our minds to play tricks on us. Long story short, people who seem to have perfect lives can have depression. And if you’ve done any amount of research on the symptoms of depression and felt you had some do yourself a favor and see a psychologist. Get evaluated. So if you need help you’re able to get it.As a reference; The DSM-V (diagnostic and statistic manual) lists the following and symptoms of and criteria for diagnosis of depression;At least 5 of the following symptoms have to have been present during the same 2-week period (and at least 1 of the symptoms must be diminished interest/pleasure or depressed mood) [2] :Depressed mood: For children and adolescents, this can also be an irritable moodDiminished interest or loss of pleasure in almost all activities (anhedonia)Significant weight change or appetite disturbance: For children, this can be failure to achieve expected weight gainSleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia)Psychomotor agitation or retardationFatigue or loss of energyFeelings of worthlessnessDiminished ability to think or concentrate; indecisivenessRecurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or specific plan for committing suicideHope this helps
jake_1316 [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 12, I resonate with most of what you've described. There are going to be numerous people that don't understand, peers, teachers, your parents, just know that it's not because of anything you've done. All I can offer in the way of advice; prioritize your health, both physical and mental. Do what makes you feel good, keep a healthy sleep schedule and make sure to eat regularly. Everything gets harder if you aren't physically healthy. Given that counseling isn't for you, I suggest journaling. Just as a way to process negative emotion.Hope you're well.
ifookedyouremom [info] I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, honestly today is still somehow the happiest period In my life. I was in a really bad state last night and the depression was definitely higher. But I don’t feel worthless or hopeless, it’s just frustrating to deal with this. Because I really do love her as a friend. And in all honesty I 100% want to keep loving her as my friend. That’s what makes this aggregating, like I said I honestly don’t want a romantic relationship, it’s just more hassle than it’s worth right now. And having feelings that feel inescapable (I know they’re not) is just frustrating to me.
texanatheartt [info] Hi. Yes I'm diagnosed with depression and insomnia.
smalldoggobigpupper [info] When I was diagnosed with depression at 17, my dad called my mom to tell her my diagnosis. He told me that she said back to him, "Why is she depressed!?! She has this and this...." She also said, "Why is she on these meds!?!"
blemishedcucumber [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14 (I'm 25 now) but I missed so much school due to that, so maybe you're dealing with some sort of depression or something? Never hurts to get it checked out if you're able to.
HopelessBea [info] I personally told my homeroom teacher that I was diagnosed with depression and she actually became more understanding. She would sometimes ask me how I was doing, but mostly, she was just aware that I was going trough some stuff and she didn't mind if I slept in or sometimes took a day off from school. If you know your teacher is understanding then yea, you should tell her, you don't have to mention hospitalization.
Flashmode1 [info] I have been diagnosed with depression by a MD. It’s not something you around sharing with everyone.
12086478 [info] My mum broke up with her boyfriend when they were in their early 20s, she had my sister, she couldn't be with him, though she loved him alot.He took the breakup hard and ended up hanging himself behind his family house, his parents found him and a note. The note mentioned my mum, I'm not sure exactly what it said but I know it put the blame on her a little. His family Turned on my mum.Shes never forgiven herself for it, anytime one of us (her kids, there's 5 of us now) talks about suicide, she tells us the story and makes us promise we will never end our lives, that there's always a way to fix things, always somthing good about to happen.I was diagnosed with depression as a teen and she's always been the best with it, always helps,However she's always worried that one day she will go to wake me up and I won't.For that reason, no matter how bad I feel, how hard things get, how miserable life may seem, I will keep going, for my mum, for the person she lost.
swimmerboy5817 [info] Right? I've been diagnosed with depression for almost 6 years, see a therapist every week, a psychiatrist every month, and was even hospitalized for it 18 months ago, yet sometimes I still wonder if I really have depression or I am just a shitty person. 
shortkid113 [info] The weight effects are very different from person to person. Before being diagnosed BP2 I was diagnosed with depression. I was put on SSRIs for over a year. My weight went from normal to -20 pounds to +10 pounds after around a year on one SSRI. Meds can mess with weight, but it varies from person to person. Also, remember you are taking these meds to help you with a serious illness. If a little weight gain or loss is the only problem, maybe learn to be ok with it. It takes time. Most meds will have their ups and downs to them. You should put how your mind and you feel over physical effects like that. Your mind being happy and healthy is more important than physical appearance. Just for info, I'm on welbutrin now after 2 years of trial and error with different meds. I don't have much difference in weight from this med. I have had weight changes with every other med I have taken, but it's well worth it if it might be the one to bring peace and normality back to your life. Although I'm to a point where I would do about anything to have normal thoughts back with a normal mind.
yeeters-apprentice [info] Thanks, I guess that's one of the things I left out, I'm diagnosed with depression and adhd and take lexapro and adderall for them. They help a bit but this stuff that happened with the girl absolutely destroyed me. She was the first gal I actually liked and she did a 180 on me and cast me aside, and now I'm kind of doing that to my friends. Only, instead of getting popular like her I've become an absolute god at minecraft while still distancing myself from everyone I love and care about. I'm just afraid that college is going to be a repeat of highschool where I'm alone with nobody to talk to or share my experiences with. Hell, if I told anyone any of this in person I'd just be told I'm being a pussy and to suck it up, which is the main reason I've sealed with this shit for so long, I've just tried to suck it up. I'm going to try and start spending time with my good friend again and hopefully that'll motivate me to start talking to people again.
The_Funkefizer [info] Exercise definetely helps me. I have been diagnosed with depression myself and am on anti depressants. I never really exercised untill my depression, but whenever I do I feel better for a while. I find running especially helpfull, I put some music on and push myself to keep on going. I am usually exhausted when I come back, but it gets your dopamine and endorphin levels up so you actually feel better. Works better than any medicine I've tried! 9 out of 10 times I don't feel like it and I really have to push myself. But everytime I go I feel better and it also gives me a feeling that I'm in control of my thoughts.
Moribund42 [info] I am one of these people. I have dysmorphia and feel so strongly that I'm a winged elf/demonic general and that I'm in the wrong place and wrong time. I feel like I should be dead on the battlefield. I've been diagnosed with depression and disassociative identity disorder. I take a handful of medication and have had ECT. My inability to handle reality gets so great sometimes I pull on my hair and scream and cry and harm myself. I've attempted suicide several times and often feel like I can't be saved. It's absolutely maddening, especially when it's so hard to talk about to anyone without being viewed as completely insane or stupid, but it's very real to me. I try so hard to accept reality but just can't do it. I hate the body I'm in, I hate what I see in the mirror. I don't know what will happen to me, I don't know if madness will take me or if I can accept what I really am - no amount of evidence changes this mind that feels so truly to be not human. I have phantom limb syndrome of wings which I can't take away! Laughing at people like us is torturous when we're tortured already... I'm thankful for this question, maybe some understanding can come of it to people who think we make this up for fun or whatever they may believe.
chaseandwin232 [info] Here are some problems with your statements, although I really appreciate you taking the time to put this together. Really, I do. There's nothing in my life that gives me joy anymore. I used to play video games all the time non-stop until like the last month where I've become completely disinterested in them. I'm not satisfied with my guitar playing, but I'm also not getting any better, so that's a dead end as well. The dream I have, ironically, is to play music for a living, but the success of that depends on whether or not people like what I play, and I imagine people don't really want covers of 40 year old songs. And as for my depression, I've been to see 6 therapists and 3 psychiatrists and one outpatient program that includes some of those therapists and one psychiatrist, I'm on 7 different meds, I've been diagnosed with depression, add/adhd, and borderline personality disorder, so that's that
Sh0v3l_Kn1ght [info] I was depressed before the move, and I should have put that in the post. I was diagnosed with depression a few months before she told us about the move. It just made it so much worse and for some reason it's hard for me to take my medication. She knows i'm miserable, and it doesn't make sense to me as to why she would keep saying such things to me. Its ridiculous, and I wish I could figure out why this stuff keeps happening.
KarrieWayne [info] I was diagnosed with depression some years ago and put on medication. It just made it worse and I was on the verge of loosing my husband and thinking of ending my own life. He told me the meds seemed to be making me not give a shit and that's exactly what they was doing. I thought they was helping bc of course they WAS making me not give a shit. But in doing that I was hurting him. A lot. So I stopped taking them and after a year( the time it took to get my brain back to not being dependant on some drug) I was able to put my life somewhat back together. I was able to communicate better with people bc I knew that in order to be happy in life I had to learn to except the things I couldn't change and to taking chances and just be myself. Instead of just keeping my emotions pent up inside I let them out but at a slow rate so to not blow up( to vent I call it) I used to think if there was only a place I could have someone to just listen and let me talk things could be so much better. But there wasn't back then. At the hight of my depression I lost my home and was ready to end it all. The only way I got through it besides my husband was to make myself understand that my depression was coming from in myself. I was making myself depressed bc I felt like my life wasn't what was considered as normal in sociaty. Wasn't what God wanted and had no meaning.  So I decided that I no longer was going to try so hard to fit in. I was just going to do what I felt was right by the 10 comandments and to treat everything in life as I believed god wanted and also that God isn't a way of life but guidelines. I started thinking that if there is a god he only helps those who help themselves. Everything happens for a reason even if the reason isn't for me to benefit or understand. I had to teach myself not to depend on God but on myself. That God is an addiction and a crutch to most people but was not going to be to me anymore. Also that anything the movies and TV had made life out to be was a fairytale and not how ANYBODIES life really was. There are no happy endings waiting around the corner and no light waiting at the end of a tunnel.  It is what it is and if I had the power to change something I didn't like than change it but if I couldn't then except it and move on. Don't dwell on the bad things in life, just let them go. So what if I don't have any friends to hang out with and all people do is make life uncomfortable because of their expectations. I used to worry about what people thought of me and what they said about me. I don't anymore! I don't care and life is so much better for it. If you don't like me, good then that's your problem and you can just stay away from me. I am The one who is important and I am the only one ( besides my husband) I should be making happy. If I get up in the morning  and don't feel like brushing my hair so what! It is my hair and I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks of me bc my hair is a mess. If someone thinks I am ugly then they don't have to look at me. As long as I feel comfortable with myself then that's what I need. And that all we have to look forward to in life is death and to make the best of it before it's gone.  Life is so much less stressful less depressing with this way of thinking for me. I no longer worry about the struggles of the expectations of others. Life is what it is and that's all it is. You get what you put in and if things are not how i want them then only I can change them. No one knows how I feel or do they care. Be me and don't depend on anyone but myself. Make me happy and in doing so I can live. Everyone has their own problems in this life and no matter what I should only care for my own. Just be me😁 life isn't great but oh well it is what it is and if today is bad then there is always tomorrow to hope for. No one really has a pourpose for living we just do. And the only garentee in life is death. So live while you can!
Rhaenysknees [info] I have a couple close friends luckily enough but it just saddens me that no one in my family give a shit, especially when I have been diagnosed with depression and it's not exactly a secret. Plus sitting alone for two hours at your brothers wedding, starring off into the distance and vaguely watching other people dance is usually a good sign imo.
zac_taylor [info] I was diagnosed with depression, PTSD and GAD.
JadeyBear7 [info] Hi there, I'm sorry you're feeling this way, honestly your story eerily echoes my own! However I'm F and now 25, I've just come to tell you it will be OK.I also want to ask if you've ever been to a Dr to speak about your concerns?I was diagnosed with depression and GAD - I am positive that the GAD is a direct result of my upbringing and, like you, being completely invalidated by everyone I trusted. But getting help and advice with mental health is a must for your own health.One thing I'd like you to take away from this comment though is that you are not weak, you may feel it, but the fact that you are still going and also identifying that there is something wrong means you are alot stronger than you realise. You've been able to make it this far, you will make it further. :)And also - if you ever want a private chat to vent I'm always around, I like to try and provide a positive safe space for discussion and venting because I know how hard it can be speaking to reach out to those close to us for fear of ridicule or invalidation 💜
MieczyslawRakowski [info] I was diagnosed with depression and ever since i started taking meds everything is better, talk with your parents you want to talk with a therapist, it will help you, trust me
Kitchen_Moose [info] I'm 14. I was bullied by old classmates last school year. I was diagnosed with depression about two weeks ago. I was discharged from the psychiatric hospital one week ago. I went on a walk about three days ago, and I happened to see them as I passed by. One of them caught up to me on a scooter. Lucky for me, they never liked to be physical, and I knew more than likely I was going to be harassed to try and make me and easy target again. They asked what I'd been doing for the past month. I said "therapy" they asked "Why?" I simply said "depression" They responded with "That shit is fake. grow up." On the bright side, I'm now going to a different school then them, and the kids there seem much nicer.
mustardyellow123 [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 12, and have been medicated since 13. I’m 26 now, and have been hospitalized on two occasions for attempting suicide. I cannot tell you how many therapists/counselors I’ve seen. I think I’m more than sad, but thank you for assuming.
ChaoticBraindead [info] You shouldn't make a be-all end-all excuse as an out for your mind to resolve your cognitive dissonance to justify your actions. I've been diagnosed with depression too, but I'd never use that as an excuse to not do something. That frame of mind even further leads to problems motivating.
timmyunknown [info] I am diagnosed with depression, you going to cart me off even though I was born here?
cursedbymo2 [info] It's not  schizophrenia, doctor said so. It's like my own voice, but of evil me. Yes it wanted me dead so badly, but i resisted and i hear it no more. Voice it's not my problem, it's depression i have now is a problem. I am an vegetable for now, and i'm trying to overcome this state. I was diagnosed with depression with derealization and depersonalization as unusual symptoms but not enough to be diagnosed with anything else including  schizophrenia. this is useless information for you but i'm telling that to prove that i don't have schizophrenia and i will be kicked out of any medical center or any help center. Because i'm not suicidal, not harming anyone, i want to live that life, i have desires and dreams, i just can't achieve them because i am vegetable. Almost anyone will say that i'm doing crap and i need get over it, but i know it's real mental problem but who would recognize that won't help me for free.  I have no idea why i'm telling this, i just want to help myself. I am sorry, because i guess as i said nobody would help me because my problem isn't that serious, so i just wasting everybody's time. Still, i got nothing to do for now.
alexshldshutup [info] I am actually quick to accept problems too. When I was diagnosed with depression I was just like "okay, that's it then. I do have depression." But until I can know for sure, I'll always doubt myself.You're right, I'm probably not ready to feel better. Every time I display "normal" behaviours I feel like a fraud.
TastesLikeTongues [info] >Absolute and total copeWhen speaking to uninitiated people, it might help if you explain terms. >The bluepill life probably seems real from your perspective, although behind the scenes, You claimed every man taller than 6'2" fantasizes about killing shorter men. I'm telling you that's just not true. Regardless of whether I have some sort of fantastical dream about romance, women, or human sexuality- you should realize at the very least that belief of yours is literally false. And I doubt I'm the only person taller than 6ft who doesn't want to kill you.>Whites have height and height makes might and might makes right.We live in a world where intelligence is probably more important than height. If you want societal power, and you're reasonably intelligent and work hard, all things being equal, you can get to a position where you'll do well in society- you'll have that "might" you're referring to. You'll be desirable in many respects. And while I do agree that societal conventions, especially those surrounding morality, aren't a product of rational investigation, it seems pretty ill conceived to think its the result of the raw power of height. And ofc. no one denies height plays into attractiveness, but its *a* factor, you could easily make the distinction on interpupillary distance or jawline or nose shape. >The human male caste system is made up of breeders, feeders, and bleeders. The breeders are the apex predators who enslave the feeders and sometimes kill the bleeders for sport. The feeders are average males aka BETA males and they work for and provide for females and the spawns of the breeders. They are the most fearful of chad and the state's intimidation and are the slaves who keep the chad harem/eugenics slave-ciety running. They aren't good enough to be respected and seen as high quality breeding material by women but they aren't ugly enough to be suicidal and nihilistic so they are the perfect slaves because they fear authority and cling to their pitiful lives rather than risk it to escape and become sigmas or die and be set free from their shame. The bleeders are the untermensch, we are killed for sport or kill ourselves or become suicidal and nihilistic "terrorists". Literally lone wolves, they are seen as too weak and sickly for the pack (the cuckolding chad harem of male slavery). Do you have, as I requested, any sort of respected studies published about this phenomenon to rely on? A lot of blackpillers believe this type of stuff, but its largely not in line in with what academics who study human sexuality and relationships believe. >They aren't good enough to be respected and seen as high quality breeding material by women but they aren't ugly enough to be suicidal and nihilistic so they are the perfect slaves because they fear authority and cling to their pitiful lives rather than risk it to escape and become sigmas or die and be set free from their shame. I mean you can be good looking, or at least average and still be suicidal, depressed, etc. I was diagnosed with depression and a host of issues when I was 14 and retroactively told that I was probably depressed even before then. I attempted to take my life several times in my teens, with differing levels of success, and then very recently attempted to do so again. This time I bankrupted myself also. None of this had to do with my romantic woes.And where do asexual people like me exist? Or gay/bi men?>we are killed for sport or kill ourselves or become suicidal and nihilistic "terrorists". In the industrialized world, where are "bleeders" killed for sport? Sure there's serious mental health problems throughout the population, made worse so by the way social media seems to concentrate/reduce interactions, but I can't think of situations where some underclass is killed in any sort of systematized way for the enjoyment of others. There are poor impoverished individuals who serve in the military, there are ghettos where interactions between law enforcement and citizens lead to increased death, etc. but nothing like you've described. >although behind the scenes, all of your non chad friends are getting cheated on or raising the children of other men unknowingly. What's wrong with raising the children of other men? I've dated women who had children with other men. Hell, I'm pretty sure if I ever have a family, asexuality aside, I would prefer to adopt to bringing in children to the world. My life isn't, and most (or at least a significant portion is) people aren't obsessed with sex and the cultivating of future generations that bear their genetic material.>Human sexuality is the root of all evil. All of the evil humans do to other humans is related to sex in some way. I mean I'm shitty sometimes to a person at work or at the store. I'm asexual. Where's the connection? Also, there are far greater moral evils than the stuff humans do to each other. What about environmental damage, non-human animal suffering, etc. A claim that strong and universal is either going to have many exceptions, or its going to be something that's going to be so indirect and diluted that a similar claim could be made about anything. And anyways, that's a pretty poor idea. Better candidates exist, look at moral philosophy if you're interested. Buddhists found the attachment to the ego to the primary source of non-physical suffering. >The only way to have a society where all humans have a reason to live and will be treated with dignity and respect is through guided evolution via the use of artificial wombs, waifubots, genetic modification, transhumanism, and facial surgery. Humans will always be worthless primate scum until we are all asexually reproducing and androgynous. I mean I'm all for transhumanism, but why do you think we're going to be better off in that weird system where we're all some androgynous people using artificial wombs? People are still going to be myopic, ignorant, suffering from cognitive dissonance. All of which suggests that problems in the world ("evil") have their roots outside of sex. And why do you care about reproduction so much? I mean I'm personally an anti-natalist and would be indifferent if life were snuffed out on earth the next day. It seems more like unhealthy vanity to desire to keep the human species existing for the sake of existing. >Until then, we are all born enemies of each other, everyone is a hypocrite, there is no such thing as love, and the blood is on everyone's hands.What is "love" to you and why do you think everyone lacks such a thing? What about platonic love, or the love between friends/family? I'm not a sexual competitor to other men since I'm basically not in the race, but I still love my friends (male/female/etc.). Of course I'm a hypocrite and suffer from moral/epistemic failings, I fail to do many things- but my failings are independent of whether I'm sexually desired by other people. And key is that there's still love. >become suicidal and nihilistic "terrorists". Literally lone wolvesOf interest is that some anti-social mass shooters aren't that ugly. Think of Nikolas Cruz who was responsible for the Stoneman Douglas shooting. He wasn't ugly by any metric. I'd actually say he was reasonably attractive. If you're so concerned about this hierarchy why not go into STEM or Law or some other field where once you pass through its easy to get a relatively well paying job? You'll makeup for your perceived failings by succeeding in that realm. Then you can attract a partner easily enough, you can even go do a paternity test if you're that concerned about raising someone else's child. The problem seems easily resolved.
BlueImmigrant [info] I totally get you! I was diagnosed with depression at 4 years old, my parents flipped out and never took me to another psychiatrist again. Because in their mind i wasn't "mentally deranged", i was just spoiled and ungrateful. 20 years later, they are still caught in the same discourse. I love them, but they are pathetic, especially since there is a history of mental illness in my family.Our parents will probably never change their ways. But we can be different from them and learn from their mistakes.
balooni [info] Similar story to yours. I went to a Catholic school up until high school; granted, it wasn’t a wealthy school at all (decently poor sadly, I love everyone at that school.) so all the kids were down to Earth and cool. I was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia when I was around 14 and it just really made me start to question the idea of “God is testing your strength.” I can see how people believe that, but from my viewpoint I just can’t imagine an almighty being, who can control everything, allowing mental illness, physical illness, poverty, murder, etc to be so common. It just doesn’t make sense to me at all. Crazy how similar some peoples experiences are. 
Ylong [info] I have been diagnosed with depression recently and i have been taking medication for maybe close to 2 months.although it is just helping a little.you can use medisave to pay for your consultation if you are diagnosed with major depression.(if im not wrong) 
Sarahsota [info] I'm diagnosed with depression and gender Dysphoria but I think I'm coping, I honestly really feel "existentially happy", but I figured I'd respond anyway.1. No, even when nothing requires my attention my mind is racing. It's not constant self hatred anymore though, it's that my mind has very loud mental music going on in there all the time. It's so loud and I really dislike it but at least it's not thoughts of suicide2. Dissatisfied. I'm transgender, so if I had to choose if I was born into this life, I would choose not to be born.3. Usually just the music, I'm not the best person to ask because I'm a music major, so my homework is usually practicing and that's much more involved than just pen and paper homework. In fact, while I'm working in the practice room, my mind is usually quiet. For my music theory homework, it's sometimes the chords I'm writing, or it's quiet.4. Depends. I don't look forward to waking up exactly. I have to get up at 7:30 every day and I have class and practice until 9:30 pm. But I do look forward to the experiences I'll have the next day.
HeUlMi [info] I am diagnosed with depression and my school literally doesn't give a shit but if some girl everyone cares. Take my upvote.
johnlime3301 [info] Finished 3rd year here. I'm so tempted to say yes, but I am diagnosed with depression, and it's up to the point where I am taking a medical break next semester. I'll probably only be able to see your posts in 3rd person.  My main field is reinforcement learning. I have implemented Diversity Is All You Need and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) via PyTorch, one of which is in a public repo and have recently made a video about (this pretty much sums up my understanding of the field).PPO Implementation: [https://github.com/johnlime/rlkit\_extension](https://github.com/johnlime/rlkit_extension)  Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8rPgVFsGgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8rPgVFsGgU)  I have also attended a complex learning lab for 1.5 years, where we mainly covered Strogatz' nonlinear dynamics and chaos. Not sure if that'll mean anything here though...
krahe7 [info] This. So much this. You don’t even have to be touching him if he fights back in it. Just being in the same room nearby can be good. I was in a really dark place before I was diagnosed with depression and I pushed everyone away. But deep in my heart I wanted that warmth of someone being with me. I wanted that person to show that they cared enough to ignore me and be there with me. They didn’t have to be focused on me or talking to me. Just the fact that they would have the care to sit by me and be on their phone and be available would have meant the world to me.
Tayasos [info] I have been diagnosed with depression for 7 years now. At the moment, it's pretty well-managed, though. My meds work great, and I'm not anywhere near how bad I was a little over a year ago. Even at my worst, my sleep was never like this. It's never been great even as a young kid, but it's never been this bad.
AxeGirlAries [info] Hey, I know our body stats aren't the same but our situation is. I'm a 23 year old college student & since June of last year when I took a trip to Portland OR I've been slowly gaining back over half the weight I lost. My flair is now a lie. I am currently maintaining at 165 lb. At one point my lowest was 139. That was a dream. Its been 3 years. And every year around the holidays I derail until May because I have important birthdays in February, March, & April. I was diagnosed with depression a while back. In fact it was depression that kick-started my weight loss. At one point I was so miserable I was thinking about ways to die. I considered going without food or water. One of my biggest points of depression was that I considered myself extremely ugly. Down to my facial structure. So one day 3 of me attempting to starve myself to death I had a thought. "You know. This isn't going to work. You're going to pass out at some point & someone's going to take you to the hospital. They're going to stick an IV in you & undo it all." And then I thought "this time is going to pass regardless of what I do, & even eating doesn't make me feel better anymore. If I'm going to continue suffering I might as well just make it that little bit more worse & try to diet." A week later I downloaded Lifesum & ever since that day I've been doing my best. One of the greatest changes of my life came from my depression. I was at rock bottom & I turned it around. I think we can do this. Lets remember why we started, what pushed us to change in the first place, & keep going. Even if we mess up, that's okay. There's always tomorrow.
FuzzyLittleBunnies [info] I was diagnosed with depression and put on prosaic about 10 years ago. Fast forward to now. My depression is the worst it's ever been. I'm just waiting to get my shotgun back from a friend so I can end it. I don't think it's clinical. But I'm fucking depressed.
TheOriginalFuckface [info] Started angry and I want to explain myself.I am diagnosed with depression.I know exactly what I am talking about here because I go through it every day.However you cannot possibly fathom how it feels.People often chalk it up to being sad but that is far from it.Believe me you can be depressed while being happy.For example I like to think I like playing video games(just 1 example).However ,at the same time it feels like a chore to play ANY games.Being depressed is(in my experience)being tired of all the things that you.Eventually you start hating them.But you still do it.Because change seems even worse.And you end up hating yourself.But sooner or later you start accepting this is how it is going to be.By doing this you start pushing away everyone that tries to make you feel better because you perceive it as change.And then you cry because you want to change but also do not want to.Makes sense?Of course it fucking doesn't.None of it makes any sense.Not even to you.If it doesn't make sense to you how can it make sense to someone else?You cannot understand why someone commits suicide.Because they most likely do not understand it fully either.But when someone commits suicide it is never one thing that made them do it.Things add up and in the end matter even if you and I do not.In the end you stop caring at all.Not one bit.This is how you continue to live.If you can actually calk it a life I guess.And that leads to either a miserable life or suicide.You either don't care so you continue living or you don't care so you end it all.By that point anyone stops caring about so called consequences.Why bother?I chose the first option.Life is miserable and hopeless(no reason we should go into that)and your friend chose the second.You think he made a mistake?Just a matter of perspective. I have never heard of someone coming back from depression and lead a happy life.You can sustain yourself at most and breathe air.Either way you put it someone suffers.Better them than him.That's the only answer there is to his suicide.
thedumplingthief [info] I was diagnosed with depression  and have been taking medication for it. My pi knows about this but does not know the degree to which this impacts my sleep. I fell asleep at 8am and overslept a 11am meeting...
makkkz [info] I second this advice. Before I was diagnosed with depression, I was playing life in hard mode. Evertything was super difficult to do, even showering and brushing my teeth. After I started treatment, everything just seem easier and doable. Nothing changed in my routine, I did.
Nunyabz7 [info] I hear ya. I also feel like I've been this way forever. I was diagnosed with depression at age 12 or 13 and I'm about to turn 34. That's almost 22 fucking years. Jesus fucking Christ. I'm sick of feeling this way and it will never end unless i kill myself.
LadyOfAvalon83 [info] I was diagnosed with depression and several years later it turned out to be thyroid cancer.
mindkingdom [info] Not sure whether I really get it or not..I've been diagnosed with depression and suffer from it, but this image doesn't really represent my experiences. The "falling" part is so weird to me and really makes me uncomfortable. No hate.
lilspertx [info] I've honestly helped alot of people through depression and heartbreaks and I'm now starting to realise that nobody's helped me (yeah I was diagnosed with depression in 3rd grade and it hasn't gone away) I've been alone most my life and it really sucks being bullied because everyone sees how you get picked on and laugh at you instead of helping and I honestly feel like I should stand up for myself so I'm practicing MMA because whenever a girl I like sees me getting picked on laughs at me it really hurts. and honestly I just wanna stop being so lonely.
whatisallthis27 [info] I've had bad PMS for years. Later when I was diagnosed with depression, I realized that I felt down all the time, but felt way too worse during PMS. I have recovered from depression, but my PMS is still there, but not as bad as it used to be. I was deficient in a lot of nutrients (mainly B and D vitamins) which apparently cause these imbalances. There is no definitive answer to your question. There are two things you should do - have balanced meals and exercise and if you can, contact a therapist. When I went to doctors for the first time about my PMS, they also suggested therapy. If you are working somewhere, check if your firm offers employee assistance programs. You can avail them for free. Other than that, track your mood. Everyday. Keep a journal. See how you are doing and then you can get an idea from there.
Sasa2110 [info] My aunt has schizophrenia and my cousin has severe depression, another cousin suffers from mental illness too but his fami doesn't understand that, so he doesn't have a proper treatment. I grown up hearing their families complained that how it's tired and annoying taking care of them. So since I was diagnosed with depression I never told anyone because I don't want my family get into that position. I'm going down really quick. My therapist already that this is a serious problem and I'm in danger, It's not overacting. But I still cannot believe it...
finalproject [info] My uncle committed suicide after battling depression. It was only revealed to me after I was diagnosed with depression as well.
mjp141r [info] I was diagnosed with depression in the 90s. It was basically the equivalent of being diagnosed with HIV—especially in the black community. When I went to the hospital for my first suicide attempt, my mother lied to my school. My school treated me like shit. I didn’t realize I had rights. No, life is not fair. That is actually an illusion. It’s a myth that the American media tries to sell the American public while it fucks us over. People like us are working to make the world MORE fair. I know it’s frustrating. I’m really sorry that thirty years later, it hasn’t gotten much better. But at least it’s been more normalized and we have forums like this. I would have killed for this in the 90s. What would you like to see more of in your experience?
manicmidland [info] I've been dealing with depression for a long time.  My pre-teen and teenage years were really tough.  I thought it was a teenager phase, by the end of my teens I was diagnosed with depression.  Time does pass by fast, so make sure you enjoy each day as much as you can.  There will always be things we don't like to do, but that is life, do them and enjoy the time you get to choose your activities.  Over the years I have good periods and dark periods. Get exercise (helps with chemicals in brain) talk to parents, research what works and what could work.  I use a light box as mine gets worse in winter.  Look at your thinking process it plays a part as well.I hope that helps a bit.
franczerberg [info] Well when I was diagnosed with depression my mother denied it a lot and was very afraid of the psychiatrist putting me on antidepressants. Maybe Sue felt that same sense of denial? Given how she sorta doesn't hold Dylan to the same accountability of what happened as much as she does Eric, I would imagine her also thinking "No not my Dylan,  not my child".
SpeakLiesFakeASmile [info] Thank you for sharing your story. First I want to say, I hope you are taking your own advice and trying to get better as well. I know it's hard, even though I'm only young, I'm 16. I was diagnosed with depression at 4, after I told my mom I want to die. Since then I constantly have suicidal thoughts. I haven't gotten help since primary, simply because I see no point in it. But your post, together with some other saying the same message are motivating me to seek mental help. I'm still trying to figure everything out with psychologists and so on, but it's a start. Thank you. You are a lovely person. ❤️
keysarecool [info] No I have bi polar disorder and depression. I was diagnosed with depression due to PTSD at a young age, the bi polar disorder and manic episodes came a lot later in life. Tried to take my own life a couple of times and have done a lot of self harming. I cant really remember the way my doctor explained it to me when I asked the same question.
Unapologetic_infidel [info] I find this depressing if true. For the religious, that is. I'm an atheist and I have been diagnosed with depression but it has absolutely nothing to do with my lack of religious beliefs. Religion is the  ultimate scam. You get promised something nice but won't get it or even know if the offer wasn't a scam until you die. That's truly f* up and needs to be stopped. Religion is like fake ads on the internet and would not in any way help with my depression.
TheVectorEffect [info] I have been diagnosed with depression, my previous 2 medicines did nothing, and I can't tell with this new one because of what's going on. She helped me better than any therapist has, and even if she didn't I still miss her because I care about her. All this taught me that people you care about can leave you at any time and that fact has made me hesitant to make new friends because I know I won't be able to take something like this again, and that's assuming I can ever move on from my best friend. I've started having huge trust issues and I feel I should be wary of everyone around me. That fact that I've made this post is ironic in itself.I'm no stranger to suicide, I've tried and failed a couple times. The last time I tried I swore I wouldn't kill myself as long as my parents are around. But when they pass, I'm not going to waste a single second being alive. But even that's a long time from now, and I don't know how to manage till then.
ecosine [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 14 and always equated myself to the stereotype. I’m 19 now and STILL trying to accept the fact that I’m mentally ill. Work with yourself, you got this.
breakfastandbrunch [info] I started a very mild antidepressent a couple months after I was diagnosed with depression. Prior to that, it didn't even occur to me or my parents that I had depression, even though I had spiraled the past couple years to a nearly non-functional state where every action I took was a severely misguided attempt to relieve the symptoms and just live through that day. My therapist suggested I find a psychiatrist to discuss medication, and I was so desperate at the time to just not feel what I was feeling that I went against my initial reaction of 'hell no' and gave it a chance. I'm so grateful I did. It was enough to tone down the really severe lows, so I would recommend at least discussing it on a precursory level with a doctor, even if you decide the risks outweigh the potential benefits. 
GlitterTomahawk [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 12, it never got better even with treatment until I was diagnosed and treated for PCOS, my psychiatrist has my diagnosis code as something like “major depressive disorder secondary to a physical condition” because he so strongly believes the PCOS is the root of the depression.
Sean123Ryan [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 18 and didn’t really do anything about it (apart from drink, smoke and snort everything in site) for 11 years.I’m 29 now and my biggest advice is to stop wasting time and get help. Talking therapy has been my biggest win. Speaking to someone completely impartial and medically trained to deal with people like us is a game changer. Don’t ever feel like it’s a burden on people because I’m sure if your best friend came to you with a problem, you wouldn’t take it as a burden.Surround yourself with decent people, don’t do anything that will make you hate yourself and be open minded. There’s all sorts of things to try. Yoga, meditation, medication, therapist, mindfulness, group therapy. Don’t let the illness win. Kick it in the balls and be a winner yourself
bookislandgirl [info] Just wanted to say a word. I am skinny yes. I never ever dieted in my life, never exercised, only went for walks because I had to, I was diagnosed with depression at 17 yrs old and taking TONS of meds a day. Yes I do have good genes. But do you know what else I got? I bet you don’t. No one is 100% healthy 100% doesn’t exist. You think skinny people who look like models and lift and do all the woork... and those who are skinny because of their genes don’t have other body problems to worry about? Privileged?This is nuts. Pls don’t think I’m being rude, I am trying to prove to you that all that glitters is not gold.  
Boxers10 [info] You have described high functioning depression to a "T". I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago after a life time of wondering what was wrong with me. It is hard to put on the face every day...a lot of days I just come home and crash, BUT there are good days...just enough to keep me pushing. It was a relief for me to find a doctor that listened to me. It was hard hearing you have "Depression with fear" and the big one was when therapist updated it to "Depression and passive suicidal"...BUT it does get better so hang in there you know what is going on and can work on it. I hope you are younger than me when I found help at 55.
jifjif212 [info] Suicide is too inconvenient for me, there’s really no good way to do it, so until they make one i’m staying alive.Anyway, odds are, someone really cares about you man. I used to think this way, but after it got bad, i finally told my mom, and went and got help. Ever since I was diagnosed with depression, and given proper treatment, i’ve felt so much better and had much less suicidal thoughts.Onto the funeral thing, that is something i often imagined. One night i even planned my funeral on an iNote called “if i die before i get to live”.I highly recommend  if you’re truly feeling like committing suicide, or calling one of those hotlines (i did the text one once, it was pretty okay).
buitestaander [info] My logs look the same and I'm diagnosed with depression
snorton034 [info] I am diagnosed with depression and it definitely gets worse when my pain starts to increase.  I have been so frustrated with the number of things I can't do or the things I do that significantly increase my pain.  You are not alone in feeling depressed.  Pain takes a HUGE toll on your mood, your mental stamina, and physical stamina. I hope things get better for you, and that you are able to get the help you need.
3267631315 [info] Our feelings are real; they exist regardless of whether we can justify them.  And knowledge of the reasons for our feelings is *not* one of the diagnostic criteria for clinical depression.  I was diagnosed with depression more than 20 years ago, but it’s only been within the past 5 years or so that that I’ve gained some understanding of its root causes.  I wasn’t aware of them earlier because I had *depressed* them to a level that was “beneath” (i.e. beyond) my conscious awareness at the time, but stored in my body. If it’d been me in your shoes, I would have wanted my friend to listen with an open heart and mind, acknowledge that they didn’t understand what it’s like to be depressed, and ask me open-ended questions in an attempt to better understand my experience.  I also would have wanted them to validate my feelings, which wouldn’t require them to understand or “agree” with them.  I would have felt angry, frustrated & hurt by your friend’s actual response. The fact that your friend hasn’t experienced depression does *not* lead me to conclude they’re “right”, but rather that their opinion re: the matter should be taken with a grain of salt due to their limited experience & knowledge. Finally, your questioning whether you “deserve” to consider yourself depressed and feeling concerned that you’re “cheating” and might just be lazy is what I’d call a hallmark of depression in and of itself! That’s part of what sucks so much about it. May you be as kind to/gentle with yourself as possible. 
randomcarrotaf [info] Yes! I always knew biological kids was nothing i wanted. I felt pretty strongly against IVF my entire life because ive always been a huge supporter of adoption, and i wanted to adopt for as long as i can remember (i think i should add here that i am lesbian, i also dont like the idea of just getting knocked up by a random guy)I always dreamt of adopting a girl, maybe age 8 or 10, from orphanages or refugee camps. The thought of children growing up without a home, without a place of their own, without parents they can rely on in institutions they are shoved into with other children scared the shit out of me when i was a child and i wanted nothing but to help them. I asked my parents about adoption even when i was in kindergarten already and i knew a bunch of things, such as that older children have a harder time finding someone. The Disney film "the rescuers" basically was the last thing i needed to know that i want to adopt a girl that age.When i grew older i realized how badly i behave around children, how i have 0 tolerance for tantrums etc. I was diagnosed with depression and either an attention disorder or dissociation and now i don't trust myself enough how to take care of even myself... also financially it is an issue because so far i had a hard time working regular full time hours - last time i almost ended up in psych ward (almost because they were full and therefore decided that my suicide attempt didn't count as one...), so how i will be able to live financially is nothing i can tell.It still sticks with me that i want to adopt children, and that i dont want to watch them suffer... on the one had, my dream would be being a housewife and caring for those children, giving them what i can, but also it would be an absolute nightmare.
chef-boy-par-ty [info] I never precisely related it to depression but that would make sense. I have the fluctuating feelings of superiority and inferiority; and it's in the periods of inferiority that I feel deserving of misery. I've got so many mental health concerns that are untreated. I'm diagnosed with depression and I'm certain I must have a personality disorder. It's just untenable living in my current state of flux. How do you cope? 
cassiefinnerty [info] It's not always something external that creates depression, however it can be, I definitely think you should check out youth and adolescent depression resources there is a tonne online or in books, it might help you widen your knowledge on this topic. I get what your saying, it doesn't seem to make sense they are just youths how could they be depressed, in comparison to someone a bit older who has lived through more difficulties, which is in my opinion sad to even think about, but I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 12, and am 28 now. It isn't what's happened in my life Its how my behavioural and emotional response structure of my brain works or well doesn't work sometimes that led to that diagnosis.
sukaretta [info] The thing is, I’ve been clinically depressed before (about 4-5 years ago, my psychiatrist prescribed me Zoloft and everything worked itself out), so I know exactly how it feels to be truly depressed. This is fairly different than it was back then. I still attend classes regularly (I used to skip classes for 3 semesters straight then), I now have better relationship with my parents, a much healthier coping mechanism, no more outwardly destructive thoughts—quite a turnaround than when I was diagnosed with depression. But now you got me wondering, is it possible for depression to recur just because you haven’t been taking any antidepressants, even without experiencing a significant emotional event?
TechnicalConclusion0 [info] I have no idea. I once spent an awesome evening with the people I like most. Just general talking, banter, games, all the fun stuff. But about half an hour after it ended late in the evening I was already thinking of killing myself.  Now, months later, I was diagnosed with depression and I'm taking meds. They haven't worked so far.
InvisibilityPowers [info] I've been experiencing the "waking up" feeling for most of my life. "Normal" is a kind of foggy I'm-probably-awake-but-I-could-be-dreaming feeling, and when I "wake up," everything feels vivid and real, which is usually unsettling and sometimes downright terrifying. It's usually very brief, but has happened multiple times over the past couple hours, while I've been here and on PTSD subs.And I just blanked out. Lost my train of thought.I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 18 by a professional I'd talked to for maybe 10 minutes. *blanks out*I've been on medication since, but am starting to think maybe I didn't get the right diagnosis. I'm nearly 40 now.My point being, you make sense. I know the feeling. I think that was my point.
V1nCLeeU [info] This was waaay back in 2002 when I was 16-17 so things could be different now.Anyway, my mom took me there for consultation and I was diagnosed with depression. Just like with clinics in hospitals you just have to go there, sign up for consultation, then wait for your turn. I think usually 2 or 3 psychiatrists are scheduled to handle patients each day.What happens is you go into a room/clinic with the psychiatrist and you just talk to him/her and tell the doctor what's happening to you, how are you feeling, etc. I think there are standard questions psychiatrists have to ask you for them to determine your condition. In my case, my doctor asked how long have I've been feeling this, have I considered suicide, etc. No couches, unlike what we usually in Hollywood movies. (I was kind of disappointed about this part, hehe). I just sat in front of my doctor while I talked to her. I would cry at some points. At one point she would also call in my mom so she could talk to her while I was there. I would say those sessions are a mix of probing and counseling sessions.  I was then prescribed to take Zoloft to treat my depression. I would estimate my treatment probably lasted 10 months to almost a year, which included taking the medicine and a visit to the clinic every other month if I remember correctly. It went well, I got well but I can't say that the depression has completely gone away. Every few years I feel like my depression always comes back, especially in times of stress (unemployment, death of a loved one).
NaomiKatyr [info] I have been diagnosed with depression and Anxiety, and I am like that often.Might be like that.
CaptainMrBucket [info] I am diagnosed with depression and GAD and take medication best I can tell you is to keep moving forward. It is hard as fuck I can understand but no one said it was going to be easy. Mental illness is important so make sure you take care of you.Your brain is going to fuck with you consistently. It is an internal struggle I understand but no one deserves to be or feel alone.
amanda1o12 [info] This is great! I feel like you could be talking about me! I was diagnosed with depression and then I got PTSD. After my assault I turned to food for comfort. That was a year and a half ago. I finally realized it was time. In other words, I understand how difficult it can be but it’s amazing what you’re doing :)
Evrlastingbeauti [info] Stress from Mom can absolutely hurt the baby. And how can you properly take care of yourself physically if you can't take care of yourself mentally as well? The risk to baby from anti-depressants is minimal. The risk to your health is not. You want to be the best Mom you can be? Take care of yourself, body and mind. Crying at your desk, in your car, etc. isn't healthy. The stress can and will hurt the baby. I have been diagnosed with depression since I was 4. I only started treatment after a suicide attempt at 15, and that I didn't to l do consistently until I was in my mid twenties. It's taken me years and tons of work to get to the point where I can truly say that I know I must take care of myself first. If I'm running on empty, I can't help anyone else, least of all my child. I'm on three different anti-depressants as well as going to therapy weekly. I've talked with my psychiatrist's, my OB, and a genetic counselor about my meds and possible effects they might maybe have on baby. Low birth weight and possible 'withdrawal' are the worst; and the chance of either is so small. With today's medical advancements and the fact that I'm planning on nursing, I'm not worried about either of these. Please, please, please, from someone who had not taken care of herself in the past and knows what is like, please take the medication prescribed to you. You would not have been prescribed medication without reason. Please take care of yourself and in so doing take care of baby. Feel free to msg me if you want. We are here for you.
jdkyles [info] This could be a passive ideation of suicidal thoughts. I thought the same way when I was diagnosed with depression.
wischmopp [info] Thank you for your advice! I've already tried therapy but was extremely unsatisfied with my therapist. I'm diagnosed with depression and bulimia and he didn't seem to know anything about these illnesses. To "cure" my Bulimia, he just told me that I look good and don't need to worry about my weight and that I should "eat in moderation instead of binging and purging" (lol if it only was that easy). For my depression, he recommended exercise even though I told him ONE SESSION AGO that I compulsively overexercise because of my bulimia. In addition, he sometimes just didn't show up for a session without notifying me. So yeah, that didn't really work out...I've been trying to find a new therapist but that's REALLY hard in my city. I've been on several waiting lists for more than six months now.
kyaluna [info]  I was diagnosed with depression at age 13 so you never know if "moody" is more than it seems.
tamingjackie [info] It seems you've been at least partly diagnosed. Maybe you also have some kind of personality disorder. Depression is not rational. Whether you have reason or not. A personality disorder like borderline or narcissism could be the explanation of some the attention seeking behavior. Maybe get a second opinion on a further diagnosis. I have had several of these thoughts before I was diagnosed with depression and then borderline. Denial is normal. As soon as you can understand what you're working with though, then you can work on changing some of your unhealthy behaviors. I mean none of this as an insult. You could very well be misdiagnosed, and I could be projecting. I would still suggest a second opinion I'm that case, though. 
Chrisrawraw [info] I'm sorry. Please message me if you want someone to just message. I want things to be made right for you. How old are you? Are you old enough to get a job and see a therapist?Just want to make a joke, your parents and my parents should meet up. I was diagnosed with depression and they still don't believe me.
Safe_Hands [info] Hi, sure. I'm 22, my reason for going is because I'm running out of money soon and I need to either get treatment for my emotional numbness (I confused this with emotional detachment in OP) so I can become functional enough to work, or to get a diagnosis that'll allow me to apply for disability benefits. The method of diagnosis was just talking with my psychiatrist, got diagnosed in second session (not sure exactly what you're asking). I'm unsure about comorbidity. I've been diagnosed with depression, that's it.
MaceNow [info] I've been diagnosed with depression. Just because I believe it's a disease, that doesn't mean that I don't also believe that there are positive actions one can take to alleviate the symptoms of depression. It's both - it's a disease, and it's also a daily choice. Tiredness... lethargy... poor habits: these things can be regulated through force of action. Are these things much harder to do by a person who has depression? Yes. That's true. We face challenges that others don't. But we're all facing something. This is our cross to bear, and how we bear it.. is up to us.
Inasss [info] I've been diagnosed with depression and the major causes as per the therapy sessions are my disturbed self-identity and emotionally abusive childhood. The problem with the self-image made me lose all purpose in life to the point of being suicidal.I don't think it would be right to not call it depression because you have a self-identity problem, I think if you do have the symptoms of depression the you have depression, the reason is something you will discover step by step.It's been 6 months for me, and 4 months in we have uncovered a personality disorder that I was keeping hidden really well because I always show a strong and resilient persona but when I allowed myself to be vulnerable everything unfurled and we were able to take on a different approach in therapy.I was like you, started out feeling in control of 90% of what goes on with my life and just needed help controlling my sad feelings, but then as we went on, I discovered that I am emotionally immature in some aspects without me noticing it. It gets me down sometimes because discovering emotional shortcomings only makes me think worse of myself, more than I already do due to the depression. You'll figure everything out with your therapist, just keep going every week and see where it leads you.
weegeekus [info] Hi there, I really feel for you and well done for progressing so far with the DBT and making a real difference to your life.I was diagnosed with depression when I was fifteen (I definitely had it right through childhood). I wasn't diagnosed with BPD until I was in my thirties (although I had that from adolescence). They are absolutely two separate things. With BPD most get depressive moods, while they may feel similar to depression they are generally more transient and are part of the mood swings (of course this varies widely between individuals). In general depression is more long term and is accompanied by other symptoms (appetite loss, sleep disturbance etc.). It is very confusing when the symptoms overlap so much. It is also likely that the causes of the two conditions are different too. To be honest there is a huge amount of overlap between different mental health diagnoses and it can be hard to make sense of it when you're trying to deal with it all. I found this article that may help explain further http://bpd.about.com/od/relatedconditions/a/Bpd-And-Depression.htmBasically, yes, they are two different things, you can have both and it's very common to have both. Do you think you may go to see another doctor about the depression symptoms?
suedecubs [info] I feel the same way. I was diagnosed with depression and the friends who I thought were going to be there for me weren’t, but rather people I had known for like a year than my best friends who I had known for five. It’s kinda hard because I’m still young and in school and I had just slowly isolated myself after trying to reach out and reach for help and the effort wasn’t reciprocated, or their response just sounded like they didn’t really care or it was just a half assed, back hand response. It’s lonely too, but I would rather put my effort into those who do the same, and I guess I’m at that age where I start having to be picky about the friendships and relationships that I foster. It’s kind of the part of growing up that I had forgotten and it makes me pretty sad. When I think my depression drove me away from my friends, I remember how much closer it bought me to my family so maybe it was just my friends. I do think it is growth. When we’re at a place when we actually need them we see beyond just fun times together. I sincerely wish the best for you though. I’m glad you can find positivity and enlightenment in something so many people would find terrifying and jarring.
ash4459 [info] You're the third person I've said this to this thread, but it needs to be said: I've been diagnosed with depression, and I'm honestly not sure if these types of comments would make me attempt suicide again.  I literally cannnot process toxicity in the same way as normal people.So please, think of people like me when discussing how to deal with toxic behavior.  Just because you can shrug it off doesn't mean everyone can.
me_maradona_elvis [info] So glad to hear you’re on the right track to figure stuff out. Since I was a child, I have always been the happy go lucky kinda guy who’s not afraid to make a fool out of myself and just be fun, but that’s all an exterior. The past 6 months has been the hardest period of my life without question. I was diagnosed with depression, had to take a lot of time out of work and have been attending therapy weekly to try and sort myself out. Thankfully it’s been working really well for me. I hope therapy works for you too but just remember that it might not always seem like it is at the time. I wish that I could have shared my experiences with people like Ben who were silently suffering too and maybe it would have inspired him to take the same steps that people like you and I are taking. As the latest Enjoi Instagram post says “if sharing with the whole world that Ben took his life means it starts a conversation somewhere, and that, that conversation saves a life, then I can’t help but think that all of us losing Ben isn’t all in vain.” Let’s be open with people about our darkest times.
kumawo [info] I go to a psychiatrist, I've been diagnosed with depression and ptsd, but my medication doesn't help me, I feel very odd, I attempted suicide twice, so I think I should be dead, I just feel very confused, I forget stuff, whenever I say something, people scream at me, and I just don't understand why
cablespinach [info] Hey, no problem. Maybe it would help if you talked to him and let him know what you're going through. Explain how you feel you might be taking out your frustration on the relationship, and I'm sure it's possible for you to work things out once he understands what it's been like. As for the therapy, I've been there too. I was diagnosed with depression four years ago, and I kept going to therapy without experiencing significant improvement for a long time because my mother didn't want me to take medication. I went through a number of tough relapses over the past couple years, so we decided it was time to give medication a chance, and it has worked pretty well. Talk to your therapist; maybe she can recommend a different treatment that can help you feel better. 
ChubbyBubba91 [info] I've been taking it with no Ill effects. I am diagnosed with depression. Why combine with methylcobalamin?
countastrotacos [info] Yes. I have been diagnosed with depression 3 years ago. This of course has ruined my confidence with women. As well as my looks.
spottieottie93 [info] I had this exact same breakdown when I was younger. I have vivid memories of doing everything that you did. I have no idea why I did it. And I just remember my parents looking at me like something was terribly wrong with me and they were just so confused. I get it. I really do. I wish I could give you some insight on why it happened or what you should do now but, I still don’t know. But I do know that I was diagnosed with depression, ADHD, borderline personality disorder and Bi polar.
panax_ [info] I was diagnosed with depression for a long time. It makes sense because I specifically mentioned suicidal thoughts, and I was so horrified by the thoughts (and it took me such a long time to admit them to anybody) that I didn’t really interrogate them. It was only when I spoke about some more classic checking that was taking over my life did OCD click as a diagnosis. It also gave me the space to talk through various iterations of harm and sexual OCD that I had been ashamed to admit.
jdb2793 [info] Thanks for this message and for the reminder.I am diagnosed with depression so meaning I actually need (not just want) something externally to actually help me cope up with my pain and struggles. I do love myself, and believe me, I have made all your suggestions already. But what’s nice is when someone else can remind me again whenever I’m clouded like what you did. But I already seek professional help since even myself, family, and friends aren’t enough sometimes to help me with this illness. I have monthly psychologist therapy session and will be taking meds again. It’s just nice to have a genuine (and not paid lol) care and comfort from other people. Thanks again!
alt123456789o [info] I used to feel very negative like this, like life was complete bullshit. I was diagnosed with depression at the time, and it's gotten better since then. If you haven't already, get a doctor's appointment and get checked out. Reading up about depression online has helped me understand my thoughts better and what the disease actually is. Hopefully this may help you as well.
LifeWA [info] Hey dude, I was diagnosed with depression around 5 years ago. I started my SSRIs and I would say it took around 8 months to feel somewhat myself again, although there was an improvement after about a month.It’s important to remember that everyone is different, if you don’t see any improvement after a month, talk to your doctor again. It’s also important to look after yourself, eat healthy, make a point of exercising, get into a routine and learn how to be by yourself. I’m hoping to come off meds this year, it would have been a bit sooner, but life gets in the way sometimes
lonelyheart66 [info] The problem is there is absolutely nothing going on and I am not comfortable, makes me very anxious at times with the need to help. I had to care for three family members going threw hospice and held there hand as they past, the last being my wife of 20 years and kind of lost at the moment. Work 60 hours a week just to come home to an empty house.I have been in counseling twice and just didnt get anything out of it. I have been diagnosed with depression and on meds for that along with meds to help me sleep for a few hours a nite. Just a lot of self pity and dwelling on what's wrong and not what's good. I really wish I could meet people especially the opposite sex but my shy and introverted self comes out whenever I am out in public. Few online dating sites but just so impersonal not much luck.
meghanhauk [info] Its called high functioning depression. Or more often referred to as "fake it till you make it"When I was diagnosed with depression I was still attending work full time, hitting the gym 4-5 times a week, going out with friends etc. I was also crying on my lunch breaks, would get home and crawl into bed immediately, wouldn't eat and couldn't be bothered to keep up with any hygiene outside of the basics. 
Dynamic_P0tato [info] I didn't quite *know*, but I did learn that feeling as though your future will contain nothing but bad stuff from age 10 is kind of odd. I was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago and I'm still nowhere near rid of it, although I do exercise regularly now and I haven't self-harmed in 15 months.
LOOOOPS [info] I've been diagnosed with depression, technically a "mental illness." I've tried bunch of medications, cognitive behavior therapy, and group sessions. Nothing has worked.I'm convinced that my depression has nothing to do with mental illness. I just hate the world and no pill or therapy is going to change that.
Gezy152 [info] Amitriptyline and risperdal, 2018 I was diagnosed with depression but I refused to take medication till 2019 will d medication still work?
doodongo [info] I do, I am diagnosed with depression and I did regularly to see a therapist. The symptoms of PTSD I have not talked about. I guess I should.
redditusersg [info] I don't know. I know that I have been diagnosed with depression. But I don't know why I'm so scared of how I am in this world and in this body, am I 'stuck' here :(((
ayindy [info] Find a way to distract yourself, here is one of my favourite videos to watch and it instantly calms me down. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd7KC3PaEaAFind a show you love and watch it. You could try and  download an app called pacifica where you can join groupchats or post your feelings and people will respond to you. It also tracks the way you feel and does a check in on you. Meditation or mindfulness can help (headspace or calm app). I have been diagnosed with depression from a young age and I am still dealing with suicidal thoughts but this is what I find helps me but of course it's not the same for everyone but please do give these things a try if you have not done before. 
soap_savon [info] O h  m a n. Okay, so I straight up went to my high school counselor multiple times and said "I am diagnosed with depression and feel suicidal and hopeless all the time, what can I do? I do an hour of yoga once a week and run whenever I can." "Hmm... Well, all bad feelings pass eventually so you need to keep that in mind. Have you tried reducing your stress and exercising?" ... thanks dude, im fuckin cured and all it took was some more goddamn yoga. I then went to university, saw a psychiatrist, and was prescribed medication and advised to seek out a psychologist who specialized in CBT and whaddya know, some good actually came out of it!!!!Edit: I think it's important to note that, while high school admin was worse than useless, every single one of my teachers were incredibly understanding. The hardest part was telling them about it + asking them for accommodations on a case-by-case basis because it felt like I was getting special treatment. At my uni I was given a lette I could email to my profs explaining my situation and honestly that's so much easier - I can just type in a few words, send it, and forget it
bigcoffeemug [info] Yes, I am 20. My moods used to be very low (I was diagnosed with depression at 14) but now they are just changeable. So it's already much better. :)
Nicotine12 [info] I've been diagnosed with depression, so yeah, I experienced this. And experiencing it throughout as well. I just try to ignore it. If it becomes unbearable, I try to go out and find something else to do. Distraction is a hell of a drug, lol.
harrison_wheels [info] Not just America, but most Western countries.The only reason why high-school was 'defining' for me is because it's when I was diagnosed with depression. "Best time of your life" my ass.
Anti-Itch [info] Thanks for your response! I'm not like that at all and wish I was. I feel like everytime I second guess my career choices it's because things are hard in school, and then I start thinking of a possible exit strategy, instead of actually trying. I was diagnosed with depression in undergrad and lost a lot of my work ethic as I sank deeper and deeper into it as the years went on, so I feel like I came out of it gasping for air instead of feeling accomplished. That being said, my current field is motivating me to do better and I want to try and run with that. For example, I actually GO to classes! But I still have those days where my mood sucks and this quarantine isnt helping and neither is the fact that I get up like 3 min before my class starts and I'm groggy. I'm thinking of ordering a book and learning what is important for my research and future career at least so I know what's going on, but I'm worried I'm not disciplined enough for that.
tatertwatter [info] Go back to therapy. I’m not in menopause, but I do have depression and I understand having a libido drop. I’m glad it came back after I was put on antidepressants. I also understand how stress and being overwhelmed can impact libido. I had twins and that was so much work. That is the depression killed out sex life. I was so tired all the time, and stressed due to health problems my kids were having. My husband reacted by retreating into his “man cave” way more often than he should have, and then sulking when I refused to have sex with him. To this day I don’t know what the heck he was thinking; between kids and my job I didn’t even have 30 minutes of peace to take a bath, and after the kids were in bed he wanted me to give up my hard earned sleep to have sex with his ass after he spent the evening playing around on the computer and watching Netflix?  Hard no. Things changed for us after I was diagnosed with depression and put on medication. He understood that I was really going through some mental shit and it wasn’t that I didn’t love him. He went from feeling rejected to feeling protective. Like my knight in shining armor who would do anything to help me if that makes any sense at all. He doesn’t even know the full depth of my depression or how I wanted to hurt myself. For my part, once the medicine kicked in I was able to enjoy spending time with my kids and husband and able to take care of myself again. After a few months my libido came back and I feel like my husband and I are full partners again. My point of this long ass story is that it’s very possible that something is wrong and she might not even realize it. I certainly didn’t think anything was wrong with me; I thought that with all of the issues we were facing that it seemed perfectly normal to feel like this—who wouldn’t? I was pretty damned wrong because we still have the same obstacles we always did but my outlook is normal now.
Beouve [info] I'm not "sad", being angry is a symptom of depression as well, I'm diagnosed with depression, I never said that girls HAVE to have sex with me because I'm so good for them or that it's all their fault. I'm taking the blame on myself here. If you're going to give such a negative reply, why don't you use this time for something better, such as learning how to interpret text.
Big_Brother_Ed [info] Full disclosure; I'm only checking out this sub, and haven't been diagnosed with BPD, but I am a recovering ice addict. I've had similar experiences to what you've had, thankfully not when driving, but when doing other monotonous things like vacuuming or reading. I lose myself in the reliving of smoking it, and almost but not quite feel the rush I used to get when I still used. So possibly not BPD related, though I've been diagnosed with depression and shown traits of BPD (I'm looking into BPD at a recommendation from my psychologist)
shitboxranger [info] Well if it makes you feel any better I'm the same way. I'm lonely too and I lost one of my only friends. But even though I have been diagnosed with depression and prescribed zoloft I vowed to myself to never do anything stupid over a girl. I know it hurts dude but don't do anything you would regret.
Hyppocritamus [info] Oh no, I mean I was diagnosed with depression at 14, and nobody knew.  Still waiting on the learning disability as I "have all the markers for one" so I have one, just not sure which one
DankMorgano420 [info] When I was diagnosed with depression
al0_ [info] I agree, I think it's a good idea for a professional to either ask if it needs to be explained or to just explain it anyway. And it's my responsibility as a client/patient to ask if I'm confused instead of getting in a huff like I did.I focused so much on the "learned" part.. that he was already judging how I was diagnosed with depression ie I was young and maybe my environment influenced and caused it instead of getting to know me and my history more before drawing conclusions.But when you say it like this>its possible they wanted you to see depression as a changeable thing which is an important perspective for treatment.it gives me a different perspective on why he may have said that and that's why I came to this subreddit so I appreciate you giving another perspective and explaining the differences. Like you said, no idea what he intended but I should have spoken up and asked so I understand where he's coming from. Thanks for taking the time to answer my question.
chadnobyl [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14 or maybe 15. Upgraded to bpII when I went to see my doctor thinking it may be ADHD and depression combined. 
emmeemmememm [info] I've been diagnosed with depression and I self-harm. I get pissed off when I hear other kid's who failed their Biology test say random shit like: ' I failed my test again. Oh well, guess it's time to cut myself'. *Pretends to cut themselves with a ruler in a joking matter*
gingerelviswut [info] I am in a similar boat. Music was everything to me. My passion, my therapy. Since I was diagnosed with depression a couple of years ago, my lifelong love of music has not been the same. I would rather have silence. I rarely pick up my guitar. I don't feel like I know who I am without it.
bigh2k1 [info] I’ve been actively trying to increase my odds of cancer. I’ve tried suicide and I’m a miserable failure. I drink a lot trying to perpetuate the pancreatic cancer that runs in my family. I never use sunscreen. I eat lots of processed foods. Hell I even sometimes lay my cellphone on my abdomen Incase there really are harmful cancer causing waves being transmitted. Six months to live would be ideal. I can liquidate my meager assets and spend that money living like I’m dying.  The best day of my life would be the day I get my parole diagnosis.  On that day I finally will have hope there is an end to the misery depression has caused me for 21 years.   I was diagnosed with depression at age 29 and I’m now 50.  
Pimphandloose95 [info] I was diagnosed with depression about 2 months ago and am taking medication and nobody knows. I haven't told my family, friends, work, or anyone. It's easier to not have people pity you or treat you differently
lavygirl [info] Same but I was diagnosed with depression so I struggle to know if it’s that, or I’m just lazy.
WhatAmI71 [info] It is possible. :) That is pretty much how I started (from the little I can remember about my childhood)...just burning shit in the woods by my house. Now I go to the woods (by the railroad tracks) where it is safe to burn paper and wood. There are no people, no structures and no animals. I can burn until my little heart is content, and I do. I have ALWAYS been a fire-truck chaser, have always gone to any house fire in my area...I even torched a dumpster just to see the fire department. The disorder had actually slept inside of me for decades because well, life happened after high school. I got married, bought a house, started my family...I had no time to think about it. I was diagnosed with depression and have been in and out of psych hospitals pretty much from my teens to just recently (2105). I triggered the disorder back to life earlier this year and now it is full-blown pyromania. I got diagnosed not long ago. A lot of people think it is just starting fires. It is NOT only that. It is far more complex. You can see by the DSM that it is all about the emotions and how the person FEELS when they start a fire. It is about what happens in the person's mind and soul and heart. I got it bad for fire. I feel that weak-in-the-knees, totally head-over-heels-in-love feeling that you would feel for someone you have a crush on when I start a fire. The excitement before-hand (especially when the impulse hits and I have to gather my materials) is likened to a child on Christmas morning. THAT kind of excited feeling...anticipation. :)Oh, I am 47 by the way and female. So I am bucking ALL the odds lol. Take THAT statistics lol.
Sbeast [info] &gt;From age 7 (I believe) I've had on and off homicidal idealization.Can you remember if anything bad or traumatic happened to you in childhood?&gt; I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13ish,[Overcoming Depression](https://www.reddit.com/ some tips in this post which might help if it's an anger related problem:[How to Deal With Anger](https://www.reddit.com/
juststupid8970 [info] I've never been evaluated for ADD. I remember daydreaming a lot in classes when I was younger, but my concentration was never an issue. I have been diagnosed with depression and am medicated for it and I fear it's not doing the trick anymore. I know what to do: work out, eat well, sleep well, self-care, etc etc. But I just don't have the discipline to follow through with these things. I put all my laundry away today, but I hadn't for weeks. And it took a lot out of me to do for some reason. I have no motivation to lose weight since I feel like no potential partners would be interested in me if I do.I feel like I need some kind of strategy to discipline myself to get these things done to feel better.
exokkir [info] I was diagnosed with depression years before my sz diagnosis. After I started having psychotic symptoms, I got Psychosis NOS and Psychotic Disorder before being diagnosed with Schizophrenia Unspecified Type.
wake-eat-cut-repeat [info] I can relate to you cus I have a very similar life- good family, few but good friends, good academic career- yet I've been diagnosed with depression. I've come to realize happiness is not about your current state, but rather the relative rate of change of your state(sounds weird but think of it as the formula for bulk modulous). So a very poor guy earning 100 bucks will be so much more happy than Warren buffet doing the same. Or like, getting a job after struggling for a day is much more appreciated(not retrospectively) vs struggling for a year and then getting a job. So, this sounds weird but if S is some quantifiable representation of your current state, happiness (H) according to me is :H = (1/S)(dS/dt)Where t is time. It's not very accurate or a very good theory or anything. Just something I've picked up over the years.
Dee_Lansky [info] I can understand that, it’s sad how the only thing I look forward to is masturbating. I have been diagnosed with depression and honestly hate getting out of bed, hate going to school, hate eating food, I hate myself all I enjoy is Masturbating. I wish I was dead. 
IMainJannaxxx [info] Lol yeah I was really straightforward. Most of the impact on my app was implied (being hospitalized, missing many days). I didn’t say something like,“The overbearing sadness I felt was debilitating to the point where I couldn’t do anything outside of school.”more like“I was diagnosed with depression, missed 80 days of school, and was hospitalized for a month.”Congrats btw! It’s really inspiring to see someone succeed with mental health issues. You’re awesome :)
reed555 [info] Hope it’s all right that i showed your post and reply to my spouse who has BP2  (he was diagnosed at age 46 and doing well in treatment the past year.  I was diagnosed with depression, which i have had on and off since my teens.)  we both know mental illness really, really hurts.From my spouse: “A buddy of mine rescued a dog on Utila who ended up rescuing him.  He needs a change in perspective to create a new narrative.  He should strike out on his own.  Create a non profit or go to a third world country for a bit.”From me:  adding to what he said, is becoming partner so very necessary to considering yourself a success?   I used to think promotions were very important, but when i got my last one, i surprised everyone (even myself) by walking away.  I decided love (small and large, platonic or romantic) was far more important than more money and status.  I ended working only up until the point we could retire in modest comfort.  Btw we also have a rescue dog to whom i am super attached. You have been fighting a very, very tough enemy but still you are here, doing meaningful work and feeling love.  If it comforts you somehow to contemplate controlling your end — it does me — then contemplate it.  But please consider the end will come whether you bring it on or not, and you still have time to live a different story.  Seize opportunities to show love, kindness and compassion to others for as long as you are here.  It doesn’t matter how small the gesture is as long as you do it.  Be open to recognizing love and kindness in others, whether human or animal friends.  Remember most of all to be good to yourself, recognize that you are being very strong already, that you are more than good enough. Love yourself as you are.
Hey454 [info] That happened to me yesterday , my mom told me that i am not depressed or anything although i am diagnosed with depression. She told me that i put myself in this situation with my choices. I felt very misunderstood. She said that she lived in much worse situations and still wasn't depressed.i know how u are feeling
thatisnotmyknob [info] To stop being so rough on myself. I'm diagnosed with depression, its ridiculous to beat myself up over a medical condition I inherited.
simmerstation [info] I agree. I have been diagnosed with depression last year and every night I cry myself to sleep but then the notification pops up and I am the happiest I’ve ever been. I love him and he makes me so much better.
Phsyco1430 [info] I realized I needed help when I was in the middle of a suicide attempt and broke down crying, I called my friend and she talked me out of it. I reached out to my school's social worker and she helped me talk to my parents. Two years after that I was diagnosed with depression officially 6 months ago but have been dealing with the symptoms for more than half my life. I decided to reach out because I felt guilty about how I felt and I didn't want to end my last year of middle school feeling like crap and being there and not feeling there.
lrnzsmith [info] I have some similar issue, but with my girlfriend and friends. I know she/they love me and care about me. I was diagnosed with depression about four years ago, I have had theraphy for about two years and I am still on medication. The fact that are relativly ‚normal‘  and still care, but I am still misserable and I am still feeling such dark thoughts from times to times, even after this long period of treatment, makes me shamefull. I don‘t want to be a burden to them after so many years.
didshyplen [info] It's been going on for a while. I started with just deleting all my pictures on all my digital devices and soc med sites. Then it was the mirrors that I can't stand, so I covered them all with a cloth. Finally, the thought of just having photographs of myself from childhood irked me so I scratched my face out of all the family pictures and threw away all the solo pics that I can find. I was diagnosed with depression since college. It's always been tough but I could always tolerate it. But lately, I can't motivate myself anymore and feel paralyzed. Everything's hazy and I can't think straight.
pony-boi [info] You have a point. However, nope, you’re wrong about the conversion therapy. It was awful and I wake up in a cold sweat to flashbacks every once a month or so.  I was diagnosed with depression at conversion therapy.I’ve told my general practice I wanted to come off Zoloft. They are aware and helping me, over what’s been 5 ish months. Will my gender change? Maybe. Probably not, but if I hadn’t started T, I’m near certain I wouldn’t be alive to find out. 
BudgetTruth [info] You don't think lazy losers don't have mental problems? I don't believe 'lazy' exists, it's always the result of something else and being lazy is a coping mechanism;avoidance. But yes there are a lot of disorders which make working very hard even though you don't look ill on the outside or in conversation. Depression is part of it most of the time of course. I'm diagnosed with depression, avoidant personality disorder and closet narcissistic personality disorder. A tripple whammy which sucked out all the motivation to work (or 'live', compared to the average citizen) out of me when it all crashed down after forcing myself to wageslave 'because everyone does so I can too'. I'm using a cocktail of antidepressants and should get adderall or ritalin soon too, hoping it gives me motivation. In therapy I always make it clear I want the motivation to work and if I can't think it into existence I demand the pills that make me not suffer while wageslaving. Too which psychiatrist or therapist always says "it would be better if you found a job you like, you'd be motivated for the things you like". No shit sherlock. Now where's that job? Most of us would like to work if bottom of the barrel work didn't give us such an increase in depression
notoriousriot [info] Thank you. I’ve wondered, as I’ve been a drinker long before I was diagnosed with depression, just how much the two held hands. It’s a horrible idea to combine pills and alcohol. I would tell anyone else it was crazy and dangerous and damaging. All while not giving myself the same respect.
infplacey [info] Thanks for the response! I am in PA and we have two-party consent.So, I have gone through ADA training myself, but the way I was treated before is why I’m confused about how much protection I do have. If I say I have been diagnosed with depression, is that enough for them to be reasonably aware that I do? Or can they try to force me to get documentation?I really do appreciate any help you can give, especially resources. It’s been awhile since I went through training, but I don’t think my experiences have matched up with my rights.
Queso_and_Molasses [info] I used to have the exact same sleep schedule as you, and that year was the best of my life. But after I was diagnosed with depression, waking up is the most difficult thing in the world. I feel you. 
WhenLeavesFall [info] I have an nmom. I didn't even bother telling her when I was diagnosed with ADHD. I learned my lesson when I told her in my early 20s I was diagnosed with depression and she said that if I took antidepressants, I was a drug addict and I needed to pull myself up from my bootstraps. Only the strong survive (because chemical imbalances make you weak to her, I suppose) and I have to get over whatever I was feeling. I know how unfair and shitty having an nmom is, believe me OP. What I will tell you is that as unlikely as it seems now, you will care less and less what your mother thinks or how she acts as you go further into adulthood and instinctively look to her less for assurance. And then one day when she has a tantrum or decides to throw you some insults, you will roll your eyes, walk away, and continue your day like it never happened. Feeling like you have to "move on" (I heard that from nmom too, because childhood was hard and we did not have an easy life) is doing a disservice to yourself because it is invalidating your perfectly normal emotions. You can't erase the 18 years of your life and you shouldn't feel like you have to bury your experiences. I encourage you to acknowledge what happened to you. You had a shitty childhood. So did I. It's part of who we are and we have every right to be angry and feel pain at the injustice. **You are allowed to be unhappy about how you were treated. You are a human being with dignity and self-respect** And going through that anger will allow you to heal, I promise. I will be straight with you. Navigating early adulthood without parents to fall back on is very, very difficult. It might be the hardest thing you've ever done. But it's not impossible and resources are out there to help you. There are subreddits like / or / or / if you need guidance. Feel free to PM me at any time. 
pikachuuuuu [info] Yes, I was diagnosed with depression long long ago, way before my ADHD diagnosis, and I am on meds for it.  It's just something I've never really been able to get over, so learning it also has to do with ADHD, which I was recently diagnosed with and am still learning about, has been eye opening.
Dragon_Girl928 [info] My diagnoses story is super long as well. I was known as a bit of a violent but passive child when I was 6 and my parents were going through a divorce and I would act up a bit with other kids and also steal stuff from the classroom. But the main thing the teachers noticed was that I literally did not ever pay attention in my morning Chinese class (I went to an immersion school) so I didn’t know how to speak as well and I fell behind. After moving schools I had my hearing checked because my dad thought I had auditory processing issues but the doctor suggested attention issues. In middle and early high school I was kinda depressed and anxious and when I got myself into progressively worse situations I had a stay in the psych ward where I was diagnosed with depression, then in the next ward the doctor said I had autism/aspergers. I got tested and I didn’t have autism I had the step down obscure diagnoses of Social communication disorder but there was no treatment for that which was covered so I moved on. Then I was evaluated by my school for a 504 because I needed extended time on math tests and I got diagnosed with adhd, or specificity add inattentive type. Adhd makes a lot of sense for me and my issues and I didn’t ever had the repetitive behaviors of autism, I had a case of ocd for 3 months due to a rough period and I also never had sensory issues. I had a lot of difficulties when I was young with attention especially in school but the issues got better progressively but my social issues got worse. The long stories from this is that you will get a different diagnoses wherever you go and for different reasons and the person who knows you the best is yourself if something doesn’t fit or a diagnoses don’t make sense for you then you can look elsewhere.
kimbyblue [info] That makes sense! I have been diagnosed with depression so the depression and daydreaming correlation is totally understandable. Things are so much harder for.me too when I have my lower points. Being a girl that's even harder, as in some points in the menstrual cycle (ovulation, pms) hormonal shifts happen that can really exacerbate depression.My daydreams have reduced considerably since focusing on working on my depression rather than stopping the daydreaming. I started to do all these little things that help depression, like exercise, meditation, proper sleep, eating well, and a self help workbook. I'm a very skeptical person and always hated whoever gave me such advice (like meditating or exercising) but I decided to just give it a try since I was in rock bottom anyway. My problems are still here and I still have a long way to go. But I'm.more centered, does that make sense? I feel less distressed and like I'm struggling less. I feel more moments of calm, despite some moments of distress. I have not daydreamt for 30 something days, and that hasn't even been my focus at all, it just happens as I try to address depression directly.About the animals thing, I also love them so yes, it is very hard to see something like that. I've been trying to extend this understanding of the situation and this compassion for myself too...You're very sweet and kind in your response. Thank you! Oh, the workbook I'm using is The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Depression, I bought the kindle version.&lt;3
Wicomico96 [info] I feel the same way too. Sometimes I think I won’t have the balls to do it but if I was faced with death I’d happily go. What I mean is that if I were in a car accident where I could do something to save myself, I wouldn’t. If I were swimming and my arms go tired, I’d let go. At the beginning when I was diagnosed with depression, I’d cry and pray that something horrible would take me out. I’d pray my car would flip and explode or for me to be in the way of a gun. I may not be praying anymore but I know I wouldn’t do anything to stop it.
JenniferKayla [info] Agreed. I was diagnosed with depression before the age of 10, had several traumatic experiences both before and after. At 14 I had tried to kill my self three times in one year, every time it got brushed off as “she just wants attention.” Which...if someone has to go through those type of lengths to receive attention..maybe give them the fucking attention? I’ve never understood that mindset. By 16 I had been hospitalized at least 6 times. By 19 that number doubled. I’m 26 now, and looking back at those years I can undoubtedly say it was absolutely depression and not me just being dramatic. I still have depression, I always will. You don’t “get over” depression or suicidal thoughts. It either wins and you die, or you find ways to live your life around it. I am very sorry and so saddened to hear this OP,
linebreaker-bot [info] &gt;I always had a lack of sleep ever since I was little. I don’t know the reason but I can tell you that I replaced sleeping with day dreaming. I don’t remember the first time but it definitely was when I had my first crush. Ever since then I would Day dream a world that I created. It was like I had a second life I lived in at night (they were about a family I had in the future). This went on for years and I never thought anything bad of it. Then in 2018 I remember going to the supermarket with my sisters. This wouldn’t be the first time I had a maladaptive daydream outside, but it was about my friend and I and some story I created in my head.&amp;nbsp;&gt;That’s when I almost crossed the street with a green light and I woke up to reality with one one of my sisters grabbing my arm and asking if I’m blind. I laughed it off of course but then realized that this Daydreaming stuff is becoming a problem. Obviously the day dreaming did not stop. Summer break was over and I had school. In the beginning of the year everything was fine. And day dreaming wasn’t much of a problem to me anymore especially since I can control it. I still tend to do it but it didn’t affect me as much. Fast forward to the beginning of this year. I had to start waking from school to home and that’s a 40 minute walk all alone.&amp;nbsp;&gt;I was kinda scared that I would start day dreaming and something would happen to me. It was a good thing I had a few people I walked with sometimes and when I didn’t I just listened to music to distract me. I also accidentally found a post about Maladaptive day Dreaming and that is when I started my research about it. I thought I was alone in this and I find it crazy that there’s other like me out there. In February I had a huge fight with my mom (verbally) later on I was diagnosed with depression and sleep disorder. Through therapy sessions I found out my mom has been emotionally abusing me all these years.&amp;nbsp;&gt;I already knew this and how my mom is toxic but all this just told me the reasoning to the Maladaptive day dreaming. When I was five my parents got divorced and I believe that was the cause as well. I went to the doctor on May 5th and I was going to bring up the Maladaptive day dreaming up but then I just got quiet especially with my mom being there. I just felt like I shouldn’t speak about it all. Same goes for my therapy session. And now just a few days ago I spent 9+ hours willingly day dreaming and I have no reason to why I did that. I’m scared that this will become more of a problem but I’m scared of reaching out for help because I think it’s not big deal.&amp;nbsp;Hey /u/BrockenSeason, it looks like you posted a wall of text.

hjkljgtj [info] Thanks for this. I was diagnosed with depression but so many other things are at play that make everything a nightmare. I don’t feel bad about deciding to kill myself anymore
athrowawaay__ [info] When I was diagnosed with depression around 17-18, she said I just needed friends. I told her about my BPD diagnosis about 4-5 years ago and I remember her saying “its always something with you.” I was also diagnosed with an eating disorder and GAD at 15. My sister also had a lot of issues growing up: rehab at 14-15, self-harm, in trouble with drugs, getting brought home from the cops for drinking in fields, but I think because that’s the same behaviour my mom took part in when she was young, it was deemed as normal whereas I was more clingy and moody which she found to be annoying. To this day, my mom says my sister is just like her because they both suffer from the same physical aliments and drug addictions - opioids and meth. My mom understands and supports her, but because for the most part of my life I’ve just powered through shit, I’m seen as not being as “messed up”, I think anyways. I’ve learned now that if I’m struggling with mental health, it’s often downplayed as being attention seeking and she’ll compare how my life is no where near as awful as hers or my sisters. I go through stages where I want a relationship with her, however, it’s become very clear to me that every time she reaches out or wants to “make things right”, she ends up making me feel like a shitty person which sends me into an emotional breakdown (writing this I’m realizing the cause of this current one). I still love her and care about her, and it breaks my heart that she is the way she is. I try to tell myself that deep down she is a good person. She’s just very troubled and has cognitive dissonance towards many things in her life including my chaotic childhood. I find people like her are too set in their ways to change. She doesn’t see that she’s the problem or that she has problems, it’s everyone else’s fault as to why she’s struggling. On the locus of control, she’s very external. The cycle I keep replaying is intertwined with the cycle she keeps replaying: she wants to get better, she feels bad for her lack of parenting and reaches out, I fall for it, reach out with my own issues, get invalidated and made out to be the bad guy which then brings up all the feelings I experienced during my childhood and teen years.  I used to blame her a lot, but I know I have control over my life - it would just help with bettering myself if I could feel like she cared for me because when your own mother doesn’t care for you, you feel worthless and like you’re incapable of being loved. I need to learn to understand that her inability to care or show me love has nothing to do with my worth as a person. Sometimes our parents don’t have or can’t have the mental capacity to understand the harm they’ve inflicted on us, so it’s better for them to simply deny it happened. That’s the excuse that I’ve made for my mom anyways.
FluffySharkBird [info] I was tested for it as a child so his question wasn't that weird to me.  My brother said I was tested for autism too, and when my school started doing cursive (I was about 9) they hated my writing so much they made me do physical therapy for it.  I bet they tested me for dysgraphia (from what I can research it's like dyslexia but for writing).So the only things I've ever known for sure is the hearing impairment, which is a birth defect so I've always had it, and I was diagnosed with depression when I was 10.I wish I could make more special needs friends (I'm in college now) because it's hard to talk about this stuff with "normal" people.  They say shit like "But you're not disabled!  You're different!" Like oh thanks that fixed my problems.  Sometimes it feels like it offends people that I'm not 100% happy about it all the time.Or they feel awkward or bad for me.  It's different when another special needs person feels bad because they feel bad at your level.  They don't feel bad for you the way others do, the way I feel bad for sick dogs.  Special needs people feel bad for my situation as an equal.
aysecube [info] I have! I've known what I wanted to do since I was 13 (23 atm), a lawyer or even a detective  (I was stuck between the two) but my parents didnt exactly give me support, and wanted me to focus on something more "achievable " . Like they clearly had no faith in my dreams so why the fuck should I? Granted I was diagnosed with depression years later, but still lacking the encouragement and confidence I need.I'm completely with you, I barely want to go outside because of the shitty people out there.  It feels redundant .
vaultdweller64 [info] This really sums up my life in a lot of ways. In all honesty, while I'm diagnosed with depression, it's not the sadness that conquers me, but the apathy. It's hard to live day in and day out when you feel like you don't have a purpose or any direction in life. When you get to the point where you don't enjoy anything anymore, it's hard to even get out of bed. Or even care if you do.I wish I had an answer for this, but as I said, I'm currently living this situation as well. However, I would suggest seeing a therapist. I genuinely think everyone can benefit from therapy. Talking to someone who will hold no judgement on you and who can also help you process your feelings is one of the best things you can do for yourself. And it really does help kind of sort your thoughts out. Stuff you subconsciously knew, but never really framed it in certain contexts.Stay strong, my friend. There's an entire community here who is here for you. Keep your family close. And whatever you do, don't shut yourself off from the rest of the world. It only makes things much harder and will draw you further into a pit of despair.
jake1110 [info] I came down the same road you did, I was diagnosed with depression months before ASD. Now it’s hard differentiating the two
glittermoths [info] Things DO get better. And guess what...they will get better for YOU. I was diagnosed with depression as an 11 year old. I was put on pills which later turned into addiction and you know what those pills did? They masked it all. They made me even sicker. One day I decided that I wasnt letting this control me. My life had also spiraled out of control. I was 23 when I got myself off prescription drugs. I will be 26 this year. My body has had to detox for 3 years and some of the drugs actually damaged my memory and my metabolism. I want to tell you that you do matter. All of you reading this matter so much in this world. We have a purpose so much bigger than we even know. We are meant to help each other grow and thrive and LIVE! I know you will overcome this, I did. 
chancegiven [info] I was diagnosed with depression in the 7th grade but I had the symptoms of it for years. I had suicidal thoughts in the 4th grade. I hate being depressed, and I hate seeing people who do it just because its quirky and they want attention and they can do whatever they want and you can't say anything because they're 'depressed'.
jakeslash [info] That sucks, I was diagnosed with depression 7 years ago but haven't been in a psych ward and hopefully won't
flashflashcarcrash [info] This is where my questions come in. I've been diagnosed with depression since 2008 &amp; have unfortunately had an abortion in the past. I also have tattoos &amp; a history of self harm 
heartbagels [info] no I was diagnosed with depression by a therapist
jesse1300 [info] I've had depression for most of my life. When I look back to my childhood, I realize that even when I was very, very young, I had recurring depressive episodes. I was good at hiding my feelings and acting cool around people, so my family didn't know until I was 13 or 14. It got so bad that I couldn't pretend anymore. My mother took me to a psychologist and I've been diagnosed not with depression, but with an identity disorder or something like that. I was diagnosed with depression later. But that's not important. The therapy was useless. It didn't help me at all, neither did the drugs I had to take. What hurt me the most was my mother's sadness when she learned about my mental issues. She was often very sad, disappointed and I know she didn't mean to, but she made me feel guilty. Bad choice of words maybe. But it still hit me hard. I didn't want to watch her suffer anymore so I pretended to get better. I don't go to the psychologist anymore, I don't take any drugs, and I struggle with this on my own.I just wanted to say I know how hard it is - having to live with this shit everyday, your own mind killing you and telling you you're worthless, slowly forgetting how happiness feels like... it's too damn hard. Nobody deserves it. I wish I could help everyone here and make it all go away, but I can't. I can only wish you all the best in the world and tell you you're worthy. To anyone who needs to hear this: you're a beautiful person and I love you. I hope you get better someday and love yourself as much as you hate yourself now. Because you deserve love and care, because you're important. You are a significant part of the universe and you are not alone. You matter. All lives matter. We're all a part of something great and wonderful. Please think about it while you look at the stars tonight.
DreamSteel [info] 14 years ago I was diagnosed with depression. 14 years I've seeked professional help off and on. I've seen multiple therapists, been put on a cocktail of medications, been through intensive outpatient group therapy, and learned a lot of strategies for coping. Problem is despite having acceptance, support, and understanding I just end up back in a rut every year. I go through the repeat process of seeing a therapist, upgrading or changing meds. It feels never ending.Last month, I was diagnosed with ADHD. It  was a major relief. I should have been diagnosed when I first started treating my depression in grade school. It's helped me let go of a lot things I used to beat myself up over. I've started taking new medication for my ADHD, learned strategies for dealing with it and most days I feel okay. Some days though the depression hits me. There's usually reasons attached to the episodes, and I struggle to climb over the mental walls they create.I tell myself "It'll be okay, I'll figure it out." Today I'm having a hard time convincing myself of it. With so many things I've let go, more critical things have taken they're place and it's building up more and more. Financial burdens and the desire to go back and do things I've failed at becomes overwhelming. Understanding why I've struggled with school, over spending, and substance abuse hasn't made it easier to tackle these things and it's chipping away at me again. I hope that I can push through, but it's not really getting easier and the feeling of self-doubt and hopelessness is taking hold again.
ohkay- [info] Thank you for this! Next time I see them I’ll try and explain why it’s important to me. I think I feel like I would be lying to my family and friends if I said “I have been diagnosed with depression” because there is clearly so much more going on than just that. It just kinda sucks because i feel stuck with this therapist and can’t change, bc they know my experience better than anyone else, and feel like starting over would be way too hard.
Tigger_tigrou [info] I moved to Canada 11 years ago so the B.C. part is pretty obvious. I was diagnosed with depression and got treated but somehow that’s not “A.D.”... It was a lengthy process of medication and therapy. My life now is nowhere near what I thought could be possible... like I’m actually happy now. And yet it’s not a clear A.D. It’s not a single event. Batlling depression is hard work and a lengthy process, with adjustments and relapses... just putting in out there for people going through it. Don’t give up, not only is it possible but it’s also worth it!
HyperChibiAbsol [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16 but I’ve started therapy again and nothing much has come of it yet..*hugs*
wafflekonez [info] Grew up in a Christian family, can confirm. First time I told my mom I was diagnosed with depression she shook it off and told me to just go back to church, that the Devil was targeting me in my weakness. I’ve gone on to forgive her for that because after a year of therapy I’ve realized a lot of people don’t really understand what exactly depression is, hell I never did either besides it being a “chemical imbalance”.I’m grateful for having gone through depression though, it’s taught me so much about what’s important in life and the importance of being there for others. I have a much greater appreciation for life, and after seeking profession help and talking out all my shitty issues, I feel in control of my life and 1,000,000 times more positive about everything. Reading Mark Maron’s book also helped iron out the remaining kinks.Tips for anyone who thinks they’re going through depression: Find someone, anyone to talk to and tell them everything you feel, even if it doesn’t make sense. Seek professional help if you can, it’s definitely worth it. And though you may not see it or believe, it can and does get better if you’re brave enough to face it and put in the effort to work through it. It’s not an easy thing to live with, but you can make it out, it’s just a matter of understanding your mind and your body and why things affect you the way they do. EDIT: Though I’m not the best Christian, I do believe in God, and I think in his own way he walked me through my recovery process to give me an understanding of it, so that I can use my experience to help others. I’m a firm believer in the power of Love and loving others regardless of their background/situation. There’s too much hate in this world going around, we need to be brave and fight back with compassion, patience, and kindness.
wowitskapow [info] I know, but it’s so hard not to. I was diagnosed with depression so whenever I have one of my episodes I usually have to come here (or elsewhere) to confirm my own negative beliefs about myself. I try to avoid it because I know people hate depressed people coming on and showing their insecurities but it’s hard not too sometimes. 
defaultweedbabe [info] I'm sorry you're going through a rough time!! It always gets better!! We live in a loving universe!I was diagnosed with depression last summer. At that time I thought I've had it my whole life.Then I quit my job and I was like OH MY GOD! How did I not see it? I am a highly sensitive person! Every time I've quit a job it was always because I was absorbing the bad vibes of people there. As a child my family life was so messed up and I was always attracting really messed up people into my life. I started dejunking the negative people in my life and all the symptom of depression went away and I came off my meds.My true feelings are love and happiness but the people around me were really ruining my life.
DoctorJony5 [info] I am 14 years old now, I was diagnosed with depression at 8, diagnosed with high functioning depression at 10.This story really touches me as the last friends I had (2 days ago) left me and decided to make everyone in my school hate me, since then I’ve had to spend a whole day at the psychiatrist and spent a whole morning with the headmaster talking about why they would ever have any reason to bully me both mentally and physically.
GuyFromTexas123 [info] What stuff do you mean?I am diagnosed with depression, and nothing on here is "funny". But it's relatable, which is in a way comforting.However browsing this sub makes me feel worse usually, so I restrict myself to browse /top/this week every once in awhile.
pepthomas [info] Oh man, you bet. It starts out kind of shit, but things are really going well now.A few years back, I was diagnosed with depression, insomnia, IBS, and a substance abuse disorder. I had a few low-wage service type jobs over the years. Never went for any post-secondary education, so I haven't accumulated any debt, but nothing special.In 2014, I moved to a new city with one of my best pals from high school. Neither of us really knew anyone else here. I ended up nearly becoming a shut-in, living off my savings and only leaving the apartment to buy food. Not a great time.Eventually, the money started to run out, so it was time to get another crappy job. One of the guys there really brought me into the social group in the workplace, and we went for wings every couple weeks and stuff. I started a band with one of my co-workers, and started dating another. One of the guys in the band got a job and had to move, so I got my roommate in, and we're really starting to get some traction. The guy in the band, my girlfriend, and I all got laid off, but just yesterday I accepted a management position with the same company.On top of that, it's a night position, and holy crap dude! I can finally stay up all night playing video games without feeling like I'm wasting my life. I get paid salary now! Things are looking good :)
toomanygoblins [info] Don't drink fireball, you'll get sick and never enjoy cinnamon again. Suicide is a great way to say "fuck it I'm out" I guess but you wont leave behind any happy people, everyone you know will blame themselves at one point or another. Everything that is good and that is bad in your life will pass including the thoughts of this girl and your suicide. I know this sounds so stupid and you're probably thinking I don't know the pain you're going through. Well... you're right. while I have been diagnosed with depression I don't know what your life is like. But things change, with medication, therapy time and work. Please hold on and be patient with yourself and give it time. There will be more girls and breakups, there will be more good days and bad ones but please hold on because when this situation passes I want you to be able to look back and smile at something.
EvilSubie21 [info] I'm really sorry about your grandfather. That's never an easy thing to deal with. As for the "becoming an adult" thing, yeah don't worry. I'm 20 and I felt exactly like you do. I was diagnosed with depression at 14, along with a laundry list of other things. The lack of confidence and self-esteem is something I deal with on a daily basis. I feel all of it, just like you say. The constant awareness of how I'm presenting myself. And boy, oh boy have a lot of my problems stemmed from my inability to change. I'm also overweight, because I overeat and I'm lazy. I go days without showering and/or brushing my teeth. Sometimes the days just blend together and I forget. I waste all my money on cigarettes, video games and random shit I don't need. I don't have a car. No friends. Really I feel your pain. I've been lucky to sleep 8 hours the past week. I've been unemployed for months, and im stuck at my parents house. broke as hell.But you do have two semesters of college under your belt, and while you might not think much of that, I think that's pretty awesome. Cause I haven't been able to do that. It will get easier, but you have to want it. Depression is hell my friend. But it can be conquered like anything. I see everyone I used to know in nice cars, their own apartments, etc. I'm jealous. But i know with hard work, I'll get there too. We will. We're gonna mess up. We're gonna make mistakes and do stupid shit. But thats all part of the experience. You just put one foot infront of the other and don't stop. We get stuck in our heads and an idle mind is the devils playground. You can lose that weight. You can get that job and you can keep that promise to your mother. I know you can. Your life is in your hands. It will only be shit if you let it. Dont let things keep you down and work, work, work. Do what you gotta do and eventually it'll all come together. Not immediately, but it will.  
joho3883 [info] I was diagnosed with depression In 1st grade so I was about 7 years old. I started antidepressants in 3rd grade so about 9 years old. I do believe I still had my sense of smell. But thank you I will try to find more info
Amelia_M_James [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 10. It doesn't matter how old you are. What matters is how you feel.
bumblebri93 [info] I have never felt more at peace, and was low key wondering if I was a sociopath. I was diagnosed with depression and insomnia this year, and have actually slept without medication this week. Which is completely crazy for me; and I don’t know the last time it happened!
Njeff [info] I am diagnosed with depression (in remission) and I can tell you I know how you feel.  My medication and therapy helped overcome it, though.  I would mention it to your doctor if you are still struggling.  Medication only took me so far, and therapy helped me change my thought patterns to prevent it from happening again.
rattler44 [info] Just finished my junior year in college n had a similiar experiance in the fall, best advise is get help from a psyciatrist that knows what theyre doing. I was diagnosed with depression but the treatment didnt help till I saw a professional and got actual help and took medication for what I really had. Talking is nice, but if you have a chemical imbalance it will only go so far, because you cant fix a broken arm by talking. Just know that there are people who know of or have gone through similiar experiances themeselves and that you're not alone regardless of where you are. Just know that it will get better, just keep fighting n seeking help, n it might not seem it but it'll pay off.
fneezer [info] Is that why people don't talk much about what emotions actually feel like, because it's exactly the same uncomfortable little pains as needing to take a dump or being constipated? So it would be gross and too much information if people said which one of those sensations they're having when they say they feel an emotion or say they have a gut feeling. So they just don't say. There's no sensation of swelling or motion involved, or impression of that. The idea that there's swelling or stretch of the intestines involved in getting those sensations is just an idea based on mechanical ideas about physics, that maybe there's more in the intestines somewhere, and that would activate some nerves that are sensitive to stretch. The sensation itself is just vaguely uncomfortable, like a light pinch on the skin. It doesn't feel specifically like a stretch on the skin, let alone feel like any sort of motion or swelling.I thought I specifically said that what I called a sinking feeling wasn't a sensation in my chest or gut. I guess it was a bad mistake for me to call it a "sinking feeling" if you keep misunderstanding it that way. It wasn't any sort of sensation of motion or swelling in my internals. I don't have any sensations of motion or swelling in my internals. Before reading more about emotions a couple of years ago, I didn't even know that people would feel something inside the torso, below the skin and muscles, besides occasional pain from the intestines, that has digestive causes or from getting their abdomen palpated like by a doctor checking for appendicitis.I thought that the reason that heart attack pain is said to usually occur in shoulder to arm, as "referred pain," is because there isn't such a thing as a perceived sensory location inside the chest. I wasn't aware that other people might think that reason actual pains might seem to be somewhere else would be because emotional sensations might seem to be there in the chest usually. I thought all the talk relating to emotions using the word "heart" was a metaphor or about the conceptual center of a person, not the literal organ. I thought feeling the heartbeat was something people do through their skin when it's strong, or with their fingers on their skin on specific places when it's not, which would be the reason people take their own pulse that way, and they have to be taught how to do it. I didn't think anyone would be able to count their pulse rate without being taught how to do it with their fingers and a clock, to get a number that they'd then compare with other numbers to see if it was faster or slower than what's supposedly usual for them.The throat sensation that I used to get sometimes related to crying was just like there's something related to swallowing or the voice box preparing to make a sound. I only called it a "lump in the throat" because that's an expression other people always use when they get a sensation there related to crying. I don't know what that sensation other people get there really is, and I didn't expect it would be something painful, like some other people say it is. So maybe I made a bad mistake too by using the expression "lump in the throat."I don't know whether there's supposed to be sensation inside the chest, or sensation inside the gut more than vague discomfort related to having to go. It could be, as far as I know, that there's not really supposed to be any more sensation deeper inside the torso than surface voluntary muscles, the same as there's not sensation inside the head or inside the bones. So I don't know whether people are just using their imagination when they say things that make it sound like feeling something more. That's why I've been asking about emotions and what people feel and what "feeling" means, on reddit, and other places in my life, because I don't know, and it seems like it might be really important for figuring out why I've been diagnosed with depression usually since I was a teenager, and important for figuring out what my symptoms are or what the difference is actually from normal.Then when you assume that I'm feeling some normal sorts of emotional things from the internals, in response to my explaining in detail the little that I do feel and that it doesn't seem emotional and instead seems like it's about eliminatory functions and seems like less sensation than other people get even for those sensations, that makes it sound to me like maybe there isn't supposed to be a lot of emotional sensation actually. What you wrote is implying to me, maybe it's just the slightest bits of sensation that are about normal physical material mechanical things, that people get, then people use a whole lot of imagination and reading things into it and trying to believe that they feel something that supposedly tells them something about their emotion, when actually their emotion was in their mind, just a concept about the situation in their intellect, the whole time, and not anything in their body. They just misinterpret their body sensations and use their imagination, to try to fit in with having "strong feelings" because that's a popular religion about what emotions are, and they want to believe they're members of that religion in good standing.
Gazpacho_Catapult [info] &gt; I would guess that you’ve never personally struggled with it And that's your issue, you assume. Just because weight isn't a big priority to you, or your wife hasn't put on that much, doesn't mean OP's concern isn't valid. If she finds her partner less attractive because he's put on a large amount of weight, who are you to shame her and judge her relationship for it?  As for your comment, I have struggled with weight. When I was 21 I weighed 75kg, had a six pack and was in the best shape of my life due to rigorous training in mixed martial arts. Then I was diagnosed with depression and put on a medication that causes massive weight gain; 12 months later I weighed almost 130kg. It took 2 seperate hardcore 6 month diets and a painful amount of exercise, but I got back down to 80kg, despite still being on the medication.  So really, I'm in the perfect position to comment on battling weight gain, and if I can stay in shape on this BS medication, then people without a medical condition have absolutely no excuse.
nadjaproblem [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was pretty young and have had to deal with it almost all my life. It's almost like it becomes your identity. I was comfortable with it after a while too and honestly when I get into depressive episodes even now it feels almost like where I'm supposed to be because it was how I was constantly for so long. It's like happiness becomes this weird thing and it almost feels like it's something that you aren't even supposed to have. You end up comfortable with your sadness  when it's been part of you for so long and being any other way is like stepping out of that comfort zone. You gotta try to remember that depression isn't your main identity ya know? It's hard to get out of but ya gotta try. I still have to work at it day by day and gradually it gets easier! The more you work on it the happier you will be and it'll all be wayyyy better on the end. It's easy to be depressed and hide from the world and all that, the hard part is stepping out of that mindset. Once you finally do and you keep working at it things will feel much more comfortable and you'll be able to find more of yourself and it'll be awesome. 
Fackyaself [info] It’s never too late to go from negative to positive. Easier said than done, I know, but after a while of being depressed I was no longer THINKING negatively but actually BELIEVING negatively. Gain some positive momentum and one day you’ll wake up giddy to be the person you are now.(I was diagnosed with depression a year ago and it’s almost completely gone for me.)
Curlypie [info] What you're describing is exactly how I felt before I was diagnosed with depression. You should talk to a doctor about how you feel and they may recommend some medication to take. In my experience, they make depression much worse ( I had to check into a locked facility for my own safety) before they make it better. It takes about 2-3 weeks to see some results. Im off my medication now and feel better than I ever did before, thats just how it worked out for me. Just know, some medication can be VERY expensive if you are in the US, my copay for my meds monthly was $160. Also think about going to see a therapist. They can help give you coping skills and also help you open up and dig a bit deeper about why you might feel the way you do. 
HellCat70 [info] Would you mind elaborating on how he harassed your people? I'm curious what last year's (non-serious, as agreed) ex could resort to, given the opportunity. Fortunately, we'd only dated about a month when I broke off clean, and he never had the chance to meet my friends/family/etc. Guy still sends pics of any business bearing my name and selfies with this dog he sits occasionally. He was fun, but quickly saw his judgement and mean-spiritedness (he called himself "opinionated and high-spirited") toward anything he didn't understand (depression, "how can someone allow themselves to fall for the bullshit old wives tale of ADHD? That's weakness.") As soon as it clicked that he was no longer on his better behavior an this is the real thing I quit. I told him that I always feel shitty around him, thinking he'd understand because I've been diagnosed with depression (also had neurosurgery years ago) so he should be glad to be free to pursue someone who fits him better.. yet here I am 10mos later, still getting holiday wishes and pics showing he hasn't yet let go. Why?? What drives obsession like that? Isn't it obvious that it's done, over?If it's not too personal, what'd this guy do to harass your inner circle of people, and for how long? 
TheHungryRoot [info] I doubt it. They really are just looking to make sure that you are of sound mind and that you will be a compliant patient. I was diagnosed with depression at 14, been in and out of therapy most of my adult life and was on antidepressants for a number of years. I was not in therapy and not on meds at time of my consult, but I assured the psych that I was totally fine and that my depression was very manageable. Didn't have any issues getting approval. I also second the person that mentioned that they want to make sure you won't turn to another vice (alcohol, pills, etc.) if you aren't able to "eat your feelings" after surgery, like a lot of overweight people do.  
nanette3 [info] Hey, it's fine. You're going to turn out okay. You are really struggling right now. I was diagnosed with depression and I had SEVERAL moments where I felt happy and content. It doesn't mean you're not depressed or you don't have anything to worry about. Your feelings are valid here. Don't make any big decisions in this state, ok? just put on some music and shut your eyes. And focus all your energy on deep breaths. You'll be okay just keep breathing slowly. You're safe. You're going to go through tomorrow like you always manage to and you will be back home and safe. Come back here and talk to us. We got you.
helloreddit3645 [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was 8. It’s rare but it can happen. I was abused as a child. How do you know this person is lying? Even if they are, why do you care? 
Im_A_Girl_Damn_It [info] They are surprisingly picky. I tried to enlist when I was 17 (I had already graduated and my parents would have signed off on it) since I was poor and had nothing else going for me. I did great on my ASVAB, but eventually I was turned away because I was diagnosed with depression when I was 11. I hadn't seen a psychiatrist in years and was doing great mentally, but it was still enough to turn me away. It's a bitch too, I was in NJROTC so I would have enlisted as a E3. Oh well.
Violentfemme89 [info] I feel you so much. I lost my job recently and it was well payed, now I'm trying to get any job just to pay some bills, and my credit is loosing points. I was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago but now I feel worst. I think is our generation, we have to do many things just to live a decent life, everything is so expensive and it's hard to stay afloat. I understand how you feel, but pleas edont let this feeling consume you, you can walk on the rain everyday but you are not the rain. You will not see this now, but you will feel better, please keep trying to stay alive for your wife. 
robstyg [info] Thank you so much for your reply. I'm diagnosed with depression and should've started my therapy in july, they've never called me again though. I managed it quite well over the last couple of days to suppress these thoughts when they came up. Denying thoughts naturally feels like an unhealthy solution to me, but it really helps that you say it's the correct way of dealing with it. I'll do exactly that and hope these thoughts fade away. It's also not the first time I experience this, it has happened a couple of times in the past already, and it has always been a struggle for days.
NonFunctioningHuman [info] So it's been a year since my (ex)gf and I broke up, my family moved abroad and I still feel wrecked. I just feel like life has no meaning anymore and the thought of suicide is always lingering. I feel so lonely sometimes but I don't really know if I want a relationship. I feel crippled, I can't find motivation enough to do things and I was diagnosed with depression a couple of months ago. I just wish i could dissapear, so no one misses me or feel bad for my departure but my family will get really sad if I go. Basically that's the only thing tying me to this world. I don't want to inflict any suffering on others, let alone my family. A psychologist simply doesn't work for me. I just want to feel again like when I was a kid, with that innocence thinking that everthing was ok and everyone had some goodness in them but I can't. I've become bitter... and I hate myself for that. Anyway, that's how it is for me. thank you for reading if you came this far, I guess i just needed to express some of this somewhere.
FreeReaction [info] WOW. I was recently diagnosed with POCS after years of doctors telling me I didn’t have it. I finally saw an endocrinologist who actually looked into my hormones. I was diagnosed with depression just before high school and just recently I realized that these two must be linked to eachother. I become so irritable and down for a certain period of time and it’s horrible I’ve tried antidepressants for a couple months and didn’t like them because of side effects. I don’t know what to do about my down moods it really affects my daily life 
ezraxcore [info] I was diagnosed with depression a month ago. I started taking Sertraline. It kinda worked i guess? The only problem is that I cant feel emotion that much. Im better off like this than being overwhelmed and wanting to kill myself. Also, my mother is my strength. If you need someone to talk to, OP, you can send me a PM.
chanesully [info] I woke up day in and day out thinking that everything was terrible, I was ready to die, often thought about killing myself, and I hadn’t felt happy in years. I was diagnosed with depression
zoom_to_earth [info] I'm so sorry you're suffering. I really wish I had some good advice. I didn't want to read and just not say anything. Know that you're not alone. I was diagnosed with depression over a decade ago (as a child) and I still struggle with it daily.Please don't give up. We are still young. I have hope that science will invent new medicines that actually work for our depression.Feeling numb feelings and even death is something I'm sure many here relate to.You are worth it. Don't give up. Things can get better, it just feels like forever. Just try to survive this moment.I hope others have some advice. 
rosacanina_ [info] &gt; Not sure where you’re getting the 3 days max recommendation of medication for sleep from.Those are the guidelines for usage of zopiclone for example. &gt; Er... be careful of your claims and overgeneralization. Medicine is much more nuanced than you’re leading it to be (all neuroleptics causing “numbness” for example and not being able to function for multiple weeks). True, but there's the big three or four neuroleptics that are prescribed like for example olanzapine, quetiapine and haloperidol and at least all the ones I know of have this effect. Maybe not in everyone, but if you're planning to hold on to a job this needs to be factored in to the decision of taking the medication. With any medication, really. Zopiclone causes anterograde amnesia for example, a few hours into the morning meaning you are unable to function for a few hours even after waking up.My definition of "able to function" is very strict... to me it means that the patient can continue everyday activites as usual. ADs can also make you unable to function due to the side-effects. The compulsive yawning due to escitalopram for example has huge social implications making you unable to function. Neurolpetics can also cause issues with vision, which can impact on your ability to drive, which means you can't function as usual anymore. Some drugs cause tremors or dystonia... which aren't considered "severe side-effects" but they can make you unable to function. If you have a job where you need your fingers but they jerk/shake unpredictably this can cause you to be unable to do your job (or any job even) -&gt; thus you are not able to function anymore. If you operate machinery this can also make it too dangerous to continue to work. &gt; People are allowed to drive on second generation antipsychotics, which OP is asking about. The initial sedation is in a minority of patients &lt;10-15% and lasts only a few days.Might be region dependent, but yes.. you are allowed but it's still a heck of a legal gray area. You are also allowed to drive with a blood alcohol level just 0.0001% under the legal limit, but if you happen to cause an accident it is to your disadvantage, even though you were under the legal limit but even under the legal limit means there's some form of impairment and since it caused an accident the impairment was obviously high enough to make you unable to drive... even though you were under the legal limit. It's a legal mess. &gt; Regardless, he’ll need to have a more accurate assessment since we don’t just throw drugs at people for any symptom without a full evaluation.I trust that you don't do that... but it's done... a lot. More than anybody is comfortable admitting. It's literally easier to get a prescription for an antipsychotic than it is for ibuprofene. The latter requires you to convince the doctor that you're in pain (so much as to warrant the prescription) while the former just takes an appointment at a psychiatrist and they'll throw it at you. Not to mention all the cases of misdiagnosis of illnesses as depression and all the misdiagnosis we don't even know of yet. Full evaluations cost a ton of money and time, more than any health insurance or doctor is willing to spend, ironically, because hospital stays cost upwards 600 bucks a day. &gt; There is definitely a consensus and guidelines for treating depression and treatment refractory depression.There's also consensus in the homeopathic community on how to treat some illness. The question is whether the consensus is actually rooted in overwhelming evidence or not. It's very common for psychiatrists to just have a set of medications they prescribe, and every patient gets the same thing (which of course is legit, if you assume the drug cures something and they all got the same thing, why wouldn't you) but this isn't rooted in consensus, it's rooted in "the experience of that psychiatrist"... but obviously other psychiatrists have other experiences so they prescribe different things. That's an inconsistency. If there were actual consensus, it wouldn't be a matter of experience (or preference). The same with diagnosing people. If there were consensus, then if you send the same patient to 5 different psychiatrist you'd expect at least 4/5 agreement, which in practice there isn't. Luckily, this doesn't matter too much because the treatment for a lot of them is the same anyway so a "screw up" in diagnosis isn't really that relevant to treatment. The consenus is limited to what category of drugs to prescribe (i.e. SSRIs, Neuroleptics, Tranquilizers) but that's pretty much it.I've been living with chronic pain for the last two years (although recently it is on an all time low (== almost no pain)) and one of the biggest challenge was having a GP even as much as to look at me (because I was diagnosed with depression many years ago) as the standard treatment for any patient with a mental health history and literally any symptom that isn't visible by eyesight is to send them directly to a psychiatrist without running any tests. My biggest "personal" issue with psychiatrists is that none of them offered me a treatment plan and at this point I don't think there's even a psychiatrist that can offer a treatment plan... which should be possible if there's consensus based on overwhelming evidence. Basically, this puts me into the position where I have to do my own research, read studies, study parts of medicine and pharmacology and do all this stuff I don't want to do because this shouldn't be my job in the first place.
GiftsandCurses88 [info] I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD - I’m also autistic if that’s relevant - I was previously on   anti-ds but ever since I underwent EMDR I’ve been ok without them - you can talk to me and I’ll answer as best I can 
plasticinaymanjar [info] I talked about this with my doctor when I was diagnosed with depression, and she told me that it was fine. First of all, make it clear you're not crying or upset because of them (unless you are, of course), and tell your baby sometimes people feel sad and cry, and it's ok... specially with boys, the "boys don't cry" speech and mentality is too common, even if you don't believe it yourself your son will hear it elsewhere eventually, so make sure you let him know people have emotions and it's normal and healthy to identify them, and sometimes it's ok to just cry without being judged...My son is 5, and whenever any of us is angry or sad, when we feel we're going to start crying or yelling, we sit together and hug in silence, until we feel better. Sometimes when I'm starting to lose my patience he'll tell me "mom, let's hug until you're not angry anymore", and it reaaaally helps me... in the same way, I can tell him to come hug me mid-tantrum and he'll stop and breathe in my arms... Emotions are real, we all have them, and it's healthy to let them out and let our kids know it's fine to feel things
junkykarma [info] I sat in one spot on my couch for so long that the back of my pajamas turned black from the color of the couch cushions rubbing off on me. It was absolutely pathetic, but I was so extremely depressed that it was basically all I could manage most days (disclaimer that I've been diagnosed with depression my entire adult life, my husband was also deployed at the time and I had just moved to the area shortly before taking the bar - so things were rough). Eventually I got myself in to therapy and on medication again and I took the initiative and found some temporary contract work (one of which actually lead to my permanent job), stated volunteering with a voluntary bar associations pro bono group, and forced myself to get up and out of the house more often. I worked out a lot, haha. 
RicardoRoo [info] So I’m not that old, but I had a big depressive episode where I took to my wrist about 7 or 8 times and about lost it, went to therapy, which my parents continued to bicker over for months until finally everybody just kind of ignored it. I was diagnosed with depression, where my parents fought yet again over my medicine, which I ended up not taking. I’ve also had a couple panic attacks. All of these add to my rock bottom so far. It was horrible.
oziku [info] I was diagnosed with depression at 8. I was in a very bad state. It happens but a lot of them are just looking for attention.
walkingupstream [info] Yes, I was diagnosed with depression 25 years ago, and again about 18 years ago. This past summer i was diagnosed OCD. Depression never really explained everything, but absolutely my main symptom is rumination. Depression hits when my ruminations are allowed to persist too long. The biggest difference in the treatment of each is that medication for ocs is 3-4x the dosage of ssri than for depression. Anyways people here dont seem to care to hear about OCD, judging by the downvotes, so I'll probably just quit visiting this sub in the future. Good luck to you, im doing better with the whole mental heath thing than ever before. 
krazkatluvsu [info] I am not sure where you live but I was feeling the same way. I have 11 years clean from meth and I needed to get to a psychiatrist . I am not sure if that is something you can do. I was diagnosed with depression and being on meds helped me.Congrats on the 3 years.
ElectricalDeer87 [info] I've actually got a lot of things going on that my parents don't suspect. Luckily. My mother would lock me up and my dad would sue me. I mean that. He's done that before. My dad sued me because I was diagnosed with depression. :|Edit: I find it freaky what some people call the Ana voice in their head as some kind of thing they think about, is actually a real hallucination for me just like I hallucinate other things that don't exit.
aarongr [info] I have been high every day for 2 years and a bit. Coupled with some other issues I wasn't even aware of, it has slowly destroyed my willpower and made my life a never ending cycle of Smoke-Work-Smoke-Sleep. Last february I was diagnosed with depression and started psycotherapy, yesterday I bought a pin board and put up some goals of mine. I want to quit marijuana, meditate and do my chores. My house will never look like a landfill ever again.Thank you for your uplifting words!
TDubTheSubBub [info] After I was diagnosed with depression I decided to go into an outpatient intensive dialectical behavior therapy group for adults. I learned about many different people dealing with the same illness as me and some dealing with other illnesses. We all came from different paths in life, but we all found ourselves in that room every morning, making an effort to better our lives. It was more focused on how to live with our illness than what caused it. One thing that will always stick with me is that we were all told at the beginning that we would have to deal with our illnesses for the rest of our lives. We had a couple rules for every meeting that went along with an overarching theme. We never mentioned specifics, no self harming thoughts or the like were to come up in meetings. No judgement was to be passed on anyone else, we were all there to improve our lives. And probably the most relevant for this post, we never made any assumptions. We weren't supposed to try and relate to others problems because we all came from different paths. I didn't know what anyone was going through and they didn't know what I was going through. All we needed to know was that all of our emotions were valid. We all had our reasons and those reasons were valid. I think the worst thing anyone could do to anyone dealing  with mental illness is to invalidate their emotions. Don't ever tell them that they shouldn't feel that way, don't ever make assumptions about what they are going through, and lastly don't bring it up often. We are just people trying to live the same as you. 
Jimbobobabo [info] I feel pretty much exactly like that. Sometimes I'm so up for life and sometimes, just not. I've been diagnosed with depression but doing good atm. I guess its kinda important not to label it as either having depression, or not having anything. At the end of the day it is just how you're feeling.If you feel like you need help or anything a fair amount of the time then maybe it might be good to talk to a doctor or something. Could it be something else? Like prolonged stress or not sleeping enough can have quite severe effects on your body and mind.
IfYouHaveGhosts824 [info] Four years ago, I was diagnosed with depression. I was managing a work project and it failed miserably. Some employees quit, we lost money – it was awful, and I had nobody to blame for it but myself. I was convinced my dreams were never going to come true and that I was destined to be a failure. Right as I was about to kill myself, a thought popped into my head: “If I'm dead, who's going to take care of Mom and Dad when they get old?”Just like that, it was over. Something changed in me. I was still horribly depressed, but I knew killing myself wasn't the right option. I was sick and tired of being depressed, and I was desperate to make a change for the better. I went to the doctor and they prescribed me Zoloft. It wasn't a one-and-done fix, but it was the first of many steps towards feeling better. I opened up to my family about what I was feeling. Not only did they take sympathy on me, but they gave me the finances to get my life together. It would've been so much easier to slam the door in my face, but they called me to check on me and offered me a place to stay when I needed it. If it wasn't for them, I probably wouldn't be here. Fast-forward several years. My life is now better than it's ever been. I have my dream job and I'm happier than ever before. Things are so great, I honestly can't imagine being gone. I've made it my mission in life to help other people who are struggling, the same way my family helped me when I was struggling. In a weird twisted way, I'm grateful for going through depression when I did. I had to be broken before I could be made whole again. It taught me some valuable life lessons and changed the way I look at the world. It taught me how to appreciate the good days and realize the bad days are only temporary. Being in a dark place taught me how to be more sympathetic to other people. It taught me everyone is fighting a battle we know nothing about, and sometimes, something as simple as a smile or compliment can make somebody's whole day. If it wasn't for going through depression, I doubt I would be as happy as I am now. In the end, it made me into a better person. I'm sorry for what you're going through, but I hope you can find it within you to keep pushing forward. I wish you all the best in the days ahead. You can do this – I believe in you!
BlueFlame1000 [info] If you're talking about Clinical Depression, thats not how it works, its a mental illness and can affect someone regardless of their circumstances (unless its situational depression). It's not something people choose to get and it makes it so you barely (or don't at all) enjoy the things that normal people would love doing.Thats why rich people and celebrities who seem to have everything still can have depression and commit suicide.I'm diagnosed with depression myself and I haven't told anyone about it apart from my mom because I don't want anyone to know about it or treat me differently because of it. So I find it weird that girls wanna tell you about it, especially if you're not even super close to them. That seems like it could maybe be attention seeking which is a pretty shitty thing for them to do because actual depression is the most horrible thing i've ever had to experience by far. It's like someone saying they have cancer for sympathy
xylvera [info] I can relate to the whole "they want it more so I just give inn" thing. I do that too and I struggle to push myself just like u describe. Thing is, I'm diagnosed with depression. Sounds like u might be depressed too. Maybe look into that with a professional? Sorry for ur loss, hope u figure it out.
lazerberriez [info] Try your best to find why you’re trips where bad exactly, dig deep into the roots of it and try to figure it out. There is always a reason for your trips going south and you can almost always learn how to prevent that in the future as well as help navigate through some issues in your life. It’s not easy to trip with mental health issues. I have been diagnosed with depression and GAD in the past but I don’t think that’s entirely accurate. I don’t have typical depression but more a episodic mood disorder with borderline features. When I’m in an episode tripping can be very challenging but you can gain many insights in this state. I say if you are interested then go ahead and keep going with it. Psychedelics are fascinating and do great things to us. The best thing you can do is try to apply your interests into the grander scheme of your life.
RepressingFire [info] I'm 21, I was diagnosed with depression and Asperger's at 5.  My depression has worsened significantly since age 18.
Pur33 [info] I know you are suffering because you feel your family or friends don't love/like you. However happiness comes from within.You can look at famous celebs who seem to have it all but alot of them have mental health, drugs or alcohol addiction problems.Sometimes depression might not be coming from where you think it is coming from. There might be other areas in your life that needs to be addressed or fixed.I was diagnosed with depression twice and got out of it twice. I did it by fixing the addressing the relevant things in my life.I'm alone but living well so it shows happiness doesn't come from external things.So try thinking about things in your life that you can change or control. If it is the right choice you will feel good thinking about it.Are you spiritual? Buddhism has helped me alot - that can be an option for you to look at. No harm in seeking extra supportFeel free to pm me if would like to chat
Bailey1393 [info] Kind of in the same boat I unintentionaly pushed my gf away by neglecting her not showing affection not seen her for 2 weeks... I was diagnosed with depression yesterday and started on AD's. She has wished me better but it being kind of blunt. I'm shitting myself that I've pushed her to far away because I tried to deal with depression alone.
Glaivekids [info] I didn't realise how much I believed this until I was diagnosed with depression. You mean, heathens aren't always empty and tired?
Croxxig [info] I've been diagnosed with depression and take meds for it. I can say yes it can have an effect. On my bad days I notice the weights just feels so much heavier and on good days its like nothing. 
Uknownsufferer [info] Hi man, I feel your emotions and I know what your going through. I am 17 years old. In my prime I was playing soccer for my country and enjoying every minute of my life. Around 14 years of age, I had a panic attack in an important tournament. I was rushed to the hospital with the belief that I had asthma. But I didn’t. In fact, there was nothing wrong with me, not a single thing. My life soon became a living hell as I would sit up at night drowning myself with the thought of having another attack on the field. This went on for 2 years. Every single game and a couple of days leading up towards it I would not sleep until 4-5 am with a game at around 10/11. I was dropped off the national team as my lack of sleep soon caught up to me on the field. I was sluggish and afraid of everything. I used to be so confident dribbling but everything time I was on the ball, all I had in mind was what everyone else thought of me. Soccer was my life and my passion, I wanted to become great, but I was losing it. I’ve done therapy and all sorts of medications and remedies to help me get through those hard days. 3 years go by since I’ve last played the beautiful game. I still play the odd game for my school and I score a Hatrick nearly every game. Running by players who have spent all their life trying to learn the sport and then there’s me, scared to play competitively, but still floats by every player and always finding the back of the net like i were back in school learning the alphabet. My friends’ family members say I’m a complete waste of talent but I don’t seem to care and that’s what hurts me the most. Here I am today, with a completely different problem as I was diagnosed with depression and a rare and extreme case of OCD. Doing CBT therapy twice a week and really feeling the void of my once beloved passion, football.Thanks for reading, have a good day.
sailorscovt [info] Not directly overheard but my friend told me after I had spent the weekend at her house, her mum said she just had a feeling that I was someone who'd go places in life. A year or so later, I was diagnosed with depression and went through long phases of feeling like nothing I ever did was worthwhile and just wanting everything to stop but every time I think about that one innocuous comment, I feel a bit better. Like if someone who only met me for such a short amount of time could see something special in me then maybe it was true and that maybe I shouldn't give up. I wish I could tell her how much that comment's saved me over the years. 
TheGamingBros55 [info] Look man, I really dont give a damn about this game and anyone who plays it, I have been diagnosed with depression a year ago and I am not mentally fucking stable anymore so really if Reto doesnt do something with this im just going to drop this game and this subreddit once for all and stop losing my nerves over a bunch of lazy developers.
cryphus [info] My mom is most likely a sensor even though I don't know her type, and she acts exactly like this. It's almost like she's okay with using people for advice or only talks to her friends when she needs something from them. I was diagnosed with depression awhile back and when she found out, it's like she didn't know how to deal with it. She kept denying it no matter what the doctors told her and acted like she has never seen me sad before. She was the same way when my dog got sick. I'm not sure why she's this way but it may just be her coping mechanism. I think sensors may just not like to deal with people when they're down, like they don't want to be involved and only want people when they're happy. Yeah, I know that's a *big* generalization, and I don't think it's true for all people. For some people, though, it is.Also with the SAD, I can totally relate. My depression always gets bad during the winter. It's pretty much inevitable, but I'm hoping to turn things around this year and try to prevent it from getting bad again.
mlou123 [info] Thank you, I am diagnosed with depression but I’m being sent for further diagnosis because I have all the signs and characteristics of another illness. When I’m down I feel like this, the minute I’m having a high episode I’m overly confident, it is so irritating 
LoserGodsThrowaway [info] Actually, know what, fuck you, how dare you tell me what I do and do not have, you dickish, Inceltears motherfucker. Fuck you to fucking hell actually, I was diagnosed with depression when I was 15 fucking years old, and I didn't even want to be, my school *forced* me to go see a psychiatrist, I've been in mental hospitals because I've tried taking my life more than once and spent a year on medications. You think someone speaks and talks the way I do without having mental problems? That people cut themselves and fantasize every single day about dying without having them? I know you want to think I'm some monstrous incel, but fuck you, just fuck you, you don't know a fucking THING about my life. This is why I hate *everyone* on this sub, as far as I'm concerned, you're the real monsters.
kimberlymohnsroberts [info] So I was diagnosed with hashimoto's thyroiditis which is an autoimmune disease so it comes and goes. My symptoms aren't as frequent as your but getting off birth control can affect you. Then throw in your cycle and everything is exasperated. When I was 16 and attempted suicide, I was diagnosed with depression, I probably had thyroid issues then but no one checked. As you figure this out, also consider your eating habits. It's proven way of managing/hormones issues. Healthy eating balances you more. Get as many tests as you can to get answers, good luck! And try to fight those negative thoughts!!! You are one of a kind and irreplaceable!!
no-m0tivation [info] I think I am. I mean, I get compliments a lot and I've never once looked at myself in the mirror and been like "god, you're fucking ugly." I used to be a little insecure about other things pertaining to myself, emotionally, when I was diagnosed with depression, but since I've started to recover I've just come to appreciate myself and gained some confidence, and it's definitely paid off. 
niko4ever [info] I remember as early as 4 years old that I always felt alone, because other people were a mystery. I didn't understand the way they thought, or why they said or did the things they did. Why I got weird looks when I spoke my mind.  I've been diagnosed with depression but I still don't know exactly why I was like that as a child. I think it might have been my bad home life. I just knew that there was something different about me and that I couldn't connect properly with others because of it.
you-are-my-xanadu [info] Also on your sleep habits, you either are just an night owl or you have discipline issues. Do find self-discipline to be hard for you? Dehydration should seriously be the first thing to knock off of people's Todo list. Body/brain needs water to function properly or you can't regulate your emotions and think straight enough. I'm sorry I actually cannot fathom crying for no reason. Are you absolutely positive that there's no reason behind it? Not even self-pity? I'm diagnosed with depression and I've never cried for no reason....
Teenage_Frankenstein [info] True, but I relate to it more ever since I was diagnosed with depression. So it’s just so awesome to relate with your favorite musician/band.
Mind_Velvet [info] Pretty often. Once I started I fell in love. I'd say 5 days a week at least. The past 10 years or so I smoked basically all day every day until maybe a few months ago when I wanted to begin some deep emotional work. The one negative is I tend to feel happy all the time and only focus on the positive when there's weed in my system, which is great, but just like being on antidepressants or something, it makes it hard to work through and process the deep emotional stuff. I've been through some abuse, so there was a lot of stuff I needed to process. Now I smoke maybe a week straight and then take a week off to emotionally process things and to keep my tolerance down, and that seems to be working well for me.But yeah it really hasn't had a negative effect on my thinking. Or well... I guess it's possible I would have been some sort of genius without it and I ruined that and now I'm just a semi-normal intelligent person. lol but if so, that's okay with me. Edit: I feel I should add my case is probably pretty rare. I'm an extremely hyperactive thinker. I'm one of those people who goes a mile a minute, can't ever sleep, is a workaholic, etc. So I think for me, it kinda brings me back down to earth. For someone naturally on the chill side, who struggles to motivate, who tends to be lazy, etc I could see how it could be a major negative. People have such different personalities and brain chemistry that it's hard to compare. Oh and I was also given a cocktail of antidepressants and mood stabilizers that totally messed me up during my earlier teen years. I was diagnosed with depression at 12. So whatever those drugs did to my brain also could play a role in how weed affected me (I was able to transition off those drugs using weed). In other words: It's complicated and who knows what's going on. But yeah my brain was jacked up by other stuff long before I touched weed. I don't even want to get into how badly zoloft fucked up my young brain. :(
texmexsushi [info] I was in a relationship when I was diagnosed with depression. Honestly, I wasn't sure what I needed. Now that that relationship is over, I still don't know what I need, but I know I felt better before when I had someone by my side.   Everyone's different but I prefer it when I can talk about how I'm dealing with my depression in a casual way. I like it when my friends ask "hey, hows your head today?" and I can keep my answer as short as I want or I can go into detail if I want. Just showing that you care helps.
tempuserthrowaway5 [info] Back in the 1990's I was diagnosed with depression. I was literally just angry about some unpleasant life circumstance.Now the word "depression" has a different criteria.   What you are describing was notwhat I experienced when I was given that label. What is keeping the person from functioning, more over how is that related to their environment.If its anything like my own life it has to do with not having enough personal power (if that means social, financial, freedom).If that's not the case then what is lacking?
Vic__Vega [info] Man, I hear that. I have owned guns since before I was diagnosed with depression, and I don't want to get rid of them But, I refuse to keep ammo in the house.
throwaway031917 [info] I completely agree with what you're saying, thank you for your input. I guess what I'm having trouble with is figuring out where to even begin this process. Both times I was diagnosed with depression, I didn't seek out the treatment, it just kind of happened due to circumstances. I don't know where to actively seek out the help, or who to call. 
BottomHippo [info] hi there!we're in similar situations. i'm 21 and studying chemical engineering, and i'm finishing up grad apps for PhD programs. i'd say things started getting bad for me when i was 16. my family has always been against any medications, and i used to be as well. not just psychiatric ones - it takes a lot for me to even take advil when i'm feeling sick. therapy has never worked for me because i am very closed off to people emotionally. i also have gone through TMS therapy but didn't notice much of an effect. but my mental health deterioated to the point where my mom actually begged me to see a psychiatrist, and now here i am! i'm diagnosed with depression, panic disorder, PTSD and narcolepsy, and i have been taking meds for about a year and a half now.the process of finding suitable meds is HELL. i actually love going to class (hence grad apps) and i wasn't able to attend a majority of them because i was experiencing horrible side effects of all kinds. everything seemed to make me worse and the number of meds i took from all sorts of categories of anti-depressants, stimulants, benzos, etc. is actually terrifying. DM me if you'd like to know more since i don't think it's necessary to launch into my whole life story.i'm sure you can relate to this as an engineering major: my grades went from dean's list to receiving emails from the dean about my attendance and possibly failing grades. i ended up taking a genetic test by genemind that is recommended for all those who are treatment resistant, and it turns out i have a homozygous mutation of a gene that affects norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. not everyone who has a MTHFR mutation will become sick, but it makes you more susceptible to a whole range of mental and physical health problems and makes finding the right meds a lot more difficult.anyway, i'm still not stable on a med routine but the genetic test highlighted everything that was a big NO for me and what could potentially be therapeutic and so far its results have been accurate. i'm currently takine effexor (SNRI), desipramine (TCA), klonopin, dexedrine, methylfolate for the mutation, and xanax acts as my emergency pills for my panic attacks, which aren't triggered by anything and can literally happen anytime. the process has been rough to say the least, but it has been worth getting to this point. i've gone from almost being fired from an internship because i was unable to function from having 3-4 panic attacks a week, to none at all unless i get sloppy with taking my meds. i'm still not entirely happy with the fact that i'm prescribed an amphetamine and a benzo, and take frequent breaks from taking them although i really shouldn't because my mental health significantly deterioates without them. i'm still working out my depression and narcolepsy, and this semester has really been a low point for me in terms of suicidal thoughts and relapsing back into self harm for a myriad of reasons. but there are days when i do feel improvements that indicate that my meds are working. i just need to find a therapeutic dosage, but i'm getting close!if you're looking into taking meds, just make sure you're mentally prepared to get much worse before seeing any improvements. doesn't happen with everyone, but most people take a loooonng time to find meds that they are happy with. and i've taken practically every med in the world so feel free to message me with any questions, now or later when you are prescribed something! something that i didn't know is that anti-depressants are actually addicting in a way, and there are people who have tried getting off them after long-term use but are unable to because withdrawal symptoms are just so damn bad. meds don't fix everything but for me, they alleviated my symptoms just enough to motivate me to make other lifestyle changes, like getting more exercise and drinking more water. 
ILikeToPetDogs90 [info] "I have no reason so to be sad but i am" this is because of "I was diagnosed with depression" This, I have Major Depressive Disorder and in my experience I went from being suicidal when I was unhappy with life to being healthy when my life started turning around to being suicidal when my life was objectively great, it ruined my relationship with my Fiancee, ruined my health and ruined my career, there can be causes for MDD and other types of depression,Diet and health is a big one, since I have gotten back on top of my issues with Chronic pain I have been getting a bit, better, I had a great week, and I'm having a shit day, but trying to stay positive helps me, levels of minerals and shit can do it too, but don't shy away from the fact that you have depression "I want a quit my job and just spend all day in my room" that's depression, whichever type it is, you need to try to reflect on your problems, which honestly is the hardest when you're depressed, friends and a good support network who understand what you are going through and who you are honest with is the only thing I have found that helps me, it is very hard to maintain such a network without asking too much of people you rely on though as well, people only have so much emotional willpower themselves. anyway sorry for the rant, having a shit day like I said, but I hope this sheds a little bit of light on things? sorry if it doesn't, and if you need to talk man, feel free to hit me up :) I'll try to help with some of the things that have plagued me and some of the ways I try to cope if you like. Have a good one though man, hope you're feeling better soon, and if this is hitting you when you've been super unhealthy, that could well be the reason, talk to your doctor and see if there's anything they can check on that could help.
LoudSeagull [info] Wow thanks for taking your time to reply :)Great advice thanks.I'm trying to treat my daydreaming as an addiction but it's hard because it isn't anything physical. So my first step is to become more aware of it and everytime I catch myself doing it I do a little gesture that I chose just to mark it and stop. I'll also try being more productive now that I know what's stopping me.Since daydreaming is really enoyable to me I'm still gonna let myself do it when I set it in my schedule so I don't get frustrated or something.What I want is to control it not to stop it.I know it won't be as easy as I expect it to be since this is a habit that I build up for years. I also noticed that it screwed with my memory and focus.I think it started naturally like I always practiced conversations before I had them as scenarios in my head and then eventually I started imagining ones just for fun. I mean most people daydream to some extent it's only a disorder when it starts messing with your life.I'll also try making my real life more fun and worth living. I gave up on my friends too because they just didn't seem good enough. I'm diagnosed with depression although I'm not so sure about it.I'm 15 so I still got plenty of time haha.Anyway good luck! I really believe this can be reversed and we can continue to live normally :)Ohh and btw I used to suck at socializing too idk why I just couldn't figure it out and what helped me was this youtube channel CharismaOnCommand. Then I started understanding how to make conversation enjoyable for both sides and not boring/awkward and now it comes off naturally. Also it helped my confidence soo much. Treat socializing like a skill not a characteristic it makes so much more sense. You have to practice it to get good at it.Maybe give it a try?
imekon [info] I was taught by my parents that I'm stupid and lack common sense. I was taught by christians that I'm an abomination and a monster.Just after I came out to my parents, I stood on a bridge and thought about suicide. I ran away at the time, and had several huge rows with my parents.I was diagnosed with depression some time ago. It's effect on me is that I cry without reason.I feel a lot better now after years but I just wish things had been different. I'm a happy person I think who got burdened by junk at the start and had to fight my way through it.
PurePerfection_ [info] I think that would work as well. I just personally prefer to add the "I was diagnosed with" part as way of creating additional distance between myself and the illness. Unless you've got a really overzealous medical professional taking your history, neither option should be a red flag.In my case, the one extra bit of information I volunteer is "I was diagnosed with depression in 2005." Said with the right tone, so the implication is "I didn't just fall off the turnip truck. I know what a depressive episode is. This is not that."
karlrowden [info] &gt;Back in the 1990's I was diagnosed with depression. I was literally just angry about some unpleasant life circumstance.So you should hate psychiatry because they slapped label on you, not invalidate people who can't work or care about their loved ones because they can't function, and hate themselves *because of it*.&gt;Now the word "depression" has a different criteria. What you are describing was not what I experienced when I was given that label.It has the same criteria, it's just that psychiatry overdiagnoses it and makes it worse instead of helping, which we all agree on. It's like having a broken leg and being given painkillers instead of mending it, of course it's bullshit. You enemy is psychiatry, not people who have depression.&gt;If its anything like my own life it has to do with not having enough personal power (if that means social, financial, freedom).What you're describing looks like range of normal emotions still. It's not depression. I'd agree with everything you are saying if that'd be definition of it, but as I said it's not that.&gt;If that's not the case then what is lacking?That purely medical conditions can cause it should tell us something. Maybe people were broken in childhood just like a tree can be broken when it's small and stop being able to function. We don't know all causes, only how it manifests, and that it's not simply range of emotions. I recall reading that in developing countries people with depression don't even complain about emotions that much (and it means that emotional part might be indeed a cultural phenomena), their complaints were primarily physical. I understand that this word is abused by pharma companies and medication commercials and all that bullshit, but doesn't mean that what this word describes doesn't exist. I agree that we might need a better word. I'd use something like behavioral shutdown with possible emotional manifestations, but it looks unwieldy. 
LisaArouet [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was eleven years old (battled it since age five) but can’t take antidepressants because they make me do crazy things like spend all my money, run away and run in the street screaming at midnight.I get episodes of depression but the rest of the time I legitimately am *extremely* happy, confident and energetic, almost hyperactive.I don’t want people to know I get depressed because they will think I’m either faking depression or faking happiness.
lia1tan [info] Yeah I was like that in high school (perfect GPA, perfect AP scores, perfect SAT subject tests, near perfect ACT) and college was a painful reality for me. I actually did worse than you did to be honest where I got C's too. It was such a blow to me because at the time I felt like the only redeeming quality I had was being smart, but then it felt like all of that wasn't true anymore and I had lost the only one good thing about me. It didn't help that I was also relatively poor compared to all my peers (I went to an ivy league school so you can imagine that most of the student body came from families who made over $100K a year). That just made things worse as it was so hard for me to relate to others since people judged you on what brand clothes and bags you had or what kind of vacations you've been on or other pretentious things that differentiate themselves from the middle and lower class. I'll spare you the details but later I was diagnosed with depression the spring of my freshman year after attempting suicide.Fast forward a few years and I graduated from that school. Along the way I switched majors to one that made me happier and tried to surround myself with people who weren't shallow (most of them ending up being staff members rather than students). I seeked help and got counseling which was literally a life saver for me. Sure, in the end I wasn't top of my class and I no longer had that perfect streak anymore that I did in high school. But honestly, I think I came out of college a better person than before. I'm less likely to judge others based on their grades or what school they went to or their academic achievements. I realized that grades and being perfect aren't all that important in the long run. Your character and your attitude is what matters. Also if other people are judging you on your grades or whatever (unless it's your first job or grad school, unfortunately they do), then they're not worth your time. It's hard to get out of that mindset when you've been like that for so long. However, you're more than just a grade unless you decide to out yourself in that box.Basically what I'm trying to say is that if you continue to hang in there, reach out for help when you need it, and actively try to make things better, then it will get better. Also if it helped you realized that someone like me, who did worse than you, can somehow make it out okay and can accept themselves, then my job is done here.
keegan112099 [info] I've been diagnosed with depression and all I had to do was tell my walk in clinic doctor I attempted suicide.  It's not that rigorous
lardsack [info] I was diagnosed with depression ever since I was a teenager. At 22, I only just started taking antidepressants since my lack of energy was starting to affect my schoolwork. Since then, it has never been so easy to keep up with my productivity expectations! Mental gymnastics and tricks also worked maybe 30% of the time, but after I began taking prescribed Effexor pills it took my productivity game to another level. My advice? If you’re really struggling, consider seeing a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist to look into possible ADHD, depression, sleep disorders, etc. It might just change your life.
shm09 [info] Don't give up. I know how you're feeling because I've been through the same phase. In my second year I was diagnosed with depression. It was crippling, per se, and I just couldn't concentrate. I know how frustrating it gets. I had to skip 3 papers in my 4th semester and another 4 in my 5th. I'm planning to clear those out in this semester itself. I know it's difficult but I definitely know it's going to be worth it. I just need to pass and then I'll be fine.Try to hold on. It gets better. Life is a series of ups and downs, right now you're at Rock bottom, but look on the bright side. The only way to go is up. :)About the guilt, remember this, your life is yours to lead. If something doesn't make you happy and you feel miserable for it, it's better to avoid it. The most important thing is peace of mind.
velociraptorjax [info] Ok, but it's the oil change needed light, thank you very much. And the only reason it is on is because I didn't turn it off when I got the oil changed.And I was funny before I was diagnosed with depression.
Nirvalove [info] Atarax.No really, it's awesome. I was diagnosed with depression a year ago, met a awesome girl that helped me through it, dated for a year, she dumped me about ... 3 weeks ago. It was hard.Depression came back with a side dish of panic attacks and night terrors. Took some Atarax one night to help me sleep. It completely calmed me in about an hour , slept like a baby. Still on it . And I'm doing better everyday. I used to take 2 a day. And I'm down to 1 at the moment. Yay
Bruchibre [info] Jokes aside, I realise that it's because I haven't founds something that really motivates me, drives me, whatever. I get bored very easily and am quite resilient so starting something new doesn't excite me for long and whatever happens I don't really care. Also I've been diagnosed with depression in the past.
Merhat [info] No i am not at nofap journey. I am diagnosed with depression from doctor. It is not because i do nofap. It is because why the fuck not
chojurou [info] Hands down, "Shimmer" by Fuel. I grew up listening to this song A LOT between probably ages 6-9 (I'm 25 now) so, the formative years before puberty. The only times I heard this song was when I was driving around with my dad. He loved those late 90s alternative rock bands, for some reason, and he always talked about how much he wanted to see them in concert, which sings where his favorite, and why some songs had specific meanings to him.  I don't remember any of the meanings, but I remember this one being one of his absolute favorites. We probably listened to it 5+ times a day when my brother and I got to see him, every other weekend, because it was "our song." My parents separated when I was 7, so that's as often as we could hang out. I think I was about age 9 when I got the phone call from him, informing me that he'd moved to North Carolina to visit family. Later on, my mom told me that he was only there for 9 months, but I was diagnosed with depression at a young age and it made time feel like it was moving incredibly slow. Every time I heard this song on the radio after that, I just started crying because I missed my dad, he was my best buddy for a long time. But today I cry when I hear it because I was informed in my earlier 20's that he'd fled to North Carolina to evade authorities in Oregon (we did and still do have family in North Carolina, so he technically wasn't lying). Turns out, he had over $8,000 in unpaid fines for DUIs. I thought about it for so long, we drove so much and was seemingly carefree with my younger brother and I: "Don't worry about your seatbelts," "Don't tell your mother I let you do this," we shot off guns as children, went unsupervised with lesser known relatives without him during his visitation time.... so many things. I never realized how careless he was and why my mother despises him so much.It's a very love/hate song depending on how I'm feeling at the moment, I suppose. But nonetheless, there's always going to be tears. ["Shimmer" by Fuel](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rZwSqX6J5hs) 
TomerMeme [info] 2017 was the year I was diagnosed with depression.2018 will be the year I get rid of it, it may not be easy or even possible, but these are my goals.
heckin_cool [info] I am glad that you are interested in learning more, so let me be as thorough as I can:1. There are _so_ many misconceptions. One of the biggest being that aces can't/don't have sex. This is untrue for many of us. In general, aces identify as either sex repulsed, sex neutral, or sex favorable. The best way I can explain this is with an analogy. I'm going to presume that you masturbate. You are not sexually attracted to your own hand, yet you can still find pleasure in touching yourself. Sex-favorable aces are like that, except replace "your hand" with "people". 2. I cant say that I feel happy, perse, because it makes romantic relationships very difficult. You can probably imagine how things go when I tell a potential partner that I dont intend to have sex with them.3. Honestly, I don't think it's just a phase, but there is always doubt. Asexuality is very different from other sexual orientations. Where other orientations are about whom you feel attracted to, asexuality is an absence of feeling. So yes, there are times when I feel unsure and ask myself "wait, could that be considered sexual attraction???" simply because I dont actually know what it is that I am not feeling.4. I have been diagnosed with depression but my asexuality predates that. And I have been on treatments for a while now so that my symptoms are under control and I still lack sexual attraction. In addition, I have had my thyroid tested twice so I know that I do not have a hormone imbalance.
Tobizz3 [info] I’m sorry that happened, but I’m glad you “chose” to leave. I went through something really similar. When I started a new study I moved in with 2 classmates I barely knew. They turned out to be assholes, and that was also when I was diagnosed with depression (not because of them necessarily). I left. They scammed me for a couple hundred bucks though, just because they could. A couple years later I’ve now found a study subject which I love, and I’ve surrounded myself with people I click with. I’ve been very cautious about not attracting the wrong kind of person again. My social life determines a lot for me, I’ve come to see. I hope you find something you really enjoy doing. And I hope the people you meet will be different from the ones you’ve had to deal with. All the best!
rigoletta [info] I just weened myself off all anti-depressants since I first started taking them 8 years ago. I started them back in high school when I was diagnosed with depression, but the real issue was multiple eating disorders. It took me 5 years and a fuck ton of therapy but I finally recovered from that mess. Eventually, I realized that I'm in the best place I've ever been in my adult life. I hated feeling "chained" to my expensive prescription antidepressants, so with the help of my doctor, I'm happy to say I'm totally off them now. I'm in a good place, and I'm lucky to have a job I love and great friends/family as support. The biggest thing was the amount of time it took to fully recover. Looking back, I can't believe it took that long to recover from an eating disorder. I don't view it as wasted time, however. It's just the card that got dealt to me. I hope this helps anyone out there struggling. Depression and trauma can seem impossible to overcome when you're in the thick of it, but it can be done. Time can heal a lot if you let it. 
Fefe887 [info] Hello, thanks for the response. I have been diagnosed with depression a few years ago however I never went on medication because my parents freaked out and pretended they never took me to a therapist. As for the mania part, after doing some research I think I experinced hypomania. Normally i am incredibly money conscious, i would nevverrrrr cut my hair in a million years, etc. I am not known to make rash decisions, and when my friends saw me doing these things they said it seemed bizarre. It felt like nothing I did had any consequences. I would usually not go down town past dark, as its really dangerous and full of homeless people, and im a 5'1 girl. However, when i went down town at 11 pn, it felt like nothing could hurt me.  I had 5 of those symptoms from that list for about four days, and then about two days of being really, really depressed (nearly suicidal.) Like, lets say a normal, non depressed person's mood is at a 5 on a scale of 10 (1 being suicidal, 10 being euphoric). On a normal day, i am at a 4. The days i think i was hypomanic I was at an 8. Then the days following, I was at a 1.5
raydijk16 [info] Hey guys, i wanted to share my video with you. I've been diagnosed with depression 4 years ago..Seen therapists, take medication.. But the depression always comes back.. Now, I have recently started my journey on YouTube, and hopefully my video helps people see something good in each day!! Just as I need to do this for myself
Aop_or3o [info] A while ago I was diagnosed with depression, Some days it got really hard to even want to get up from the couch and go somewhere. I decided to go look at some animals not really wanting to come home with one. But then I found him. I have loved beagles my entire life and he was the one that stuck out to me. He is an introverted one though. Dosent howl much and keeps to himself. It's his third day so I'm not expecting much excitement out of him just yet but I do love him and I hope he learns to love me. Zero is his name and I think it fits him. Because he is such an important number but sometimes overlooked. Well that's my story any questions just ask :)
am-i-rite-ladies [info] I have 2. Bipolar disorder, and leukemia. I had bad depression growing up, but I also had periods where I was just *elated* all the time and made really weird choices. I was diagnosed with depression at 16, but I always knew something else was there, or worse. Eventually I saw a few psych's and I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. Nobody in my family has it, so I thought it was odd. Not to mention, I always associated Bipolar disorder as someone who is super crazy or something, but it's a lot more complicated than the movies will tell you.Leukemia was actually this year. Again, nobody in my family has ever had leukemia or cancer of any sort, and I was (presumably) the healthiest individual in my family. Young, only had eye troubles, and very fit and healthy. Then one day I'm sick for a week, have bad leg pain and whaddya know, I have leukemia.
-kodoku- [info] I was diagnosed with depression around the age of 6. You can have depression at almost any age. You also don't necessarily know if you have depression. It's obvious for some people, while others can go their life without realizing or even suspecting they have depression. Check out this depression screening test. This is the same test that they make you fill out when you see a psychiatrist or psychologist. http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/depress/phq-9.pdf
Cutecatladyy [info] I have definitely been in a space where I used suicide jokes as a mechanism for coping. It’s a way of saying “I’m hurting but don’t make a big deal about it,” at least for me anyway. Sometimes you want to talk about how you feel in a way that doesn’t make everyone super worried and fuss about it, or make it about themselves. I was diagnosed with depression at 13, and everyone’s reaction was like “what can /I/ do,” or “what did /I/ do wrong”. Making a joke is such an easy alternative. That being said, if you are suicidal, please do actually seek help from a professional or someone you trust!!!
Throwawaydreams101 [info] The lows definitely pass. I'm trying to figure out how I ever get that low and how suddenly it goes away. I'm perfectly fine now, I have tons of energy and currently for the first time in the past few years, no money.. I tried to buy a laptop yday and realised I can't. Which is fun, and exciting for me to start again on a new slate - which is something I wouldn't say if I was in my little mood like the past couple weeks. I think it might be my period but it's a bit extreme. I'm just trying to figure things out 💆🏽Although I've been diagnosed with depression, I can't understand why it's so bad sometimes. When I do the same things every week. I know what to do when it comes to physically doing things to help stop feeling depressed like being around people or being active in some way. But it doesn't always help. But it's a good start and I love my boyfriend and everyone that provides me company (which is usually just family because I don't like outside socialising when I'm depressed unless it's work) I know what you mean about feeling like the walking dead. I've been like that for the past couple weeks and just a couple days ago I stopped wanting to kill myself. The urge when it's there, is so real. And it's such a relief when it's gone. I'm trying to figure things out still, I don't think we ever stop. But I wish you the best of luck 🤗 and you can always message me if you want/need. 
AutobotN7 [info] I was diagnosed with depression. The only thing that changed is some of my family stopped taking things like I didn't want to talk or I was kinda just..ill (like in a bad mood) as personally and I tried to be more aware when it happens and just tell them, "Hey I'm having a bad day today."
lawdy_lawdy_lawdy [info] Unfortunately, becoming a parent does not come with an instruction manual.  I wish it did.  A baby is a shiny new toy in many ways.  That's the fun part.  It's easy.  No need for instructions.  Then, life happens.  Depression can easily blind side anybody.  Especially a parent.  Denial, shame, and blame.  Depression is a family illness.  I wish there was one clear answer to all of this.  There isn't.  Honesty surely helps.  I am a parent &amp; grandparent of a depressed young man.  I have been diagnosed with depression for over 20 years.  I feel guilty.  I feel my grandson inherited my flawed DNA.  I can take my own suffering.  I cannot take his.  We're struggling to get through this.  I am confident that we will. We all make so many mistakes.  I hope you can reach out to an adult who you feel safe  talking to.  Get help.  Help will not only help you but give you the information to honestly discuss your depression with your parents.  They want to help you.  They just don't know how.  Help them to help you. 
RuggyDog [info] I was diagnosed with depression roughly seven years ago, I’ve recently begun to actually deal with it, I’m already getting professional help. Thank you for your concern though.I guess I forgot this wasn’t 
Jai-jo [info] I have been underemployed for 2 years now and I am in a field with an ever decreasing job market. Underemployment has been a major factor is my current mental health status (I have been diagnosed with depression and GAD). Being underemployed is an epidemic and a by-product of the absolutely shit situation that the job market represents.My humble advice is to continue to put out your resume and continue the application process. It sucks, it's soul crushing, but there are very few alternatives. Also, not sure if this is applicable to your industry, but you may consider taking on some sort of internship in addition to a day job which keeps the bills paid. This is what I have had to do.Also, take to your doctor about your depression. Underemployment does cause depressive feelings, and it can have long term effects on your mental health.All the best in your job hunt.
penguinmaster3000 [info] I had no interest in it when I was a child, but my mom is an alcoholic and when I was a teenager I started wondering what was so amazing about it, because my mom was drinking it everyday. So I started drinking it. I can't quit it now, it's like a social lubricant for me, most of my friends are drinking and I can't stop. I was diagnosed with depression and alcoholism three months ago, but I refused the help. I don't know if I want the help or not... It's truly frustrating to think that I am becoming my mother.
Em-16 [info] That sucks, I can't imagine being so young and having those thoughts. I was about your age when I was diagnosed with depression after being hospitalised. I also fell behind in school because of it so I understand how overwhelmed you must feel. Have you got any hobbies or anything that brings you joy?. For myself, I always enjoyed caring for animals. I volunteered at a shelter and adopted a cat which gave me a reason to get up everyday. I also met plenty of likeminded people there. You're only young so you have plenty of time to find a SO but communicating with people helps a whole lot. You are not alone in the way you are feeling and just remember that so many people have fought the same battle and come out stronger because of it.
SupraLuggi [info] The thing you said about not being able to work hard... See I've been diagnosed with depression, I know it's the main thing I grapple with, but the fact that I have such a hard time working has always bothered me deeply. A while back I recreationally took Adderall, and those were unironically some of the best days I'd had in years. I was energetic, interested, and most of all I just couldn't help but be productive. It was exhilarating, I felt like an actual person. Should I look into this more? Or did I just get high off of Adderall and that's it? 
Hobstank [info] I've tried talking to my parents and it didn't go well. Although I've been diagnosed with depression, my mom still continues to believe that I'm feeling this way for attention or as an excuse. I want to talk to a teacher so they have a better understanding of my current situation, but I'm afraid they wouldn't believe me or that they'd react negatively.
lurklark [info] I was diagnosed with depression in 2011, and it was relief to know that I wasn’t just wanting attention or was a bad person- a professional listened to my physical and mental symptoms and came to a conclusion. I suspect I had depression since middle school (probably around 2003-2004) but always thought I just couldn’t cope. It was way more powerful to be assessed by a doctor than by my own biased self. Six years on and after being able to take a break from meds I’m trying to find the right one again. All these morons running around thinking they have BPD and shit. Hell, PROFESSIONALS often misdiagnose that, and from everything I read it is hell to live with.
