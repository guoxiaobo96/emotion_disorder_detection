aliengames666 [info] I had doctors and therapists tell me it was possible I was bipolar for a long time, but I just never really took it seriously and had one REALLY incompetent therapist  who told me I was just very “deeply feeling” while I was tearing my life apart. Later the same therapist also related me some very inaccurate information about bipolar. Weird how therapists can be so incompetent sometimes. Years later I was institutionalized for attempting suicide because a girl I was interested in didn’t like me back. I was diagnosed with depression while I was there, put on anti depressants, and like instantly went manic while in the psych ward. The next day I met with a new psychiatrist and she nailed me as bipolar immediately, stopped the anti depressants, and put me on lithium that night.My mom is probably also bipolar and she was prescribed anti depressants and she’s manic as hell rn. We’re estranged, but I told her I was bipolar and she said there was no way she was. She’s gonna damage the F out of her brain if she’s actually bipolar.
ladycielphantomhive [info] I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 13 but got a diagnosis of bipolar depression at 20. My psychiatrist said they don’t diagnose under 18 almost ever.
fearfuleyes [info] 22 here. I felt like I wanted to die last year. I literally stopped going to college and put all my efforts on my mental health. I was diagnosed with depression and some very mild kind of bipolar disorder. I’m spending lots of money and time on this. I see my therapist every week and psychiatrist every month and also take meds that have changed my life completely. I consider this is the best investment I could have ever made and I’m very relieved that I started paying attention to mental health so young I’m going back to college in August.
WiseWoman7 [info] I was diagnosed with depression in my sophomore years and back then there were almost no meds to be that effective. I should have been diagnosed as bipolar and received proper treatment. It’s rough to get the right diagnosis and I’m so proud of you and what you’ve accomplished in the last few years!! I think any of us with bipolar disorder can take from your experience that there IS a good life for us out there if we just keep looking and working for it. Congratulations on your engagement!
fandroid-leda [info] So it's not just me... I've been diagnosed with depression/anxiety, PTSD, OCD and borderline at various times when certain meds wouldn't work and my psych wanted to redirect my treatment. With BP2, we have a lot of overlap with other illnesses. Any question over the BPII diagnosis is because I'm "high functioning" (externally) and my hypomania doesn't express as extremely as is genuinely attributed to people with BPII. Everything else is BPII, especially meds. I can't take just anti-depressants without a mood stabilizer without crashing and if I have too much of an SSRI in my system, I do get hypo. Currently on a Lamictal, Buspar and Lexapro cocktail that makes things more manageable but still requires I do a lot to maintain. Do you find yourself needing structure a lot? That's one area that highly impacts my affective state more than factors you often see in borderline.
roboraptor3000 [info] Opposites! Well, I was diagnosed with depression, but my hypomania was written off as anxiety (I do also have pretty severe anxiety, but still). Turns out those antidepressants were just making everything worse!
donteatmee3333 [info] Yeah I could see my younger self saying something like this. I was diagnosed with depression early
Brewskidog93 [info] Ugh I'm so sorry people can be so unhelpful and thoughtless. I lost my best friend of 20 years to a several month depressive/suicidal episode pre diagnosis. I was diagnosed with depression at the time, which she was aware of. She herself has lupus, which is another often debilitating invisible disease. Long story short she had an event she invited me to in another city (she lives a few hours away) and I had RSVP'd yes originally because that's what BFFs do. A month or two prior to the event I still hadn't been able to really leave my house except to go to work as a zombie and I just wanted to die, so I wrote her and asked if it would be okay if I skipped the event with lights and people and staying in a hotel and all the things that add needless stress. She cold shouldered me up until the event and I thought she was just stressed so no biggie - stress flares her disease too, so I get it. I brought it up again and offered to hang out with her just one on one to celebrate a few months later and get quality time in, and she flat out told me she wouldn't "accommodate" me anymore and she broke up with me. Like said we are no longer friends. So I explained in greater detail the depressive/suicidal episode and how I physically and mentally wasn't up for being social and friendly to people I barely know, and she didn't believe me. Thought it was a complete cop out. I was sitting there already wanting to die and now my best friend for two decades was telling me I was full of shit. She knew I had mental health problems but I guess that meant nothing to her. I "accommodated" and helped her through so many episodes with Lupus over 20 years. But it just couldn't go the other way because it wasn't believable. It's been a little over 3 years and I'm still angry about it, the double standard. My coworkers are more "accommodating" than my best friend. Sweet. I hope to run into her at something (her husband is still friends with mine) so I can maybe try again to explain. Not to be friends because that's over, but to hopefully get her to realize that mental health problems are real, that being bipolar is no joke and often invisible because of the energy we put in to protect our friends. That energy we use to protect or shield friends and coworkers completely drains us when we are on the low side, and sometimes we just don't have any energy left to even protect ourselves. We need people that don't judge. That try to understand because the crushing guilt from not being able to physically and mentally make social events is not at all helpful when you are one push away from self harm. I probably won't talk to her ever again, but I do know I am really done with the "flake" label. There is nothing flaky about me and the most hurtful part is that after 20 years I can be brushed aside so easily when to that point I never once bailed on anything. She didn't even ask if I was okay. Just friendship off. Big hugs to you, OP. So many of us know how you feel and have unfortunately gone through something similar. I do hope you know you are believed and supported ❤️. 
corrosivesoul [info] There is also cyclothymia, which is on the bipolar spectrum, but not as severe as bipolar. I think it's telling that you say "I have a feeling I'm kind of cycling." I think for most of us, it's pretty clear cut when we are cycling, not a vague feeling. Even if it might sneak up on us a little, it becomes painfully obvious at some point. For me, going into a depressive phase is like being on a broken elevator going straight to the bottom of the shaft. Hypomania feels like runaway train I can't get off of.I experience hypomania as the following - sometimes, it is a feeling of euphoria, like I'm floating. However, I'm also volatile in that state and it doesn't take much for me to flip into extreme irritability and outright rage. I also have a habit of having some really great ideas, executing on them for a week or two, enlisting people to help make these things a reality, buying books or supplies on it, becoming intensely working on it to the exclusion of all else, then seeing it fall apart when I cycle into depression again. I also tend to have a lot of energy, psycho-motor agitation, and will run just fine on 3-4 hours of sleep (I do sleep more hypo than other do). Also, one trigger I've noticed is if there is a big outing or important event coming up, like going to an amusement park or having a work review. This will usually throw me into hypomania.(the above symptoms are without medication, things are much, much milder on meds)I also don't usually experience "normal" periods, which is a little unusual for bipolar, as I understand, and also cycle pretty rapidly (1-2 weeks hypo, 4-6 weeks depressed, as a very rough estimate). Also, generally speaking, bipolar moods often don't always correspond to life circumstances. If I'm not on meds, I could hit the lottery and still be looking for a bridge to jump off.(since being on meds, my rapid cycling has been condensed down to a day or two if I'm having any problems with it at all, which is not common)Also, I was diagnosed only after being in therapy for a while and my therapist seeing the same patterns of behavior over and over in my personal history, as well as going to their office both hypo and depressed. Another marker is usually an adverse reaction to anti-depressant therapy alone. When I was younger, I was diagnosed with depression and given anti-depressants. They put me into a nearly constant extreme irritability and sometimes rage. My combination of meds right now can sometimes cause a mild hypomania, but it's manageable and doesn't really interfere with anything.Good luck on getting an accurate diagnosis (I mean that positively, not sarcastically. :) ), and I hope you get a handle on things, whatever is going on.
ch1kita [info] the chicken or the egg!! I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ADHD for years, so i've been on adderall for 8 years or so. Now it just so happens i have bipolar 2, so now they want to give me mood stabilizers and have my bipolar 2 taken care of so they can decrease my adderall. I'm terrified of them decreasing my adderall meds =( absolutely terrified because sometimes it's the only thing that helps me even move. But what if this is the right move? What if i don't have ADHD and I've been bipolar this entire time and it's the reason I can't focus? BUT WHAT IF I HAVE BOTH!?!?.....DUN DUN DUN! \*suspenseful music\*
libraryreaper [info] Hypomania can be subtle and it doesn't always present in obvious, "classic" ways. It can be even more complicated when you consider that mixed features are not uncommon in bipolar disorder, which can somewhat disguise the symptoms. I wasn't properly diagnosed with bipolar II until my 40s, even though I was diagnosed with depression at age 14. Part of the reason is that hypomania often feels dysphoric to me, like a really agitated, irritable, dark kind of feeling. My mood shifts a lot during these episodes, but overall it feels bad, so I tended to internalize it as just being part of my depression and anxiety.So, it's definitely not always as straightforward as it seems in textbooks.
georgiaokeefe123 [info] I agree with all of this. I totally agree that my mom feels like it’s her fault, I remember when I was diagnosed with depression when I was 12 and I read through her texts and she was blaming herself for all of it, even though the doctors told her it was a chemical imbalance. She gets so sad every time I’m sad and it just makes me feel worse because it’s not her fault at all. She doesn’t understand the severity of it and I haven’t worked up the courage to give her all of the information about the illness. I hope your mom grows in her understanding.

ManicTypist [info] Oh man, so yeah, I was diagnosed with depression in high school and put on prozac right away. Then... it was like my brain broke. I was so numb, so I was onto another medication and my symptoms got worse and worse until finally I was (literally within 2 minutes of *not even seeing the doctor*) diagnosed as bipolar because I went into rehab for addiction. Then began the fucking brain-breaking thing that was trying about 10 different psych meds and none of them worked. I stuck with Viibryd for a while and then ended up in the psych ward many years later (so recently as of today). Now I'm on a mood stabilizer and I'm wondering if I have BPD instead of BPI because my moods change from crying one second to being elated another to total anger where I see white. I'm afraid to tell my doc that because I don't understand BPD so well, other than it's super difficult to live with. So for now, I'm BPI/BP NOS (seriously that's on my chart). I swear to god though, the changing up of all the medications fucked with my head. Like, legit broke my brain.
desertdigger [info] I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety and my husband and I were in financial stress for about 3 years. I was overworked and had a bad commute. Even though we were beyond stressed and worried about if we would be able to afford our apartment, we **NEVER** treated the other's family with such disrespect. If I was not having a good day and we had plans with his parents,  I wouldn't go because I knew I would be bad company. I understand the stress, but she knows how she functions and needs to talk to her therapist about skills to better manage her anxiety. I agree with the others,  she's not taking responsibility for her actions she's making excuses.
ccoasters [info] I was diagnosed with depression because I was pretty young to be diagnosed as bipolar. Got manic and tried to kill myself. In the hospital, my mom did a shit ton of research because my diagnosis didn’t make sense to her. She’s the one who explained to my negligent doctor why she was so wrong about my diagnosis, why it only made sense that I was bipolar, and is the reason I got on better meds. I was still diagnosed as bp2 for years before it being corrected to bp1, but I owe my mom a lot for that.
linebreaker-bot [info] >Hi. I was thinking about things and doing research and came across info on HSP's. I was thinking I might be one and wanted to see what people on here think. I feel like I have extremely high emotional sensitivity. I can feel others' pain and know what they r feeling without them saying anything. I also take on others' pain and problems and they become my own. I then end up putting in tons of effort trying to solve them and fix their pain. To the point, it causes me severe anxiety and emotional anguish every day until I succeed. I also have had people tell me my reasons for being upset aren't good reasons. Today I was looking at a pic of a cat that I had that passed away almost six years ago and started thinking about him and then suddenly couldn't stop crying.&nbsp;>I also have started crying or laughing from stuff I read, see online, or watch on tv. Or see in a videogame. Or even from some random thought i have. I also can't stop saying thank you and sorry and constantly feel the need to explain my actions or how things work and give excruciating detail to the point I constantly get told to just get to the point. I also feel like I may have some physical sensitivity. I can't wear clothes made of certain fabrics, such as wool because they make me itch. For 26 years of my life I pretty much never wore long sleeves unless they were very flowy or were a jacket or coat, even in -40 degrees with windchill and snow everywhere weather because the material touching my skin bothers me.&nbsp;>I also refuse to wear long johns, don't like scarves, and won't wear socks higher than crew cut. I also only will wear bikini cut underwear. I hate high waisted pants and my sister made fun of me for how I wear my pants but I can't stand anything pushing into my stomach or being up in my crotch. There are also certain sounds like things scratching/rubbing against carpet and velcro that actually make my ears hurt and make me just want to do anything to either stop or get away from the sound.&nbsp;>I also think cilantro tastes like soap and am told I am a picky eater. I have nasal and throat allergies. I also have a huge list of medications I have severe reactions to to the point doctors don't even believe me when I list them off and put down why I can't take them. I know they don't believe me because the last time I was in a hospital I got my medical records and it said in there " she listed off a bunch of medications that she "can't" take". I have been in the ER 5 times due to serious life-threatening reactions to medications and was once hospitalized for a week due to serious life-threatening reactions to a med I was on.&nbsp;>My dad forced me to see a doctor as a kid and I have been diagnosed with depression, adhd, PMDD, asperger's, and bipolar. But none of these doctors really listened to me and all of these diagnoses were based off of stuff my dad said. my dad was always there at my appointments and he was physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive so I felt I had no voice to say what was really going on and basically got forced to take a bunch of drugs I didn't want nor felt like I needed. all these drugs just gave me new problems as I proceeded to have side effects or severe allergic reactions to pretty much everything I got forced to take.&nbsp;>and its not just psyche meds that bother me either, I can't take penicillin or anything ending in cillin or I will get a rash. also, Vicodin apparently puts me right back in the ER with a blocked bladder. one time I went to the ER doctors tried to act like I was faking and gave me nausea medicine and some other thing I don't remember and told me my symptoms would just go away. They didn't and I only got more and more and worse symptoms. it took 3 ER trips before people finally concluded it was the topamax I was on despite all of the doctors knowing what meds I was on. I once had a doctor in a mental hospital force me to take a med I know I have a bad reaction to since apparently minors have no say on what goes in their body.&nbsp;>I even told them to call my dad and offered up another med for "anxiety". they were really just mad because I kept repeating myself because they weren't listening to me. Oh and also some things that others might view as trivial such as a break up can easily lead to me crying everyday for hours for months on end. my record is 6 months straight of crying. anyways I guess this about sums it up. What do you guys think? am I a HSP?sorry for the long post but I wanted to give as much information as i could think of.&nbsp;Hey /u/ichigo_wildblossom, it looks like you posted a wall of text.

owlfoxer [info] Yeah. These meds only manage BP. I also take trazqdone bc I have sleep problems (Pretty much everyone with BP does. )It is hard to say whether they have gotten worse or not. I would say that as I have gotten older, the disease has become a bigger part of my life. So I would say the illness develops more into defined cycles. I would say my cycles have wrecked a lot of experiences— especially with employment. I hope that the older I have gotten, the wiser I have become and am trying to learn how to accept and manage the disease. I was exactly like you. Recurring bouts of depression and experiences of hypo mania which I didn’t realize either. I was diagnosed with depression. So I didn’t get correctly diagnosed until later.  Side effects are hard in the beginning. Be patient. Adjusting to them might take a month or more. But you need to stick with it. The meds caused me to become super tired. The meds help slow your mind down - because after all — racing thoughts are not normal. Pm with any questions you might have.
Unknown3Fortune1Rye [info] Can you elaborate more regarding what condition do you mean that’s not proven?I’d set myself as an example; I’m living a very perfect life according to my standards, I have everything that I ever wanted. However, I’m not feeling okay and I was diagnosed with depression..
ladycielphantomhive [info] I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 13 but got a diagnosis of bipolar depression at 20. My psychiatrist said they don’t diagnose under 18 almost ever.
MessyConstellations [info] You mean how I became ugly? Well, to start off, I started to gain weight to the point that I weight 20 pounds more than an average teen, zits started to come out and it doesn’t help that I have a tendency to scratch them which leads to me having injuries on my face, scars or even trails of blood, I’ve been wearing braces for 8 years now and I use baggy clothing to hide my breast because I was made fun of that in secondary school.And my mental state is no better, I’ve been struggling with a low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and I was diagnosed with depression on December.So yeah, I decided to start dieting and do exercise to at least be able to change my weight.
diego-fer [info] I think it does!.So far I'm really scared about myself, I knew that something was different... I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder and once those symptoms were over I found that I behave in the way that I describe in this thread.Sometimes I don't know if the way I behave is because I have something like ADHD, because I'm lazy and learn how to procastinate like a pro, or for some other reason...Anyway I'll talk to my psychiatrist to see if I can get an exam for ADHD although in my country it's really hard to get those kind of exams and they usually take a really long time to give you an appointment.
Jassyladd311 [info] Awe I'm so sorry. A lack of sleep and nothing in the stomach can turn the nicest person a little grouchy. Everyone feels irritable once in a while especially when you're growing up. You're so young and are going through a very difficult time through puberty which is not fun or forgiving on anyone. Good job for diffusing and going to your room. Getting away from people and into "your space" when you become irritable is a good thing. Everyone lashes out at people once in a while. It's a part of family and being in such a closed space all the time especially when you're most likely not even getting time away at school. Your day got a twist with your mom being upset about a family pet death. That doesnt help your day. And even if death doesnt affect you that much your mood can be affected by those around you. I doubt your an asshole. Yes its rude to lash out and you dont want to make it a habit but learning to diffuse yourself and not lash out is a big part of that and you did a good job. Next time bring a snack up there, eat, diffuse, and get a couple hours of sleep. You'll feel better when you wake up. I was diagnosed with depression as a young teen and have learned effective coping mechanisms through therapy and life.
HelpThereIsPainHere [info] Hello, I was always a quiet kid. I was diagnosed with depression as a kid, two more times as a teenager, and once as an adult.I struggled with suicidal thoughts for a long time.I started a new job recently, I got rid of my last roommate.All at the end of 2019Things changed. I felt different. I started acting different. I know I'm probably still depressed and slowly recovering, but I am different now. I am happy, I feel emotions, I love, I love my boyfriend a lot, more than I thought I did. My depression was keeping me from enjoying everything.I thought it was a chemical imbalance since I have been this way since I was small. But, I think I was in a shitty situation. The situatuin was a long thing.My family, my friends, my job/school. Everything sucked, it all made me depressed Im 2000 miles away from it all, me and my boyfriend, in an apartment with nice things, I work 3 days a week but make enough to pay bills.I am happy for the first time.I think people can recover. Chemical imbalance or life long (small, simple) trauma, I think it is possible. I'm sure more traumatic things are harder. The most traumatic thing to happen to me is a car accident, 4 years later it still hurts but I can get in a car, I can drive, it's not too bad.I hope others can find the kind of peace and happiness I have found.
sangriasky [info] I'm so so so happy for you, this is a big step towards recovery, and I'm glad you talked about it openlyI've been diagnosed with depression 6 years ago (I'm 20) and I still can't accept it, can't admit it in front of myself, I avoid the word 'depression' like a plague, I don't know how to talk about it with my family, I lost friends because I couldn't explain my behaviour, all of this is making me feel worse and worse, nothing good comes from hiding and denialI hope you'll treat yourself with compassion and love  ❤️
Inner_Examination_90 [info] Hey, I can promise you that no matter what it feels like. there are people who care about you. I have experienced those feelings before and almost committed suicide. However, I found someone to talk to and after I was diagnosed with depression and people found out, they were so amazing. I was so supported.People care. Even the ones that you think dont. they do.
Lifelacksluster [info] _Just_ gotten? I honestly don't want to nitpick. I saw this was your second post in a short period of time... I was diagnosed with depression too... and it's quite the rollercoaster ride for me... I wanted to understand how you are feeling lately...
8bit-meow [info] I absolutely love it, too. Everything is much more mild and it doesn't seem to aggravate my moods (I'm diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder). It actually seems to help them. At first I started breaking out and was retaining a lot of water but that has subsided and these pills seriously a godsend. It's good to know I'm not the only one with wacky bleeding whenever. I took this forum's advice and bought the cheap HPT strips just because things are so irregular now just to make sure everything is fine. Thanks for your response! 
situationtypedill [info] I was on venlafaxine for about a year because I was just diagnosed with depression at first and it would make me have even worse depressive episodes
shadeyrain [info] Years ago, when I was still in highschool I got my first betta fish with my own money(not forced upon me by my unknowing parents). I was so depressed at the time, and I left him to rot for a while. After I was diagnosed with depression(at the ripe age of 17) my therapist recommended I take on a responsibly like a fish or rodent. When I went to check on my betta, he was nearly dead. No fins( he literally was just a body. He barely could move) from fin rot, tiny bowl and barely fed. I did some research and found out how much more bettas needed. I worked on that betta for months to regrow his fins, make him feel better and gave him something bigger than a half gallon bowl. Every day, changed his water and medicated him and just monitored him hour to hour for months. I got that phrase a lot. "But it's just a fish"He was the most beautiful fish I've ever owned. I had him for nearly six years after that. He survived through all that and turned out to be this beautiful thing in my life. I was devastated when he died, cried for hours. I haven't loved any other betta the same way. But I cherish that my fish get me through the hard times, motivate me, inspire me to keep beautiful things alive. It's embarrassing sometimes to admit this, but I will never forget what my fish hobby has given me in my very depressed life. SIP Spectrum.
Hardy326 [info] Around the age of 10, My great uncle passed away after being in and out of the hospital for about 3 years. Every day he was in the hospital, I was so afraid to come home and possibly have to hear he had passed,my last week of 5th grade,I got home and that fear came true. After that, I became very fearful about many things,such as friendships falling apart and people passing away that I would lose my mind emotionally if given the slightest bit of bad news. I saw a psychiatrist and we worked through it. This was the end of my battle... or so I thought.My sophomore year of high school, I tried to call my grandad (mom’s side),who I had built a relationship with over the course of a year. When it went to voicemail, I just decided to wait. We eventually got a call telling us he had a heart attack and passed away in his bathroom. This really effected me, to a point where I began pushing people away,for fear of dealing with these issues again.In the mean time,we moved my Grandmother (Dad’s side) into our house,so she wouldn’t be lonely. When she moved in,it was a bit of a toxic environment that began brewing. There were arguments about many different things almost weekly, to a point,I began to isolate myself from my family. So I graduated high school and got my first job. I was scheduled to work a 4 day stint from Friday to Monday,well Thursday I get a call asking me to come in and cover for one of my co-workers. I agreed to take his shift. That day,my grandmother was hospitalized and she passed away Sunday night. I never got to say goodbye.When I found out she had passed, I lost my mind. I broke the foot board of my bed in half and had a mental breakdown, this was the first time I had ever called the national suicide hotline. I went to work less than 12 hours after she passed and was mocked and ridiculed like most other days. The next day (Tuesday), I talked with my family about setting up my first appointment with my old psychiatrist, and then the date was set.I was mortified about my appointment,to the point, I tried to avoid it in any way possible. But when I got back to the office, it was like when I was a kid,before my life came crashing down. We had a good chat and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I remember her saying those words and not knowing what to think. Was I crazy? How would it affect me? Was this something that I should keep secret? I had to figure out the answers and soon. So from May to September of last year, I went and saw my psychiatrist on a biweekly basis. I took medication to help. I felt like things would be okay, and then she retired. I thought there would be a referral to someone else,but there wasn’t, I was just put out to pasture with a few pill bottles. In October, I had another bad mental breakdown, I couldn’t find any will to move forward with life, so I set up an appointment with a therapist.When it came to therapy, I wondered a lot about what it entailed. What would I do if it didn’t work? What comes after it? Any more pills? So,I went to the first session with an open mind. I found that it helped a good bit, but I needed to find a psychiatrist, so after months of looking, I found one and I have an appointment set for the 19th of next month. But,how am I doing now?In short, depends on the day. Some are great and I love them,but most are unfortunately ,challenging to get through. The way my brain is set, I hate myself with an immense passion, and I’m trying to fight back against it. I am fighting, which can be considered a victory in it’s own right.If you make it to the end of this, I just want to say, that YOU ARE WORTH IT. I at times am very tough on myself, and I don’t want any of you,my friends, to suffer like I allow myself to. Love you all. Take care.
unipos [info] You're getting a lot of shit but I hope you won't be discouraged. This subreddit unfortunately has a lot of victim mentality and saying anything in the direction of encouraging people to try a bit harder is interpreted in an extremely negative light.I'm a fat lazy slob, a negative person with a fatalistic attitude. I've been diagnosed with depression, ADHD, psychosis... . I've let myself slide into a miserable state. And the only one I can blame is myself. The truth is I don't even try to make my life better very often because I forget I can. But when I see a post like yours, I remember again that I can try and I can do. Even if it's just small baby steps.The only thing I wish is I had brave people like you in my life, reminding that I can do better and when need be sometimes remind me of uncomfortable truths.But I can see why people often don't bother. Because they get shat on and accused of not having empathy. You have my upvote.
CosinesCosines [info] I can kinda relate to this. I was diagnosed with depression and my docs kept only suggesting medication and therapy to help. Neither worked. I come to learn on my own that simply cutting out certain people who were my stressors helped tremendously. All the therapists I've been to only tried to teach me skills on how to deal with said people when they actually should've told me to just leave them.
McSwearWolf [info] Looking over your post history .... I am not a doctor but before you do this, please have your hormone levels (thyroid) checked out. It can be a factor. Source: I am diagnosed with depression but also had my PCP run thyroid levels several times, and it turns out I have ‘T3 sick syndrome’ / Euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) which is a state of adaptation or dysregulation of thyrotropic feedback control wherein the levels of T3 and/or T4 are abnormal, but the thyroid gland does not appear to be dysfunctional. Thus, my issues were misdiagnosed for years. I have a masters in psychology as well, and I know bipolar is very real, but I also think mental healthcare is a real mixed bag. I received different diagnoses from several different experts and I found out about the thyroid issues myself from doing my own research. PS: meds do not work well for people with thyroid issues. Really tricky. As for your grad program... can you take some time off? Talk to your advisor. Explain you are seriously ill at the moment and you need HELP. I hope you’ll stick around and see if you can find more answers. I’m rooting for you.
oofecalmatteroo666 [info] Just curious how old are you ? I was diagnosed with depression at like 16 at first then by 20 phase II bipolar. Honestly if you got diagnosed in the past with just depression with no extreme behavior like violence , stealing , over spending etc... I highly doubt that would change now . You could be considered bipolar with small bouts of mania like maybe talking fast extreme energy maybe more irritable insomnia. I get what you’re saying tho the connotation of being bipolar always seems worse than depression . Don’t be scared . I’m 36 and I will warn you be careful about drug and alcohol abuse, it’s common with bipolar . I went to a great school but truthfully that was my downfall the drugs . Just Be mindful of behavior then you will be ok 
Teefdreams [info] Yeah, not great to keep going to psychiatrists in search of a specific diagnosis.   Howwweeeever, I was misdiagnosed. 17 yrs ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Which, like, I was depressed and having severe panic attacks. They just missed the hypomania. And they didn't ask me if I could hear my neighbours thoughts at night so I didn't tell them.   SSRIs don't really work for people with BP. It's one of the things that psychiatrists look for when they diagnose. SSRIs generally send us manic or don't work at all.  The other stuff sounds more like hypomania?  Edit: Someone else has mentioned BPD. Definitely worth looking into, especially since you mention a traumatic childhood.  And another thing, are you always absorbed in something when you don't sleep?
Exoen [info] I didn't have PTSD but I had nightmares every night when I was diagnosed with depression and took antidepressants. I was also scared to fall asleep. Eventually I was diagnosed as bipolar and switched to mood stabilizers and it went away for most of the time. I don't have enough information to give advice, but from my experience it got better with different medication and therapy.I hope you find your thing too.
LlZARD99 [info] Thank you.  I've been diagnosed with depression, but I haven't had these intense feelings since I was in my 20s. I'm 47 now.
CreepySignature [info] Yeah typically they might say the birth control to see if "balances" your hormones. There's a degree to which I think having small ups and downs is "normal". My counselor outs it this way, when you're in your high energy, hypomanic state, you're using up all your "good" brain chemicals and then you crash which leads to the depression. Until you get a counselor and/psychiatrist my suggestion for you would be notice these high energy, hypomanic moments and try (if you can) to reel it in and do something that's the opposite of what your high energy body wants to do. I know I will sound like a broken record, but try something like meditation where you HAVE to be still and calm you brain down. There are plenty of apps like calm, headspace, etc. That have some free guided meditations in them. My other suggestion would be just to go walk. Don't make yourself do a project or try to complete something. That sort of feeds the beast from my experience. As far as the depression goes, same thing, try REALLY hard to force yourself to do some of the things you might do in a hypomanic state. I feel like as cyclothymatics (is that a word? Lol) have the ability to manage their moods a bit more without medication than say bipolar 1 or 2. BUT with that being said, you absolutely need to seek a counselor first and foremost when you are able to. AND DON'T TAKE SSRI'S OR ANTIDEPRESSANTS WITHOUT BEING LOOKED AT FOR BIPOLAR. Zoloft fucked me up for 2 years while I was on it because I was just diagnosed with depression and anxiety.
