HypertextMakeoutLang [info] my doctor wants me to get retested, and I'm not sure what to make of it given previous tests Obligatory i'm not tryina have you guys diagnose me.        I've been chronically fatigued / have had EDS since 2013. I had a PSG done in 2013 and was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea and my REM Latency was 153 minutes. I adjusted fine to CPAP but could not for the life of me get better. In 2014 I was diagnosed with depression and went on antidepressants, got the depression under control, and again the fatigue and sleepiness never got better.        At the end of 2015 while on 250mg of Seroquel, i had another PSG and this time an MSLT to go along with it. During the PSG my REM latency was 194 minutes, but we did the MSLT anyway because I wasn't having apneas. I only fell asleep during the first of the five naps, and my sleep latency was 4 minutes. There's a dash over REM latency, so I guess i never hit it. Narcolepsy was ruled out.        I was never a big napper, usually I just had to get horizontal in the afternoons, but in 2016 I found i was napping more. Towards the end of the year it became two times a day. Now that I think of it, maybe it was because I'd switched from Seroquel to Cymbalta? In 2017 I realized I was gluten and dairy intolerant, and that cut it down to one nap per day, and I switched to Effexor, which I now take at night, but I'm still exhausted all the time.        I started going through the process of getting diagnosed with CFS towards the end of last year, and the new sleep specialist I'm seeing wants me to get another MSLT because I was on Seroquel last time. Obviously he wants me to be off Effexor for it, which will be a pain in the ass.        My question is, if 5 years ago while fatigued with EDS and not on any AD's and my REM latency was 150 minutes, how could I possibly have had narcolepsy all this time? Wouldn't it have shown there if  i was already so tired during the day? I guess it's possible that I could have developed narcolepsy along the way and had/have another problem? But idk...

Bubbly_Taro [info] How do you know if you are depressed and not lazy? So I was diagnosed with depression about 10 years ago and I have been in mental hospitals several times and tried various types of medications.I also had counseling up until fairly recently and we talked ad nauseam about the things I need to do to improve my condition. Exercise, better diet, going outside, socializing with other people, the usual stuff.I have a profound understanding about what I need to do to get better but I cannot bring myself to adhere to these ideas so I am wondering if I am not just incredibly lazy instead of depressed and that my poor state of mind stems from inaction and reclusion.

pipermaru84 [info] I transitioned for 7 years including almost 4 years of testosterone, top surgery, and legal document changes. I was less than a month out from my hysterectomy and planning bottom surgery when I finally got my wakeup call. I detransitioned almost 3 years ago and have never looked back. I did have a pretty long "anger phase" where I wasn't able to be around the trans community but at this point I have a couple of FTM friends and am able to separate myself from the issue a little bit. Occasionally I feel what I used to call dysphoria, but I've done enough internal work at this point to be able to deconstruct those feelings, determine their source, and fix the source if possible or else just understand it as an external force and not something wrong with me. I have been diagnosed with depression for longer than I've been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, so of course I have my ups and downs, but in general I would say I experience no distress related to my gender any more, barring occasional insecurity about my facial hair (though not enough to actually shave more than every couple of weeks). I don't have much experience with dating while detrans since I'm still with the first woman I started dating afterwards, but perhaps that's an indication anyway--she was previously a relatively normie lesbian and never batted an eye at any of my transition related features. It can be annoying sometimes to be read as male (or more often, as a transwoman) and know that it's because of what I did to my own body but it's not something that makes me upset anymore, just a little irritated occasionally.

Seriou [info] &gt;treatment resistent depressionThat phrase triggered me. Depression is a mental thing, and the ways we "treat" it is fucking backwards, sideways and inside out. Let me tell ya something: I was diagnosed with depression when I was young. I've been horribly, almost violently suicidal and self-loathing my whole life. My death was constantly on my mind. I used to take antidepressants, tried talk therapy and counseling, even got prescribed a bunch of adult anti-psychotic meds by a shockingly incompetent specialist. That was a nightmarish year.  What helped me in the end though, was myself. It's been a very long and rough road that I'm still walking. Life still isn't very enjoyable and I have many self-destructive behaviors I'm dealing with, but I haven't legitimately felt the need to die in a long time. I'm so thankful for that.

Lineaddict [info] My various physical illnesses are getting too much to bear. I have vocal chord dysfunction, which is like reverse athsma. That along with mucus heavy saliva makes breathing painful and difficult. I am severely constipated, only using the restroom about once a week. This causes me to sometimes have crippling butt spasms which leave me unable to do anything but sit and wait the pain out. I was diagnosed with depression before these two things were too much of a problem, and while I am better mentally than I was, my most intense urges to off are when my symptoms are at their worse. I have thoughts that I might rather die than experience the pain anymore. I am proactive about managing my illnesses, seeing doctors and such, but appointments are few and far between for the VCD.I am drowning inside of myself and if my symptoms get much worse, I will have difficulty keeping invasive thoughts out.

dispwned [info] In the first few weeks after finding out I was pregnant, I was terrified I would miscarry. I remember how many times my Brother and Sister-in-law miscarried before they had their first baby. So, I did some research - online and a little offline - and what I found was reassuring and validating.The basic summary of everything I read was this: As long as you're eating and living healthy (no recreational drugs, no alcohol, no smoking, no reckless activities, you're taking your prenatal and/or supplements etc.) and following your doctors' orders, but you still miscarry, it's okay and it's not your fault. If a miscarriage happens at that point, I found it's typically because the pregnancy itself isn't viable - either not genetically (for a multitude of reasons), the egg didn't attach properly, and other scenarios I can't remember at the moment. But none of that would be your fault.I had a rough first trimester, and I thought for sure I would miscarry because I couldn't take good care of myself:  * My diet was mostly force-fed V8 juice, cottage cheese, milk, water, and the occasional bowl of plain cereal, because the thought of anything else usually made my nausea even worse. * I was utterly exhausted, often sleeping for over 2/3rds of the day (there was more than one weekend where I slept almost the entire time, and it worried my Husband)  * I had such brutal vertigo, I couldn't walk from one end of our house to the other without holding on to something. * I had severe cramping that I was *sure* was a sign of a miscarriage. I was so worried that I scheduled a last minute appt. at my OB's office to check before my actual 'first' appointment the following week. But, it was just my uterus starting to grow to make room, and the OB assured me everything was fine.Now, here I am at 21 weeks of my first pregnancy, and our little girl is feisty. Any movement is a flurry of jabs, she'll react sometimes when I talk or sing after being quiet for a bit, and if she finds herself being squished (like one of the last times I wore pre-pregnancy jeans or when I eat far too much) she will not have it and starts kicking up a fuss.It's okay to worry and be cautious, but also keep in mind it could be your hormones making your worry even more, I know mine did. Hell, they still do lol. Just keep talking to your husband and be open with him about it, and talk to your doctor and/or OB about your concerns. It might also be a good idea to see a therapist, if you don't have one already, because it's possible to have depression with your pregnancy, not just postpartum, referred to as antepartum depression. I was diagnosed with depression years ago, and am currently taking Zoloft 100mg for it. (Under close watch of the prescribing nurse) So, make sure you're listening to your doctor, take your prenatals, eat as well as you're able, and keep talking it out and be open about your concerns especially with your Husband and Doctor. =) Plus, you can always come here again.

noratat [info] &gt; Women get looked at as beings to care for and love and help... adult men aspies are seen as broken hopeless, useless, and potentially dangerous beings... I'm sure other male aspies here can relate with this.Male aspie here, and while I can relate to depressive feelings, I can't relate to the rest of what you've said.I agree with the other poster - you're looking at everything through a rather distorted lens here, and you should seriously talk to your doctor about depression. You remind me of how I thought back in high school (and I was diagnosed with depression then), twisting everything to fit a negative perspective whether it was warranted or not.Growing up, I was seen as obstinate, annoying, and hard to deal with, sure. But none of those are unique to high-functioning autism, and frankly some of it was actual nuture/nature from my family as my dad has some similar personality traits (but is definitely NT). We're definitely not automatically seen as "hopeless, useless, or broken" - like I said, I think you're projecting what I suspect is depression or something related.You also seem to have a distorted idea of how women on the spectrum are treated - I can't speak for your sister, but I've known several women with autism, and their experiences were very different - they were often seen as easy targets, and even as adults a lot of them have to put up with crap I've never even had to encounter.

FrostedPoptart [info] Prozac dosage increased two days ago. Are these new feelings happening coincidentally or is it the new dose? I was diagnosed with depression three weeks ago and put on 10mg Prozac once a day. I hadn't noticed a different at all for three weeks. If anything the last few days up until the third week I just didn't give a shit, I had no filter with anyone basically. I could had just been having a couple bad days though.I told my psychiatrist this and three days ago she increased my dose to 20mg. Since then, I have felt better and been lot more positive and just generally in a better state of mind. But since its only been a few days Im afraid that this is coincidental and I'll feel bad again soon.

Arrow156 [info] I kinda get that. I was diagnosed with depression at 10, was on meds for awhile but I didn't notice any difference except for a few bad reactions. Whenever I have a real shitty day my thoughts turn to death, maybe no so much suicide but just the longing to no longer exist.  Often I just feel so tired of merely existing, the day to day grind and the complete lack of meaning behind it all.  I see death and the cease of my existence as a relief, like the feeling of finally sleeping after days of being awake.  I've had these feelings for decades, it's now just a part of who I am. I don't worry that I'll ever commit suicide or put myself in danger or anything like that, I lack the energy to do anything; I just have no motivation, to live or to die.

Hime_Takamura [info] Ever since my older sister moved home, I've come to realize that my family doesn't like me. They love me like a family should, they care for my well-being and take care of me, but they don't like me and it's my fault. This is gonna be a long one. I'm sorry. I've never talked to anyone about any of this so it's just kind of all spilling out now. I'm not a very good writer so this may be very disjointed, I'm sorry.To make things easier:I am a female, currently aged 24 and my family and I live in Texas.My oldest sister is 6 years older than me and I'll call her E.My second oldest sister is 1 year older than me and I'll call her M.My youngest sister is 9 years younger than me and I'll call her R. She has Downs Syndrome.I was diagnosed with depression when I was in 5th grade after years of already struggling with it. The first time I tried to kill myself, I was about 12 years old. I took a bunch of pills, both mine and my mother's. It didn't work. I tried laying in bed waiting to die but I got scared of some wasps outside my window right next to my bed so I went downstairs. I sat in me and my sister's play room and watched a movie (I think it was Romeo and Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio). I got hungry and I stumbled into the kitchen to make a sandwich. I got really dizzy and couldn't concentrate and I asked my dad to finish making them for me. As I was walking back to the play room, I blacked out for a few second sand came to lying on the ground. My dad and my oldest sister were next to me and my parents ended up taking me to the hospital. I recall laying in the hospital bed and my mom sitting next to me with my dad. She said "She'd better not be faking this." My dad asked me if I took all the antidepressants because I thought taking more would make me more happy and I lied and said yes because I was scared of getting in trouble for purposefully trying to kill myself. The second time I tried to kill myself was when I was December 21st, 2010, when I was 18. My recent ex-boyfriend had cheated on me with one of my friends and all the friends in that group didn't think it was a big deal so I isolated myself from them. I lost my best friend because he would rather hang out with the girl my boyfriend cheated on me with and left me for. It was half way through senior year and everyone else in school had already grouped off in the months and years before so I had no one. I was alone and I didn't want to suffer anymore while also getting back at my ex friends. "This will show them" I thought, "They'll have to live the rest of their lives knowing they drove a girl to suicide." I took 40 sleeping pills while my family and I were staying in a condo out of town for Christmas and visiting family. When I survived, I was embarrassed. My mother was mad at me again and yelled at me in her room loud enough for the rest of the family and cousins to hear. Everyone had to take shifts watching me for the next few days making sure I didn't fall asleep and die. My cousin had to clean up when I vomited up all the pills. I remember my late grandfather telling me that throwing up was good and it was my body getting rid of all the bad things. When I graduated from high school (I didn't go to the ceremony since I didn't have any friends anymore) my parents forced me to go to college despite my protests. I always hated school and I still didn't even know what I wanted to do with my life. I chose the school that E went to, up in New York. I had always been an underachiever. In high school, I took the borderline remedial classes so I could get straight A's and barely have to do anything. All my school and homework would be done within minutes in class and I would spend the rest of my time drawing. In college, I was immediately overwhelmed by everything and ended up flunking out after about 2 months. I had to call my parents, sobbing and explain to them that I was a failure and had flunked out of a very far away and expensive college. They let me come home and move in with them. For the past 5 years, I've lived at home with my parents and disabled sister. I have a part time job getting paid to provide respite care for R although I'm practically her mother at this point. I'm ashamed to say I haven't been very kind to her at all and on occasion in the past, I've taken out some of my anger on her. Not in an abusive way, but I've screamed at her and on a few occasions years ago I hit her. When I was a child, I was so excited to have a little sister. My friends had little sisters and I thought it would be so cool to have someone to teach about new things and have fun with. Unfortunately that never happened. After the first few years of her life, I realized she would never grow up. She'd always be a baby, she'd never be normal, and she would never be able to take care of herself. I resent her. I wish she had never been born. I hope every day that she'll get in some sort of accident and die so no one has to deal with her anymore. After she was born, my parents had no time for the rest of us. We didn't get to go out and do anything because of R. I hate her.Lately, my mother's health has been declining. She almost died last year because of surgery complications and this year she's gotten one of her knees replaced. She needs a walker to get around. So I stay at home and take care of her and R. A month ago, M moved back home. She's hardworking, determined, and outgoing. My polar opposite. I'm lazy, depressed, unmotivated, and a shut in. Ever since she came home, she's been helping and doing way more than I have. Rather than get motivated and try and keep up with her, I just wallow in self pity and cry in my room. M is also very mean sometimes. We used to be so close when we were children; we were like conjoined twins doing everything together. Now, she'll yell at me and berate me for being lazy. This morning, she put a bag of maggot infested garbage in my room because I neglected to take out one of the trash bins on trash day. My parents didn't even care. Now that M is home, they don't need me anymore. I'm just in the way. But I have nowhere to go. I have no one to turn to. I wish I could blame all of my faults on my depression but I feel like I'm just using it as a crutch. All I ever do is make excuses. I'm not a good person. I'm lazy and childish and selfish and I'm not making anyone's lives better by being in them. I'm just bothersome to everyone and I feel like I'm bothering everyone just by posting this. I'd be better off dead but I'm too much of a coward to pull the trigger. I'd just make a huge mess and then everyone would hate me for making them have to clean up after me. The worst part is, I don't deserve to be depressed. I have all of my finances covered, I was never abused, My family is upper middle class, and I have a wonderful boyfriend (albeit one I could never say any of this to). Other people have it much worse than me and yet I'm the one wallowing in self pity, cutting my arms and sobbing into my pillow. I'm the worst. [info] None [info] 1477857579 [info] test
MrZane113 [info] Ok so get a 2nd opinion and be totally honest with them don't hold back idk if u have BP I'm not a doc but if u think/know something was wrong then u have to be honest to get the help u need. I will now sum how not being honest affected my life (it's kinda long)Ok so at 17 I was diagnosed with depression I had the thoughts of suicide constantly (never really told them that cuZ I was ashamed just said I was sad)  they gave my Zoloft. at 21 I had back surgery that turned in to a drug addiction for a few years(not really sure how long) I snapped one night slit my wrists and thankfully called my lil bro to tell him I loved him I passed out with him on the phone (from blood loss).  Thankfully he could tell something was wrong and called 911 24 Staples later I was diagnosed with major depression disorder I moved back to my home town spent 9 months in and out of the hospital (not sure how many it was more then 6 though) every time I held back I was not totally honest I told them what they needed to hear I did not follow up with therapy I did not take my mental health seriously.  Then my cousin on his 15th bday hung him self I honestly can't explain what it did to me cuz it was so uncontrollable and just down right unbearable (I wish I new him better cuz I new how he felt but never really told anyone) 2 night before the funeral me and my bro get in to an all out fight (we are both 6'2 and work out it was a battle Royale) once again I tried to kill my self by slitting my wrists but I did it in front of everyone (it was really just a cry for help) I spent that night in jail naked in the suicide Ward.  Thank God they did not press charges I got home flipped out again and once again the cops came but this time I got sent to the exit in a mental health facility.... honestly this sounds horrible but the only reason I was actually honest for the first time was cuz my cousin killed him self it gave me motivation to get help cuz I new I was fucked in the head.  So for the first time I was totally honest I told them everything the sex the drugs the suicidal thoughts the paranoia fucking everything I never visually hallucinated but I awalys had my own voice in the back of my head telling me to kill my self.  That being said I hit the 2 year anniversary of my diagnosis about to weeks ago I got a fulltime job that I'm kicking ass at I'm mostly stabe when I'm not I fake it till I make it.  I still live at home (which sucks cuz I'm 28 and wanna date but its only temporary)  the worst part is it took the my cousin suicide to be honest.  Sometimes I think if I would have just been honest with the family in the beginning I would have been diagnosed earlier he might still be alive maybe I could have been there for him...but u can't change the past u can only move forward and learn from the past. My point is if u want to get help u have to share your deepest fears your most personal feelings u have to be vulnerable it's the hardest thing I have ever done I wish I would have had the strength to do it sooner maybe things would be different.Happy new years my friend I wish the best for u and truly hope the best for u.

Accomplished_Drummer [info] I was a quiet, nerdy, sad girl.

ladybug812 [info] I know you said your mind is made up. But this might give some insight and, if nothing else, at least something to think about.My mom committed suicide when I was 19 (I'm 27). She was an addict, had a hard life, etc. Trust me when I tell you...the impact is devastating. We were not on good terms when she died. She had so many demons and I can understand that finality would rid her of them...but she could have saved herself. I miss her and wish I could talk to her again.In all honesty, when someone completes suicide, usually they dont think about the impact. They want instant gratification - for their pain to end. But it isnt worth it. How do I know? I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13 or 14. I was suicidal and engaged in selfharm. My upbringing was unstable and heartwrenching, but I'm still here and I'm so glad that I did not end my life. Despite the fact I continue to deal with depression, I have more hope compared to when I was younger and it has kept me going. I never thought I would think that way...but here I am.I hope that you find the will to live. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem/situation/etc.I wish you luck.

Kinetic_EKO [info] "If you didn't - the mods overreacted, but I've played with Zeus and he's not an unreasonable dude, so there's that."Oh no they did and I do have Zeus' own pic to prove it.Since **I**, on the other hand, have been on suicide watch a number of times, given how I've been diagnosed with depression as early as 2014, I actually felt very much offended by what happened and I know that I JUST SAID 'let's stop being sad' and everything but if you are going to go tease me over my reason not to be officially there I'm simply going to tell you why, because I have not forgotten nor do I mean to. And while we're at it, I think this is a valid joke, whether or not you know someone is having an issue with it. I was doing it myself. I was joking about my serotonin level here, being actually low. If that is really the reason they want to start a fight over, they obviously don't have much actual drama going on for them. I'm just gonna go and try to enjoy life, myself.

alderfae [info] I am definitely aware that I have a mood disorder. I was diagnosed with depression several years ago. I'm pretty sure I am relapsing. I forgot to take my meds for a while, then just stopped taking them all together - big mistake! I've stopped eating, sleeping, I am irritable. I didn't even realize it until my boyfriend brought it up. We were arguing about the ex, bc I was crying bc I felt like he will never love me as much as he loved her. He said I was crying over nothing, and I had nothing to worry about, and politely asked if I was taking my medication or if maybe it was close to that time of the month. I realized it had been at least 2 weeks since I'd taken my pills. I'm going to the doctor next week for a refill and to ask her to increase the dosage and to recommend a therapist in my healthcare network. I was seeing a different therapist for a while, but in my opinion, there is a conflict of interest since she is a friend of my mother and my mother was encouraging me to see her. The drama that was the catalyst for all this has been the rough patch in the relationship with my mom. It may sound paranoid, but I do not trust a therapist who is close friends with her. Also, my mom was/is a client of hers. It's just too much for me. And my mom and I got in a fight and she implied that the therapist is on her side and agrees that I am a liar/there is something wrong with me/etc. And this was long before I started breaking down. It has just been a lot of stress to deal with. My mom hates my boyfriend and he hates her back bc he does not like how she speaks to me. It's a long story, and I've got an extensive post history about it through r/raisedbynarcissists.  [info] None [info] 1547171584 [info] test

Stupid thing to think up maybe, it's late at night bordering on being depressed again but just can't help feeling gray.I was usually the guy who kept quiet and kept to myself, I never was that social, and after I was diagnosed with depression/PTSD from shit that happened years ago I turned into a recluse; I hid as much as I can from general contact, I remember overhearing from a classmate years ago in College she was scared of me because i just didn't 'fit in'.I currently work in Retail, lovely store couldn't ask for better but...just I feel like ive never formed any type of personality, years ago I probably wouldve loved a best friend to go do anything with, a girlfriend I could cherish and care for, people to have my back...but because of shitty experiences that have hurt me deeply i shut myself off, the only two relationships i had I got cheated on as I was a fall-guy, and any attempt i try to make friends even at my job just result in people avoiding me, I don't consider myself as weird or anything but could be because I just feel im not that interesting.

I was on medication for a few years, didn't really work, but made it a bit easier. Eventually we had to try other things, counselling, breathing exercises, just trying to get myself to a better place within my own mind. That took 4-5 years overall until I was able to do it myself and keep it up.You took 6 months, that really isn't all that much.However, despite offering advice, suggestions, ideas, reasons, you seem set in your way to be a failure.

glqck [info] I'm nothing without my medication. Hey, i'm Bradley. I'm turning 16 close to the end of this year. This year's exams that are upcoming are really, really important and will determine my near future. It's stressful, but I always avoid getting stressed. Here's where the first problem comes in: when i'm not stressed, I don't worry about the exams. So in the end, there's completely no effort when the day comes.Medication started about a month or two ago. So far, i've missed some days and yes, my psychiatrist knows. I won't elaborate on my problems but basically I have been diagnosed with depression after close to 3 years of suffering in silence. And it has been tough. Seeking help didn't relieve me that much, but it did. My mood changed a little, i'm kind of more positive in terms of my everyday life. Just school, sports and home. A cycle.Everytime there's signs (which are triggers, but i'm afraid of telling my teachers or psychiatrist because i'm just too scared to) i'm always getting into that depressive episode. I get easily angry, especially to my friends and I tend to be impulsive during these "anger moments". It's tough dealing with depression. Really tough. Medication just makes it seem like I can't handle things on my own, and drugs are needed just for my mood to get better (I mean, when I was a child it was so easy to be happy, why not now?). I seem to never forget that without medication i'd be dead. I don't know if I should see it that way or whether I should take things on my own. It's masculinity, right? If we could handle this, we're stronger than others, right?People always tell us that it'd be better if they understood what I was going through, but must I really tell _everyone_ that I have depression?

Deadamisa911 [info] My husbands parents did this to him all the time. When he told them what they said bothered him they would say, "You're turning into a woman." "You're too sensitive." "You're such a snowflake." We had to go no contact with them. (I say had because they gave us no other choice.) At first we just wanted to limit contact like through social media and stuff. They freaked out because we blocked them on Facebook and Instagram. They called us demanding that we unblock them. Through out the entire phone call we were incredibly polite, but they refused to listen to what we had to say. After that they started harassing us, and we had to block them or we wouldn't have been able to go to sleep. Then they went nuts. It's been about a month, and we've been forced to change out phone numbers. The things is they seem to think I'm convincing my husband that he's depressed. However, I never once said that he was. It's just them projecting mental illness on him. They are trying to project it onto me too, except that I am diagnosed with depression, but whatever. [info] None [info] 1574352706 [info] test

sumguythere [info] Oh, I may be just the person you're looking for to ask this to.So am I happy? Not yet, but I'm well on my way. Right now I am working as a drafter in the engineering department of a manufacturing business started by my great-grandfather and currently run by my dad and uncle. While I worked for years to find a career path that would keep me from this place, I inevitably found myself looking for a steady paycheck when the recession started and found what I had hoped would be a temporary position. Many circumstances beyond my control changed that, and shortly after starting I was on a journey that would take me to another part of the country and into family drama that makes the Bluth's a model family. But I am happy? That's a tough question to answer, and one I ask myself everyday. I can honestly say the stress has put me into therapy, and I have been diagnosed with depression (very treatable though, so long as I stay regular on the meds). Some of the biggest stresses are caused because it's a family business, it carries a great deal more stress then a normal 9-5 job might. There are a number of things I cannot talk about to people, and in many instances have had to feign ignorance on a subject with coworkers because I would have extensive knowledge on behind the scenes action that they are not supposed to hear. There is also the added stress of simply not knowing how to do what I need to do since I went to school for theater and film, and have only some experience in business, engineering, and manufacturing. The hardest part of the past few years was finding a position where I would could provide value to the company and contribute without being "the bosses son" (I loath nepotism, even though it got my foot in the door). That also creates issues for me personally, since as a 28 year old trying to make an identity for myself I constantly go into a job where my name carries weight and history, some of which I'm sorry to say is very bad.So am I happy? I'm not unhappy. While it's not what I wanted to do with my life it's providing me a stable foundation that allows me to pay all my bills and have my own place (it is a high price we young people pay these days for independence) and has allowed me to start meeting new people and develop my first long term relationship. I also have enough freedom that I have begun taking improv classes at night in order to work on my speaking skills, to be active, and to indulge in my love of theater, something I wouldn't have imagined possible before starting here.Most important to me is not my immediate happiness but the stability and resources of my future, both of which are going to be met through the family business. My hope is that while I am not doing what I love now with my life, by dedicating the time now to educating myself and establishing an identity at the company it will give me the freedom and power later to spend time pursuing creative interest or, at the very least, allow me to raise a family.TL:DR - No, I'm not doing the Ren and Stimpy "Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy" dance at my family business, but it will let me do it later in life.

MrsBadExample [info] SSRIs have saved my life, seriously.I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago now, and they started me off with Wellbutrin, a fairly low dosage. It worked decently, and I felt a bit better, and had more energy. But it wore off pretty fast. I had an entire year where it wasn't working but I didn't understand, and I dragged back to suicidal thoughts and tendencies, and became a recluse in my own house.My doctor, who is pretty amazing, recognized the problems without me even saying anything to her and prescribed me Prozac. The adjustment period was extremely rough - I was very tired, I felt extremely flat and kind of "bleh" about a lot of stuff. But after being on it for over a year, I feel fairly normal besides being maybe a bit more tired than normal, and I don't want to kill myself every day. I still get depressed, however the suicide thoughts have almost completely ceased, which is *absolutely wonderful*. It's also helped immensely with my GAD, so I've been happy with it.Therapy also helps, but the medication is an insanely helpful tool. Being off of it is terrifying, and the backlash is literally frightening. [info] None [info] 1494328548 [info] test

EianSiCK [info] I'm a chronically ill non-binary trans guy, and probably would never have come out without the sudden influx of trans/non-binary people in the media and online. I had a conversation with my queer godfather(in his fifties) who told me that if there had been the vocabulary when he was younger he would have identified as non-binary. The world is getting smaller and the queer community is getting bigger because we have the vocabulary to define ourselves now. More people are being exposed to it and therefore more people can say "hey that's me." Also mental illness rates have gone up over the last several years due to economic decline and life-quality decline. I will probably never own a house, I can't afford to finish college and if I did I'd be in debt my entire life. I've been diagnosed with depression and panic disorder, along with OCD.

walkingupstream [info] Yes, I was diagnosed with depression 25 years ago, and again about 18 years ago. This past summer i was diagnosed OCD. Depression never really explained everything, but absolutely my main symptom is rumination. Depression hits when my ruminations are allowed to persist too long. The biggest difference in the treatment of each is that medication for ocs is 3-4x the dosage of ssri than for depression.

Know_What_Fvck_This [info] Well, my parents don't want me on anti-depressants, I don't trust my friends, at least not after the last one to know I had depression, and, I haven't seen my therapist in months, not that it matters, all they care about is money, they don't give a shit about you personally. I'd try group therapy, but, my mom says changing therapists is too hard. My parents, despite knowing I was diagnosed with depression, would rather pretend I don't have it, so, if I live they'll at least notice, and, if I get committed and put away, I finally get to escape. Not to mention, I'm about to fail a midterm so, either death or commitment gets me out of it, even if I fail I don't have to think about it nor any of my other failures. I have one person I trust, I love her, we're not together, and, she doesn't love me romantically, but, I do consider her one of my closest friends. She knows about my depression.

kelbarbs [info] Tired of my parent's decisions constantly having negative impacts on me. First and foremost, I'm F19, about to go into University soon. Perhaps saying I'm from an Asian family might help too. My parents had 4 children, all girls. I am the oldest, middle two are 14 and 13,and then 8. They told me they kept wanting a boy at the time. When I was in my teens, my parents were constantly fighting and the family was dysfunctional. I had nobody to turn to when I was sad. Later dad was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. Episodes come and go throughout my teen years. I was diagnosed with depression myswmd at the age of 16. It's a lot better now. I've also been having to step up to the mother role lately by being the confidant to my sisters, which I'm more than happy to do as I only want the best for them and I know growing up can be hard, and I always tell them they can tell me anything and I would never judge them.  This all happened because my mother said she was burnt out from raising kids for 20 years and wanted to take time for herself. So she's hardly at home and also very short tempered and judgemental all the time. Fast forward to now, I'm looking at going to university abroad. They've agreed to pay for it (money is no problem in the family) very early on and promised me a university education. Some years ago I took a major exam and had to choose between 3 years in a specialised course or 2 years in a generalised study. 16 yo me had no idea and just agreed with whatever they recommended. I was miserable the whole 3 years as I hated the course of study and the school and it was a very toxic environment. I know where I want to go but it would require an extra year of study as whatever course they asked me to do doesn't qualify me for university right away. Initially they agreed but then now they are saying otherwise as they have this delusion that if I spend an extra year studying I will not get hired into a good job out of university. Keep in mind because of their decision at the time for the specialised course I'm already a year later than my peers  who went to university. At this point im just sick of it. Sick of the one taking the emotional burden of the decisions they push onto me. I feel like as an adult now I should have the say of where I want to go in life. I also constantly worry for my sisters not having anyone to confide in when I move out and they bottle it up.I don't know what to say them anymore. I just want to have a say in my decisions, for once. I know they mean well but id rather face the good or bad consequences of my own decisions than theirs.Thank you for hearing me out.TL;DR I'm sick and tired of my parents poor decisions constantly having negative impacts on me.

chronickiddo [info] Corona Virus has ruined over two years of mental stability I was diagnosed with depression when I was 12, things were really bad for a long time but I started feeling in control again my freshman year of high school. I’m now a junior, and I haven’t had bad depression in at least two years. Being stuck inside with my less than supportive parents while attempting to force myself into online learning is sending me in a downward spiral. I’ve never had any motivation for school, I also have Aspergers and ADHD which makes focusing on things I don’t care about impossible.

JoslyneD [info] Please help a newbie with depression/hormone problems... I'm still pretty new to this keto business, and I dont have a clue what keywords to even search for an answer to my problem, and the "Top Five..." link in the sidebar helped with part of my issue but not all of it. Halp!I get the feeling that maybe hormones/chemicals that were bound up in the fat cells are releasing into my body now that the fat cells are going away. I don't know any of the science behind this so I may be completely off the mark here, if so please tell me! I'm trying to figure out if I need to schedule a dr appointment, which I don't want to do since it means taking time off of work.I was diagnosed with depression about 18 months ago and have been stable with my meds for about 8 months...but all of a sudden I'm feeling depressed again. Literally all I want right now is to go home and be a blanket-burrito in front of my computer or tv.I'm also spotting in the middle of my month of birth control, and although I saw where the sidebar post says that shorter periods are common, my question is if it takes time to stabilize or if spotting randomly is normal for awhile. I used to not start until a day or two into the next month of pills so this is definitely abnormal for me. I need to lose about 120 pounds, and I'm down 15 after lazy keto/trying to strict keto and failing for about a month and a half. I don't know if I can handle this unpredictable hormone/depression crap for another 105 pounds :( Do I wait it out until I've successfully strict-keto-ed for a month or so, or make a doctor appointment sooner rather than later?

sadthough [info] The feeling of nostalgia actually really hurts sometime I've been diagnosed with depression for a few years now, but one thing that gets me the most is this really painful pang of nostalgia.

A lot of the times, I don't even know why, but I suddenly feel like I need to go back to my childhood, and that I want to leave reality. The pain actually feels physical, and I clutch my chest to stop it from hurting. Sometimes I think about the things I miss, and I remember this scent I used to love in my bed sheets.

avacatt [info] This was helpful. I wish someone had told me when I was younger that my high processed high carb diet was contributing to my hormonal imbalance. No one did, not even my endo who diagnosed me with it in the first place. I was diagnosed with depression but I started to realize that my hormones had an effect on my mood, not my brain chemistry. So the SSRI's I took I feel like didn't treat the root of the problem. Not even my psychiatrist asked me anything about my hormones even though hormonal imbalance is such a big contributer to PMDD and mood issues.I notice my mood issues and depression get worse when I'm eating bread, pasta, high GI. So I am laying off that for now and I see such a huge improvement. I just don't think some people's bodies were meant for those foods.Aside from that, I did want to also mention that while diet is extremely important, so is dealing with past traumas that can also lead to actual hormonal change. I had really low self esteem as a result of a bad upbringing and I know that in addition to diet I also have to heal from my past. [info] None [info] 1507656891 [info] test

You don’t know shit about depression”.After I got my diagnosis it was all like.....that doctor is crazy. He doesn’t know shit. You are only a bit sad, that’s not depression, so on and so forth.All good now though, my therapy helped me in the end. [info] None [info] 1564381948 [info] test
nopeagogo [info] ADHD and depression? anybody diagnosed with ADHD AND depression? I've been diagnosed with depression before, but (after a year and a half of trying various anti-depressants with nothing helping much) it was ultimately decided that it was situational and attributed to my untreated ADHD-- which I take a stimulant for. however, it seems (to me-- haven't delved much into this with my psychiatrist yet) to come with a pretty low-med intensity depression that comes and goes. sometimes it's so low-level that I'm functioning just fine, but it's not til I'm actually not depressed that I realize that I actually was depressed. I've been in one of my "funks" for a few months now. I go to work, I see my boyfriend, I see friends, but I only get minimally excited about BIG things (road trips, new purchases, etc). everything else just feels flat and even when I do get mildly excited about something, it is incredibly brief and fleeting, lasting only for a day or two. I guess I'm just wondering.... could this just be my ADHD or could it be something like depression? I like how I feel on stimulants and they help with my focus and lethargy, but it's just not lasting and sometimes even if I'm focused and have energy, I still feel completely adrift and just FLAT. is this what ADHD with depression can look like?

nbqt2015 [info] it was frightening to have been threatened with a hold every other week just because i am diagnosed with depression. admitting that i have diagnoses doesn’t warrant putting that kind of fear into people hearts unnecessarily. i’m blessed to have the kind of insurance that will allow me to see my shrink for free, other people don’t have that benefit and scaring them is cruel and counter-intuitive.

Teuthex [info] I've been diagnosed with Asperger's by a woman I only met once, after she spent hours on the phone with my mother, who also tried to make everyone believe that I was violent and abusive.I've been diagnosed with depression, and only avoided being prescribed medication after running out of the room and vanishing for a day or two, by a therapist who I had been seeing for 3-6 months against my will, in which the sessions consisted of me completely refusing to engage with her and telling her that I wasn't depressed. I'm assuming she came to this frame of mind through contact with my father and grandmother, though, to be fair, she could have just been exceptionally dense.I've been handcuffed by a policeman and taken from my apartment against my will to spend five days in the psychiatric ward of a hospital and eventually diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder due to my father convincing a court that I was suicidal, because I didn't return his calls for a week or two.In case it isn't obvious enough from my tone, I'm not even remotely any of those things; though, ironically enough, that last one led me right up to the brink of attempting suicide, and because of it I very fervently hope that I have a chance to end my life if I'm ever committed to a place like that again.

Dsiee [info] Man, It pains me to read things like this. Australia has inherited the same problem, i think.I haven't cried since i was 11 years old. I don't even know if i can anymore. I was diagnosed with depression at 16 and slowly improved when i went to university, but of course never cured. 8 years later I'm working and falling back down. I know i need to get better but i don't know that i can or should be bothered. Whenever i go to talk about it i just feel like a whining little bitch, which really doesn't help. I doubt my coworkers even 'believe' in mental illness.Fuck, sorry for the pity parade. I just need to vent. [info] None [info] 1536134068 [info] test
capsulet [info] 1. I was classified as gifted when I was 7 years old2. I don't know my subcategorization but my IQ at the time tested to be about 134. 3. I became depressed at the age of 15 and still struggle with it at the age of 20 (nearly 21).4. I did really well in school with little effort until my depression took over... Since then, my grades have suffered immensely.5. I've been diagnosed with depression, and both my primary care doctor and my psychologist want me to get tested for ADD as it's likely Ihave that as well.This is a really interesting point... I would love to see some kind of research on this or even help with any. This post gives me a weird sense of comfort-- my PCOS and my depression have been curses for me, but this kind of puts them together into a puzzle along with my gifted status, something that I'm really not sure has been a curse for me or not.

IVGreen [info] If you're having trouble budgeting it might be your brain and not your finances So basically the last 5 or so months I've been having a bitch of a time paying bills. I've been behind on everything, robbing Peter to pay Paul. I'd create a budget. Pay day would come. And in 48 hours I'd be looking at our bank balance to figure out how the shit did I not pay the bills but still have no money. Or it would be a few days til pay day and I'm digging for change in the car to buy milk and bread. Frantically refreshing the online banking app to see if the direct deposit is available yet. Basically totally financially screwed. Meanwhile, someone mentioned that my Facebook posts had gotten increasingly prosuicide and death. I always make jokes like that but in retrospect I reviewed the last 2 months of posts and basically other than news it's all suicide and death jokes. This same friend suggested I should talk to a doctor about depression. Now I have been diagnosed with depression in the past but it had been very manageable for a long while. And from my perspective I was doing really well. Anyway, I talked with my doc and she got me on appropriate medication. I mentioned the budgeting problem and she said that is a common problem that comes with depression. That was 2 weeks ago. Over the last week I was able to create a budget and stick to it. I have 1 more bill to pay for the week which I'll do later today. But after that I'll have a decent amount of money left over for random expenses. Now, I have an accounting degree and have the knowledge to budget and manage m finances but I just wasn't able to execute it properly. So if you don't know how to create a budget it's likely not a mental health issue that is causing your financial troubles. But since I know how to budget, should be able to budget and just couldn't get my shit together, I was glad to find out that it was health related. The worst part is that I realized that I should have been able to put away 500$ a month to savings. (Approximately 20% of our monthly income)Hope this helps someone in their financial and other life goals. **Tl;dr: couldn't make a budget work realized I was depressed. Got help and now I can pay my bills** [info] None [info] 1471073862 [info] test
for_tits_and_giggles [info] I'm not taking any meds right now. I was diagnosed with depression and for 5 years I tried different meds, but they never did shit. I finally just stopped taking them this summer. I'm not seeing a therapist right now because I went back to school, and I don't have a car or good insurance here. I mention the car part, because it's already close to impossible for me to force myself to get out of my room, much less bike 2 miles for an hour of therapy...I'm seriously considering going back home next semester and committing to some intensive therapy. I'm having trouble getting committed to that idea, though, because literally every story I've been told, heard, or read is exactly what you said: it took forever and a bajillion different combo of meds to figure out one that works. I instinctively resist the idea of meds now, probably because of my exclusively negative experiences so far. Also, I have to quit drugs to get the meds to work...at least that's what I'm told. I could do it if I knew the meds replacing drugs would actually work and make me feel better, but...That's fantastic that you found a combo that works for you, though! I'm jealous. I really do need meds. That was kind of the point of my post: eventually, I'm going to need to go through a bunch of therapy, psychiatry, etc.  and figure out a combo of meds that work, because I can't handle what I'm feeling right now and it's rendering me incapable of handling my life. I can't take care of myself...I can't *do* life like this lol. [info] heroin &amp; meth &lt;3 [info] 1415246027 [info] test
Slymsh [info] She left when I told her I was diagnosed with depression. Then she came back only to abuse me. She left for a job across the country when I told her we needed to support each other, then she started abusing me over the phone, and when I stopped answering her calls she came back to abuse me in person. I just told her not to contact me again and cancelled my proposal, then NC. [info] None [info] 1569059255 [info] test
saddyodaddyo [info] Advice for explaining mental health to my family? I (f/17) am currently struggling with my mental health. I have been diagnosed with depression from my doctor and currently take prescribed mood stabilizers. These past few months have been very difficult for me and I really haven’t been myself. I’ve been struggling with my final year in high school and it shows through my grades. I really improve my grades but with my mental state it is impossible. I’m not sure what I should do.

iAreMoot [info] Yep, still together. And I would say better off now. We’ve never ever talked about it however. My entire immediate family have been in therapy apart from me because I can’t afford it. The worst thing is I was diagnosed with depression and I told them this once. My mums first reaction was to say ‘good for you’, very sarcastically. A couple years later she’s having problems at work and is also diagnosed with depression, she called me up crying about it and it took every fibre in my body not to hang up on her.

raainly [info] Where/how do you start to get medical help? I'm a little lost on where to start to get help. I'm in high school; should I see my guidance counselor first? Should I see my doctor? Or should I go straight to a mental health professional? How would I go about bringing this up? "I've been feeling down for a while now..." And then what should I say next? I'm scared I might start crying while talking haha.. Would I have to tell my parents? If I am diagnosed with depression and put on medication, will they be informed of it?

nawal86 [info] &gt; Along with those wonderful (not) changes I started feeling something I thought I was over and done with a long time ago. I wanted a partner, a significant other.I've been diagnosed with depression again and given a prescription for antidepressants again, but this time I'm really hesitant to take it, because it'll probably make me want social contact and intimacy. I mean I already crave it, but at least my life feels sufficiently meaningless that I know there's no point to having friends and a lover - "they can't make me happy, I need to be happy by myself" sort of shit.If I start having the irrational feeling of hope again, then I'll have to start whoring my services as an emotional tampon again in the hope that one time out of ten people will actually have a use for me, and they'll still ignore me 9 times out of 10. So I don't really want to give up on my depression - it makes things easier on everybody. I don't have to put in any effort, and people who don't need an emotional tampon don't have to feel harangued to spend time with me. [info] None [info] 1572433676 [info] test
