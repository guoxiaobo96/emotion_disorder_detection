ReallyBadAtSpelling [info] Yeah no. I was diagnosed with depression-- by a psychiatrist, not "wow I'm sad a lot"-- and faced a shit ton of pressure to not only act like nothing was wrong, but to not open up about it to anyone.As long as I presented outwardly a strong, confident, MASCULINE persona, I was fine and accepted. People thought I knew what I was doing, rarely corrected me when I was wrong (or when I was right), and rarely challenged my interests or presence.However when I couldn't hold it together and got emotional I was treated as worthless, weak, and incapable of caring for myself. Hm, who in society has been typecast as weak, emotional, and incapable? TEH GRILS. I was quite literally viewed as feminine for exposing a side of myself that needed help. To anyone. Fuck, I can  still hear my mother's voice (sweet baby Zeus I swear I'm not Norman Bates) telling me that there was nothing wrong with me and getting angry that her boy was looking weak.Anyway, where was I?Oh right.I'm better now. I still rarely get questioned when talking about my area of expertise. I often get deferred to to provide leadership, even when I'm one of the youngest or least qualified people in a group, when I'm the only white guy in that group. Security guards still wave me through shoplifting alarms instead of eye me suspiciously. [info] self-hating male SJW [info] 1445878938
GanjaminDanklin [info] I feel terrible (Sorry for the super long post) I generally feel terrible. It all started back when I started to study the first time. Everyone around me were doing fine academically. I was doing terribly. I didn't understand a single thing we were working on and even though I tried my ass off to understand. I really worked for it, but I just couldn't wrap my head around any of it. When the finals came around I started having panic attacks on a daily basis and most of the time it was multiple times a day. I had talks with a educational psychologist and I was diagnosed with depression. We both ended up agreeing on the right course of action was to drop out and "find myself" to figure out the right path of education that was for me (Education is free here so yeah that helps). So I did. I started smoking after a couple of weeks into the education I dropped out from because I couldn't handle the stress and pressure.I ended up spending 5-6 months doing absolutely nothing. I slept until 3 in the afternoon everyday, and played videogames long into the night and just repeated that every day in those 5-6 months. For some that might sound so good and that I have nothing to complain about, but on the inside I just grew more and more tired of myself. I was running from any thought of responsibility. I was scared of anyone having requirements of me. I still am to be completely honest.I finally had enough of doing nothing and started on a "production-school" that we have here. We did some interesting projects and it was actually okay for a change. I still felt terribly about myself in secret, but it was a time where I didn't constantly think about how bad everything was for me when I was at school. But I still felt mentally drained when I came home so all I could muster to do with myself was sleep until dinner was ready, so a solid 2 hours or so. I was there for a year because that's the longest time they allow a student to be there since you don't get an education or anything for being there. It's strictly for people that doesn't know what they want to do in life.I left that school about 4 months ago and during the time from then till now I have actually tried to get a job, but no one wants to hire me since I have no experience in anything and I have no education at the age of 21. I am starting on an education that focuses on people who "aren't ready" for a regular education and I don't know how I feel about it yet. All I know is that for the last couple of years I have felt nothing but terribly about myself. I have on multiple occasions had to ask for money from my mother to pay for something as simple as my phone bill and that is not helping me feel better about myself. To be completely honest I have on so many occasions considered myself a waste of life. I have not considered suicide as some people do, since I still have some wonderful things in my life. I love my family and my friends to death. My friends are always there for me and they know how I feel so they are very supportive.So all in all, I still feel terrible all the time, but it's the worst at night. I can't seem to find the right place for me in this world and I kinda feel like I don't want to die, but I don't wan't to live either. Everything since my 18th birthday till now has only done bad things for me. I can't see where I am going. Everything ahead of me is in utter darkness. I have started multiple things and given up because I am not strong enough to handle the pain and stress that it brings. All my friends have regular jobs, girlfriends, apartments and is starting their adult lives and I still sit here in my dark hole with nothing to give me the slightest of happiness. I have kinda forgotten how it feels to be happy. I don't know anything anymore. Something that has also been beating my brain to pieces is that to live you need to work. You literally work to live and I can't seem to agree with that. Money control the way you live and if you don't get any money you're doomed. I just can't fathom how people does it and I don't want to be apart of it. I see that I have to, but I don't want to. I just don't know how to live. [info] None [info] 1571610904

Linkums [info] I was diagnosed with depression in high school.College wasn't easy. I started out majoring in Computer Science at a college four hours from home. I wanted to die pretty much every day. I went through a year of that and then decided to switch my major for the next fall semester to basically my home-made linguistics major with Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese. This was a bit easier, but my depression wasn't any better and I ended up leaving mid-semester because of it.The next spring, I took only a Japanese class at a college I could commute to. Then in the fall, I commuted to that college and majored in Japanese, once again a full time student. It was still really rough, but I had more support / motivation from living at home and for the last year or two, from my girlfriend. I'm also the sort of person that would let my own health fail completely before I would fail to meet responsibilities.I graduated in 2012 and I haven't gotten any better. I still don't have a "real" job because of depression and just make a small amount of money from giving Japanese lessons. Don't know where to go from here.My advice: Get as much work done ahead of time as you can when you feel up to it and don't try to think about everything at once. Get a friend or family member to help keep you going. [info] None [info] 1382922484

magnaswimgirl [info] When I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago, we realized that inactivity is what caused it to spike. I needed to be on antidepressants for a while, but I was partially prescribed them in order to give me the energy to get out and get moving. I'm still struggling with weight loss, but I've found that dragging my butt to the gym or even out on a walk on my worst days (now off the antidepressants), really does help. For me, at least, depression was all about self-hatred and feeling like I never could achieve anything. So there's a level of achievement of getting up and off my bed and rowing a couple thousand meters or taking a short walk.Good luck, keep your head up! [info]  [info] 1356477471
burn-after-use [info] Realized that for most of my childhood, I was “on my own” emotionally. I guess the title sums it up. I was always sensitive growing up and even still to this day. When I went to live with my aunt when I was 9, after my mom’s drug and drunken bullshit came to a head, it should’ve been expected that I’d develop even more emotional problems (being separated from mom, sister, and brother, AND having to deal with mom trying to guilt trip me into coming back).It hurts that no matter how obvious it was that I *needed fucking HELP* that all my attempts at talking about problems, shedding any amount of tears, hurting myself out of anger, etc were ignored. Or, I was treated as if I was trying to be manipulative, and I’d basically hear a list of reasons why I shouldn’t be sad, and if you’re sad because *this happened* at school, well, it’s your problem. You were the one being weird. It should be common sense that a 9yr old having to deal with CPS and getting removed from her home would be traumatic itself, yet every minor mistake I made (again. 9yrs old) was due to me having no common sense.I started getting bullied a lot the same year I left my mom’s, so I’d go to school and get it. I’d go home and get it. The only time I got to talk to someone about my issues was the school guidance counselor when my teacher would hastily make appointment after appointment for me after every attempt at telling her about the bullies. They never got any punishment for it, by the way. I told guidance counselor about my situation with my mom but didn’t say anything about how my aunt treated me. I never mentioned how if I lost a training bra I’d get slapped into the next room. I never talked about the sneers and snide remarks I’d get when I even mentioned being sad/upset/depressed. I never talked about the screaming. I never talked about how badly I was scared to cry because I knew my aunt would be mad at me for it. I was told that CPS would’ve put me with a whole different family if it weren’t for my aunt.So naturally, by middle school, the girl who was never given the time of day to learn how to healthily cope with emotion and stress found ways to cope unhealthily; through self harm and self hate. Granted I’ve bitten myself out of anger since before I can remember but that switched to cutting and scratching. I also eventually concluded that if this many people hate me; my family and dozens of classmates, maybe *i’m* the problem, and a bad person. Maybe people could smell that this 7th grader with average to decent grades, zero suspensions, and wouldn’t hurt a fly would somehow be another incarnation of Hitler. Maybe I did something wrong and just didn’t know it. With that being said I also have always had an overwhelming desire for justice, so maybe I deserved it. I started to believe that showing my emotions are always gonna be manipulative, and I just shouldn’t do that.I’m gonna cut the story short and skip the minor details from this point; I was diagnosed with depression at 15, of course auntie didn’t believe it. I was able to get therapy for a year (till auntie decided that therapy wasn’t helping me, when it was, and I told her this.) when I was around 18 I kept needing to switch antidepressants until eventually I gave up on them anyway because of both insurance issues and the fact that they weren’t helping. I still live with my aunt since I really can’t move out just yet. Surprisingly, the physical abuse tapered as I went into my teens, but I was still pretty neglected emotionally, and even had to rely on myself for sanitary pads out of fear that I didn’t ask my aunt “in time” and I’d get yelled at. A few times I had to cut up a diaper and wear that as a pad because I was so terrified of asking my aunt to get me pads. Thank god for my dad occasionally lending me a few dollars, and the dollar store.It’s just that now I’m 20 and my emotional insecurity has gotten far worse. I used to bury it all as a kid, but now, I just can’t take being life’s punching bag anymore. I was stronger as a kid than I am an adult, and it feels so pathetic. I’m starting to think that maybe life doesn’t get better and all of that “it gets better! :)” talk is simply anti-suicide propaganda to help therapists rake in more money. Can’t profit off a patient who already set themselves free.I have such an amazing boyfriend and regrettably I sometimes take my frustration out on him. Never physical but I have shouted and ignored him out of anger. I feel like I don’t even deserve him, and honestly I probably don’t. He’s been the only stable minded person who listens and takes the time to comfort me, but I hate being someone who has to be taken care of. It’s not fair for him.So that’s pretty much has been what’s on my mind lately. I don’t really know how else I should conclude. [info] always anxious [info] 1581861938

CaptainYid [info] AITA - For not wanting to do anything for my birthday? I'll try be elaborate on what is probably the most boring post on here...So every year, I tend to not actually care about my birthday and Christmas. To the point where I'd just as happy being at work than being at home on these days. Even as a kid it meant little to nothing to me.But nearly 3 years ago, my mum died the day after my birthday. And since then, both Christmas and my birthday  mean even less to me. To the point I only do stuff for other people.Which brings me to my current issue. This year I'm 30. Something my sister and my girlfriend all insist is a birthday I need to do something big for. I however, just want to stay in bed all day. Now bare in mind, I don't drink or do any drugs. So partying isn't my thing. They're trying to compromise and just go out for dinner, which again, I'd rather just stay in bed.So judgemental people of Reddit... Am I the arsehole for not wanting to go out or do anything for my 30th birthday?Edit - just a few things here...I know that everyone around me is just trying to get me out and have fun. It's all coming from a good place.I do work shifts so anytime I get at home with nothing to do I like to just chill and do nothing.Few people have mentioned it, I have been diagnosed with depression too. But even before that diagnosis I felt the same if it helps?With certain spelling i'm sure people have picked up that I'm English.

Scarlet-Ladder [info] I should probably go back to a therapist, you're right. I saw one fairly recently for issues unrelated to the depression. The only problem is I was using her for a psych evaluation for other treatment I need. I only saw her in order for her to say 'Your mental health is fine' to other clinicians. If I am diagnosed with depression again, the chances of getting the treatment go down considerably. All I really want to do is curl up and sleep, but I know that isn't an option here. I really need help, but I'm having to choose between the physical medical treatment I need, or mental treatment that would delay it. I suppose I have to pick the lesser of two evils.

figurehead00 [info] About to be fired again because I’m just too stupid and incompetent. Okay, this is my first post here and maybe I just need to vent, I hope that’s okay.    I’m 34 years old and I don’t think I’ve ever done anything right in my entire life. I was diagnosed with depression in high school and have always struggled with it, though I was just diagnosed by a PCP, never seen a psychiatrist.    Years back I got laid off from a factory job that made me miserable, so I decided to get an office job. I was so happy to have a “normal person” job, but I was just too stupid to figure it out. Everyone else learned it no problem but I was always behind, no matter how much they tried to help me I couldn’t make my numbers, constantly made mistakes, and eventually they fired me.    So then I got my current office job. Okay, this time it’s going to be different. A fresh start. I’m going to focus, ask questions, and learn it inside and out. I thought it was a perfect fit. Now a couple years later and I’m about to be fired again. I kept getting more and more work, I was totally overwhelmed and couldn’t figure out how to get it all done, and got really behind. Then last week I got an awful kidney stone and had to be out most of the week. While I was gone they discovered my secret. I was behind, unorganized, couldn’t keep track of things, I was a mess, I was letting everyone down. Everyone knew. It was confirmed my coworkers don’t like me. My boss has all but told me I’ll be fired next week.    I just don’t understand why I can’t be a normal person. I come across as fairly well spoken and intelligent, but I ALWAYS screw it up. I ALWAYS let everyone down. I have no skills, no talents, no strengths, nothing. Nothing to offer anyone. Always been single, my roommate is moving out so soon I’ll live alone. My worthless brain can’t even keep a low paying entry level job.    You know Imposter Syndrome? Where you feel like everyone else knows what they’re doing but you and eventually they’ll find out you don’t belong? Well usually that’s just in your head, but I keep being proven right and people keep finding out.    Once I lose this job I have no idea what I’ll do. It’s being proven over and over again that there’s nothing I’m smart enough or competent enough to be able to do.    This, along with everything else, has sent me into an intense and scary depression cycle. I hate myself. I can’t stand even a second of silence. I have to keep either a video or podcast of my favorite internet people (Giant Bomb, a video game site) going constantly or I just break down into tears. I just want to be a normal person and not this worthless, terminally incompetent idiot who’s afraid literally every second of every day.     Sorry this was so long. If you read it all that really means a lot to me. I guess I just needed this really bad today.Edit: I’ve never been a cryer, but the tag line to this sub is making me choke up every time I read it.

Slappers_only007 [info] Can you have low TSH and have hypothyroidism? Got some blood work done last week due to fatigue. I have had chronic fatigue for as long as I can remember (10+ years), but my bloodwork has always been normal. I was diagnosed with depression at age 12 so I've always attributed it to that, but I've had a sneaking suspicion that my thyroid wasn't working properly (especially since my mom has hypothyroidism and I grew up watching her go through the symptoms).The results? TSH 0.411, indicating hyperthyroidism. I have no symptoms of hyperthyroidism and all of the symptoms of hypothyroidism- fatigue, headaches, cold sensitivity,  decreased libido, dry skin, weight gain, constipation...I could go on. Reading the list of symptoms is like reading my diary. Also, if it helps, I fasted before the test.The other result of my bloodwork is that I have high cholesterol (286 overall, 210 LDL). I am a 28 F with no family history and a fairly healthy diet. I have read that hypothyroidism can raise your cholesterol as well.What do you think? Any advice is appreciated! I have a follow up appt with my GP on Monday and I want to go in asking all the right questions. Thanks!Update: Thank you for all of your advice.

Hamza78ch11 [info] I wish I had straight A's, was incredibly good looking and a million other things, but wishing doesn't mean anything. You have to fight for the things that you want. Two years ago I was diagnosed with depression. It's been a struggle. But I'm finally at a good place in my life. I don't need drugs and I'm not constantly breaking down. I still think about death a lot but it gets better. I still don't want to be alive sometimes but the number of days that I want to live is starting to outnumber the amount of times I don't. Im haggard and weary and just bone tired but that's because being pre-med is tough and not because I haven't slept in 72 hours because for the first time in years I'm sleeping and eating like a normal person. I'm fighting my way through my anorexia and because I love my mom and she packs me a sandwich to take with me to Uni I make sure that I eat that at least and dinner. I'm getting to the point where I don't cringe when I look in the mirror anymore and because I'm going to the gym regularly sometimes, when I'm all alone and I know no one is near me, I even flex in the mirror and pose for myself. People have always, my entire life told me that they like how confident and outspoken and well articulated I am but for the first time I'm starting to feel that way on the inside too. I don't feel Insecure all the time either.I'm trying my absolute hardest to be a good older brother and a good son and a good friend and I think I'm doing a good job. I don't have a lot of time to spend with my younger siblings but I try to make the most of it when I can. I was neglecting my little sister all week because I have to study so this morning we went and got pizza so we could have our brother sister time. My little brother and I spent all afternoon working on our car, male bonding time.I have a B in physics which sucks but I know I can bring it up, on the other hand I have an A in biochemistry and Cell and Molecular Biology even thought most people are struggling with those. I'm keeping up a 3.8 even if just barely. Applying to med school is scary, and I don't know how to find those clinical shadowing hours because they just don't fit in my schedule, but I'm doing research in a lab and I just expressed a protein on my own for the first time! I know that I'm not the best looking guy out there. But I'm not constantly calling myself ugly anymore either. I'm learning to be nice to myself. No girl has ever "wanted" me but that's okay, one day it'll happen. I know I'll never be the kind of boy that makes heads turn, but I know that I'll try my best to be the absolute best husband I can ever be. I've never been in a relationship and that's because of the whole no girl ever wanting me thing but also the fact that my religion doesn't allow that. That's okay, it's my choice and I have accepted it for what it is. I'm okay with an arranged marriage. It worked for my parents! The point is, I'm fighting my way out. I might still get depressed sometimes but I'm doing better and I'm hoping I'm better every single day than I was the day before. I won't ever let those thoughts win. I won't ever let them back into my head again, that sanctuary belongs to me and to me alone. I might wish to have all A's but that doesn't mean anything until I put in the effort for it. I might want to be ridiculously good looking and I know I'm not and I know I won't be, but I can still have nice hair and trim my beard well and wear good clothes and shower and overall make an effort to be presentable. I will be happy you guys. I will be. Come December, I will have straight A's. Come June I will destroy the MCAT, I will have the absolute greatest personal statement the any American med school has ever seen. I will have these things because I earned them. Because I worked for them. I will never wallow in self pity again. I will always remember that it's not as bleak as it looks and that the power to make things better rests within me. I am strong, I am smart, I will not lose to the black thoughts that live within me. [info] None [info] 1475994196
Flybirdieee [info] I’ve never been this depressed. Merry fucking Christmas to me It's been over four months now, since he ended it. Last month I was feeling a bit better, but lately I've been struggling with an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness. I'm so depressed. I was diagnosed with depression about 6 years ago but I’d been so happy the past few years I went off my meds and everything. Then he did this. I never want to do anything. I am so, so lonely, and yet, I keep isolating myself. I am not even going home for Christmas because I can’t be around people, even though I LOVE my family... I just don't want to spend time with anyone. I just can’t. I miss him. It hurts in my bones. I just want to lay under the covers in my shitty new studio apartment, with the covers over my head, and just close my eyes. I don't know how I could ever be happy again. I downloaded some dating apps and I get all sorts of guys matching with me, and instead of making me feel better, like I thought it would, it just made me more miserable, because how could anyone compare to him? He was perfect in my eyes. He was everything to me. Some days, he still is. [info] None [info] 1576797472
MCLCP3 [info] I want to have sex with the villager from Minecraft. There is something about their sweet, sultry voice that turns me on to no end. I constantly fantasize about using their long, phallic noses as a dildo and ramming it right up my ass into my little prostate. I like to think that the villagers can use their noses as anal probes. I bet when they get horny that their noses inflate and get rock hard to shove right into my little boipussy. I think the new Minecraft villager textures are sexy af. The farmer's short sleeves reveal their strong, well-built muscles and make me even hornier for their tasty villager cock. I have a custom made villager body pillow. I sewed on a big, brown dragon dildo where the nose should be so I can ride it whenever I'm feelin frisky. It is so crusty that it stands up on its own. I had a fantasy last night about the farmer villager pinning me down on his pressure plate table and rammed his rock hard pulsating nose into my ass and straight into my prostate. It felt so real I really wish it was... I have been on several gay dating sites and have tried to get other homosexual men to roleplay as the villager from Minecraft. So far no one has been able to sate my desires and it makes me very angry. Please, Reddit, if anyone out here would like to RP as a villager from Minecraft, I would love to get in touch :)FUCK I WISH VILLAGERS WERE REAL. I have been diagnosed with depression and ADHD and I know it's because I'll never get a long, lustrous villager cock rammed up my tight holes. I hope someday in the future when technology is so advanced that we can transport our conscious into the internet, that I will finally be able to achieve my dreams and have a strong, bulky villager ram his rock hard nose into my ass. Please, PLEASE OH PLEASE ELON MUSK MAKE THIS HAPPEN. If I have to go another DAY without a villager ramming his greasy rock hard nose into my ass I AM GOING TO SCREAM. I WILL HURT PEOPLE. I WILL HURT MYSELF. ELON PLEASE I NEED THIS RIGHT NOW. [info] None [info] 1567531407
dinosaregaylikeme [info] I was asked to talk about the death of my mother. So I decided to share the story of how domestic violence and abuse can kill and destroy lives. Well first thing first, I was born in South California. I was an only child to a family of Catholic Italian immigrants. Both my mother and father had family in America and decided to come here to get married. Then they had me in their early 20s. I was given an old name for first born sons.I have some memories before my mother was killed. I remember my father drinking. I remember finding beer cans by his armchair. I remember my mother trying to shield me from the violence. I remember daycare at the Catholic church. I remember how kind and loving my mother was. I remember the Italian lullabies she would sing to me while she put me to bed. My father was rarely home, when he was home he was always angry at something.I was four when my father murdered my mother in domestic violence. I remember my mom tucking me into bed and saying "I love you. Be good.". I remember hearing shouting and screaming, but it was louder this time. Really really loud. I remember getting up and looking for my mom.I know I saw my mom being murder. But I don't remember it. I know my dad saw me and tried to kill men,  but I don't remember it. I know a police officer grabbed me before my father could kill me, but I don't remember it. The next clear memory I have is sitting in the passager seat next to a police women. She was the same age as mother but was white with blonde hair. I was wearing a jacket, and I think it was her jacket.Then the memories start to blur. I have no memories of the trials. I later learned that my father avoided death row by not killing me. If I was dead, he would of been sent to death row. I have no more memories until I was six years old. I was at school, looking at the clock and a sort of reality wave hit me. A sort of feeling of "I am alive and existing" type of feeling. I wounded up in the state of Arizona and had a long road ahead of me. I was abused in foster care. The foster parents neglected me. The kids in school mocked me for having no parents and slight homosexual tendencies. I was always *that* foster kid. Always getting blamed for stuff. Always in fights. Always going from foster house to foster house.I ran away a lot. I could be gone for weeks and even months. I was 12 when a set of foster parents drugged and raped me. It went on for months until I spoke up. But men don't get raped. And I was a no good foster kid just causing trouble for a set of good Christian folks. I remember those folks use to show me off at church like a toy poodle to brag about the good deeds they are doing for the lord.I got moved to a new home. Those homosexual tendencies grew more and more until I had a secret to hide. I ran away for good before my 18th birthday. Hitchhiked from Arizona to Hollywood, California. Learn to accept my gayness and embrace it with strings of one night stands.In reality I was running. I tried to bury my grief with loveless sex, sometimes drugs, and a box cutter to my arms and thighs. I stopped running when I was about 21 and finally put a gun to my head. My neighbor heard the gun shot and called 911. I woke up the hospital with my right side of my skull shatter and a hell of a headache. After recovering I was sent to rehab and that was when I discover the magic of therapy.I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD. I had to learn to stop running and finally start the grief process.And about 6 months later I met a guy at a gay BDSM sex club. We had a one night stand and we fell in love. I was so scared of love because of what my father did to my mother. This guy had to teach me how to love and accept people.We moved in with each other soon after. And soon after that all the bathroom doors came off and anything sharp had to get thrown out. I wanted to learn how to stop hurting myself and start healing myself.During all of this I kept getting letters from my father. They always got set on fire in the kitchen sink. I would get calls from prison and I always had to deny them. I told my father's counselor/case worker that I am getting those letters but I am denying them.And about a year later, I was in a better place. My ptsd was almost gone, depression under control, relationship was strong and we were so in love, and I was feeling love and happy. I was expressing love and happiness. I made better friends. Became a better person.And then the prison called telling me my father was dead. They wanted to know if I wanted him cremated or in a casket. When I would pick him up. And since my family was Catholic and Catholic don't like being cremated. I had my dad cremated. And my boyfriend and I set off to get the bag of ashes. We made a pit stop at Michaels to get a cheap box to put him in.My boyfriend let me go alone to the prison because I needed to be alone. My father's case worker told me that he was seeking my forgiveness. He had a moment of God and wanted a relationship with me. The other inmates found out he was a wife beater and almost child killer and isolated him. Some got more into it and bullied him and sometimes raped him.I still had no remorse. I hate that man and still hate him. The inmates did too and all wanted a word with me the second I came in. I was relieved to hear the inmates telling me that look like my mother and carry the same graceful look in my eyes that my father talked about. My husband and I drove back to Arizona. Stopped in the middle of nowhere, dug a hole, dropped the box in, and set the hole on fire. I embraced the feeling of finally being free from him.Overnight my fears went away. My depression went away. My PTSD went away because it didn't have any fears to live off. I slept better at night. No more nightmares.And in the last eight years, I got married to the love of my life. We adopted a teenager out of foster care. I learn to speak up about what happened so others can learn from it.I am only one of the millions of kids that lived with domestic violence. Most of these kids will be in an abusive relationship. I was in one. I had a boyfriend that threaten to rape me when I broke up with him. I had a friend sock his jaw in for me so I can be left alone.About two women die everyday from domestic violence. I always wonder who was the 2nd women that died the same day my mom did. 3 out of 5 women will experience domestic abuse in their lifetime. The statistics for men are still not accurate because men are only now finally coming out and admitting that domestic violence happens to them as well.If you see something please speak up. You could be saving someone life. Sorry if the grammer is a bit wishy washy. I was crying while writing some of this. It happens when I miss my mom.And don't be scared to ask about anything. The more something is talked about, the less taboo the subject is. [info] None [info] 1522734274
w4nn4_8e_sk1nny [info] Recovery Guys...Like, I've been to a psychiatrist, I've been diagnosed with depression and I'm taking prescription antidepressants.I'm taking it seriously (and I'm actually surprised myself) and I'm visiting my new psycho-therapy expert next Wednesday to treat my bulimia. The thing is, even though my antidepressants make my mood mostly normal and I actually sleep at night for once, I also caught myself multiple times emotionally eating. I am not able to stop it. It just happens and of course I abuse laxatives and purge afterwards, even though at this point it's so fucking weird, cause I see myself in the mirror (I've gained weight because of this) and actually don't give a single emotional fuck about what I see, but something inside makes me think about how fat I am and then purge. But I religiously just don't give a single fuck about how I look.I have no idea what's happening.Does anyone have an experience like this? [info] None [info] 1557665673
rainfallrose [info] Yes, it is **extremely** annoying and closeminded. I've told one boss who proceeded to tell me that I didn't "look" autistic, saying I was too "pretty, attractive, and pleasant". As if you can tell autism by looks and autistic people can't be attractive or pleasant. Another boss told me that I was so "competent and smart", as if autistic people are all incompetent/stupid? It seems petty, but being what people deem "objectively attractive" makes it harder because I have to try so much to fit this exterior image of pretty, smart, nice girl when I actually have struggled with autism my whole life. It's the same with depression too. I was diagnosed with depression and people couldn't believe it because I wasn't "crazy, unkempt, unattractive" whatever stereotypes people have about those with a mental illness.

Cingetorix [info] I was diagnosed with depression eight months ago and am currently on anti-depressants. I checked "yes" on my application and also included a doctor's note that explains the reasons for my treatment as well as my current situation (stable). I also included a personal statement as to why I needed them and also explained that there is a doctor's note attached to my app. I'm currently in the process of getting my RPAL and so far it seems like I'm going to get it as my references were recently called, so I wouldn't worry about it unless you've got a history of suicide attempts or self-harm - which you say you don't have. It may lead to a longer processing time as the CFO or RCMP may give you a call (I haven't gotten any, yet) to make sure you're not a danger to yourself or others. Personally, I needed them for a while to stabilize my mood, and thanks to them I feel fantastic and like myself (best I've ever felt, really) and very happy so in my case, I think I'm good to go. If you feel fine without them, and have references that can vouch for your well-being, you shouldn't have any issues.  [info] Tacticool whore [info] 1465698576
jasminaaa03 [info] Ik, that's why I wanted to ask for others opinions. My parents are not supportive of mental health, they don't believe in it, I was diagnosed with depression by my school psychologist that I started seeing recently.

I'm planning on speaking to the psychologist again to ask her. [info] None [info] 1556994267

jackmeawf [info] How can I stay consistent in my career with depression? I really need some advice on this situation. I cannot stay consistent in my work and attendance. I am diagnosed with depression and have been on Zoloft since August, and it worked great at first. In the past few weeks I increased my dose to 75 mg but it hasn't helped. I am supposed to graduate with my bachelor's this month, but I have missed so many classes and my assignments have mostly been turned in late or of really poor quality, even though I love what I do and have great ideas initially. I can't follow through and neglect all of my work that's due on days my depression hits and I can't bring myself to care enough to get out of bed and complete anything. I write lists of things that are due, write out a schedule, complete maybe a few days of it, then just completely stop because I don't care enough.  I dont think I can use any of my professors as job references when I graduate because I've been so inconsistent. I'm ashamed of the work i've turned in and how it reflects on me. I lack serious follow through and I don't know how to fix it. I'm not going to be able to hold a full time job like this, I can't even attend my classes 3x a week. I had an internship that I quit halfway through. Long story short, after talking with my school's career center I was allowed to get credit for it still because the work they were having me complete unpaid was illegal. They are no longer allowed to list their internships at my school. Despite this, I just got my eval from them and it's a 25/50. I feel so ashamed, I know I can and need to do better than this but I don't know how to care enough to stay consistent. I used to get great grades and great reviews from employers and now my work ethic and discipline is so inconsistent. Today I haven't gotten out of bed or eaten. I don't know what to do and I really need some advice on how to turn this around. [info] None [info] 1575857651
SortedN2Slytherin [info] I feel the same way you do.  I have been diagnosed with depression and am an introvert.  I have to force myself to get up and interact with people, and got a second social job (Starbucks) on weekends as a means of forcing myself to get out there.  I go to the gym nearly every day after work and feel good, but once the endorphin high wears off, I am back to feeling very meh and sometimes hopeless.  I benefit from seeing a therapist because 1) I like having a completely unbiased 3rd party to talk things out with, and 2) because she is trained to see things in a way my friends and family are not.  Give it a try, maybe 3-5 sessions.  You may have more to work through than you realize.  If not, so be it.  I hope you don't feel the need to apologize for who you are, because I don't think anyone ever should.  Unless they're blatantly offensive assholes.  But living with depression is not something you owe anyone an apology or explanation for.Good luck. [info] None [info] 1503940018

Xalthanal [info] You might be confusing diagnosis with the insurance billing protocol. In the US, even if a professional can't technically "diagnose" you with something, they have to have a code for what you are being seen for so they can bill insurances. These are called "diagnosis codes" but they don't always mean that you are medically diagnosed. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 18 but my therapist used the depression code in billing for years before. Yes the system sucks. [info] None [info] 1549999354

HypertextMakeoutLang [info] my doctor wants me to get retested, and I'm not sure what to make of it given previous tests Obligatory i'm not tryina have you guys diagnose me.        I've been chronically fatigued / have had EDS since 2013. I had a PSG done in 2013 and was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea and my REM Latency was 153 minutes. I adjusted fine to CPAP but could not for the life of me get better. In 2014 I was diagnosed with depression and went on antidepressants, got the depression under control, and again the fatigue and sleepiness never got better.        At the end of 2015 while on 250mg of Seroquel, i had another PSG and this time an MSLT to go along with it. During the PSG my REM latency was 194 minutes, but we did the MSLT anyway because I wasn't having apneas. I only fell asleep during the first of the five naps, and my sleep latency was 4 minutes. There's a dash over REM latency, so I guess i never hit it. Narcolepsy was ruled out.        I was never a big napper, usually I just had to get horizontal in the afternoons, but in 2016 I found i was napping more. Towards the end of the year it became two times a day. Now that I think of it, maybe it was because I'd switched from Seroquel to Cymbalta? In 2017 I realized I was gluten and dairy intolerant, and that cut it down to one nap per day, and I switched to Effexor, which I now take at night, but I'm still exhausted all the time.        I started going through the process of getting diagnosed with CFS towards the end of last year, and the new sleep specialist I'm seeing wants me to get another MSLT because I was on Seroquel last time. Obviously he wants me to be off Effexor for it, which will be a pain in the ass.        My question is, if 5 years ago while fatigued with EDS and not on any AD's and my REM latency was 150 minutes, how could I possibly have had narcolepsy all this time? Wouldn't it have shown there if  i was already so tired during the day? I guess it's possible that I could have developed narcolepsy along the way and had/have another problem? But idk...

freethenipple23 [info] Therapy and medication!I was diagnosed with depression when I was 9 and grew up in a poor and abusive household so I didn't have the resources or support to get help.After getting beaten up, cheated on numerous times, and knocked up against my will by my ex at the age of 16, I decided (finally) that enough was enough. I reached out to a social worker at my school and began going for counseling-- I wasn't afraid of being taken away from my family anymore. Once I got my license and had regular access to a car, I made an appointment with a psychiatrist and was able to get prescribed medication. The medication helped a lot, but I wasn't able to afford therapy until four months ago. With the combination of the two, I'd like to think that now, I'm doing a lot better. I still struggle but I've got better support now thanks to my boyfriend and having a job that can support me financially. Im still trying to figure out who *I* am and what it is that I like to do, but I'm still young and now I've actually got the resources to discover myself. [info] None [info] 1528039468
CooperArt [info] :) It's a good one! I want to get to a point where I'm not punished for when my conditions do rear their head, but I'm treated well enough that they don't rear their head that often. That'd be a good medium, in my opinion.The handwriting is important to me because I want to be a teacher, and I can theoretically keep dodging handwriting--bring my laptop in and the like--and I've had several teachers with bloody awful handwriting, but I'd to just see if I can fix it. And I agree on the "old enough" part, because I was diagnosed with depression once before and given antidepressants, right before they started deciding not to give them to children. (I might have even experienced the suicidal side effect that caused them to be more hesitant giving antidepressants to kids.) Mom never explained why I had the pills, and what they were supposed to do. Then took them away when I "wasn't taking them seriously enough."My childhood is a series of "what ifs" that I've, thankfully, stopped entertaining constantly. (Once in a blue moon.)

TheTroubledChild [info] It won't get any better than this Hear me out. My life was fantastic and came with many privileges. My childhood was nearly perfect, my family was big and loving, I grew up travelling etc. Even when I was diagnosed with depression later, it was okay, it was hard many many times, but I've been lucky to always have supporting company. I've always been an passionate artist and even had my own exhibitions from a young age.But then I was diagnosed with MS. This is 10 years ago and I realized, it can only go downhill from now on. Even when I am getting good medication, this illness makes me so tired. I am extremely sleepy and exhausted 24/7. Mixed with depression, I lie in bed the whole day. Just taking a shower is like running a marathon. I don't feel like doing anything, nothing holds any joy anymore. I don't care for art anymore, I don't care for Friends anymore, I won't find anyone to love me "like this", and I won't be able to find or let alone HOLD a job anymore. I'm a university student who is close to finishing (that means if I graduate at all, because I am too sleepy and exhausted to do shit). I can't see a future with any dignity for me. With the condition I have and how it is worsening, I feel like it's impossible to think of a happy ending. My life was amazing, but from here it can only go downhill. All I can see for myself is crippling depts, living on wellfare and foodstamps because my illness shows good signs that I'll need a wheelchair in a few years, dying alone, selling all I own. No matter who I am talking to, people are just as helpless to come up with any hopeful ideas as I do. MS can't be cured, it can only make things worse. It is already slurring my speech and affecting my brain a lot, which is scary asf. I often fail to feel or use certain limbs. Wouldn't it be better to go now, with a smile, knowing that my life was a dream - than waiting until my illness finishes me off and I am dying in poverty and being miserable? I see no light at the end of this tunnel. [info] None [info] 1535206069

Bubbly_Taro [info] How do you know if you are depressed and not lazy? So I was diagnosed with depression about 10 years ago and I have been in mental hospitals several times and tried various types of medications.I also had counseling up until fairly recently and we talked ad nauseam about the things I need to do to improve my condition. Exercise, better diet, going outside, socializing with other people, the usual stuff.I have a profound understanding about what I need to do to get better but I cannot bring myself to adhere to these ideas so I am wondering if I am not just incredibly lazy instead of depressed and that my poor state of mind stems from inaction and reclusion.

Sakazuki27 [info] How should I approach going to vacation with a friend? I have a friend who is on a completely different level of awareness, he doesn't bother about spirituality and lifes an instagram life. He is one of my only friends and we were planning on going to vacation for a few days. I'm unsure if I should really go with him because of the distance I feel towards him. He doesn't know how I feel. And on Monday I was diagnosed with depression coming from the huge shift in my consciousness lately. It's a bit too much for me to handle so I'm very introverted during this phase, I process a lot. Like I'm in a cocoon. I feel like a vacation would help me recharge myself but I don't want to be a burden for his vacation. But I want to go with him since he is the only one I could imagine going with right now. He's pretty chill but I don't know how to communicate how I feel lately. I even thought about cancelling but wouldn't that be a missed opportunity to get out of my routine? I didn't go for vacation in 3 year and I feel like I need it. Any advice? Also what generall advice would you give me if I do go, like what's a good way to recharge? It would be a hotel at the beach with a lot of tourists there. I apologize for my ignorance but I recently started exploring myself and what I need, so I'm looking for guidelines.

alittlebirdy_toldme [info] I agree wholeheartedly. I was diagnosed with depression, and I've told my best friend to shame me into taking a shower because that was the only thing to get me out of bed. Made me feel like shit, being gross and having people tell me, but it worked. I am now a regular showerer! [info] None [info] 1530848843
drewisawesome14 [info] I'm currently Military. I was diagnosed with depression but they ignored it at the recruiters and here I am. I don't recommend the military though. Because what the military does is puts you in even more stressful situations that will bring out the very demon inside of you. I know it hurts. PM me if you would like.  [info] None [info] 1430116294
Gideon_Drake [info] Jesus.  I know exactly how you feel - I was diagnosed with depression about 6 months ago after dealing with it for years.  I don't know if you are medicated for it, but I can't tell you how much it changed my life.  But enough about that, I need you to know how incredible it is that you managed this.  I couldn't manage what you did, and I can only imagine how much strength and determination you must have to be able to do this.  Congratulations on making good decisions and for being such a strong person - I don't know that I could do what you did today if I wasn't on my medication. [info]  [info] 1429132409
The_Lost_King [info] Dude, I don’t know where you got the idea that just because I said that you’ve never dealt with depression means I am talking about myself. Since you intend to bring me in on this though, yes, I have been diagnosed with depression, but honestly I’m in the best point in my life I’ve ever been despite not filling the prescription of my antidepressants. I really need to get my ADHD meds, but I’m fine other than that. You really are more of a piece of shit than I gave you credit for though with diagnosing me with all that crap just because I’m a gamer, but if you must know, I did well in Highschool and have almost graduated college just fine. I get physical activity at my job, but yes I should do more. My diet isn’t as bad as you’ve implied, but I do definitely need to change it. My goal is to coast through life because I live for the simple pleasures of reading books/manga, playing games, hanging with friends, and maybe creating a table top rpg or two. Now we were talking about my fiancée. She does well in school, watches her diet carefully, exercises frequently, is well supported by me and her family and friends and is pursuing happiness as much as you can as someone in their early 20s who has to work through school doing shitty jobs no one else wants to do because you don’t have the schooling necessary to do a job you want to do. And yet she is still horribly depressed and you refuse to acknowledge that because you’re just an asshole that makes quick value judgements on tiny pieces of information.

frauleinlurker [info] I was diagnosed with depression about a decade ago but stopped taking an SSRI after about 3 years. My migraines had gotten really bad and I was concerned about developing serotonin syndrome. I decided to work with a therapist instead. To this day I’m still not on an anti depressant.

Josh_Dangit [info] I was diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder. **Extensive** therapy has helped me manage and predict my depression, as well as recognize the symptoms of my BPD. I know when I’m being irrational, and I actively work towards correcting it.  [info] None [info] 1519905275
DreamSteel [info] Any time. I've been diagnosed with depression for almost 10 years now so I know how draining it can be. It's not easy to shake. For me I will say the best thing I can do if I can muster the strength is to get my fresh fruit and maybe some cottage cheese. I'm not sure why it just helps pull me a little bit out of that funk.

Polskihammer [info] Does anyone else sleep in the middle of the day for like 2 hours? I really hate this, I go to work 7am and get out 330pm, when i get home i sleep until maybe 5 or 6. When i do wake up I feel just as exhausted as in the morning. Is this a pattern I can break. I've been diagnosed with depression and take zoloft if that matters. [info] None [info] 1463698399
L4Deader [info] The most dramatic life I've ever had, a.k.a. The Incredible Life of Sarah Zaher First of all, I want to clarify that is is a **very** long read, as it is a full event log covering the whole life of my character. I feel like every little event in her life mattered. Second, it didn't actually happen in BitLife, but in InstLife. However, I know that the BitLife team has acquired the rights to InstLife, and the InstLife subreddit doesn't seem to be official, and it's also private on top of that, so I felt like posting here would be a better option. Please forgive me if you don't think it was appropriate. Third, a little backstory. I'd had some bad luck with my previous characters, so when I got to Sarah, I decided to go all out and play as a crazy rebellious gal set on the path of violence and crime. However, some things happened that made my jaw drop and by the end of it I was on the verge of tears. I'm totally sure you could make a movie out of this. I must also clarify beforehand that I'm Russian and I did, in fact, bring some of my language into this by naming some stuff in Russian transliteration. I will explain the meaning and significance of Russian stuff at the end. I also warn you that some of those "custom names" contain silly horny things and language. I'm not sure if this warrants an NSFW tag, but, seeing as there are posts about porn stars, I'm probably good? Feel free to correct me! With that said, let's begin our journey into the life of Sarah Zaher. I will never forget her.&gt;0 Years Old  &gt;  &gt;You were born a female, in Egypt.  &gt;  &gt;Your name is Sarah Zaher.  &gt;  &gt;You are the daughter of:  &gt;  &gt;Beni Zaher (Father), 50.  &gt;

Congratulations! I hope you enjoyed it. Now, let's get to some explanations. Sarah's rap brand name, Zaher Ya Otsidela, is a silly play on her surname. Thing is, there's the word "хер" in Russian, pronounced as... well, about the same way you would pronounce the "Her" in "Heracles". It's transliterated as "her" as well. It basically means "dick", but it's a lot more tame than the more famous "хуй" ("hui"). Sarah's surname, Zaher, can be interpreted as "why the heck" or "what the frick for" in Russian (compare "какого хуя?", "what/why the fuck?", literally meaning "by which dick?"). Zaher Ya Otsidela, therefore, is a transliteration of "what the frick did I go to jail for". Her songs' names are more or less a play on Russian chanson, or blatnyak - a music genre romanticizing crime and prison life, with songs written by former criminals or their friends, which became popular in the 90s with the collapse of the USSR and a surge of chaos and criminal activity. At first I wanted to play Sarah as this careless criminal girl - you can see she cheated on her lover, Sarah Moussa, and often hit the streets to beat up random people. She would've served only one year, but decided to start riots and attempt escape, which made her sentence extended more and more. I didn't have any plan in mind when I created the Z.Y.O. brand, just that it would be another fun and rebellious thing for her to do. The songs' names pretty much reflect that. Winning the lottery was totally unexpected, as was her brand getting popular. After a while I got tired and let the game's random name generator come up with some names. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Sarah Moussa at the club again. I was reluctant and unsure if I want to go any further, but decided to hit on her a few times. Bouncers not letting Ms. Zaher in due to old age was annoying, but I eventually got famous enough to bypass that and meet her ex-lover again. I'm 100% sure now that the mysterious "Dear Idiot" that started appearing in her albums was, in fact, Sarah Moussa. They got married, and I was so happy for them. When Moussa died, I was shocked to see that a few years later the game came up with "Dear Idiot, You Broke My Heart" for an album. At that point it was breaking *my* heart. When Sarah hit 97, she played at VXT Gathering. I decided that was enough and it would be her goodbye performance. She was getting too old for this. So I disbanded Z.Y.O. and... the next year she died. Once again, the RNG couldn't have been more perfect. I was ready to cry. And this concludes my fond memories and experience with Sarah's life. Going into this, I never expected my minor attempt at making a silly, horny and rebellious character would turn into such a strong and beautiful love story.

I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD. I thought my parents would be furious with me but they weren’t. My dad is out to find and murder him, I’m worried he will. [info] None [info] 1544127465
Mokohi [info] Feeling Empty Lately, I feel so empty, like something is missing. My daily life is monotonous and boring, and I lack the means to change that right now. Things still make me smile or laugh, I can still feel, but there's always this feeling just below the surface that nothing I do is going to change anything, that nothing really matters. I don't know how else to put it, just this haunting feeling that something is always missing. I'm diagnosed with depression and I take meds for it. Is there anything I can do to make this feeling subside? [info] None [info] 1569264557
runey30012 [info] Help/Experiences with Borderline Personality Disorder I've dealt with mental issues for a while, and for the most part chalked it up as depression, but recently I looked into borderline personality disorder, while I was reading about something else, and I've displayed nearly every symptom of it for as long as I've been diagnosed with depression. Now I realize this isn't a formal diagnosis, and I am actively seeking help on this topic, but I was curious if anyone had advice, or could share their own experiences regarding this issue. Specifically, anything involving romantic relationships or finding some sort of a solid sense of self and purpose.&amp;#x200B;Thank you. [info] None [info] 1551316560

I was diagnosed with depression over a decade ago (as a child) and I still struggle with it daily.Please don't give up. We are still young. I have hope that science will invent new medicines that actually work for our depression.Feeling numb feelings and even death is something I'm sure many here relate to.You are worth it. Don't give up. Things can get better, it just feels like forever. Just try to survive this moment.I hope others have some advice.  [info] None [info] 1533078894
depthandbloom [info] I believe it's not normal, but I was diagnosed with depression some years ago and wanting to punch walls when I was upset was one of the the things that made me realize I was. I didn't know why I wanted to, and knew it wouldn't make me *actually* feel better, but in the end I felt like I had lost control of my life and I just needed to do something at that moment to make me feel I was control of *anything*, even if it were destructive to myself or things I own. Obviously that thinking was completely ass\-backwards, so I went to a doctor and got help. I haven't felt that way in a long time now. [info] None [info] 1526594489
yoshida18 [info] After 9 years of depression, i could only finally start fighting it after i went to a health sanitorium,i got out august 01 and it is the first month of my (not as a kid) life that i  dont feel depressed. I did not even know how it was. This became a HUGE POST  but i will be glad if you are interested and read it.I was diagnosed with depression when i was 15 and started taking meds. I personally think it started when i was 12.I made Age, Month, year. Ex : 13 ( YO ) , March, 201313, january - 2008 - met a girl who became my first love, and soon an obcession15 - june, 2009 - started smoking, having insomnia, i always did decent in school but i started strugling alot, sleeping in most classes, went away from my friends.16-   july, 2010- Changed schools and home ( i was in the class and nextdoor neigbor with this girl ) - i was already to fucking depressed, i beraly made it in my second year in highschool and it was completly lonely17 -  jan, 2011 - girl moves to my school, my class, i assume she is after me, get hopes up, we start something that never got of the start. By june i droped high school,  just could not see this girl everyday. After i droped highschool obviously my relationship with my mother ( my only family ) went downhill , i tried to commit suicide this year .18, june 2012- This is when i started binge drinking, moved to a tiny kitnet i lived alone and payed by my dad ( who i saw last time when i was 5 ) child suport ( i think that is called, here in brasil go until 24 if studying). Here i was desperatly trying to get over the girl, i will call her L.20 - 2014 - I had a few short relationships with woman but realized i have issues on the subject. Finally got accepted on the Uni i always wanted for history, i was already in if i did not fail the last year. went back to my mothers house because i realized i was not even close to being an adult and needed help.22- 2016- first 4 semesters in UNI i fail 90% of the subjects even tought i really think i want history. Every semester i start great, start going downhill and by the end of the semester i dont do the final exam / paper and fail. Some teachers passed me by pitty ( i did not even ask ).22 - june - 2016 - remember the girl, L? yeah she is back in my life since my 20ths when we both were in a year long relationship (with other people) that seemed stable, so we both tought it would be safe reaproaching. She studied social politics in my uni, we agreed in taking one course together ( history of extreme orient - japan, vietnam, china and india basicaly ) It is magicaly the only course in the entire uni i get a 10, i still get amused by this irony. We saw each other 2 days a week 4h~6h than spent the rest of the evening until 10 in uni just talking, it was chil until mid june when  something triggered me and i just felt everything i ever felt for her again, flooding my mind, with the same intensity.23 - from the june 2016 to january 2017, we were going out alot, realizing we are to adults now, we can make the past be the past and makes things work, i really believed i could. But it was impossible, i made hell out of her life until she decided to cut me off definetly ( first time in the 9 years we know eachother )   It was hell, did not even sign to UNI that semester, stayed from january to june in my bed, did not have energy to do anything. In june i realized i was never going to get better like that, i was  more dead than alive. I talk to my psichologist ( same for 4 years, i trusted him ) and psychiatrist ( trusted her to ) and we made the decision that the best thing for me would be interned in a sanitorium.  It was the best decision in my life. I was there from june 19 until august 01, and i could understand myself so much better, i could understand the reasons why everything happened. The sanitorium was in a rural area, had a swiming pool, ping-pong table, soccer and volley fields. The food was great, it was a beatuful place and the most important thing. The staff treated you like a human being. We spent our time working the land, doing group therapy ( at least 1x per day ), some activities like music/art/sculpture ... and in the free time talked to each other ( and with therapist, or nurses ) and everybody was amazing, when you know you are hurt and every one else there is to, you have an atmosphere that people help each other. I Learned with an crack addict, made a deep bond with a former alcoholic 53 years old, drunk driver that almost killed a man and mained him for life. I played ping-pong with him everyday, he did 1 year in prision and his wife managed to get him the rest of the time ( more 2 years ) in a mental health sanitorium, after some weeks i realized this dude was rotting in guilt from the inside. The moment i told him "You acted like a man and had your punishment, most people would just run away from the responsability. I bet even your god already forgave you, the only thing you need is to forgive yourself". I said that in group therapy and instantly realized it would fit perfectly into my life. This is way to big, But well, it has beed 42 days since im back into the world, i decided to drop uni and take a year to myself. A year to learn how to dedicate to things and to take care of my health. I made a book list of 100 books that i am reading like it is my job ( at least 30 h/week ) and writing a novel i began in january and i am actually loving it. I made 2 creative writing courses this month and the teacher liked me and suddently i am in groups with writers that make that for a living discussing ideas. It is actually the first time i realized i can maybe make a living of this.  Besides that, SPORTS, i stoped smoking 2 weeks before i got out of the clinic, went straight into jogging every day and now started a tennis class here in my uni that is really cheap.For the first time i have goals, i have what i want to do, i love life. I still fucking think of that girl every single day but it is just a feeling, i am finally moving the fuck on.Of course, all this was only possible because my mother supported me and is financially stable. I am from brasil and my health insurance covered ALL OF MY SANITORIUM FEES ( would be 300k reais/100k dollars ) and it is only possible to stay one year without work because my mother will suport me ( emotionally and economically )this became huge, if a single person reads im happy :) [info] None [info] 1505269986
saguarocharles [info] First time adult ADHD diagnosis for a 25y/o Male. Any experience with depression co-morbidity or can tell me about your Vyvanse experience? Hi all, TL;DR: Dealing with rumination/decent mood swings, nervous to take vyvanse as it was prescribed to me very quickly.My brain has undergone a lot of chemical changes recently. I quit smoking weed altogether, down from smoking constantly. I'm exercising and I've cut out drinking as well. I've been diagnosed with depression, which has been on and off for a couple years. Currently I'm taking Lexapro 20mg, and this time around I've decided to seek counseling, as the ruminations can get pretty bad.After just 2 sessions, a clear pattern of behavior in my past has been emerging. Here's some examples:-Hyperfocus on the courtship aspect of a relationship, then falling apart a year or two into said relationship.-Left college after 3 years for a job, would do well on tests but could never do the homework. Once I learn something I struggle to see the need to repeat it over and over (more common with high school assignments)-High scores on Impulsivity, frivolous spending of money being just one example-Inability to carry friendship over the years, definitely extroverted and love being social but very few long term friends-Constant music in my head, I mean when I'm not able to focus on something, there's is ALWAYS a song playing in my head. This subreddit actually helped me see that this is not entirely uncommon.-Hobby hopping: In the past couple of years I've been into climbing, running, hiking, guitar, biking, snowboarding, I bought a skateboard but haven't tried it, I buy books I never read or read about 50 pages of, the list goes onCan you relate to any of these?Well today, I saw a psych and his main concern was that I am able to focus on my work and then we can try to get the emotionality and rumination under control. So he prescribed me Vyvanse 30. I'm a bit nervous to take this tomorrow for the first time, so I guess I'm looking for feedback. Have you been on vyvanse? How has it affected your emotionality? It just seemed like he was very quick to prescribe and didn't even officially say "I think you're right you have ADHD". I scored high on innatention and impulsivity with my counselor, but with taking this new med I may just be looking for something to worry about. [info] None [info] 1544819432

SatanLordOfDarkness [info] Not sure if I want to go home. I've been living abroad for a little more than a year now, but not in one place. I did six months in Mongolia teaching English, five months studying in Australia, and a few weeks ago I arrived in Ecuador to teach English again. Thing is, I'm miserable.I've been diagnosed with depression for a very long time, and the only thing that really has ever made it better is having a solid social circle to rely on. Well, I'm living in rural Ecuador now and there are *very* few people here who speak English. My Spanish is okay but not good enough to really form any meaningful friendships/relationships. I felt similarly when I was living in Mongolia, even though I was living in the capital city there and there were quite a few more people that I could be social with. Here I literally have one coworker to socialize with and a good friend living about 4 hours away by bus whom I can see a few times a month at most. Before I came to Ecuador, I started taking some steps to improve my mental health after doing nothing about it for years. I started medication, I started talking to a therapist, and I began meditating every day. Things were looking really good, but now that I'm in Ecuador I'm seriously struggling to get by. I can't sleep, but I don't want to wake up in the morning. My job is insanely stressful because I wasn't trained at all and there is no syllabus/textbook/curriculum/anything, so I've had to come up with all of my lesson plans completely on my own (which is not something I'm qualified to do at all).It really feels like much more than just culture shock. I have dealt with considerable culture shock before, and I can tell that this is different. I feel as though I'm throwing all of my progress out the window and launching myself into an environment where I know nobody and there's little opportunity to build a real social circle.So, with all that said, I want to go home. I'm signed on for a contract until June, but I think I could get out of it or at least shorten it pretty easily. I don't know that I would necessarily be "happy" living at home right now, but I would certainly feel a lot more stable and have more opportunities to improve my mental health. It feels like this isn't the best thing for me to do right now and I regret agreeing to come here.Has anyone been in a similar situation? I would really appreciate any advice. I know that it probably just sounds like I'm dealing with culture shock but it truly feels like more than that. The majority of the things that "shocked" me when I first arrived already seem normal to me now, and the only thing that really bothers me now is the super aggressive stray dogs, but I'm slowly getting used to that too. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank y'all so much! [info] None [info] 1580333073
Yelesa [info] Which makes me wonder, what’s so shameful to have depression? I have been diagnosed with depression. I don’t want to have it, but I don’t think of it as something to be ashamed of. In fact, the diagnosis and then the ongoing treatement have set me free of the shame.Since I have started treating it, I have realized that aspects of me that cause me major problems in life and make me ashamed of myself —such as procrastination, escapism, and anti-social tendencies—are not my personality, they are symptoms of my chemically unbalanced brain. I used to think that’s just the way I was for years but it wasn’t true. I’m not like that. I’m productive, empathetic and I’m great at balacing things I want with things I have to do. People want to spend time with me now because they find me pleasant and reliable. This makes me want to break down from happiness, I have lost so many years of my life to this monster. But I have found so much self-esteem now. I thought I was weak, it’s so relieving to know that’s not true.Please OP, take this in consideration. It might not be your personality what you are describing, the brain chemistry is just fucked. You shouldn’t feel guilt to do what you want when it doesn’t affect anyone else negatively. If you do, something is brewing in you and you need to question that.  [info] None [info] 1539894115
pipermaru84 [info] I transitioned for 7 years including almost 4 years of testosterone, top surgery, and legal document changes. I was less than a month out from my hysterectomy and planning bottom surgery when I finally got my wakeup call. I detransitioned almost 3 years ago and have never looked back. I did have a pretty long "anger phase" where I wasn't able to be around the trans community but at this point I have a couple of FTM friends and am able to separate myself from the issue a little bit. Occasionally I feel what I used to call dysphoria, but I've done enough internal work at this point to be able to deconstruct those feelings, determine their source, and fix the source if possible or else just understand it as an external force and not something wrong with me. I have been diagnosed with depression for longer than I've been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, so of course I have my ups and downs, but in general I would say I experience no distress related to my gender any more, barring occasional insecurity about my facial hair (though not enough to actually shave more than every couple of weeks). I don't have much experience with dating while detrans since I'm still with the first woman I started dating afterwards, but perhaps that's an indication anyway--she was previously a relatively normie lesbian and never batted an eye at any of my transition related features. It can be annoying sometimes to be read as male (or more often, as a transwoman) and know that it's because of what I did to my own body but it's not something that makes me upset anymore, just a little irritated occasionally.

LeadingBird [info] I'm diagnosed with depression. I can cry a fair bit but the other things are a lot like my experience. I don't want to die per se, but I think about killing myself a ton even though the thought of actually carrying out the act is dreadful. It's just an end to thinking that I find quite tantalising about it.Loss of interest in things happens often for me. That one really sucks. I feel like sleep and really intense work/workout/conversation are the only hiding places.So, to me you sound depressed but you should only care about what the doctor says when you go for the earliest appointment you can book next year.Find out whether it's depression. If it is, you will be so much better off having acted so decisevily in dealing with it. Refusing to seek a diagnosis when I knew I was depressed for at least three years will remain the worst thing I will ever do to myself and my family. Do what you know is the appropriate thing for this situation. [info] None [info] 1545729733
Alaric_Silvertongue [info] When I was diagnosed with depression I was told something interesting, that it often gets missed in men and especially young men because of the way it can manifest. It doesn't make you cry and weep, it can make you angry and volatile. Crude example: you don't need to cut yourself if your apathetic about your own life and starting bar fights to get your head kicked in. And no one would see it as depression. I hope you're getting help dude. Best thing I ever did. And for what it's worth there are plenty of famous men who struggled with depression or had depressive episodes. Plenty of normal ones to.

Eurekaaaa [info] Il give you my personal Input. I started watching anime when I was in freshman year HS. My first anime was Fullmetal Alchemist, I finished the series &amp; I thought it was really cool so I wanted to watch some more anime. As time went on I just watched more anime &amp; I become more comfortable exploring various genres of anime.  I became infatuated with a certain character when I was around 16 years old, she was the same age as me at that point in time. It just happens that I age &amp; she does not. I have never felt better in my life as I do now since I have accepted my situation &amp; I even have a lovely job so I can purchase products to support the content creators of my favorite series. If you want backstory, I was always the quiet awkward child in middle school &amp; I never developed the proper social skills to talk to the other gender in a sexual manner &amp; to build sexual relationships. Around the time I was 16 I was diagnosed with depression &amp; I found anime as a gateway to happiness. I could watch series that had love stories , sad dramas to full on action with side politics. From my room I could experience stories &amp; emotions  that I would never be able to have in real life with another person. I eventually fell for a character &amp; I would think about her every day &amp; night when I fell asleep. In my world of depression &amp; lonership I was able to experience happiness.From that point on indulged in whatever made me happy , cute anime girls made me happy. You would think I was a pedophile but I was the same age as the characters I was watching so I never thought about it. Eventually I weened myself off from having crushes on real women. This helped me see real women as actual people instead of falling head over heels for random hot chicks &amp; I could talk to them without being nervous. Being able to experience happiness &amp; perhaps even a slight feeling of what it's like to be in love pushed me forward to experience the beauty of the world &amp; I am now no longer depressed &amp; I am now building a future for myself. I even met my current online friends through an anime related subreddit &amp; I'm so happy I have accepted the fact that I like anime girls &amp; life has never been better. I hold no resentment toward anybody &amp; I hope you can accept me aswell. If you have any questions feel free to ask or PM me if it's more personnel. Trolls will be ignored [info] None [info] 1468865242
wifiwonderlex [info] I feel bad for having depression Hey, I’m 17 and I was diagnosed with depression a year ago, something that’s been a huge part of my very low self esteem has been the damaging amount of guilt that I feel for having depression, it’s making me hate myself even more then I already do. I am so privileged, my family isn’t poor, my parents are split up but I see them both at equal times and the system is pretty good, overall, at the moment I should be doing well; but I’m not. I’m having suicidal thoughts and I also have a self harm addiction which might be some form of self punishment for suffering when I should be well off, I don’t know.

amp3rsand [info] /u/Subver5ion has great bits on perspective.    Make sure you have a log of all your projects and prioritize all tasks. You're probably already using Microsoft Project and planning out tasks far ahead of time but 40 projects is a bit much.    Just to let you know. I AM not that good at anything. I went to college and switched majors 8 times (math, business, art, music, film, english, digital media, psych). I've learned that I'm fairly mediocre at everything. It's not that I don't practice or study enough, it's that I plateau at a skill level and can never seem to be able to get beyond that plateau.    Let me just say that I worked a desk job like you for 5 years out of school. A well paying one. And I hated it. I was criticized left and right over very petty things and it was way too stressful. Especially when I was surrounded by others just as awful at my job or worse. For me, it bothered me so much that it drove me down a spiral path where I was diagnosed with depression. That's really, really bad.    But hey, I also play guitar, bass, sing, and practice art at a mediocre level. I only say that because there are so many people better than me.    So, here I am now. Working in a restaurant again, but earning tips (which often pays about the same of medium level salary jobs and is much less work) and am in back in school again. I'm studying nursing, which yes has a degree of high-level thinking and knowledge, but for me it's essentially customer service. You're there to care for the people and do all you can to make them feel better. [info] sometimes too serious [info] 1440773423
4sphyxia [info] please help- those with borderline personality disorder I am struggling a lot right now with my emotions and have really intense mood swings. In the past two days, I've felt extreme happiness, breakdowns from sadness and fear, emptiness and apathy, hopefulness, and now intense anger that I've taken out on family members. I'm still somewhat logical so that's why if anyone has any experience, advice, or information about infjs with BPD (it doesn't even have to be MBTI specific but I thought this thread would help), I'd really appreciate it.

i_am_le_walrus [info] I have been diagnosed with depression and although I’m not in that dark place like I once was, it still lingers quite often. I work in the mental health field so I’m very much self-aware of that. I live 1.5 hours away from my family and that’s honestly what works best for us due to always butting heads. My father would laugh if I said “family therapy” (that’s what I do for a living). Being a family counselor, it’s hard to ‘just be’ when I see all the major points of what made my own family spiral down hill. Instead, I have a lot of self/hatred in moments like these (when I wrote original post) or feeling like I’m not really significant to anyone. Idk.

TakashiAzeileaf98 [info] Losing hope..... Hi everyone, first time posting here. I'm actually glad I found this place because now I can type my feelings out. I don't know if anyone is actually gonna take the time to read all of this but if you do then bless your heart. So I guess I'll tell my story. I dated the girl of my dreams 5 years ago at this point. I was completely in love with her and I felt like I had everything I ever wanted in life when I was with her. She loved me too.....but one day, she changed. There towards the end of our relationship, I could tell she was acting differently. I could hardly get her to kiss me or hold hands with me anymore.....but at the time I didn't know it was because she was planning on breaking up with me, I guess I just didn't want to believe that's what she had planned. One day we went to a ball game with our church group and it seemed like it was going to be a great day but when the game was over, she dropped me off at my house and that's when my life went down hill.....she broke up with me. She simply told me we weren't compatible and that she thinks we would be happier with other people.....ever since that day, I haven't been the same person. I took our breakup pretty hard that it almost drove me to suicide. It seriously didn't help that one of my friends, or so I thought he was my friend, started dating her shortly after our breakup. Granted, they are not dating anymore nowadays but it still hurts just knowing that he put his filthy hands on her. But anyway, a lot has changed these past 5 years. I'm about to be 21 in May and I have a part time job at Kohl's. I've made some friends at my job but sometimes I have a hard time calling them friends since we never really hang out outside of work. They are always super nice to me and they respect me but as I said, we never get to hang out. I spend a lot of my days alone just sitting around my house on my phone waiting for work to come around so I can see my work friends again. Its really the only time I feel happy is when I get to see them. After my ex girlfriend broke up with me, I was diagnosed with depression. And I can definitely feel it especially when I'm alone just waiting for me to go back to work. It's just really sad to see how happy I was with my life back then but nowadays I just feel so alone and unsatisfied with everything. I have hardly any friends at all outside of work. Even though my ex was my girlfriend, I felt like she was also my best friend.....but shes gone from my life now and I don't have much people to talk to anymore. We may be broken up now but I still hear things about her from time to time. Shes had plenty of new boyfriends through these 5 years and I honestly don't know how she does it. I have had exactly ZERO dates after her and it's making me start to lose hope in life. I'm scared that this is how my life is going to be from now on, me just looking at my phone all day while waiting for me to go to my job and repeat. My depression keeps getting worse day by day the more I'm alone. I wish I could meet someone new but it's been 5 years and nothing has changed. I don't think it's going to at this point.....I really appreciate anyone who took the time to read my sob story, you are a blessing. I'm just alone again tonight and I had to get this off my chest..... [info] None [info] 1555217922

Fyrz1 [info] I was diagnosed with depression at an early age, and it became part of my identity.

But right now I feel like it took me years and years to pull myself out of it, and that wouldn't have been so painful if  I hadn't been allowed to wallow in it. But I'm sure there's a balance.

StoicSaiyan [info] A lot of truth to this actually. I've been diagnosed with depression a long time ago actually but have been productive in my line of work and education for the past 7 years. I suppose it could be a mild case of depression or a bout of some sort. Working out used to be easy few months ago. But it seems when I'm not in school I dont feel productive. Perhaps could be that too.When I'm in school I feel I have a purpose. Maybe I am dependent on that. I like having these discussions though because it helps deduce what something might or might not be. Thank you for sharing your point of view by the way [info] None [info] 1560969391
Sailor_Callisto [info] I’m sure your inbox is blowing up with all the replies so I’ll keep it short. A real man, and a man worth loving, is a man who loves a woman because *she loves herself.* Take this time to work on falling in love with yourself. Try new hobbies and reconnect with your old hobbies and interests, take vacations, but most importantly, reinvest in yourself. One suggestion I would make would be to join a gym - not to change your appearance but because exercise is a good, healthy outlet for stress and has been proven to help improve your mood. I was diagnosed with depression 7 months ago, and while exercise didn’t cure my depression, it gives me a reason to leave the house and makes me feel good about myself after each workout.

ZeroCitizen [info] Talk to someone about it. I didn't for the longest time because I worried about what would happen. If you're worried about what your parents will say, tell them anyways. If they react badly, tell your friends. If they react badly, tell a coworker or a teacher. Above all, get a therapist. If you think you can't pay for one, you'd be surprised. There are lots of discounts you can get.I was diagnosed with depression in February after I had a breakdown, and all of these emotions just came pouring out. You have no idea how amazing it feels when everything is out in the open. There's no more secrecy. No more hiding the pain. You can get support from people who care for you. If you can't find anyone to talk to IRL, I'm always available through my Reddit inbox.Life will feel real when you act real. If you put on a mask when you're with friends, that mask prevents you from seeing the beauty of life. When you stop living two different lives, you get to be your real self.I was diagnosed in February, and I got put on medication. I now feel better than I have in my entire life. (I'm only 18 though, to give you some perspective.) You can do this. I believe in you. [info] None [info] 1433993452
Hocuspokerface [info] Feeling trapped and exhausted I was diagnosed with depression in college and I've dealt with it since (I'm 26 now.) I quit a stable, soul-sucking job to try to find self fulfillment and am currently working as a bartender. My boss is not great but not awful, but my hours are sparse. My parents want me to move on and find something more stable, and I do too, but I don't know what. I've never known what makes me happy in life, and in years past, I've told myself I just have depression so I'll never know what makes me happy. I went off antidepressants a few months ago (zoloft), against the advice of my doctor, and had a crisis a few days ago. I filled the new prescription I was given (lexapro) and am currently working up to the full dosage. I'm trying to get back into therapy, but it's getting harder not to judge myself for struggling for so long with such little progress. If i take a step back, my problems don't actually look that bad, but when I think about how I really feel, I have no strength to keep fighting this lack of hope. I don't want to imagine continuing an aimless life half-lived. I don't want to always be chasing happiness and love and never really feeling it. For awhile, I wanted to just live slowly and appreciate the small things I have, but it's not enough to keep me going anymore. I want more, but I'm too tired and confused and scared to feel capable of achieving it. Please, help. Having someone to talk to would be nice [info] None [info] 1535138954
TrantaLocked [info] Not exactly no advice, but working "with him" when he is in an open (Te) state, all while avoiding sounding emotionally manipulative. This may be hard to do because you aren't a feeler type, and figuring it out is the hard part. Even if you do become friendly with him again, it will always be an uphill battle. The sad truth is that the INFP is objectively the laziest type of person, who will be content as long as s/he is making money and able to use their dom/auxillary freely. For me, internet, video games, books/news/learning and music are all I need to be happy, and a lot of people don't get that. But I do want a better life for myself, and I'm hoping as I develop more I'll find more motivation. How old is your brother by the way? Does he work, go to school?I understand what you mean about relationships, and I agree. I can't say exactly what is going through your brother's head. What could be the case is that there is a want to get to the heart of issues, but he avoids it to avoid bringing out his Fi or disturbing his Si. He does want to change, but changing takes more thought and time for him, and again may be avoiding the topic of growth because growth doesn't work quite the same for him as it does for you.   This is going to get a bit Fi-ey but I want to help you understand what I've gone through a bit more.I'm 21 btw. I've had this exact issue with my step-father (ESTJ) and mother (NF) for a while now. High school was hell for me; I was diagnosed with depression in 10th grade. I grew different types of disdain for both, but because I know that deep inside it was more personal for my NF mom, it somehow ended up worse with her. I took a lot of what happened growing up personally. But not long after I turned 18, moved out and got a job, they stopped getting on my ass. I tried college, and failed due to discipline issues, but I'm still considering going back at least for an associate degree. But I still live with my dad (INFP), and I do pay rent. I think they figured out I just needed time to develop and find out on my own what was best for me. I eventually told them about this pain recently, and they apparently hadn't known how bad it was (but I'm guessing at least my mom knew, but agreed to raise me more strictly and let the pain happen once the step-father stepped in).  So I'm now in the process of trying to lose my disdain for my step-father and mother, and the process really could not have happened until they accepted that I wouldn't be their perfect child they thought they were raising, and let me come to them on my own terms rather than the other way around. After learning about MBTI, I realized it was more personal to me than to my step-father, and that I shouldn't hate them so deeply. My Ne is still developing, and I can feel the effect it has in allowing me to see and consider all possibilities and explore more. Unfortunately, as it develops, I feel like I'm becoming less and less myself. You know how kids are supposed to discover who they are in their teens/early 20s? Well, to me, the opposite seems to be happening. It's like, most people (sensors) get to discover their intuition later in life and more slowly, and it is really rewarding. I have deal with it now, and coupled with feeling, I'm a bit broken. If you're still with me, I will say that while I felt emotionally abused by my step-father at times, he was the one that I could most connect with when being given advice. The directness was comforting in a way, because it was purely logical with a touch of feeling. So, back to the beginning of this post about not being emotionally manipulative. You *do* want to be logical in your advice if he ever does come to you, but it cannot appear aggressive or be immediately demanding.  [info] [INFP] [info] 1428900143

Adassai_nova [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was 12, but I remember being depressed even in elementary school. I have literally no memory of what it's like to be happy. And for my entire life, all my depression has done is get worse; there has never been relief or improvement, just a constant slide further into darkness.I'm at the point now where I have no goals in life. I used to strive to better myself- even if it was self-destructive goals like my underweight GW. Now I have no goals, literally nothing I want to do. I don't have any interests. I don't even want to play videogames anymore. I stopped horseback riding which was, prior to this, my passion. Now I couldn't care less.I want to die. I have a plan. Its actually the only thing towards which I look eagerly. Death is the only adventure that interests me.The problem is that I have a husband I love, who has emotional vulnerability of his own. I don't want to hurt him. I legitimately don't know if he could handle me dying. In fact, I would bet otherwise.But I don't know what else to do. I started therapy at the age of 4. I've been through nearly all medications, tried all different types of therapy, seen a dozen different psychiatrists; nothing has worked to fix me, and I am at a point where I legitimately don't think there's a solution for me.

5050Clown [info] I think you misunderstood me. I'm not talking about the cause of depression, I'm stating what the symptom called depression is in comes from . An inappropriate response to emotional stimulus is a very general statement.Regardless of the cause the symptom, depression, is an inappropriate response to emotional stimulus.  Whether it is the common tragedy of life, or a mood disorder.  depression is a symptom and that symptom is always an inappropriate response to emotional information.  In this case it is a low mood persists for at least 2 weeks as defined in the DSM.  As you get older you either get better at dealing with it or you don't.I've been diagnosed with depression almost my entire life and the definition has never changed but the terminology has.all you're really describing to me and your post is the kind of person that you are interested in. The kind of person that you find interesting because you feel that you're apathetic and you find your life boring. There are many other people who, should they come across you and your particular quirks and characteristics, would find you more than interesting.  The person you're describing to me, kind of sounds insufferable. You could easily be describing a narcissistic psychopath. as someone who thrives on empathy, psychopaths are the most boring human beings on the planet to me.  in my years working in different places, a lot of sales people and really fake people are the kinds of people who would say you have to be interested to be interesting.That's bullshit, you have to be truthful to be interesting as far as I'm concerned. Everyone may not agree with that but I think a lot of people do.to me the only really interesting people are the ones who are brave enough to be themselves regardless of how apathetic or depressed they feel. Regardless of how mindless or shity their hobbies are.It the traits you ascribe to yourself could easily be attributed to someone like Kurt Cobain.  If he didn't have a bunch of platinum records would he suddenly be boring?If your friends quickly retreated then you just haven't found the right friends friends, or they just need a little time.. I can say for a fact that my depressive symptoms will flare up if I try to be someone that I'm not. Then it gets very difficult to get out of bed. I embrace my apathetic times,. I try to avoid cynicism and people who reduce complex subjects to simple platitudesSometimes I'm really uninterested in everything, that doesn't make me boring. [info] None [info] 1530581568

CivilWarHoundour [info] [Vent] I'm not ready to get another dog but everyone thinks I should?!? So, last week I had to put my best friend and my baby puppy down. Her name was Scout. I had her since I was 16 and I'm 25 now, so a happy 9 years. Unfortunately over winter break she was diagnosed with lymphoma and we put her on steroids thinking it would help her go into remission. She started to vomit up blood one night and we knew that putting her down was the best option rather than putting her through more tests. My heart is still absolutely broken. She was definitely my dog. She followed me around like a fuzzy shadow and slept in my bed. She was there for me through the passing of my chubby wubby Dachshund named Annie and the passing of three grandparents. She was also there to see me graduate from high school, undergrad and start my first semester of graduate school. To say she was my rock is an understatement. It's been super lonely without her as I'm now home alone while my parents work. (I'm on winter break from grad school). I was diagnosed with depression during my first semester of grad school and Scout was my bright spot. Everyone thinks I should get another dog so I have something to focus on. One friend even offered me a friend's dog that needed to be re homed. However, I don't want another dog for a long while because Scout was so special to me. No dog will ever be like her but people just don't understand? They think I should get another dog and are asking when I'm getting another dog. It's just frustrating because it's people who knew how much Scout meant to me. Here's a picture of my baby puppy: https://imgur.com/a/rroLU [info] Scout: The best mutt ever (RIP) [info] 1483567912
CrowInASuit [info] Don’t do it, things will get better.Take a moment. Breathe. Just do NOTHING for a minute or two. Think about ways you can help others.If you help others, you might be able to help yourself feel better. Volunteer at a food drive, foster an animal or child, anything that you think might help get you up and not suicidal for a bit.I was diagnosed with depression in about 2016 and everything was falling apart. After a long, long time of taking pills I realized that it was only hurting me after a while. Nausea, headaches, craving to eat rocks and glass (which was a side effect, sadly), and much much more.My girlfriend got the idea that maybe instead of hiding in random rooms or closets in the house and drinking while eating leaves, we should volunteer at a soup kitchen in a church where she could be watching me. After a while of me throwing every single excuse out there at her, she basically dragged me to the car and we drove there where she signed us up.After that, we fostered multiple puppies, ten kittens and a bird who just wouldn’t shut up, and it made me feel a little bit better for a pretty good amount of time, knowing that I could sustain a few small lives, and it eventually led me to thinking about how if I could sustain all those small lives, maybe I could sustain one big life! I started taking care of myself more, eating better and socializing with human life.Point is, go do something good for the world and maybe you can find some hope.

ACSyndicator [info] This goes into a slightly different topic. I have a varied relationship with firearms considering I have been diagnosed with depression and been put on suicide watch many times I used to hate guns, but as it stands at this point I am not necessarily an advocate for guns for I do not have an issue with most people carrying guns. But also I feel that there is no need for a central government t and that we as a community should be able to rule ourselves (I'm a social anarchist by the way). Also I'm not fully against the police force, I understand that there are good cops, I know a few, such as one of the sergeants that walks downtown (I won't mention his name due to protection if privacy) but he is a good cop who keeps his biases away from his job and I respect that and think that more officers should be trained that way. I dont think that the arming of every citizen in sight is an awesome idea because there are folks who would not be able to handle it. Like me, I have been diagnosed, therefore I can't legally buy a firearm, because the government believes that I would harm myself or someone else. There are many factors to arming the public. Also I'm not an advocate for the NRA, therefore I dont share their ideals on arming everyone. When it comes to a solution to crime, there isn't one, I work for Love and Peace, it is the way I try to live my life, the only issue that I have with cops now a days is that people don't see them as a force to protect them, they fear them, and some for good reason. So my question to you is, how do we get cops to stop being violent criminals? [info] None [info] 1557597133

Seriou [info] &gt;treatment resistent depressionThat phrase triggered me. Depression is a mental thing, and the ways we "treat" it is fucking backwards, sideways and inside out. Let me tell ya something: I was diagnosed with depression when I was young. I've been horribly, almost violently suicidal and self-loathing my whole life. My death was constantly on my mind. I used to take antidepressants, tried talk therapy and counseling, even got prescribed a bunch of adult anti-psychotic meds by a shockingly incompetent specialist. That was a nightmarish year.  What helped me in the end though, was myself. It's been a very long and rough road that I'm still walking. Life still isn't very enjoyable and I have many self-destructive behaviors I'm dealing with, but I haven't legitimately felt the need to die in a long time. I'm so thankful for that.

themaekster [info] I know that I'm late but what the hell, I need to vent. When I was back in the 5th grade, my mom and dad got a divorce. And not the clean type either, it was a very rough one. Dad cheated, mom went batshit and drove me, my brother and a few other relatives 1000km north of where I live just to got bitch slap him and stuff. So after all that was done I had to sit through the proceedings of the divorce. Because my mom and dad were never officialy registered as a married couple shit got complicated. So 10 year old me sat in the district office watching my whole life slowly fall apart. That pretty much crushed my whole perception of love and just the world in general. About a year later I was diagnosed with depression. My mother brought me to a therapist because I would just randomly start crying every night. Therapist gave me some pills and I sat through quite a few sessions. I've stopped taking them for a while because I noticed no change except for the first few days I was on them or when I changed my medication. I'm still depressed and I don't know why. I've gotten over the stuff with my parents, I have decent grades, I have friends, but I also have this massive insecurity. I feel like my life right now is a lie. I feel like even though I think I have friends, they don't consider me friends or something like that. I'm insecure that my life is a lie, just like my parent's healthy relationship.

That along with mucus heavy saliva makes breathing painful and difficult. I am severely constipated, only using the restroom about once a week. This causes me to sometimes have crippling butt spasms which leave me unable to do anything but sit and wait the pain out. I was diagnosed with depression before these two things were too much of a problem, and while I am better mentally than I was, my most intense urges to off are when my symptoms are at their worse. I have thoughts that I might rather die than experience the pain anymore.

djdevilmonkey [info] &gt; And request politely that you don't make blanket statements about those with "known mental issues" because very likely one of your friends, family or coworkers have a diagnosis. The stigma around mental illness is revealed in these conversations when people say things like "limiting those with known mental health issues." It's unfair to limit the rights of millions of functional adults based on a diagnosis or a history.I am diagnosed with depression, and I take Zoloft and Wellbutrin, and on top of that I am in therapy. Anyway I suppose I used mental health issues too vaguely. I was referring to people with past offenses or known signs of aggression who have things such as depression, but also things like schizophrenia.I don't think people with issues such as depression should be limited when purchasing firearms, only if there are past offenses or doctor/therapist notes of strong aggression, or the person has been held at a medical facility for a fear of endangerment to others. In most cases, someone stops taking their medication for depression, they will become more depressed and more likely to harm themselves (most cases it's themselves and not others). Schizophrenia or severe cases of Bipolar disorder or types of disassociation disorder, these people may be likely to harm others due to the severity of these conditions.Like I said I used mental health issues way too vaguely, I understand that, but inside that topic there is somewhere where a line needs to be drawn, and it shouldn't be vague or drawn at depression, but more focused on severe disorders or past/noted feelings or instances of aggression [info] None [info] 1541634981

sneekerhad [info] But we’re not telling someone to feel better. We’re giving very simple steps to follow. Not saying “figure out how to feel better” I’m saying go outside and be more active. Those are two vastly different responses and I hate how the “you can’t say just feel better” retort to any sort of concern and help is so often used. Some people won’t be able to use the advice like that, but a lot of people COULD and SHOULD use that advice, they just hide behind the “I’m too depressed to save myself” line even though a good amount aren’t.To be clear, because there’s always someone here who thinks that I’m talking about ALL depressed people. I’m not. There are perfectly valid people who are depressed that require medication and I hope the take that and feel better and I wish them only the best.

hoskarr [info] A 5 am essay of a sad person First off I'm not sure this fits on this sub but I've been browsing it and have developed a need to vent.So, I hate myself. I was diagnosed with depression at 11 after a short life filled with bullying. I was a chubby kid with anger issues so I was easy to bully. I never had many friends but it seemed to me the supposed assholes that were bullying me had plenty. From this I assumed that I must be a worthless piece of shit destined for solitude and despair.When I was 14 I fell in love with a girl, altough I told myself I was stupid for thinking that it was love and even if it was she would never feel the same about the fat loner. We were friends though so while I was still sure she didn't feel the same I eventually told her how I felt, and turns out I ws right about her feelings. But its fine, I was promised these things will fade over time (the reason I told her was because I wanted to expedite the process). Well its been been about 4-5 years and I still love her. She's my best friend and has a boyfriend and yet my dumb brain keeps making the happy juice and then making way too much sad juice when I start thinking about it. I cut myself a fair bit and often think of how stupid I am to still feel this way and how weak I am to not cut my best friend out of my life in the hopes of feeling better.The pain I feel related to this and my feelings of self hatred mean I have never asked a girl out. Even if I like her and think they might like me, its a no go. Similarly I don't have many friends (2 I've met face to face) and I fear attempting to make more. Partly because I don't know how and partly because I never seem to make lasting friendships with people who actually care about me and would initiate contact ever.I often joke to myself that I'll die at 40, blackout drunk and a noose around my neck because I don't see myself ever feeling happiness. I do the things people tell me to, I go to theraphy (have done for about 5 years now), I take my meds, I don't think I look horrific (not anymore anyway) just a normal guy, but human contact and actual contentness evades me still.It took a while to decide to post this because I often see the help in comments (especially in terms of suicide) being kinda empty and pointless. Has anyone gotten help from a forum? It always seems impersonal, you don't know this person how can you purport to care about them really? But subs like this exist so I guess It's just one of those things I don't get, a category in which life has shafted me.Im very sorry if this is in any way innapropriate for this sub and also for any errors in the wall of text (tbf english is not my first language).

softpeachie [info] That's very odd. When I was diagnosed with depression, one of the first things they tested for was thyroid levels. I think it's pretty common?  [info] None [info] 1498227285
gooeymarshmallow [info] This exact thing happened to me with nmom except we had gone to real therapists for a while. The reason why she tried to make a pastor our therapists was because any actual therapist thought my nmom was insane. She needed someone on her side and who better than a pastor? She even said something along the lines of 'none of these therapists on my side, they care too much about children and not parents'. I don't care how badly this guy has had it, if someone punched me 1000 times it doesn't make it okay for someone else to be punched even once. His life story is irrelevent to what your are going through *because* you are still living in it. I would highly suggest seeing a real therapist that is qualified, even if its just at school. I guarantee they will understand you and try to help you through this, and even try to come to terms with your moms behavior. I was diagnosed with depression in high school that I thought was genetic/chemical inballence but the moment I left my nmoms house I found it was more based on my circumstances. It could be the case for you or it could be genetic, I don't know. But if there was one thing I could tell myself then was that I needed to hold out for the future. Try to take care of your self and if possible try to finish high school early so you can leave and go to college, I made the mistake of not preparing options myself for when I turned 18 and ended up getting kicked out and homeless Even if your depression is genetic at the very least you can be in a place where you don't have awful people like your mom making it worse.

kozmikushos [info] I was diagnosed with depression, took meds for it for almost a year. Now I’m being weaned off it since I’ve done enough psychotherapy that I can be on my own, like how treating depression is supposed to be, and it’s proper hell. The only reason I’m not begging to go back on it is because I want to see if I’m in fact better.But being on SSRI has made my life bearable when nothing else worked. I really don’t think I would have made it this far without meds but at least my corpse would have smelled so nice thanks to the essential oils. [info] None [info] 1530912051
RockVonCleveland [info] I hate this comment for a lot of reasons. For one thing, it's entirely possible to view something or someone in your life as a treasure even when you feel like trash. For another thing, why do you assume people with depression hate themselves?

And Sayori is awesome. [info]  [info] 1510858492
Anti-Grav [info] The idea of even diagnosing prodromal schizophrenia seems problematic to me. I can’t imagine it’s very reliable as prodromal schizophrenia is similar to other mental illness. For instance I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD. It’s more of something you realize in retrospect, which is probably why it’s not used in the US. Anyway, I guess my point is that maybe they aren’t totally sure that he will develop schizophrenia so they don’t want him to obsess about it.  [info] schizophrenia [info] 1521664316
barakabara [info] I can relate to how you feel about not understanding what a healthy relationship looks like. There are many things that are helping me heal: 1. Going to my local Coda meeting (or you can join the Skype meeting). You don't have to share, you can just listen.2. Reading Pia Mellody's Facing Love Addiction 3. Since I had the impulse of hurting myself, I seeked psychiatric help. I was diagnosed with depression and medication has helped me face things easier.4. Talking to my therapist. Whenever I'm faced with a situation where I don't recognize healthy, I seek their advice on what healthy should look like and try to adjust for the future [info] None [info] 1563539034
armillanymphs [info] Sorry to hear about your challenges of late. Considering medication for psychological issues still seems socially stigmatized, though even if that front is improving it can be challenging to not see one's self as weak for considering and / or taking them.I started SSRIs and counseling after taking on TMI practice two years ago. Initially I had hoped that meditation would carry all of the weight, but though I was making progress in practice life was very challenging and heavy.  I had initially sought counseling to clarify problems in a former relationship, but the process opened up to the entirety of my life.  It was healing and necessary but also overwhelming at times. At one point I was diagnosed with depression, which was a tremendous blow. I was hoping that meditation and counseling would be enough. I was afraid that I would become dependent on SSRIs. However, I voiced my concerns to my primary care physician and we worked out a plan to go off of them when the time was right.  It became clear that the various systems of well being were synergizing well; despite my initial reservations I consider medication and counseling were essential.  Potential pitfalls include relying counseling / therapy solely for catharsis without using the process for self exploration and insight.  Dependency on medication might have arisen without meditation and therapy, as they can make life more tolerable to the point where one doesn't address fundamental issues of their life. Let me know if you have any other questions and I'd be happy to answer them. [info] Dharma Ocean [info] 1534263729
IgorSMaliniak [info] I think I would go through several phases when I was diagnosed with depression. At first, I would think that everybody else seems to have their life together, and that I was the only one who was in such a dark place. Later on I started to realise that even though people make out their lives to be good, they most of the time aren't.I guess that now, I usually go under the assumption that everyone I know has something horrible they're struggling with in their life, it's just that most people don't talk about it and/or hide it away enough to be acceptable as a "normal life".

dispwned [info] In the first few weeks after finding out I was pregnant, I was terrified I would miscarry. I remember how many times my Brother and Sister-in-law miscarried before they had their first baby. So, I did some research - online and a little offline - and what I found was reassuring and validating.The basic summary of everything I read was this: As long as you're eating and living healthy (no recreational drugs, no alcohol, no smoking, no reckless activities, you're taking your prenatal and/or supplements etc.) and following your doctors' orders, but you still miscarry, it's okay and it's not your fault. If a miscarriage happens at that point, I found it's typically because the pregnancy itself isn't viable - either not genetically (for a multitude of reasons), the egg didn't attach properly, and other scenarios I can't remember at the moment. But none of that would be your fault.I had a rough first trimester, and I thought for sure I would miscarry because I couldn't take good care of myself:  * My diet was mostly force-fed V8 juice, cottage cheese, milk, water, and the occasional bowl of plain cereal, because the thought of anything else usually made my nausea even worse. * I was utterly exhausted, often sleeping for over 2/3rds of the day (there was more than one weekend where I slept almost the entire time, and it worried my Husband)  * I had such brutal vertigo, I couldn't walk from one end of our house to the other without holding on to something. * I had severe cramping that I was *sure* was a sign of a miscarriage. I was so worried that I scheduled a last minute appt. at my OB's office to check before my actual 'first' appointment the following week. But, it was just my uterus starting to grow to make room, and the OB assured me everything was fine.Now, here I am at 21 weeks of my first pregnancy, and our little girl is feisty. Any movement is a flurry of jabs, she'll react sometimes when I talk or sing after being quiet for a bit, and if she finds herself being squished (like one of the last times I wore pre-pregnancy jeans or when I eat far too much) she will not have it and starts kicking up a fuss.It's okay to worry and be cautious, but also keep in mind it could be your hormones making your worry even more, I know mine did. Hell, they still do lol. Just keep talking to your husband and be open with him about it, and talk to your doctor and/or OB about your concerns. It might also be a good idea to see a therapist, if you don't have one already, because it's possible to have depression with your pregnancy, not just postpartum, referred to as antepartum depression. I was diagnosed with depression years ago, and am currently taking Zoloft 100mg for it. (Under close watch of the prescribing nurse) So, make sure you're listening to your doctor, take your prenatals, eat as well as you're able, and keep talking it out and be open about your concerns especially with your Husband and Doctor. =) Plus, you can always come here again. This community is full of amazing, supportive people (mostly moms, but some dad's pop in for some advice and such on occasion) who have so much insight they are willing to share freely to those in need, myself included.

Aki-Lui [info] Rather than asking a question, I saw your other replies, and I’m sooooooooo glad and relieved that your mum believed you and took action, and that your dad got jailed. I hope he was treated like shit in there, and when he dies he’ll rot in a special hell. There’s sure a long way for you, but I hope therapies help you, and in time you’d feel (even though slightly) better. You have strength more than you think you have, bit by bit you WILL get better, kudos to you! I am a victim of childhood sexual abuse as well. By biological dad tho. I told my mum once when I was like 5/6, well she didn’t believe me, then accused me of making things up. In addition to my dad’s threat of killing me if I tell anyone and that nobody would believe me anyway, I never told anyone for another 8ish years. When I was 14 I was super suicidal and got admitted into mental hospital, in there doctors finally found out, and I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD. I got interfered with the police and all, but my dad never received any consequence because he denied everything adamantly, and mum of course supported him. In where I live people are innocent until proven guilty. When I finally got out of the hospital I attempted suicide yet a few times, but anyway now I’m doing *better*. [info] None [info] 1545956577
disenchantedguy [info] I was wondering if you guys could yelp me figure out what my moms deal is? I'm not really sure where to start...I'm in my 20's and I was diagnosed with depression over a year ago and didn't get much, if any support from my mom. I cut her out of my life after we had an argument and she said "You're confusing depression with laziness" earlier this year (there was a build up of other things, but that was the final straw) and I've been reflecting a lot on my childhood since. After reading posts here and talking to a few people I know for sure my childhood was anything but normal and I'm pretty sure I've been depressed since I was 11 or so.My parents split when I was 4, from what I've been told my dad was very violent and angry when he was younger and only really calmed down later in life so my mom and I got kicked out in the middle of the night and never went back.My mom took me everywhere and did loads of stuff with me when I was little as it was just us but things changed as I got older. I'd be looked after by my nan (who smoked around me constantly or took me to a pub where there were other people smoking constantly) and I was left to my own devices a lot of the time too, home alone. When I was 9 both my parents met new people and this is where things get crazy on my mom's side, my mom got pregnant, married and moved in with my new step dad very quickly, she moved my school which made me start to hate school, to the point where I got moved back to my old one again for the final year, but by then it was too late and it wasn't the same. In secondary school I got bullied a little bit in my first year, this time my mom's reaction was to go overboard and pull me out to homeschool me for a year, the absolute worst thing she could have done and a complete overreaction, she barely taught me anything and she was caught up in emigrating to Canada (never happened) at the time so funnily enough the little I did learn was about (or should I say aboot? 🙃) Canada... The rest of that homeschooled year was spent watching daytime TV with my step mom. After that any kind of education was just a write off for me, I got through secondary school just barely, sixth form? Drop out. College? Drop out. Uni? Drop out. My mom didn't support me through any of this, just kinda watched on as it happened and told me I need to do something with my life, get a job, stop being lazy etc. Never tried to figure out why I was so unmotivated and unhappy. I remember when I first started uni and I told her I was aiming for a first (which I was on my way to achieving) she laughed in my face.My step dad and I didn't get on at all, she wouldn't really step in when he shouted at me or stop him from doing it more and as a result was included with family stuff less and less through my teens as I either avoided it or wasn't invited. As a result I spent most of my time in my room by myself.There are all sorts of different crazy things my mom did though my teens and I don't want to think about and list every single thing right now so here are a few highlights:- Poisoned my relationship with my dad by telling me horrible things about him and always saying things like "you don't want to end up like your dad"- Insisted I called her a name under my breath in a super market once and punished me for it even though I said nothing.- Broke down crying saying she can't handle me and that I'm such a difficult child and that I say horrible things and put her down (when the opposite is true)- Came to me insisting one of my closest friends had stolen from her despite the fact she lets countless shady people into her house.- Shouted at me and told me to go away in the middle of a city I'd only been to once before when I was 14 or so then stomped off without me, frantically called me 20 minutes later saying I shouldn't have ran off.There are plenty of other things I can think of but I'd be here all day.The worst stuff has happened most recently. When I left home for uni I gave my oldest sister my old room so that she wouldn't have to share, I left my desk, laptop, bed, pretty much the whole room as it was for her to use. I was happy to do it at the time but I always had the expectations that my mom would buy her her own stuff, she didn't. When I asked for any of the stuff for my own place I got guilted into leaving it for my sister's sake.When I ended up dropping out of uni I had nowhere to stay, my mom only really spoke to me once a month if I was lucky and less most of the time at this point, just seemed to stop caring completely once I was gone. But I tried asking her if I could move back in anyway, she had said something along the lines of 'you'll always have a room here' and stupidly I'd believed her. I got a 'it wouldn't really be practical' answer back and so had to stay with friends. Over a year later things took another bad turn. I lost my job due to depression and had nowhere to go, this time she said I could move in and she'd turn the living room into a bedroom. I bought a single bed and mattress with what little money I had left and was ready to move in when she turned around and said 'you can stay but it can't be for long and you can't set a bed up, you have to sleep on a mattress on the floor and put it away in the day as I'm having guests over the Christmas period'.The last argument we had was where she said the worst stuff, I'd asked her for help with appointments and different letters I couldn't keep track of and money as it's all very overwhelming when I'm depressed but she told me I have to learn to take care of myself and that I'm confusing depression with laziness, when I called her out on it and said as someone who's studied mental health and also gone though it herself in the past she should be able to tell the difference she turned it all back on me played the victim and said I'm always horrible to her. After that I just blocked her on everything and stopped speaking to her, she's tried to talk to me a few times through my dad but still acts like she's done nothing wrong. Even wrote a status on Facebook about how 'heartbroken' she is that I've 'decided I'm better off without' her just to get a ton of sympathy messages from her friends, not once did she mention why I'm not talking to her.I just feel crazy sometimes and have to keep checking with other people that what I went through isn't the norm.I look at my step mom and step brother who are super close and call each other almost every day for a chat or just to check in and can't help but feel envious... my mom's never called me just for a chat or come and asked about my day or just checked of I'm feeling ok, not for a very very long time at least.Sorry for the wall of text and thank you if you've stuck through and read till the end.The tl;dr is, is my mom a narcissist? how do I get through to her and make her realise how she is towards me? Or should I just continue not letting her be a part of my life? Who do you go to for support of you can't rely on your family? [info] None [info] 1565101244

SerafinaDllRose [info] There's  just those of us that have that kind of chemistry - is all I can figure.  I absolutely HAD to read your post with a headline like that.  I mean, all I can say is "Same here!"At first, I was almost like ashamed or something because I got the feeling people thought I was making it up.   Now I'm trying different stuff to see if it makes a difference. For instance, I haven't been the healthiest eater so less meat, more veggies. Complained to my Dr about it - he had a full blood panel done. Way low in potassium for one thing is what I found out.  The other thing I'm trying to do is increase my activity level - bike riding, swimming, going to the gym.  Nothing crazy - just gradually. Lastly, I was diagnosed with depression and take an antidepressant.  I wondered if that had anything to do with it. Thanks for asking the question - I'll be watching this thread closely.

dylanfurr246 [info] I hate my life, what do I do? First off: no, I'm not suicidal, I'm too much of a coward, I have thought about it though. Anyways, let's begin. Everything was fine when I was in high school, then graduation came, everyone was going off and they knew what they were doing, and I stayed home all day. I can't drive (eye problems), the girl I love dearly thinks I'm a creep (I have a tendency of coming on to strong), everyone's moving on, and time is passing every second (I know you can't give advice about that XD.) Naturally, with all of these problems, I was diagnosed with depression. On top of that, I have no friends. My life sucks. If I wasn't so afraid of death and a coward about killing myself, I'd do it. Honestly, I see no point in living. Also, I can't go to college because I'm poor. Life sucks.EDIT: plus I'm fat and ugly (I have a baby face.)

ShanePolly [info] Helping with Depression Backstory about my situation followed by my questions. Looking for help and thought this would be a good place to ask. A while back I was diagnosed with depression and back then I was on some traditional antidepressant medication. The past year I had gotten off the antidepressant since I didn't need it anymore. The past month my life has sucked a lot and for the first week when I went back in the antidepressant I completely lost my appetite. Even getting the munchies wasn't the same. I decided to stop taking the medication since it was fucking me up really bad and started to just smoke a small bowl in the morning or whenever I was feeling depressed.

Elos707 [info] I push people away and isolate myself too much Well I was diagnosed with depression a long while back and things were fine but today my girlfriend had broken up with me. Although that’s not what upsets me. It’s how with every girl I’ve talked to or been with I’ve always pushed away. I’m also a guy that’s never been a fan of physical affection and have stated that to every girl I’ve talked to or been with but no girl can seem to deal with that and be patient enough for me to choose when to warm up and be affectionate. I also have a bad habit of fearing them leaving me so at times I’m slightly distant as well. I’m aware I do this to myself but I just don’t know how to deal with it. I just want a girl that’s more in a relationship for the mental understanding as I’d probably feel more comfortable then. Being there for each other, being able to comfortably break down in front of them, helping each other. That’s what I really want. I don’t want kisses or anything like that.

libelulas3v3n [info] I've struggled with tinnitus since I was 17, the time I was diagnosed with depression. I'm now 24. Honestly, I as well thought I was eventually going to kill myself when it all began. I thought it would never disappear nor get better. Truth is, from e to age of 18 to 24, I didn't notice it. I didn't even remember it. Recently, I became very depressed again, and tinnitus is back. It scared me a lot, since I had almost forgotten about it. I panicked all over again. But I'm trying to get used to it again. There are so many people with this condition that are still able to live their lives. Even me, with more or less struggle. And so will you, believe me. Right now, it's all very new. Eventually, your brain will have no option but to get used to it. Just remember, it's not a threat, you'll be okay.Try to see a doctor. They can help, in case your tinnitus is caused by some underlying condition that may be treatable. There are also hearing aids that can help, if you're eligible. You can search for exercises on the web, that might ease tinnitus.At night, leave the fan on, or a white noise machine. Or even a soft background music, something soothing like rain or other sound of your preference. It will help mask the ringing.Stay strong my friend. We're here for you. Your not alone in this. We all felt like you at once. [info] None [info] 1569492723

I wouldn’t even sleep from all the excitement.  All the decorations, the joy everything I loved it. This has turned from my favorite month to my most hated month since I was diagnosed with depression and other mental illnesses 3 years ago. Before that I started losing interest but I’d lie to myself like “yay December...” but I completely despise it now. The decorations, lights, joy, songs, everything, **I hate it**. Everybody is happy and getting together and having fun while I’m still alone in my dark room lonely, broken, isolated, depressed, scared, stressed. I hate it. I’m supposed to be so happy. Instead I’m sitting in my room hating myself to the point where I want to watch myself die slowly. All I want for the holidays is for me to die. It would be better for everyone.

I'm 30 now and trying to figure things out, but still a part time worker with no future prospects and barely made a dent on anything.

I have been diagnosed with depression, and I was on medication for that for awhile. I have attempted suicide in the past, and according to my therapist I have, "Major trust and abandonment issues."I just don't feel positive about the future, and if anything I'm just tired of trying when the reality is I'll only end up answering to someone else and being reminded about how worthless I am to everyone as a whole.

wintersass [info] Depression medication, depression and sex. 19 y/o, female, caucasianI was diagnosed with depression about 3 years ago and I've been on lamotragine and fluoxetine to help me function. About a year ago I got into a great relationship with a male, and we've been sexual for quite a while.I have a pretty high sex drive, which works out well between us, but my vagina just doesn't self-lubricate. We use a good water based lube since going dry is just not an option, but it'd be nice if my body could just do it on its own.Looking at my favourite porn doesn't work, neither does giving oral. Receiving only works because his saliva is slick enough to use, and teasing/edging doesn't help. It's got nothing to do with how aroused I am (giving oral turns me on a lot and playing with my clit doesn't summon any help from the pussy).When I spoke to my boyfriend he mentioned that it was a common side effects of antidepressants, and I want to know if that's true, and if there's any way for me to get wet without help (aside from going off my meds).

Ouroboros612 [info] Not sure if awesome covers it, maybe just sad, but I feel like sharing this one.    I worked an important evening shift (16.00-00.00) and we are only 2 people on that shift. So not showing is a big deal. Overslept so much I came in at 21.00. My boss was furious and I told her the reason was because I overslept - and the reason for that was because I was depressed, and how when you are depressed it leads to complete apathy.    Instead of firing me, she paid for a therapist. I thought I had delivered a flat on lie. But I was diagnosed with depression. I was actually depressed but I had been in denial, so I wasn't self-aware of it.     I thought I was lying to my boss, but I subconsciously told the truth.     Edit: I never showed late for work again a single time the remaining 2 years I worked there.  [info] None [info] 1542326866
tw231116 [info] I was diagnosed with depression when actually I have ME (also thought to be autoimmune, but we don't really know due to insufficient research). It should have been a clear indicator that I had tested positive for Epstein-Barr, but it was ignored. I was absolutely exhausted and was struggling to function as I was studying full-time and later working full-time. My body was just not working anymore and producing all kinds of strange symptoms like fainting frequently, constant sore throat, cognitive dysfunction and strange tingling sensations. They told me the exhaustion was caused by depression and told me that if I refused to take antidepressants, there was nothing else they could do for me. This is despite the fact I was telling them I was *not* depressed: I was suffering with low mood resulting from the exhaustion because I was no longer able to do all the activities I usually enjoy. I was also referred to a psychiatrist. After more than two years, just by chance, I was seen by a locum who finally referred me to an ME specialist, where I was diagnosed. The bad news is the condition is chronically underfunded and underresearched, so there is still no treatment available. I can no longer work full-time and have to manage the best I can without any medical care. [info] None [info] 1531995082

meizhong [info] You make a good point, and it was just a rant, but I still disagree. It is just my opinion, take it for what it's worth, but I feel like the noticeable traits of autism that make us in whatever way different from the neurotypical, stem from the underlying fundamental way I process information and think. In contrast, I was diagnosed with depression in my early 20s and I took medication and it worked and it was helpful. Treating depression did not change how I think. Maybe I can explain it like this, if I didn't take medicine for depression I see a glass half empty, with meditation I see it half full, but this doesn't change how I process that there is a glass of water in the first place. Also, don't misunderstand me as being against a cure, I'm saying I don't think there can be one. If there can, and you want it, great. Many people would benefit. But I think autism is a deep subconscious fundamental thing. [info] None [info] 1558357121
Deathmedical [info] A reddit for people recovering from depression and loneliness. I was diagnosed with depression the year before last and have  been undergoing treatment since which has helped tremendously. However because of the long time prior I've never developed any kind of social skills/life, hobbies, or made friends and figuring out how to do so might as well be brain surgery. Is there a reddit that i can chat with others like me without coming off as weird, awkward or desperate. I legitimately just don't know how to people out side of the internet.

Rhisper [info] I knew I'd get hurt Over the summer I was diagnosed with depression after a suicide attempt. My depression, suicidal thoughts, and self harm built up for years before it finally came out. I've been getting help now, but still not doing the best.Through therapy I found a lot of my misery and anger comes from my family. I have been talking to them less in the months after my stay in the hospital.I'm in the military so I dont go home a lot. But I decided to for christmas. I thought it'd be a good idea. My coworkers all advised me against it and when they asked where I was going on leave, I lied and said i was going to see a friend that lives in my home state. I got home today and I dont expect a huge greeting but at least a hello, hows life? Let's go chat in the living room for a bit. I got none of that. I sat in the living room by myself, hoping one of my parents or siblings would come speak to me.Later on I was talking to my dad about my car loan. I didn't know what gap is,after telling me he goes "so you better pay it off before the end of your contract because they're not going to let you reenlist with those coo coo games you want to play. Acting crazy so you can get off the ship. Yeah you're not going to last much longer."And that there ruined my day. So now I'm curled up in bed with my dogs, staring blankly at the wall. Part of me wants to just get up now, take my dogs and go back home. [info] None [info] 1545260389
MichaelWithAOnTheEnd [info] I tell truly hilarious stories. Or at least, before I was diagnosed with depression, I did. I would literally have people crying with laughter telling them about (for example) the time I went home from a bar with a member of the British Air Force and fell naked onto their friend whose room we were in, who they had drunkenly kicked out of the bed. The friend told me not to apologize because me falling naked onto his face was the most action he’d seen in months. Swear to god, verbatim quote. Once I developed depression and PTSD from dark and twisty things i won’t go into here, I lost that spark. I haven’t made anyone besides my SO or my family members laugh in a long while. My depression has been in remission for a little bit here, though! And I recently was able to discontinue my meds. I’ve just gotten out of the habit of being funny. OP, you’ve inspired me to share my comic experiences again. Maybe not the one about falling naked onto someone’s face. But i have lots of others!  [info] None [info] 1532018614
incapablepanda [info] So over the past few years, my company's CEO has personally paid for the increase in our health  insurance premiums as they pile on. The last year was apparently quite a bit higher than previous years to the point that his generosity was tested. So he made the choice so cut everyone's sick allowed sick time in half but he'll pay the increase. I'm not complaining. It's very generous for him to be paying the increase at all. He doesn't have to do that. But its still kind of a bummer that we lose sick time. Makes me wonder what they'll be taking away next year, or if they'll tell us to suck it up and pay the increases ourselves.When I was unemployed I didn't qualify for medicaid in my state and it was still cheaper to just pay the tax penalty. I work in an industry where you work 40 hours a week so you get health coverage anyway. I don't need Obamacare now, and it didn't help me at all when I was unemployed. The only benefit to me from the AHCA is that they can't increase my premiums because I've been diagnosed with depression and epilspsy or outright deny me coverage. [info] None [info] 1477435452

stalpno [info] You have an awesome jawline dude, mad jealous. Good on you for at least seeking therapy, if your parents don't cooperate don't be switched off from it as an option in the future. I was diagnosed with depression at 17 and got therapy at 18 and it really helped me turn my life around and find ways to like the person that I am.In the mean time, a thing that really helped me when I was in a bad way was a technique I was taught where every night before going to sleep I would think about 3 unique things I liked about myself or the world. It could be as simple as liking that paint provides colour to the world, or the atmosphere of a rainy day spent indoors next to a fireplace. It is amazing when you take the time to try and be present in the things that are good that you begin to notice how much good there is in life, and helped me be a little less pessimistic and get out of a negative depressed cycle that I felt trapped in.I hope you have a good week and that your parents can be supportive!

rapunzl129 [info] My husband works for a family business of less than 5 employees. I have my own small business. We pay for our own health insurance and receive no assistance for it. I was diagnosed with depression in 2005 and asthma in 2012. These 2 preexisting conditions prevented me from having health insurance before the affordable healthcare act. Since I've had health insurance again (got it in January 2014), I've been diagnosed with 3 additional conditions - all require regular doctor visits, blood work, and prescriptions. If the health care act gets repealed I'm afraid I'll lose my health insurance again and I have no idea how we'll pay out of pocket for my medical expenses.  [info] None [info] 1484536436
GwenCocoUgo [info] This won't be the best advice here, but this is what I did regarding the first part of your issue - your parents not wanting to take ADHD seriously. Take from this what you will. I was diagnosed at 17 as well. Exact same situation, and I was sent to a doctor by the school GC and so what followed was that I wasn't allowed to have sessions with the GC anymore either. What I did was stopped giving a fuck. I spent hours doing what I wanted to, which was watching TV. I didn't attend any classes first semester of college, and failed 3 of my 5 classes. I hated that, but I was still not caring. I wasted so much time it's unbelievable. Second year, I was put on academic probation and I was eating 200 calories a day (ED). went into treatment for ED after nearly fainting twice a day after 2 months of eating 1000 calories a week. Nobody had any choice then. I was either going to take antidepressants, or be dead. The doctors talked to my family. The treatment continued. I was 19 at the time, and had just survived an almost dangerous ED. Doctor visits continued, at the school clinic and for the first itme ever my family was spending money on my mental health because it was physical health as well. There I was diagnosed with depression, Anxiety, OCD and ADD. An entire year on drugs was not fun, and I don't even really remember it... but guess what, I was going through the motions of life. Getting up, going to class, etc. I finished uni in 6 years, but I finished ffs. It's been a struggle. It'll be a struggle for years to come I'm sure. Anyways, what's that got to do with you? Well, you could start by letting your mind take over. Just let all the horrible shit happen. It's kind of good to get all that out of your system young. LOL. BUT, do you honestly want to go through this? Do you want to wait until you're almost dying to get help? Dude, you're a kid and you already are more self aware than half people twice your age. You deserve to have a little help here. That help is either meds or a therapist. Do whatever you can to either convince your parents, or just go after it yourself. About the job; it's a communication issue. Make it a game for just this one day, see how bad you can actually get! Like actually try to be bad. Then don't try. Compare the two. Count how many blonde people you see. write it down! You're not a cashier now, you're just playing around. After you're done, go to your boss and compliment him on something. Thank him for giving you a chance. Butter him up. Then tell him you feel like you'd be a better fit somewhere else, and you'd like a chance to prove that to him.

I suspect I had depression since middle school (probably around 2003-2004) but always thought I just couldn’t cope. It was way more powerful to be assessed by a doctor than by my own biased self.

InstitutionalizedOat [info] Not the person you were replying to, but I was diagnosed with depression 12 years ago and I’m pretty sure I was showing signs of it a few years before that. I’ve stopped myself from trying to commit suicide for stupid reasons like my dog or because I really want to see how the new season of my favorite show ends. There are always some days that are better than others. It doesn’t just go away, but there are things you can do to try and help. Sometimes it’s relying on someone else, but for me, I try to focus on just living my life for me. The best thing my therapist ever told me to do was start each day by asking myself what I want to do. And not beating myself up if the answer is just staying in bed and not doing anything. It takes getting used to and I’m not saying it will cure everything, but your attitude is really concerning. Maybe if you looked more at yourself instead of thinking that people who do have more good days don’t suffer as much as you do, you might actually have some good days yourself.

I’m struggling with that a bit, because I have a 3 year old who gets up at night. Anyways! I had been taking Zoloft for an incorrect diagnoses, but stopped when I started the Seroquel. It has definitely been making me cycle faster and worse.But now I’m wondering if stopping it was a mistake. I’m feeling a little better, but still very emotional and angry. I just am so unfamiliar with any of the medications related to Bipolar, I was diagnosed with depression for 6 years. Should I give just the Seroquel until my follow up appointment? Or call my doctor and have her refill my Zoloft for me. She hadn’t been very clear on if I should stay on it or not. [info] Bipolar 1 [info] 1534035594
kdubbstep [info] Yes!!! I remember writing a letter to the advice column of Highlights for Children like “what should I do if my parents keep blaming me for things my brother did?” I never sent it because I was like... 8 ish? And I had no idea how to send a letter lol.God, so I’m an emotional person. An empath. And I’m really emotional (but now I’m fucked up in that department because I was conditioned to suppress my emotions. Suppressing my emotions kept me “out of trouble.” Like the child’s version of grey rocking (or whatever it’s called.) I remember one time I stole my dad’s vodka (it’s easy to block out emotions when your numb on alcohol). A few days later, my dad asked me if I stole his vodka. Me, I think either drunk or stoned this time, I can’t remember (I used substances a lot when I lived with my parents), just replied with a simple “no.” Apparently (my brother overheard this), my dad told my mom that he “knew” that I didn’t steal his vodka because I “didn’t bring on my usual ‘theatrics’, so because I was so causal about it (aka really just emotionally numb from drinking or drugs),  I  ‘obviously’ didn’t do it, that he probably just misplaced it somewhere.” See, showing emotions didn’t get me in trouble.Go back a few years, I was really depressed and cutting and stuff. Once my parents found my arm slashed, they took me to the ER. I was diagnosed with depression. My dad responded, “I thought it was just teenage, female hormones.”Plot twist, my dad isn’t the BPD, my mom is. But my dad was a huge enabler when it came to mom vs. me, and he would use “logic” to basically confirm whatever she would say. Or something, idk, i can’t even make sense of it TBH.

DimArtist [info] The first day was not great but not terrible. I had some cravings but nothing too severe. I used to have in the past severe cravings around Day 2. One thing I noticed it was that this morning was difficult because I always within 5 minutes when I wake up I used to smoke my first cigarette and I was pretty sad and I was not in the mood to talk to my colleagues at work. Also I was feeling sleepy, never understood why this happens every time I try to quit smoking. I was reminding myself of the mantras that Allen Carr says in his book and I was reading a list of the reasons why I am quitting. This seems to help. I am a bit afraid of the next days and I am feeling weird about changing my daily routine. Now I don't go to the smoking lounge when I take a break but to a different place and I will need some time to get used to. This is even harder for me because I am diagnosed with depression and panic attacks. Now for the Day 2. [info] None [info] 1565463091
Semicolon_Expected [info] It's a shame that even today mental health issues are still such a new thing and there is so much we don't know.I would like to share my own personal experience, because I believe myself to be one of those few. I had a great childhood, my family loved me, I had almost everything. I was a carefree child, I didn't have that many friends, but I didn't really care, life was great! Then around the time I hit puberty my moods started going downhill, and I started to not enjoy anything anymore; I didn't want to go to school, which I use to love, read books, I even started eating less. But the thing is nothing really changed for the worse; my family still loved me just as much, and in fact I had a lot of friends! This is when I started engaging in stupid behaviors because I didn't care anymore. I even attempted suicide and I still don't actually know why. It was then I was diagnosed with depression (obviously they would) To this day, i still cope with it and I don't know how it started and why I still have it.Life right now is pretty great from the outside looking in; I do well in school, I have an SO, I have a pretty good social life, and I don't engage in "high risk activities" such as drugs anymore. In essence, the onset of depression led me to a downward spiral rather than the other way around. In all honestly, I wish I had a reason to be depressed because it means I can fix it without taking medicines that have weird side effects. This is one of the reasons I feel the misconception that all depression comes from an unhappy situation is so damaging, because it's almost blaming someone for continuing to be depressed since if it comes from coping with a situation, they just aren't trying hard enough to get over whatever it is they have to get over and sometimes there is nothing to get over. It also makes it seem like depression so simple as someone can "just get over it" which doesn't help anyone.Sorry for the TL;DR [info] None [info] 1420486742

destroymysweatr [info] I'm not sure who I am, who I am supposed to be, or who I even want to be. (25/m) This could end up being a long one, I don't know yet. So strap in!I've worked quite a handful of dead-end jobs. I flunked out of college because I quit caring and now owe them too much money to go back. And even if I do pay them back, I have to pay out of pocket for my tuition until I get my GPA above a 2.0. Ouch. It sucks, because I know EXACTLY what I want to do, but don't have the resources to go back to school. So wander on in the limbo that is pennies above minimum wage, I will.I have a five year old son. I'm not with the mother anymore, and I've struggled staying consistent in his life. I see him once or twice a week, if that. I love him so goddamn much, but I simply don't know HOW to be a dad. We play video games together, go to the park, go for walks, play with his toys, wrestle, watch Pokemon together, and we both love every second of it. But when it comes to actual discipline, teaching, mentoring, I am simply lost. I'm lost because I don't have those qualities in myself. And it breaks my heart every fucking day. He's actually cried when he saw me crying because he wishes he could spend more time with me, and I feel like the biggest piece of shit.And then I see my friends. The ones who have graduated from college, the ones who have moved away from here, the ones who are really quite happy with their lives. This place fucking sucks. I want to move to Pittsburgh. Or Virginia. Or New York. I want to move away, get myself established and build myself up. But I can't leave my son behind. I won't. As little as I see him, I love the crap out of him. I want to be in his life. I want to be a positive influence because he's surrounded by so much negativity and stupidity on the other side of his family. But he needs a happy, whole, and structured father in his life. Not this man-child he has now.I don't exactly know what I need to do. I've been diagnosed with depression and I've struggled with it for ten years. I don't have insurance so I can't get back on therapy and medication. When I was, I was a boss. I had my stuff together. I was motivated. Also, my younger sister was diagnosed with Aspberger's a long time ago and I've always wondered if I have it as well. I don't know if that's hereditary or what, but I've shown a lot of symptoms of it.I'm not exactly NOT motivated right now. I just feel like there's no getting out of this situation. In the meantime, I've moved back home with my dad and I'm paying off a crap ton of debt. I'm hoping to be One Hundred Percent debt free by January. That would be awesome. But then what? I don't fucking know.I want to move away. But I can't. I want to be in my son's life. But I suck at actual parenting. The kid starts kindergarten this week. That just breaks my heart.

karlrowden [info] &gt;Back in the 1990's I was diagnosed with depression. I was literally just angry about some unpleasant life circumstance.So you should hate psychiatry because they slapped label on you, not invalidate people who can't work or care about their loved ones because they can't function, and hate themselves *because of it*.&gt;Now the word "depression" has a different criteria. What you are describing was not what I experienced when I was given that label.It has the same criteria, it's just that psychiatry overdiagnoses it and makes it worse instead of helping, which we all agree on. It's like having a broken leg and being given painkillers instead of mending it, of course it's bullshit. You enemy is psychiatry, not people who have depression.&gt;If its anything like my own life it has to do with not having enough personal power (if that means social, financial, freedom).What you're describing looks like range of normal emotions still. It's not depression. I'd agree with everything you are saying if that'd be definition of it, but as I said it's not that.&gt;If that's not the case then what is lacking?That purely medical conditions can cause it should tell us something. Maybe people were broken in childhood just like a tree can be broken when it's small and stop being able to function. We don't know all causes, only how it manifests, and that it's not simply range of emotions. I recall reading that in developing countries people with depression don't even complain about emotions that much (and it means that emotional part might be indeed a cultural phenomena), their complaints were primarily physical. I understand that this word is abused by pharma companies and medication commercials and all that bullshit, but doesn't mean that what this word describes doesn't exist. I agree that we might need a better word. I'd use something like behavioral shutdown with possible emotional manifestations, but it looks unwieldy.  [info] None [info] 1522566590
Gazpacho_Catapult [info] One night stand with a girl I did kickboxing with.  I found her quite attractive, but I couldn't for the life of me enjoy the sex. Tried several positions, hard/soft, fast/slow, nothing worked (and I was in the best shape of my life, I was going to fkn town on her!). I remember her riding me and all I could think about was what I needed at the supermarket. I ended up not being able to finish, which noticeably bummed her out, so I made up a story about supplements and told her it wasn't her fault, and then left (which I felt terrible about, but I was embarrassed as well).  I was diagnosed with depression 3-4 months later, was told sexual dysfunction was a common symptom, so chalked it up to that. [info] None [info] 1543992646
MeryCherry77 [info] I’m completely lost Hi. I needed to share this because I don’t know who to talk to (friends don’t understand, sadly).It’s Saturday and I’ve been in bed ALL day. I can’t bring myself to do anything. My house is very clean but my room looks like a mess. I didn’t shower even tho I know I need to, I can’t do anything else than lay in bed with my cellphone and it’s so sad for me... even if it doesn’t look like it, it’s sad to be like this. I don’t feel like doing anything, it would be the same if I had to be in bed just looking at the ceiling. I canceled a date with a guy because of this state of mind I’m having today.I was diagnosed with depression December 2017 so I’ve been taking fluoxetine/Prozac since that moment with ups and downs on the dosages, and my psychiatrist told me to lower the dose to half because he saw me in a really good state and I’m doing that but I feel so bad right now that I’m thinking to keep taking one like I used to.I’m also so tired of fighting with my mental body image. I’m a chubby girl and I hate myself so much because of it, but I can’t bring myself to do excercise. I am eating healthy tho but sometimes I don’t (like today) because of this feeling of nothingness I have.I haven’t been able to see a series, watch a documentary o read a book because I always have this feeling of “I’ll waist my time with that” but I’m actually wasting my time doing nothing. I need help. I need supportive people who know the struggle. People think I’m lazy. It’s not laziness. It’s just emptiness in your heart and mind... nothing makes me happy anymore.

FrostedPoptart [info] Prozac dosage increased two days ago. Are these new feelings happening coincidentally or is it the new dose? I was diagnosed with depression three weeks ago and put on 10mg Prozac once a day. I hadn't noticed a different at all for three weeks. If anything the last few days up until the third week I just didn't give a shit, I had no filter with anyone basically. I could had just been having a couple bad days though.I told my psychiatrist this and three days ago she increased my dose to 20mg. Since then, I have felt better and been lot more positive and just generally in a better state of mind. But since its only been a few days Im afraid that this is coincidental and I'll feel bad again soon. Can an increase in dose do something that fast or would it take a few weeks to get in your system like it does initially?I don't believe its a placebo because obviously Im skeptical.

behemoth9 [info] Does depression cause memory loss? Three years ago, I was diagnosed with depression but got better pretty quickly through therapy, it wasn't that bad of a case. I was fine for about a year when it sort of hit me again. For the past two years, I've been feeling depressed again but it's seemingly brought memory loss with it as well. For example, I can't tell you what I did this morning, I forget things all of my friends remember, what I ate for dinner last night, who some of my friends are, what I'm supposed to do tomorrow (I've actually been keeping lists so I don't forget), etc. From my limited knowledge, there's some sort of loose association between memory loss and depression so it could be that but could this be something worse?

CheapDimeStoreHood [info] Is this a comedown thing or a depression thing? So I recently got started on Adderall XR, 20mg per day. I feel totally awesome for the first few hours, but at a certain point I just start feeling depressed for no good reason at all. Stuff that seemed really fun earlier in the day now seems like a bore, chances I wanted to take turn into missed opportunities, and I again find it hard to enjoy anything at all. I have been diagnosed with depression for a long time, so I guess I’m wondering if these comedowns are related to it, if the medicine amplified the depression so to speak. If that’s the case, is there any way to mitigate those effects? I’ve been drinking a ton of water and trying to eat as normal, but things just sort of go downhill anyways. Please help me, I hate feeling this way and I don’t want to stop taking Adderall since I also have pretty bad ADHD. [info] None [info] 1561062179

Sacktchy [info] I don't know what to tell my parents I (17 F) am an atheist while my whole family of 5 are prodistant Christian. I stopped believing around 6th grade, that's also when I was diagnosed with depression. My whole family knows this and once my mom found out about my beliefs she dove deep into Christianity (going to o church more, reading the Bible, being more involved in church activities) at first I was made to go to youth group, Bible studies, and church, I was mad because it took away lots of my free time after school. Eventually I was able to stop going to bible study, last year I stopped going to youth group. I sometimes bring up not going to church, but my mom always says "it's family time!" Because we go out to eat after church. I have tried to compromise, I offered to make lunch or meet my family at the restaurant, but they always say no. I think I would be fine with going to church if I had a choice, but I don't. My parents make me, and if I don't then they threaten to take away my phone it my laptop. This past year I've been sitting down during worship (singing religious songs) to a. Protest, and b. Not worship. I have also slept during the services, witch is I admit, a bit rude. 2 weeks ago my dad told me to stand up during worship or he'd ground me. His reasoning was "it's rude to the the band and it's disrespectful to him." So I walked out of the sanctuary. For context the band cannot see me because of the stage lights that are nearly blinding, I think my dad just wants to look good in front of everyone. Since I sat outside if the sanctuary last week I figured I would sit out this week to, since it's my only way to protest without being mean to my parents (besides this we get along really well). I thought I could get some summer homework done instead of wasting my time in a sermon and I actually did get a lot done today. My mom came out and asked me why I wasn't in the sanctuary and that I was being disrespectful. I told her that I didn't want to go in because I didn't believe and if they didn't respect my lack of belief then I wouldn't respect theirs (though I've never said anything to them about their religion, personally I think it's fine for others to believe in a God, it helps. But I just don't and that's ok) after church we went out to eat as usual and my dad brought up the whole sitting outside the sanctuary thing, he told me that I was very disrespectful and that I was basically slapping them in the face. I couldn't control myself and started crying quietly, whenever my dad even raises his voice slightly I start to bawl. They kept asking me why I was so offended by their religion that I had to sit down during worship and sit outside of the sanctuary. Why I couldn't just spend one hour a week sitting next to them listening to something I don't believe in. I'm stumped honestly I just don't want to go to church, I like the free time in the weekend and I like to sleep in especially during the school year where I already have to wake up at 6am every morning. Not to mention I recently just got a job so I will have even less free time once school starts up. I love and respect my parents and I'm greatful for what they do for me, but I just don't want to go. I probably sound childish, I don't know. Can someone help me out here? Tell me if I'm doing something wrong or what I should say? My dad wants me to tell him why I don't sit with them. Sorry this post was so long, thank you for getting this far. Bye. [info] None [info] 1564338492

fading__blue [info] When I was diagnosed with depression, I didn’t want or need the people around me to “be strong”. I wanted to know that they had people to talk to about their fears and concerns, and that this wouldn’t end up destroying them.You obviously love your partner, and are trying to do everything you can to help him. But don’t forget to take care of yourself too. He knows this is hurting you; he needs to see that you’re finding a way to cope with what’s happening. [info] Asshole Aficionado [15] [info] 1566250246
Narcissism23 [info] A new chapter of my life. Hello all,I've had a really good day today. I wanted to share it with you all because I feel I am finally making the steps towards beating my depression.After a recent break up, today was the day I finally realised how toxic my ex was.We wanted to plant vegetables in our planter outside. She wanted parsnips so I made sure I found the seeds. She never watered it. I always did. I gave up because she showed no interest. She wanted something but didn't want to work for it. When I raised this she got very defensive. We had a cat, she brought with her when she moved in. It was a present she got from her Dad and step mom. We let him go outside and he got ticks and fleas. We had to bug bomb the house twice and wash him twice before I took him to the vet and got his vaccinations and spot on treatment. She never went to pick up the top ops for it. I always went. Again, she liked having the cat but not the responsibility of caring for it.Doing washing up, I would be standing in front it the cupboard under the sink. If she wanted something out of it, she never said excuse me. When I raised this with her she flew off the handle. How hard is it to have manners? The first time I was diagnosed with depression, I went in search of all the help I could get. I took the medication, I paid for private counselling. I did everything I could to get better. When she got a diagnosis of depression to, she refused the medication and didn't search for any help. She got on a waiting list for telephone counselling but never follow it up. I put all I could into trying to tackle the way I had been and get better, she never did. Instead she kept a hidden stash of painkillers ready for overdose if she needed it. I couldn't find them and felt held hostage to prevent that happening. I felt that if I expressed my feelings to her, it would end in an arguement. My feelings were being held hostage too. I talked to her ex before me. He received exactly the same treatment. I realised now that she had no capacity to change. Didn't want to take responsibility for anything. Wanted to take but never earn it.I am done with her and ready for the new chapter of my life. Wish me luck! [info] None [info] 1562882954
Kitchen_Moose [info] I'm 14. I was bullied by old classmates last school year. I was diagnosed with depression about two weeks ago. I was discharged from the psychiatric hospital one week ago. I went on a walk about three days ago, and I happened to see them as I passed by. One of them caught up to me on a scooter. Lucky for me, they never liked to be physical, and I knew more than likely I was going to be harassed to try and make me and easy target again. They asked what I'd been doing for the past month. I said "therapy" they asked "Why?" I simply said "depression" They responded with "That shit is fake. grow up." On the bright side, I'm now going to a different school then them, and the kids there seem much nicer. [info] 14 [info] 1565406535
Arrow156 [info] I kinda get that. I was diagnosed with depression at 10, was on meds for awhile but I didn't notice any difference except for a few bad reactions. Whenever I have a real shitty day my thoughts turn to death, maybe no so much suicide but just the longing to no longer exist.  Often I just feel so tired of merely existing, the day to day grind and the complete lack of meaning behind it all.  I see death and the cease of my existence as a relief, like the feeling of finally sleeping after days of being awake.  I've had these feelings for decades, it's now just a part of who I am. I don't worry that I'll ever commit suicide or put myself in danger or anything like that, I lack the energy to do anything; I just have no motivation, to live or to die. Anyway, the way I see it I just need to patient, death will take me eventually so I just gotta wait it out.  [info] None [info] 1351310248

My GPA was almost perfect until last semester.I am not sure what happened exactly, but a bunch of events happened back to back.First I was diagnosed with depression. Then I changed thoughts about my major. I also realized that my college years are about to be over and I had not even socialized a bit. Also some other personal things happened.Halfway through last semester I suddenly gave up. My grades dropped from A’s to B’s.Now this semester did not even start well and I’m on the verge of failing two classes only because I don’t study.These are hard classes, but I am sure I can manage them. But I just don’t feel like studying. I feel like there’s a lot of pressure on me and I’d rather sit on my bed and do nothing!I need some help to deal with the guilt and maybe some help to change the state of my mind.By the way these words are coming from a student who never got a B until last semester.

sayfromage [info] I can't sleep anymore It's 5:30 in the morning and I can't sleep. I just lay awake thinking about how I used to be happy. I was diagnosed with depression in college, about 8 years ago now. I've been on medication ever since then. For a while I was happy. I was in college, college was awesome. But now I'm in the real world and I'm just so miserable I feel like giving up. After college I tried looking for work. Couldn't find anything. Went to grad school, dropped out. That was a year ago. An entire year I've been looking for work. I reapplied to school. I'll be starting in the fall, but that feels so far away. Every day I wake up with no reason to get out of bed. All I do is play video games all day. I can't leave the house. I live in nyc and all I see is people going about their lives, and it just reminds me that until August I have nothing. I am nothing. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I guess I just wanted to vent. My therapist tells me that depression isn't permanent. That people have 'beaten' it. I don't think that will ever happen for me. I've tried different medications, pretty regular therapy, trying to work out and stay active. But I'm just dead inside, I don't enjoy anything and I just wish I could go to sleep until my life actually starts. [info] None [info] 1430472674

Garcity [info] Through Hell &amp; Back I just finished reading "Born Again," after some of recommended it to me.I blazed through this story faster than any comic or graphic novel I've ever read.What I just read is the very reason why Daredevil is and always will be my favorite super hero.In 2013, I was diagnosed with depression, though I'd been experiencing it since as far back as 2007. I'd been seeing a therapist since then, who helped me work through different psychiatrists as they tried to find a medication that suited me.In September 2015, I was hospitalized for a 51/50; the police were called because I was spiraling out of stability. After that, I was able to find an anti-depressant that helped give me a floor to stand on.Everything changed a year later. On September 9th, 2016, I was laid off from my job. Suddenly, I was cut off from my healthcare, and was scrambling to find a way to figure out my situation. I was able to switch to something relatively cheaper, but that didn't last long. I jumped from unemployment to temporary jobs as I worked through what has been the harshest winter of my life.As 2017 dawned, I felt like I was barely hanging on. During this time, I had reached out to my friends, who were gracious enough to be there for me. Sometimes, it was as simple as letting me lie motionless on their floor, so long as I had their company. I had little energy for much. But when my therapist informed me that she could no longer help me, I felt like I lost it.I purchased a length of nylon rope from the nearby Home Depot, which surprisingly, no one batted an eye to. I readied a stool and planned my suicide for the coming Sunday. My psychiatrist had called me to check in. I couldn't lie to her, so I tried to be as vague as I could. However, this would lead to my second hospitalization.After getting some access to meds and an evaluation from the hospital psychiatrist, I was released into my best friend's custody. I was on shaky ground for the next two months, though I was able to get another temporary job.I got as far as March when my job ended. I had hoped to gain unemployment benefits, but complications prevented that. I watched as my remaining funds dwindled in the month of April.Come May, it came to pass that I would need to leave the city I called home. I moved back in with my parents and looked for whatever work I could find. During these tumultuous months, I started reading Daredevil. I gained in interest after watching the Netflix series, which I immensely enjoyed. So I decided to started with some light ones: Yellow, Season One, but then moved into Brubaker's run. Eventually, I made my way to Mark Waid's iteration, which was very enjoyable for me. It showed me that Matt could get through adversity and still come out smiling.From May to November 2017, I jumped from a part-time job to another temp job. After waiting six months for an appeal, I was granted healthcare access again. I was able to find another therapist and psychiatrist. In short time, I got my meds again and was feeling right as rain.As December drew, my assignment with the temp job ended. But this time, I wasn't upset. I was ready. I mobilized and did what I needed to stay afloat. I've since managed to get another temp job and am working on finding stable employment.So, as I started the Daredevil Omnibus companion I was a little hesitant. I'm not much of a fan of Frank Miller's, considering he seems to have a fascination with overly-gritty tones filled with women as either prosititutes or strippers. But I was glad I was wrong about his Daredevil work. Every page I read, I wasn't just reading Daredevil's struggle, I was reading my own.I saw someone watch their life crumble before their eyes, to see themselves pushed to the deepest depths, and not only survive, but come back even stronger. There was a line that I muttered to myself while I struggled: Never Give Up. And lo and behold, a few pages into the Born Again issue, Matt talks about a lesson he never forgot: Never Give Up. Never. I'm not done with the Omnibus yet, but I'm sure I'll enjoy it. For me, Daredevil has become a personal hero of mine; in the way I'm sure he is for may of you. For me, it's not just because his name is also Matt. It's that I know what he's been through. And seeing him go through that made me feel that I can do it too. I'd only gotten back into Daredevil after a 8 month hiatus. But now, more than ever, I'm back into it. So much so, that I'm going to commission someone to make a Daredevil suit for cosplay. I want to don the red, become the hero that inspired me.For we both wenth through Hell and back. And likewise, I wouldn't have gotten through this without the help of my friends: my Karens, my Bens, my Foggies, and myself.Thanks,Matt G. [info] None [info] 1516841774
5thEditionFanboy [info] Not sure if my parents are emotionally abusive or not Title says it all, as far as questions. This isn't a "should I call the police" situation, I just want some input on whether their behavior is healthy and normal. My parents have always been very controlled, and I've always accepted that its somewhat normal, despite all of my friends parents being more lenient/forgiving/accepting, etc. A few years ago I was diagnosed with depression, and since then they have surveilled me near-constantly, in what I hope is a misguided attempt at helping me. They've forced me into many therapist appointments and hospital visits, even once calling the police (my father works for the department, so many of them are his friends) to force me to be institutionalized (unnecessarily, and without any positive outcome for me). They limit time on pretty much everything I do, don't let me keep a computer in my room, they shut down our internet after 10PM, and anything I "own", they claim to own, as its in their house, their reasoning has always been "If you're under 18, you have no rights other than to be fed and not physically abused". I came out as bisexual recently, and immediately upon learning, they demanded an immediate Skype conversation with my boyfriend where they asked him personal questions without any formal introduction, or even illusion of respect or care for him. They assured me that this was normal, and that they were just looking out for me, but I doubt it. Their homophobia has not only caused me to drift away from their religious and political views (which has resulted in many shouting matches with my father after I make a comment about ICE, capitalism, or any of many current political issues), but also has made me aggravated constantly, and in lieu of a healthy way of venting it (since they don't tolerate any steps out of line), its caused some relationships with my friends to become toxic, as well as essentially destroying my relationship with my boyfriend of almost a year (same one they terrorized almost 6 months ago). I've always assumed (or hoped, rather) that this was just "teenage angst" and "a phase" and all the shit they told me, but I don't know if I believe it anymore.Quick edit: if something isnt going my dad's way, he'll often call me "loser" "punk" "idiot", or accuse me of having a persecution complex, anything demeaning in regards to brainpower or intelligence/wisdom, just thought that might also be a tad relevant in someone's analysis [info] None [info] 1566449877
I-Am-The-SquidQueen [info] Is it possible to feel sad when you are depressed I am diagnosed with depression.  I guess I'm asking this because most of the online community describes depression as numbness, but that's not my experience with it.  Sure, I feel numb a lot of the time.  I don't have the drive to get out of bed or go to classes or work, and I drag myself through each day like a robot, but... I'm *sad.*  So damn sad.  For no reason.  Sometimes I can forget about it for a little while but it all culminates every few hours or so and hits me all at once, and I shut down completely and just cry for awhile.  I feel like my illness isn't "legitimate" because of this.  Maybe I'm just a crybaby and need to get over it, the sadness means I'm not *really* depressed so I shouldn't be wasting the resources that people with more severe issues need.  I'm afraid to seek help for it - I'm afraid I'll be turned away or disregarded because other people have it so much worse than I do [info]  [info] 1520655933

Vanillexhope [info] Had a Breakthrough I've been diagnosed with depression for about 20 years, but some also say Bipolar 2. I have some 'episodes' where I'm super depressed. I'm in what I would consider the worst of recent memory. My husband wants to move us to Bolivia for 3-6 months. I don't want to go and it's causing strain on the marriage. I came into therapy today explaining that I'm so depressed that I can't even properly support my husband and his needs right now (he really needs support from his wife on this move and also our future). We've been talking about possible divorce ever since this Bolivia talk came up.      It hit me hard when she pointed out that maybe it's not that my depression is simply affecting how I'm responding to the situation but that the situation is affecting my depression. I know that seems obvious now, but it was still big. And then she said, "It sounds like you are facing a huge decision -- move to a country that you don't want to, or face divorce which means losing your 16 year relationship." Then it hit me -- yeah. That's true. I've been suicidal for the past couple weeks, I couldn't bring myself to tell her that but I know she understands that I'm at my lowest I've been since we started over a year ago. But it makes sense -- I'm facing moving to this country temporarily or what feels like a death in my life -- losing my best friend and life I've made.   I thought my depression and this move were completely unrelated. I guess that's why I pay her the big bucks to make connections that seem obvious after the fact. [info] None [info] 1533581614
marc2377 [info] Tinnitus louder when opening mouth - does that mean the cause is Temporomandibular joint dysfunction, or not necessarily? Hi.I am diagnosed with depression and ADHD, and have had tinnitus for about 8-9 years now (that I remember). For the longest time, I linked tinnitus to depression in my case, since with some medication it appears to get better with time, while other meds make it worse. It also appears to be related to how anxious I feel and how well I sleep.**However**, I recently found I have bruxism (sometimes during the day, sometimes at night), and possibly TMJD as well. I found my tinnitus gets much louder when I open my mouth or yawn. I do have pain on the temporomandibular muscles on most days. My upper and lower jaws don't quite fit, and as a result, my teeth don't tipically sit in a well rested position.**What I'm wondering** is just how likely it is for tinnitus to worsen (momentarily) when someone opens their mouth, and still their tinnitus NOT be related to TMD or bruxism.In other words: if T gets louder when opening mouth, is it a surefire sign the cause is TMD?Note: I'm 25 and for all I know my hearing is quite fine and always has been.&amp;#x200B;Thanks [info] None [info] 1570507182

Ballistic_Introvert [info] I didn’t know this could happen, but it does make sense. I was diagnosed with depression and hospitalized after my parents found out I self-harmed (12 at the time...now 13). The hospital was horrible. I’m traumatized and since I’m a child, people don’t listen. They instead say I’m “too young” to face anything serious and that I’m being overdramatic. Now, it seems hard to focus at times and I tend to have to ask my peers what we are doing because I get lost in my thoughts. I also feel as if my intelligence has decreased. I’m very grateful I have my group of friends. They are always here for me since my parents aren’t.  [info] None [info] 1541994022
definitelynotSWA [info] I have several similar experiences, a couple with young women doctors as well. I feel like they see I have depression and so that discounts everything else about me. Like yes depression can cause chronic pain, but I don’t think it’d be causing how if I bend a certain way my back feels like it was either struck by lightning or I just go numb and fall down? I’ve once had a GP who was a woman tell me that all women have sex issues and that it’s normal to experience zero sexual pleasure. Before I was diagnosed with depression lolI don’t distrust my doctors per se, but I’ve had enough issues with doctors not trusting _me_ that at this point I just do a lot of research and bring up possibilities when I go. Having to advocate for myself is tiring when dealing with mental illness, chronic pain, and the insurance system. I’d rather just push for tests when I go than keep coming back because the doctor misdiagnosed me with something without doing any testing and telling me it’s all in my head. :/These aren’t even small town doctors either. They’ve been at Boston or LA! [info] None [info] 1524917025

Gothbot6k [info] Just sinus stuff. I can't afford psychiatric stuff like I want to. I used to be on my fathers awesome Health Care plan but then when I graduated from High school he dropped me from his health care plan even though he could have had me on till I was like 25-26. I applied for Medicade and was turned down. So now I am on my colleges health care which means I can go to the nurses office for health concerns. I have been wanting to see a psychiatrist/psychologist for about two years now but it's just too much money sadly. I have been diagnosed with depression and a few other things from when I used to go years ago but I just can't afford it right now. It's one of the main reasons why I want a job so bad.

csyrett [info] I absolutely agree. I was diagnosed with depression about 10 years ago. "I can't have depression, I'm a man" was my response.It took a good few months afterwards to realise and acknowledge I was actually sick.In December I had suicidal thoughts and am now not at work, pending a medication review. It's tough. I am normally a fully functioning articulate person who now finds basic life really frustrating. I struggle to speak to family about it but it does help to know people out there.It has annoyed me that some attitudes towards mental health in sports is "they have everything, what have they got to be depressed about?".

Depression can be, and is, indiscriminate.I hope that more people talk about it and we do get rid of the stigma. It might have helped me come to terms with it sooner. [info] None [info] 1517425312

Hime_Takamura [info] Ever since my older sister moved home, I've come to realize that my family doesn't like me. They love me like a family should, they care for my well-being and take care of me, but they don't like me and it's my fault. This is gonna be a long one. I'm sorry. I've never talked to anyone about any of this so it's just kind of all spilling out now. I'm not a very good writer so this may be very disjointed, I'm sorry.To make things easier:I am a female, currently aged 24 and my family and I live in Texas.My oldest sister is 6 years older than me and I'll call her E.My second oldest sister is 1 year older than me and I'll call her M.My youngest sister is 9 years younger than me and I'll call her R. She has Downs Syndrome.I was diagnosed with depression when I was in 5th grade after years of already struggling with it. The first time I tried to kill myself, I was about 12 years old. I took a bunch of pills, both mine and my mother's. It didn't work. I tried laying in bed waiting to die but I got scared of some wasps outside my window right next to my bed so I went downstairs. I sat in me and my sister's play room and watched a movie (I think it was Romeo and Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio). I got hungry and I stumbled into the kitchen to make a sandwich. I got really dizzy and couldn't concentrate and I asked my dad to finish making them for me. As I was walking back to the play room, I blacked out for a few second sand came to lying on the ground. My dad and my oldest sister were next to me and my parents ended up taking me to the hospital. I recall laying in the hospital bed and my mom sitting next to me with my dad. She said "She'd better not be faking this." My dad asked me if I took all the antidepressants because I thought taking more would make me more happy and I lied and said yes because I was scared of getting in trouble for purposefully trying to kill myself. The second time I tried to kill myself was when I was December 21st, 2010, when I was 18. My recent ex-boyfriend had cheated on me with one of my friends and all the friends in that group didn't think it was a big deal so I isolated myself from them. I lost my best friend because he would rather hang out with the girl my boyfriend cheated on me with and left me for. It was half way through senior year and everyone else in school had already grouped off in the months and years before so I had no one. I was alone and I didn't want to suffer anymore while also getting back at my ex friends. "This will show them" I thought, "They'll have to live the rest of their lives knowing they drove a girl to suicide." I took 40 sleeping pills while my family and I were staying in a condo out of town for Christmas and visiting family. When I survived, I was embarrassed. My mother was mad at me again and yelled at me in her room loud enough for the rest of the family and cousins to hear. Everyone had to take shifts watching me for the next few days making sure I didn't fall asleep and die. My cousin had to clean up when I vomited up all the pills. I remember my late grandfather telling me that throwing up was good and it was my body getting rid of all the bad things. When I graduated from high school (I didn't go to the ceremony since I didn't have any friends anymore) my parents forced me to go to college despite my protests. I always hated school and I still didn't even know what I wanted to do with my life. I chose the school that E went to, up in New York. I had always been an underachiever. In high school, I took the borderline remedial classes so I could get straight A's and barely have to do anything. All my school and homework would be done within minutes in class and I would spend the rest of my time drawing. In college, I was immediately overwhelmed by everything and ended up flunking out after about 2 months. I had to call my parents, sobbing and explain to them that I was a failure and had flunked out of a very far away and expensive college. They let me come home and move in with them. For the past 5 years, I've lived at home with my parents and disabled sister. I have a part time job getting paid to provide respite care for R although I'm practically her mother at this point. I'm ashamed to say I haven't been very kind to her at all and on occasion in the past, I've taken out some of my anger on her. Not in an abusive way, but I've screamed at her and on a few occasions years ago I hit her. When I was a child, I was so excited to have a little sister. My friends had little sisters and I thought it would be so cool to have someone to teach about new things and have fun with. Unfortunately that never happened. After the first few years of her life, I realized she would never grow up. She'd always be a baby, she'd never be normal, and she would never be able to take care of herself. I resent her. I wish she had never been born. I hope every day that she'll get in some sort of accident and die so no one has to deal with her anymore. After she was born, my parents had no time for the rest of us. We didn't get to go out and do anything because of R. I hate her.Lately, my mother's health has been declining. She almost died last year because of surgery complications and this year she's gotten one of her knees replaced. She needs a walker to get around. So I stay at home and take care of her and R. A month ago, M moved back home. She's hardworking, determined, and outgoing. My polar opposite. I'm lazy, depressed, unmotivated, and a shut in. Ever since she came home, she's been helping and doing way more than I have. Rather than get motivated and try and keep up with her, I just wallow in self pity and cry in my room. M is also very mean sometimes. We used to be so close when we were children; we were like conjoined twins doing everything together. Now, she'll yell at me and berate me for being lazy. This morning, she put a bag of maggot infested garbage in my room because I neglected to take out one of the trash bins on trash day. My parents didn't even care. Now that M is home, they don't need me anymore. I'm just in the way. But I have nowhere to go. I have no one to turn to. I wish I could blame all of my faults on my depression but I feel like I'm just using it as a crutch. All I ever do is make excuses. I'm not a good person. I'm lazy and childish and selfish and I'm not making anyone's lives better by being in them. I'm just bothersome to everyone and I feel like I'm bothering everyone just by posting this. I'd be better off dead but I'm too much of a coward to pull the trigger. I'd just make a huge mess and then everyone would hate me for making them have to clean up after me. The worst part is, I don't deserve to be depressed. I have all of my finances covered, I was never abused, My family is upper middle class, and I have a wonderful boyfriend (albeit one I could never say any of this to). Other people have it much worse than me and yet I'm the one wallowing in self pity, cutting my arms and sobbing into my pillow. I'm the worst. [info] None [info] 1477857579
JiffyFrose [info] Oh God. Your mom sounds like she's from the generation where you "pretend it doesn't exist and it'll go away". Depression doesn't work like that. In fact, it gets worse if you ignore it. I'm sorry, but if you tried to commit suicide twice, and your mom still thinks that there's nothing wrong, she's really got her head in the sand. It's good that you went to therapy, even if it was for a few months. However, only going for a few months isn't enough to make a lot of progress. It sounds like you're having "crashes" as I call them. It's when you get so upset that you cry your eyes out and you lose control of yourself, to the point where you either cut yourself, or you have to worry about an attempt. I have has those before, and they're extremely scary.The fact that your mom is emotionally blackmailing you is disgusting. She sounds very emotionally abusive. Maybe it would benefit you to visit r/raisedbynarcissists It's good that you recognize that you need help, and it sucks that your mom is being a complete bitch about it (I'm sorry if this term offends you, but this really pisses me off). Physical illness is NOT a choice. Mental illness is NOT a choice. You know what is a choice? How you treat people. Your mom chooses to be a bitch. I can't believe that she would go above and beyond for her animals, but she couldn't give 2 shits about her kid. What kind of mother does that? I'm so grateful that my parents did their best to be supportive of me when I was diagnosed with depression.Also, you didn't self-diagnose yourself because you were diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Number 2, it may be true that you have nothing to be sad about, but depression is a brain disorder. You could be the richest person in the world, with the most wonderful spouse, children and have the most envied life, and you would still have depression. It sounds like yours is genetic rather than situational, which means that there ISN'T a reason to be sad, it's because your brain is telling you toHave you ever heard of [Kati Morton?](https://www.youtube.com/user/KatiMorton) She's a therapist with a Youtube channel and talks about ALL sorts of mental illnesses, and dealing with parents. I'm sorry if I offended you by calling your mom a "bitch" or a "narcissist" It's just that your story is so similar to mine in certain ways that I can see from your shoes. I can't imagine going through this without support and it upsets me that your mom isn't supportive. I really hope things change for the better. [info] None [info] 1476567528
Keirall [info] Years ago when I was struggling with grad school, I was diagnosed with depression, which I now believe was the result of undiagnosed ADHD. After bad luck with a few SSRIs, I was prescribed Wellbutrin (bupropion), which worked pretty well for me - it works on dopamine rather than serotonin and is sometimes prescribed for ADHD. Since an ADHD diagnosis and treatment don't seem possible in your country, perhaps you could suggest to your doctor that you'd like to try bupropion. [info] None [info] 1537563713

dexterduck [info] A 'Thank You' to this community I started having symptoms about two years ago, mostly fatigue and brain fog. I was diagnosed with depression and tried about 6 different medications over the course of a year. After that, I started to suspect a hormonal problem, but after several visits to the endocrinologist, that was ruled out as well. Out of ideas, my psychiatrist tried to treat my symptoms using ADHD medications, which actually worked for a while, but pretty soon I was feeling even worse than before.I eventually stumbled onto POTS and the umbrella of autonomic disorders, and everything seemed to click. One day when I was feeling particularly terrible, I decided to buy a gatorade and suddenly felt 80% better, which made me pretty confident that I had POTS. Unfortunately, that was back in May, and it would take over a month before I could see a cardiologist, and several months after that before I could be seen for a tilt table test. I finally went in for a tilt table test just a few days ago, and although the experience was miserable, and the results were inconclusive (hospitals and needles make me very anxious, so my 'resting' HR was 90 and my blood pressure was spiking like crazy), the administrating doctor still felt that the results were enough to diagnose me with 'some kind of autonomic disorder.'------------------------I have an appointment for next week to be put on beta blockers, and I just want to thank everyone on this subreddit. This is the first time I've actually posted here, but finding this community convinced me that it wasn't just in my head, and really helped me find information as I moved forward with trying to finally get a diagnosis.

Create_Delete [info] I only just found out what DP was and the unnecessarly long story of what made me realise I had it, how do I go about telling a doctor? So when I first looked into this I thought it was very similar to what I was feeling, or had been feeling for like 3 years.A lot of the online stuff explains it to usually be from some sort of trauma, but when I think back none of it was specifically traumatic. However the more I think about it, the more little things that happened that I never quite forgot and stuck with me. I had no idea that they were traumatic until I realised that I remember every detail when I think to one event. This was pretty confusing and a big thing, I've been diagnosed with depression and I accepted that, done and dusted, plain ol' depression. End of story.But I think it is depersonalisation most of the time, and when something really shit happens it can go into derealisation, where I'm walking and can't feel my legs and often even if I take a different route home, I look up and I'm there in front of the Door with no concrete recollection of the walk. And that is like a catalyst for my depression as sometimes I find myself watching a car drive past me and thinking about walking out in front of it. Not that I would its too selfish of me, to my family and to the driver, and to the hospital and shit.But yeah, anyway, I noticed that depersonalisation is accountable for a lot of my behaviour and thoughts, and I didn't even know it was a thing, like honestly, I'd still be in the dark if my friend hadnt recognised the symptoms I explained to her as DP. This post is all over the place, but I also saw a video with a singer dodie, where she had a therapist woman and they explained that it's not always from a big trauma but It can be a build up of tiny traumas over time which I believe is what's happened to me, and now I find myself blocking out the bad emotions, and it's gotten out of control to where I'm blocking everything. When I'm talking to me friends I zone out and can't come back and they think I'm disinterested in the topic,  and I realised that every day I look in the mirror and I look not different but like I don't identify it as me, like I recognise my eyebrows and nose and can see its clearly me, but I don't know who that is. Sometimes I look hot af and I can appreciate that but often I see a tired, greasy haired uneven girl that looks she has no style and lives in pj's. My thing is how do I talk to the doctor about this and do I need to? A part of me wants to know for sure, get the sense of clarification a doctor can give, but I have already had 2 of my 6 counselling sessions with the uni so maybe I should talk to her? She didn't seem to recognise it in the last session as a disorder when I was explaining how it felt. My fear is going to the doctors and them telling me it's nothing, and that I've read up online too much which has happened before or at least the disbelief from a doctor has, and it is not fun. Any thoughts on what I should do next? [info] None [info] 1514856261

Vertigo17498 [info] Pv=nrt.The dude gave us values for r in multiple units so that for example I can calculate a missing volume in atm if it is liter or calculate missing pressure and another one for multiple units an told us to memorize them.I am like what the fuck. We know each unit and their conversions and can get the pressure and volume in any fucking unit I want.The pressure of a fixed amount of ideal gas at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the volume according to boyle’s law or by pv=nrt and change it to p=nrt/v and nrt is a constant so if v doubles p halves.No we dont do that here we use a longer more stupider method.Yesterday I had a panic attack and I have been diagnosed with depression and wanted to lay down and do nothing.But then I remembered that I want to change the world,do something instead of being slaved off in a company like elon musk.I then snapped out of it and continued to study.This is to put into prespective how important this is to me.Without this determination I would continue to feel this “emptiness”.But this determination is slowly fading especially since today a professor gave me 0/10 in the physics lab for no reason whatsoever even though I calculated all values correctly.I feel like this college is eating away at my sanity.What would you do ?

MrZane113 [info] Ok so get a 2nd opinion and be totally honest with them don't hold back idk if u have BP I'm not a doc but if u think/know something was wrong then u have to be honest to get the help u need. I will now sum how not being honest affected my life (it's kinda long)Ok so at 17 I was diagnosed with depression I had the thoughts of suicide constantly (never really told them that cuZ I was ashamed just said I was sad)  they gave my Zoloft. at 21 I had back surgery that turned in to a drug addiction for a few years(not really sure how long) I snapped one night slit my wrists and thankfully called my lil bro to tell him I loved him I passed out with him on the phone (from blood loss).  Thankfully he could tell something was wrong and called 911 24 Staples later I was diagnosed with major depression disorder I moved back to my home town spent 9 months in and out of the hospital (not sure how many it was more then 6 though) every time I held back I was not totally honest I told them what they needed to hear I did not follow up with therapy I did not take my mental health seriously.  Then my cousin on his 15th bday hung him self I honestly can't explain what it did to me cuz it was so uncontrollable and just down right unbearable (I wish I new him better cuz I new how he felt but never really told anyone) 2 night before the funeral me and my bro get in to an all out fight (we are both 6'2 and work out it was a battle Royale) once again I tried to kill my self by slitting my wrists but I did it in front of everyone (it was really just a cry for help) I spent that night in jail naked in the suicide Ward.  Thank God they did not press charges I got home flipped out again and once again the cops came but this time I got sent to the exit in a mental health facility.... honestly this sounds horrible but the only reason I was actually honest for the first time was cuz my cousin killed him self it gave me motivation to get help cuz I new I was fucked in the head.  So for the first time I was totally honest I told them everything the sex the drugs the suicidal thoughts the paranoia fucking everything I never visually hallucinated but I awalys had my own voice in the back of my head telling me to kill my self.  That being said I hit the 2 year anniversary of my diagnosis about to weeks ago I got a fulltime job that I'm kicking ass at I'm mostly stabe when I'm not I fake it till I make it.  I still live at home (which sucks cuz I'm 28 and wanna date but its only temporary)  the worst part is it took the my cousin suicide to be honest.  Sometimes I think if I would have just been honest with the family in the beginning I would have been diagnosed earlier he might still be alive maybe I could have been there for him...but u can't change the past u can only move forward and learn from the past. My point is if u want to get help u have to share your deepest fears your most personal feelings u have to be vulnerable it's the hardest thing I have ever done I wish I would have had the strength to do it sooner maybe things would be different.Happy new years my friend I wish the best for u and truly hope the best for u.

throwawayprince123 [info] Periods and depressive episodes? Hey, everyone. I seriously think I have Bipolar II, as I've been diagnosed with depression but I'm sure I have hypomanic episodes as well. However, I've never discussed these with therapists since I always thought this was just my personality. (Since I was a kid, if I was not depressed I'd get ridiculous schemes/goals, a delusional sense of importance, incredible energy, racing thoughts, etc..) My boyfriend, who has diagnosed Bipolar II believes my symptoms sound a lot like his.Anyway, I have also been diagnosed with PMDD. Years ago I started bc and it has worked a little bit but I still get depressed the week before my period. I won't understand what's going on then I'll check my calendar and- oops! Guess it's that time of the month soon.This has just happened to me and I'm beyond frustrated. I was going through a long hypomanic episode- channeling all of my energy into my art. I was an art machine for days. This is all I do. When I don't do art I don't have much of a life. Suddenly today I am depressed as hell. Sure enough- period next week. I am really just so frustrated. I feel like my body just hates me for being born with a uterus.  I've read that hormones can influence the way someone experiences Bipolar symptoms.Anyone deal with this? Anyone have tips? Has any kind of treatment helped, if you've dealt with this? Thanks in advance, even if you just wanna share your experience it would be greatly appreciated but obviously no one is obligated to share! [info] None [info] 1516332751

To me, to be forced to wait 9 long months as your body changes (oftentimes irrevocably) and your hormones wreak havoc on you only to then go through the trauma of birth for a child whose conception you never even consented to, and then having to deal with the mess that is adoption...It's horrific to me, that anybody would think that is okay to do to a woman.I live in Alabama. I graduated several months ago. Sex Ed was literally a presentation in which a church came in and showed us a slideshow of very graphic images of std-ridden genitalia. They told us that if we had sex, this would happen to us, and we needed to wait till marraige. They said that condoms had a 90% failure rate (blatantly untrue) and that birth control was against god.We had over 30 teen pregnancies in the coming years. I watched girl after girl drop out of school. Many turned to drugs. A few sunk into poverty and went homeless.  One killed herself, because she couldn't bear the social stigma and rellentless bullying she recieved.My family also is a foster care family. We have taken in several foster kids.These kids are often very unwell, mentally and physically. They're malnourished, distrusting, and cynical. They haven't been treated well, they've been in abusive households, and many, many, many of them were simply children whose parents never planned for them. Around 20% of foster children report having sex before the age of 13. Sexual abuse is far too common.In my eyes, any sort of restriction of abortion has to come AFTER these problems are fixed, because otherwise these will only compound each other.  40000 infants go into foster care each year and over 20000 children never leave it, simply aging out. Thirty percent of the homeless were once in foster care. You cannot possibly think its better to have a child live a life of misery for years and years and years, whilst also putting a huge burden on the mother (who, most likely, never knew a single thing about safe sex, like my entire graduating class). Nobody is happy to get an abortion. They get one because they don't have any other options. What about places that don't offer shit for maternity leave? Is a single woman who works a demanding job just supposed to quit her job, because her pregnancy makes it hard to keep up? The risks with giving birth alone, to me, justify abortion, simply because it seems immoral to me to force someone to take a risk of death, or even permanent injury, trauma, or the psychological risks of PMD or other illnesses. I have post traumatic stress disorder. I was diagnosed with depression also last year. I am not an expert on mental health. I do not claim to be. However, I have no doubt that the pain and trauma of childbirth, the scars, and the bodily changes with it, can be mentally crippling. This is doubly true if unwanted.Sources: https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/FosterCare/story?id=2017991&amp;page=1http://www.center4research.org/teen-pregnancy-foster-care/https://wehavekids.com/adoption-fostering/20-Random-Foster-Care-facts [info] Non-Trump Supporter [info] 1528863109
Audioslave212 [info] This is something I’m dealing with right now actually...I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13 or 14, and took medication on and off various times between then and now (I’m 18 currently.) It never seemed to do much for me and I never committed to taking it for long periods of time (which is probably why.) Less than two months ago I started ADHD medication, and it has been fairly effective in helping my symptoms. My focus and memory are significantly better, between college and work I don’t have much trouble staying engaged and fulfilling my duties. However, my biggest issue, which I assume is from the ADHD and depression comorbidity, is lack of motivation. I find it difficult to do anything I enjoy, or lack enjoyment in the things I do. Even when taking my meds I still end up sucked into my phone or laying in bed for hours. The ADHD medication doesn’t seem to help remedy that, and I’m considering going back on depression medication because of it. I’ve also started seeing a therapist, so we will see how that goes. No one is exactly the same, so you will have to find what combination works best for you, these are just my experiences with depression and ADHD. Good luck and have a nice night :)  [info] None [info] 1538882630
Talmania [info] I feel your pain. I was diagnosed with depression many many years ago and the psychiatrist prescribed me Lexapro and continued to treat me for the first year (seeing every 3-4 months) and then my companies insurance changed and I was out of benefits after one visit. By this point I’d been on it for approaching 18 months and was doing just fine but he still insisted on seeing me every 4 months and collecting a 250.00 fee for a 30 minute session and would not write a prescription without an accompanying visit. Fuck that guy.  [info] None [info] 1553134397
holdenthomas [info] Does anybody else struggle to see the light at the end of the tunnel? I’ve posted here a few times in the past and I’ve found each time pretty beneficial so I thought I might give it a stan again if only to vent how I’m feeling, so here it goes.I was diagnosed with depression 3 years ago when I moved from home to study at university. I found the whole experience incredibly difficult. At school I had always excelled academically, had an active social life and had an unshakeable confidence, that I had worked very hard to build up for myself  but everything changed when I went to university. I just was not the same person and it upset me so much. I hated the degree I’d chosen but was unwilling  to admit this to my family let alone myself for fear of being perceived as a failure. And so I persevered.At the start of last year, after a failed suicide attempt I took some time off university and saw a therapist for a brief period. When September rolled around I was happy to return and give it another shot but I just fell back into my old patterns of behaviour. I was facing a lot of external pressure, particularly from my parents to succeed and so I just couldn’t bring myself to tell them I wasn’t going to lectures and was feeling suicidal again. I spent about a month in my room, with minimal contact to the outside world, wishing the world would go away.I ultimately had an epiphany and decided to drop out of my course, after this I felt so much better on the inside. Coming clean to my parents was horrible though. They just sort of shrieked about how much money I’d cost them. But it wasn’t all bad, I did spend my last month at uni surrounded by good friends, a supportive boyfriend and there was a marked improvement in my mental health.I unfortunately didn’t have the financial resources to stay there and so have been forced to move home and it has been a walking nightmare. My parents basically just scream at me every other day about getting a job or how much money I’ve cost them and I’m so unhappy. I feel living here has undone all the progress I thought I had made and I’m falling back into my same old depressive habits once again. What’s worse is I don’t have any direction in life. I can’t think of any career path that appeals to me and I feel as though I’m just living for the sake of living. I know my parents love me but living with this hostility is making me feel increasingly suicidal again but there’s no where else I can really go. I feel trapped both mentally and physically and I’m scared that there’s only one way out of feeling this way.Sorry for the word vomit, I get in a kind of rhythm when I do these posts and it’s hard to break. Obviously I’m focusing on the negatives for the purpose of venting and my situation isn’t as dire as I’m making it out to be but what I’ve written here is a pretty honest representation about how I’ve been feeling over the past month and I am very scared about the future [info] None [info] 1531691720
dantepicante [info] I don't know if I agree that he is a pathological liar, although obviously he has used many psyops techniques that I find somewhat dishonest (albeit benign) and has changed his stated positions to get ahead. I've also seen the media consistently lie about him in order to poison the population against him, though. That's how propaganda (or "public relations", as the father of propaganda Edward Bernays rebranded it) works: it elicits emotional responses from its viewers instead of logical ones. Clever folks have been studying the best ways to affect the majority of the population, and the techniques can be seen all over the mainstream news.  They've used our emotions against us and created illogical neural pathways from a young age that are hard to overcome later on in life as neuroplasticity decreases.I think part of why I'm finally aware of this shit is because I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed prozac last year, a drug that actually increases neuroplasticity. It has allowed me to step back and really consider the ways in which I form my opinions and the ways in which those processes can be manipulated. On that note, I highly recommend [this book from the CIA on the best way to analyze intel/the news](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/).

scullayylmao [info] I was diagnosed at a relatively young age (about 14), but sufferer years before I told anyone or asked for help. It's not easy to ask for help as somehow we've created a stigma surrounding mental illness and it's still a taboo topic. What you have to do though is make sure you tell someone you're comfortable around. Whether it be a parent, family member or friend, make sure they're able to get you help to diagnose you. I told my schools guidance counsellor and asked that he call my mom and tell her for me. When she learned, she was upset I didn't tell her but understood and booked me an appointment where I was diagnosed with depression. There are resources you can go to if you're not comfortable telling family or friends. You can tell your doctor and ask for help. Remember that you don't have to tell everyone but make sure someone knows.  Please get help before things become worse. Wishing you well.  [info] None [info] 1450479828
blackdav [info] I've always had a small interest in wrist watches that started during my school days. I had no knowledge of the history and art of watches. I was simply attracted to how cool it looked. Being a gullible kid, I used to buy fake watches from a senior in school who convinced me that it was authentic. I probably spent around 100$ in total which was HUGE for an 8th grader.   I think after that incident I just wasn't thinking of watches anymore. Now, I'm 22 years old and I've been diagnosed with depression so life was pretty rough recently. Then I started noticing watches again, I just did lol. Then I got really into it, watching TGV and his videos all day and surfing the web. I saved up and bought this watch (yes its authentic this time) and I absolutely adore it! Being more knowledgeable made me appreciate watches a 1000times more. And I gotta say, I felt happy when I got this watch and I rarely get happy over materials. Im not saying this cured my depression or anything but my life is much more fun now. Sorry for the long text, its my first post here and the mod told me I have to write something here. :) [info] None [info] 1540633630

Okay, well my social life is not great because friends just left me,or I didnt know how to act. I am now going to therapy for both.Lets back up awhile....

Well, one day, something hits me. I get introduced to a girl. She was a mutual friend of others. She and I talked to each other for a bit and I told her about myself and she explained about herself. However, I had my head in my lap practically and could not even talk to her as I was nervous to talk to a girl yup, 18 year old guy nervous to talk to a girl that really was interested in me and was so outgoing=/I have grown alot, but how do I know that when I am talking to a male or female, I know what confidence is and that I have it?TLDR:basically my title, what is confidence and how do I get it and show it?

Accomplished_Drummer [info] I was a quiet, nerdy, sad girl.

I was told I was spoiled and selfish, because I had something like an old playstation console and cheap toys while not having more than 2-3 pairs of clothes to last the week, or dental and medical care.When I was diagnosed with depression in the 90s, that's when the name-calling and label of "bad" started.

misshobbitkisser [info] I wasn’t a “problem child” I was diagnosed with depression at age 12 and have been on medication since then. I have made significant progress, and feel much better. Part of that is unlearning things that I was manipulated to believe. One thing was that my mental illness was just me being a problem child, making my family miserable because I was an ungrateful brat that just wanted attention.Me and Nmom were eating dinner tonight. She was on the phone with her sister. They were talking about how polite one of my cousins in Pakistan is and what a good girl she is when my mom said, “Our kids were raised here and they don’t have that kind of attitude.” I practically had a flashback. I was 12 again, in my bedroom, sitting on the floor. I could tell you exactly which pajamas I was wearing. I had just gotten out of the shower. My hair was wet. My mom was on the phone with her sister. She was talking about how ungrateful me and my sister were and how she wished she never had children. I didn’t even know what I did. I just felt awful about myself. I cried and cried and took out the fabric cutter I used for crafting and cut my wrists. I stopped crying, went into the living room and watched tv like nothing happened before going to bed. I remember my counselor told my mom I was cutting again on mother’s day. I handed my mom flowers and she said “I don’t want it. Your counselor already made my mother’s day” and she guilted me the whole way home. I remember times I came to cry to her and she just yelled. One time I was depressed and she threatened to take my phone away as if I did something worth being punished for, Weeks before I attempted suicide, I remember her being terribly mean to me. I didn’t even know what I did. She was tired of me being depressed all the time. I told my sister I wanted to kill myself and I didn’t know how to tell mom. My sister told me it was just teen angst and I shouldn’t tell her because I’d get over it. I still haven’t gotten over it. When I was seventeen, I met my abuser. He was my “friend”s 40 year old father. Weeks before I met him I was having a hard time with my mother again. He made me feel like I was his girlfriend, that he loved me, and that he would protect me. I remember hugging him and kissing him and crying into his chest when my mom said something that upset me. I remember I used to text him when I cried at night. We went out every Friday night, and it was like the perfect escape. Until he started manipulating me and being violent. My mom blamed me when she found out about us. She thought I was just an out of control teen. I protected him. She thought I was a whore for this. She used to wake me up in the middle of the night and yell at me, tell me she wished I had killed myself successfully, said she wanted to strangle me. I cried for him more. I went back into contact with him for six months before cutting him off again. My mom was still throwing it in my face a year later. Two years later she threw it in my face. I tried to confide in my sister. I was ready to tell her it was too much, tell her that he was horrible, that though I insisted I loved him, he manipulated me. I was getting ready to tell her he raped me and that’s why it hurts that mom thinks it’s my fault when she said “Oh my god. Don’t be dramatic. No one manipulated you. It was your fault.” I remember the electricity I felt when I told my 63 year old professor about my 40 year old boyfriend in high school, and I remember when he put his hand on my arm and when he hugged me. It felt so safe. Until I found out I got so emotionally involved with a man who had a girlfriend. Men have been my drug of choice. I was literally in the office of a 52 year old a month or two later, getting my high. In a way, it makes it better. Part of the fun is that my mom would kill me if she knew where I was. I don’t feel bad anymore. If I’m a problem child, she made me that way. [info] None [info] 1576120044

SkyeEDEMT [info] It's a tad long, TLDR at end. - Every semester I sign up for pilates, the class meets twice a week and attendance is 100% necessary. When I go, I tell myself "I am going to work out. I am going to put effort into it. And I am going to enjoy myself, releasing all this tension, helping my back and shoulders, building strength." If I don't do that I'm lazy and miserable during the workout. Looking at the clock every minute. - I finally found something that relaxes me. About five weeks ago I started taking better care of my skin. Washing it twice a day and using toners and moisturizers. I also have a ton of face masks. Maintaining hygiene (or fixing it if I've let it go astray by sitting around miserable all weekend) is now a key for me. Taking a shower, getting clean really helps my confidence. I feel like at least I have one part of my life together. Taking care of my face is very relaxing for me, I treat it as a pampering than just another thing to do. Facial masks are awesome. - the place I find most comfort in is my truck. My truck is my safe place, I feel like I have just enough control, cause I have control over where I'm going and how I react to things going around me, and I don't have to think about it like I have to do in real life. If someone upsets me in life I have to think how I want to approach it. Then I gotta do it and it's stressful. If someone starts slowing down while I'm behind them, I just slow too. It's second nature since I drive 6-7 days each week, for a minimum of 40 minutes/day. So sometimes I just have to get into my truck and go. Also, sometimes I don't listen to music. I've been doing that a lot lately. So often we're exposing ourselves to so much stimuli, it's almost constant. And I have lucid dreams so sometimes even in my dreams it's constant, I'm aware and make decisions as I'm asleep just like I do in life. So being able to drive, perform a simple activity controlled by mostly muscle memory, in quiet - that helps me. - nutrition. I'm no nutritionist but we all know the basics. If you don't TedEd has some awesome videos on it. During bouts of depression, sometimes I forget to eat, or I eat a lot. For the last month it's been McDonald's every day, sometimes twice a day. I have not had McDonalds since Thursday, which is great considering how often I had it before. It has made a great change, I'm less sluggish, more aware, less sore after pilates. My body is so much more capable when it's getting the right fuel. - I see a therapist every 3-ish weeks. Took me a bit to find one that worked best for me but he is awesome and the techniques he's taught me have really helped. - sleep. I'm careful on making sure I'm sleeping well. Making sure I'm sleeping around 7-8 hours per night. 9+ hours makes me more drowsy so I'm careful with that. Not too little, not too much - Balance. Also sleep quality. I love my memory foam pillow. I keep my air at 68 degrees, which I think is around optimal temperature for sleep. There's likely more. I was diagnosed with depression last year in March. But that's all I've got for now. Sorry it's long. TLDR: Exercise. Relaxation. Hygiene. Place of comfort. Good nutrition. Therapy. Quality sleep. General mindfulness, trying to catch the signs early.  [info] None [info] 1493108958

EnglishMobster [info] There are a few different ways in which depression can manifest itself. A lot of what is mentioned here are some of the apathetic symptoms, but I'm diagnosed with depression and don't really get those same "nothing matters" vibes everyone else gets.Instead, I get something else entirely. I get [automatic thoughts](http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/cognitive-therapy), which are basically negative thoughts that are always popping into my head.These thoughts always tell me how worthless I am. How nothing I do will ever make anyone happy. How much happier people would be if I wasn't around. Why should I get out of bed? All I'm going to do is ruin someone's life today with my presence. It tells me how I'll never get to do anything you've ever wanted to do, how I'm going to be a miserable failure, how I should just kill myself and get the damn thing over with so everyone around me can be happy.For me, it doesn't feel like "nothing matters." Instead it's the opposite -- everything matters, everything you do will hurt someone, you shouldn't even bother trying because you're so pathetically worthless.Now, the logical side of me knows this isn't true. But it causes you to examine everything everyone else does. For example: "My girlfriend didn't want me to come over today because she's thinking about breaking up with me because I'm such a shitty boyfriend." It *probably* isn't true, but those thoughts *constantly* invade your head, even when you're trying to sleep.What usually happens to me is I wind up crying for a few hours every night until I fall asleep. If someone says or does something which triggers an automatic thought and hurts my feelings, I have to fight the urge to break down in tears. I stress out about absolutely everything because I always feel *I'm not good enough* to meet what people want from me.It's not that the world seems shitty to me. The world is great! But I feel like *I'm* the shitty one. [info] None [info] 1402834614

Embarrassed_Cow [info] Does your Depression medication help with ADHD? And how do you tell them apart? I was diagnosed with depression a good 10 years ago. My various psychiatrists have put me on SSRI's but they tend to only help with the emotional aspect and barely. They just up the dose and hope it works but it after all this time Im still having all of the problems that a lot of problems that people on this subreddit have. Ive been in undergrad for 8 years. I changed my major every year and Ive essentially failed most of these classes. I have no clue whats going on in class. Ill try and listen and end up thinking about some tv show, maybe a boy...really anything thats not whats going on. Doing homework and finsihing it are both obstacles. I love my major. I LOVE LEARNING. I always have but it seems like I just cant learn. I cant do what Im supposed to do. I dont sleep very well. Im constantly thinking and once I get a thought my mind likes it rides that train until the next morning. Im really shy and always have been so a lot of people have told me its not possible for me to have it. Ive always been very well behaved but Ive also always been terrified of people. Idk. I dont want to give you guys all my symptoms like yall are doctors. But no one else is taking me seriously. I feel really stupid all the time. Im surrounded by intellegent people and I cant hold a conversation with them. They say something and my mind seeems to run through every possible sentence until I blurt out something stupid.

greasymcnugget [info] Having a preexisting condition can potentially make things worst down the road so be careful.I've been diagnosed with depression, mood disorder, and psychosis a few times in my life. I've been on multiple medications since I was 16 (and I'm now 22). 2 weeks ago I tried a 3.5 gram dose of magic mushrooms because I was so tired of the pharmaceuticals. So far, my life feels as though it has changed. I tripped for 8 hours and spent a lot of time being introspective and even reading my bible and just thinking about everything in my life. I'm not going to go into the details of the trip but it was one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had. I have felt emotionally content and more self-aware than ever. I highly recommend looking into Magic Mushrooms before giving anything else a shot.  [info] None [info] 1542477123

RobotPolarbear [info] I feel rather bad saying this, but yes. In many cases I do think it is selfish to have a child if you suffer from depression or other serious mental illnesses. I'm not talking about someone who has had an episode or two of depression. Many people suffer from a single episode of depression at some point in their lives and I certainly don't think it would be selfish for those people to have children.I'm talking about people like my mother and myself, who suffer from chronic and recurrent episodes of severe depression. Having a parent with severe mental illness was extremely difficult for me. I had to grow up very fast. From a very young age I had to learn how to take care of my mother when she was depressed, how to protect her from things that would trigger an episode, and how to modify my own behavior so that I wouldn't become a target of her anger when she was at her lowest. I was diagnosed with depression myself when I was just 11 years old. I was already self-injuring by then. From age 11 until age 26, I believed that I was severely mentally ill. I took medication, I went to therapy, I formed my identity around the idea of being severely mentally ill. As it turns out, my own problems were really just a symptom of living with and caring for other people who were mentally ill. Two years ago I finally moved away and started really putting myself first. I feel guilty about it every day. I feel like I gave up on my mom. I feel like I'm a terrible daughter. But I also know now that I'm nowhere near as sick as I thought I was. I've been off antidepressants for two years and I'm happy. I didn't know it was possible to be this happy. I decided not to have children because I know that if I did, I'd be putting them through what I went through. I know that no matter how hard you try, and no matter how much you love your children, being depressed *does* effect your children. I also know that depression is genetic, and I don't want to bring a child into this world that has these genes. That said, I think it's totally possible to be a good parent despite mental illness if you have it under control and have a support system in place. My mom never went to any kind of therapy and wasn't on medication until my teen years. I'm sure things would have been different if she had a better understanding of her illness and had help.

FionnagainFeistyPaws [info] From happy to sad. In approximately 1 hour and 55 minutes, my dad will have been gone for exactly 6 weeks. It's hard. I miss him. I have shame and guilt over how things transpired in the end, when I just tried to do my best to make sure he was taken care of. I wish so many things were different. I saw that Michael Flynn plead guilty from a Megathread over on r/legaladvice and just lost my shit (sorry for swearing, mom), and my jaw dropped, as this is a huge political deal! I went to post it on Facebook (I hadn't seen anyone post about it yet) and realized that I really, really want to call my dad, and ask if he'd seen the news. To talk about it. To see what he thinks. And I can't, because he's gone. I'm sitting here at work, on Reddit (please don't judge, mom), and now thinking about my dad and trying really hard not to cry. It shouldn't have to be this hard. I miss him, and I'm kinda bothered by the fact that some of my cousins never even reached out to me. That I got lots of support while he was dying, but I've pretty much been alone in the 6 weeks since (alone as in none of his side of the family). I wish it would get better. Edit: I think one of the reasons this is so hard, I have been diagnosed with depression since he passed. I had it 20 years ago, but successfully addressed it and been a happy clam (I've been called a CareBear on Crack. I like to think I'm Lionheart). But there was so much in the last year, so much anger at him, so much anger from my mom he moved in, so much anger from my partner at my dad, so much anger at the cancer, arguments, disagreements, months without speaking to my father because I was so hurt by what he'd said, and I know I hurt him by doing so, at what the part of his life. I'm struggling, really struggling, and have been started on meds and every says I'm being really strong. I don't feel strong. I've been trying to figure out a way to honor my father, to do something positive and helpful for him. I have an idea... but I don't even know how feasible it is. I've messaged the mods to see if discussing it would be appropriate (it might violate rule 3a). I think I just need a hug. [info] None [info] 1512157514

deakers [info] Unmedicated, Unbalanced, and Uninsured So, I was diagnosed with depression back in 2006 (I was 16). Obviously, over the course of the last 11 years, I've been on a few different medications. A little over 3 years ago now, I was put on Effexor (well, the generic, but I'm not going to try to spell that...).Here's where the trouble comes in: I'm uninsured, and I *just* ran out of refills. I had to call a different doctor than the one I had last seen about 2 years ago (because my previous physician would expect payment in full at the time of service, and it'd be at least $400 that I don't have). I found a doctors office that accepts uninsured patients, and also does payment plans (with 20% up front). they're also cheaper than the doctor I used to go to. Sadly, they can't get me in until August 4th, and no doctor will give me any refills without being seen.Going to the emergency room isn't an option, they'd charge me $1500, and I will be there for 6 hours waiting. Not worth it. And the Urgent Care places near me won't do refills (yes, I called and asked).So, I'm a little over a week without my medications, and withdrawal is in full swing. I'm hearing my heart beat in my ears, my blood pressure has gone up, and I have vision distortion like a camera lens constantly refocusing.As if that wasn't bad enough, my depression is rearing its ugly head. I've been having a lot of issues with self worth, constantly being tired (then not being able to sleep), and feeling pessimistic. I'm normally upbeat, positive, and easy-going, and I miss that. It probably doesn't help that in about 3 weeks, my position where I'm working will be eliminated in about 3 weeks. So, I'm feeling like I have no value, that I'm useless, and a tumor on Society. I find myself just staring off into nothingness, feeling like there's static in my head, lights are on but no one's home.I've been talking to my partners (I'm polyamorous, I have a fiance, a boyfriend, and a girlfriend) about how I've been feeling, and they've been very supportive and trying their damnedest to try to show me that I'm not worthless. I know it's not easy on my fiance because in my pessimism, I'm seeing *everything* in a negative light, so much so that nothing he says is helping, I'm able to twist it into something macabre.I haven't had any issues with suicide/thoughts of dying yet, but I have told my partners to be aware of it. They're being as helpful as possible.I've been using some essential oils to try to boost my mood, keep my spirits up, but I obviously have very few options available. I've been reading that after a week or so into the withdrawal, then it's safe to try taking St. John's Wort, so I think I'll try that.I'm not sure what all else I can do to keep myself as level as possible, although I do know being with someone else helps because being alone means alone with my thoughts.I just don't know what else I can do to survive until my appointment, let alone not really knowing what other negative stuff I should anticipate...

GRIMMnM [info] I was diagnosed with depression in high school. It was bad, I didn't know how to manage/cope with it yet, even on pills. My mom started giving me the option to skip school every once in a while just to take a day where all I had to do was maybe some house chores. It was great and I am grateful my mom did that. I didn't take advantage of it, this was only a thing that happened a few times between three years of high school, but I believe those days helped me a lot. So yes, but limited mental health days because then you could get into a bad habit of not pushing through the hard times when you need to the most. A break once in a while is okay, but you have to take what Disney taught us years ago to heart. Just keep swimming.  [info] None [info] 1523709903
ItsSilver [info] &gt; I agree that you should be more empatheticI never really understood why I need to be more empathetic.  I mean, I understand the whole "try to see things from their point of view" but the whole thing as a whole sounds to me like "throw a pity party for some one so your overall good day can now less than optimal"Really it likely comes from my stubborn personality haha. because my family moves a lot more often than a family should move *(from 2009-2015 we lived in 5 different states, 6 different cities every time we move I'm expected to help pack the garage, long story short my mom has a hoarding problem. not like "hoarders" level but our garage isn't usable)*  but all the moving really got to me, and our first move was from a large city (1.5mil people) to a smaller town (50,000 people) my brother was bullied in school and neither of us could find a job no matter how hard we tried. The town didn't have a community college and I didn't have the money to get into university. I was diagnosed with depression which kinda angered me  because I've always been "ontop of the world" before the moving. I didn't outlet it on everyone else because I saw it as "making others day suck because I wanted others to suffer with me" which is exactly what my father would do. so i dealt with it myself and the easiest way to explain it is I faked it till I made it. No real depression symptoms now, I've got ADD and that tends to fuel my anger because its hard to study when you cant focus on anything. But I say the depressions gone, Although my psych says that the depression might have just started manifesting as anger instead of sadness. ( he prefaced it with "its not really proven but its my theory") My theory is I'm just an ass. I told the manager of my job before my last the dearest thing to me is my education, and that no job comes before it. (I got fired for not showing up to two shifts that the asshat of a manager scheduled during my classes). And after my girlfriend snapped and told me that I shouldn't "get angry" when she bothers me while I'm doing home work I told her bluntly that if she attempts to come between me and my studies she can walk.I'm serious here. My education is the most important thing to me and no one and nothing comes before it. Not friends, not "love", not family. [info] ThisIsntSilver [info] 1458012189

K31FF3R2 [info] I was diagnosed with depression and adhd at 12. I essentially said “fuck off” grew up and experienced life, and picked up a few “coping strategies” or views on life and how I process the world and I totally agree. People think you are downplaying depression or other mental illness, but I don’t believe that. I even remember feeling alienated trying to open up to friends and they would tell me “dude you have nothing to be depressed about, it’s all in your head” but after a while I started to realize my best chance at beating this was to just believe that to be true.  This is where all the cliches come from:Mind over matter, the world is what you make it/how you see it, etc...I don’t know about you but I think anybody who agrees here does or should believe in the law of attraction. If you are unhappy, it’s because you think you are unhappy and acknowledge it. So just think you are happy and acknowledge that.  There are going to be rough times and sometimes you are going to feel down but there’s no reason to embrace these feelings or just kinda give in and feed them with bad thoughts or actions.

ladybug812 [info] I know you said your mind is made up. But this might give some insight and, if nothing else, at least something to think about.My mom committed suicide when I was 19 (I'm 27). She was an addict, had a hard life, etc. Trust me when I tell you...the impact is devastating. We were not on good terms when she died. She had so many demons and I can understand that finality would rid her of them...but she could have saved herself. I miss her and wish I could talk to her again.In all honesty, when someone completes suicide, usually they dont think about the impact. They want instant gratification - for their pain to end. But it isnt worth it. How do I know? I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13 or 14. I was suicidal and engaged in selfharm. My upbringing was unstable and heartwrenching, but I'm still here and I'm so glad that I did not end my life. Despite the fact I continue to deal with depression, I have more hope compared to when I was younger and it has kept me going. I never thought I would think that way...but here I am.I hope that you find the will to live. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem/situation/etc.I wish you luck.

kites47 [info] Theatre, Depression, Suicide, Identification, Love, Acceptance, and the LGBT Community Hello - my name is Josef. I'm a 20-year-old third-year theatre arts major at the University of Pennsylvania. Though I've spent most of my time on the stage, I'm also an amateur playwright. There's a topic I've always wanted to write on, but never felt I had the drive, the knowledge, or the right to do it.I grew up in a conservative Christian household, was in incredible denial of the fact that I was gay, had a father who passed away, dealt with all sorts of verbal and physical abuse related to my sexuality, etc. The things I went through, however, are far from unique to me. They are something that so many LGBT individuals I have met have undergone these things, though obviously to many varying degrees and in unique ways. A sad part of growing up as an LGBT person in an environment that may not be fully supportive is how easily one can slip into depression. Writing is my passion and is the way in which I've been able to find meaning to the feelings I've undergone and the events I've seen in my friends' lives.In my freshman year of college, I volunteered with a group called SREHUP. I worked with homeless LGBT young adults at a church that housed them. There were four transgender women there who had the most incredible stories of struggle, from abusive boyfriends, to families that completely rejected them, to severe cases of physical violence, and so much more. Despite this, these were some of the happiest women I'd ever met. They had so much to say about their past and it inspired me to write something about the process an LGBT person goes into finding out their identity and trying to reconcile it with the culture they grew up in.This past year I was diagnosed with depression. I guess I probably should have seen that diagnosis coming, as I've had the tell-tale symptoms for many years, but it was hard for me to admit it. There are so many people dealing with the stigma of not only being LGBT, but also with the stigma surrounding mental illness and depression and especially suicidal thoughts that may stem from the above. It's much more common than people would think, but it feels like so few people are willing to talk about it.Now why am I posting this wrong rambling post about these topics on here? Well, I really want to write a play about the process an individual goes through from their recognition that they might be LGBT, to the moment of identification as LGBT and trying to figure out their identity, to dealing with being either open and dealing with repercussions of that or the repercussions of letting it remain hidden and being unable to announce it. This is a dialogue that, at least in my experience, is so vividly open within the LGBT community, but that is much less understood or known about outside of it.What I am asking is just to hear your stories. Whether through messages, Skype, phone calls, meeting in person if you happen to live close, email, etc. I want to write a piece representative of the stories of real LGBT people as they've dealt with the process of identifying. Now, I don't just want to hear from people that deal with depression or suicidal thoughts or just general kickback from the community they've grown up in, I also want to hear about people that have had a wonderful coming out experience with families and friends that supported them. This is a theatrical exploration that talks about the process of identification quite openly and will give a glimpse into the vulnerable time in a LGBT person's life where they come to terms with who they are.Now, this theatrical piece will not be a retelling verbatim of people's stories. These stories will work as inspiration for a piece that explores the LGBT experience. Though some specific pieces may be used, it will not be anyone's story told flat-out. As far as credit, if you would not mind being named, I would love to put your name as someone I thank at the start of the play, but if you would rather remain anonymous, let me know and I will do so as well. The play will start with the director stepping forward and thanking those that came forward to share their stories to help create this piece and there will be both those named included as well as a word for those that remained anonymous.I am sorry if this post seems long and rambly - it's so hard to put into exact words what I want to say and how I want to do this. This is why I'm asking for your stories. I want to better convey what I want to say and I feel the best way to do that is to understand more perspectives than just my own. Thank you in advance for any responses and for anyone willing to share their stories.With love and admiration for you all, Josef [info] LGBTQ Activist/UPenn Student [info] 1402525645

wingie [info] I feel like my doctor isn't doing his job, but I have no point of reference. Can Reddit help me figure out if I should switch doctors? I'm 99% certain that my doctor never reads my lab results until he talks to me about them---my "you haven't done your reading/homework" sense is honed because I've been teaching for years and whenever he reviews my file it's a "I've never read this" as opposed to a "I'm reminding myself and making sure I have it right". He never remembers what medication I'm on. Today he actually had to ask me whether he wrote a prescription for me last week (I'd assume that he can just look one inch above where he was writing on my file) and despite me reminding him every other time I'm there and updating my forms with his office all the time he doesn't seem to know that I'm on antidepressants.Are doctors supposed to do this? It feels very unprofessional for me that anyone would meet someone about a document without even glancing at it first. Or that he's recommending I look into medication that I'm already on and not taking the fact that I've been diagnosed with depression/ADHD in his diagnosis until I reminded him that hey, remember that giant form I had to fill out it's on there. But it could also just be that the industry is a busy one and this is literally the standard. [info] None [info] 1321322610
Wiebejamin [info] I can't go to class anymore I'm in my second year of college. I keep having periods where I can't bring myself to get up, leave my room, and go to my classes. I don't have the motivation. This happened last semester and I had to drop all of my classes to avoid failing. I did my hardest class over the summer by itself and did very well with no issue, so I thought I'd be able to just go right back in and continue as normal, but I can't. I know that I'd be doing well if I could attend classes normally, but I can't.As soon as I miss one class, suddenly I'm skipping all of them. I'm not doing any homework, so I'm sure I'm really behind and my grades are poor. There's a place that's supposed to help students keep up, and I'm scheduled for weekly meetings there, but I can't go to those either. Anything that involves school is just, blocked out for me. I should have made this post weeks ago, but I couldn't even do that until now.I've been diagnosed with depression and I'm taking medication for it, but it's not helping. I don't even feel sad, and I am having fun doing things on my own/with friends, so I don't even know if that diagnosis is right.I don't know what to do. I do like it here, but I think college might not be something I'm capable of doing, but if I don't, then I have no idea what I'd do with my life.I was born with all the opportunities in the world but I can't even bring myself to use them.

Kerrima [info] After I was diagnosed with depression and started taking medication for it, my Dad told me I wasn't really depressed and I should just learn to handle stress better, and that the doctor was wrong and gave me a lazy diagnosis.I stopped talking to him until he apologised, the best I got was "Depression isn't what I thought it was and you might have had it." But then told me that I hurt his feelings by not talking to him and I should feel bad and apologise.I can definitely sympathise a little. [info] None [info] 1394464799

linseeds [info] Fatigue is my most debilitating MS symptom. It started about 18 months before my diagnosis. I was working a full time job, ran a little etsy business, sold vintage stuff on ebay, worked out about 4 hours a week, prepped all kinds of healthy food and I gradually became a person who could only go to and from work and spent most of their non-work time in bed. About 6 months before my diagnosis, I went to my primary care doctor thinking I was depressed. I told her I thought it was weird that I \*wanted\* to do things, I just couldn't. When I was diagnosed with depression previously, I didn't \*want\* to do anything. 4 months after that, more MS symptoms showed up and I was sent to a neurologist for testing.I tried Amantadine. It helped a lot with fatigue, but increased brain fog to the point that I didn't think it was safe to drive. Maybe it would have improved over time, but I quit after about 4 days. May be worth a try because it does work for some people. My first neurologist prescribed Modafinil, but the insert says it decreases the effectiveness of my hormonal birth control so that's a no-go. I kind of decided I'm on my own for figuring out how to deal with the fatigue.I've been taking CBD oil for my fatigue and it makes a huge difference. Most days my fatigue is zero to mild. According to the National MS Society: "Fatigue occurs in about 80% of people, can significantly interfere with the ability to function at home and work, and may be the most prominent symptom in a person who otherwise has minimal activity limitations." So MS definitely can cause fatigue! Can you get a new neurologist? My first one wasn't very helpful. I switched to one who specializes in MS and he seems better informed about MS and puts more thought into treating me.  [info] RRMS | 39F | Dx2018 | Tecfidera [info] 1550510746
ASAPAP [info] I regret calling OP an asshole but I don’t appreciate you attacking me. I was diagnosed with depression as a kid and later as a adult so yes I do know. I also had a very close friend kill himself in high school and have seen the impact it had on his family and friends. For people affected by depression personally or that know someone that has been affected, it is not something to make a mockery of with a “starter pack” on reddit. The teen suicide rate is at a 40 year high. I understand that kids are often over dramatic and not really clinically depressed but this is not an issue to be generalized. Also who said anything about “worshipping depressed people.” Talk about an insensitive, hyperbolic statement... No one is worshipping them; we are simply being sensitive to the fact that they have very real feelings too- although they may not qualify in your book (what age do they qualify for you?). I feel like kids’ struggles get ignored because they are kids but they often go through very adult problems at home or elsewhere without the mental maturity to handle it. All that being said, I truly hope you don’t project this attitude onto anyone struggling inside near you. It could be extremely harmful and all kids want is to feel like they are being heard. I find it quite ironic you are calling me ignorant for calling someone as asshole because they are basically mocking teen depression then proceed to accuse me of worshipping depressed kids. All the best my friend. [info] None [info] 1535498943

rasdabess [info] Im now 18, and want to talk to my doctor for depression meds and am not sure how exactly this works. I was diagnosed with depression 3 years ago, the most minor of depression. every now and then it pops back up, i lose will power to do really anything and its affecting me going to school. Ive been absent 8 times so far this year, i constantly make up all my work so that im missing nothing but its really hindering me and if i miss anymore days ill probably face consequences. My old meds definitely made me feel better although i become much more hyper as a side effect but im fine with that and i guess i need it.Im a private type of person and dont want my family to know Ill be taking meds again. Im now 18 and have control over my own self and I want to go to my doctor and talk over it but ive never scheduled an appointment before and im  not sure what to say. Do I call my clinic and tell them id like to make an appointment with my doctor or a psychiatrist? Will my father need to know anything since we re on the same insurance?

Gairloch [info] My parents didn't divorce till I was in high school so I never had to deal with who to spend holidays with. I did try to not pick sides though (even though I know my dad had plenty of issues and I completely understood why my mom left him) and now I'm not very popular with extended family on either side. That is to say I haven't spoken with any extended family on my dads side for years (mostly just cousins since grandparents and aunt on his side died when I was rather young), and the only time I've seen extended family on my moms side was when my grandpa died a few years ago and earlier this year when my grandma died. At least that side is more friendly towards me even if they aren't exactly sending me cards or anything. Granted I was diagnosed with depression and ASD which might be why the whole thing doesn't bother me that much. The only family I like being in contact with is my mom, though I don't talk to her as much as I probably should but I'm never in a financial position to visit or anything beyond email/phone/text.

CronusTheDefender [info] “Devastation and heartbreak” for me. I consider myself to have been pretty fortunate in life. About 12 years ago, I was diagnosed with depression, but didn’t do anything about it because I never felt I had anything to be “depressed” about. It was until earlier this year that I was able to comprehend what it is and how it’s been affecting my life. From it ruining a relationship, to dealing with a loss of family members, it unfortunately took a series of events to comes to terms with it. I was in a very low place, a place where some haven’t been able to come back from. This game, this community, my clan, along with help outside of this group, I was able to slowly come out of it. I knew when I played the beta for D1, that this was going to be the game I play for a long time. I’ve made friends from various clans over the years, encountered many different walks of life from all over the globe. When I need to be distracted from my day to day life, Destiny is there. When clan members in another country needed to talk about their issues, Destiny was that bridge for us. The loot has been cool, the story and lore has been amazing, but meeting and playing with strangers who I now call friends, has been one of the best stories. We all have issues and our up and down moments, but the thing we all have in common is this game and community. Thank you all. I’m not sure how I would’ve gotten through this last year without you.

shykel [info] I've been passed around for years to different clinics where they interview me and tell me I don't have the symptoms they're looking for. I recently had one where they said I might just be quirky which surprisingly hurt me. I just want a reason for why I struggle so hard with things that are trivial to other people.It felt good when I was diagnosed with depression because then I knew what kind of beast I was battling and I could learn to handle it - that did a lot more than antidepressants or Councilling ever did for me. Its worth looking into it as soon as you can.  [info] None [info] 1548808837

Sylamatek [info] It's taken a few course corrections, but I'm finally unlearning a lifetime of poor diet and exercising habits. This might be a bit of a read, but hopefully if you're in (or have been) in a situation like I was, this will give you some encouragement.  Perhaps this is an "eminent" victory, for Victory Sunday? I'm a 21 year old guy, and for as long as I can remember, I've been overweight.  The heaviest I ever got was about 225 pounds (6'0 btw).  I had an incredibly sedentary lifestyle.  I lost some weight from marching band during the summer but afterwards started gaining weight since I did no additional exercise.  I gave up drinking glasses and glasses of soda every time I went out to eat, but I still had god-awful eating habits, especially in the summer.   Freshman year of college was a fresh start.  I tried to eat better but swore up and down that I would never limit what I was eating, beyond calorie counting (I'll never give up pasta, it tastes too good!)  This meant that I was eating less food overall but it was still not very healthy food.  I joined the fencing club, did cardio consistently, etc. and got down to 185 lbs.  Then it got rough.  Fencing club dissolved.  School ( architecture student) became stressful, I moved farther away from campus and the gym, I got more into drinking, and I started to feel like shit in general.  My apartment complex had a tiny "rec center" I would use it for cardio occasionally, but I still skyrocketed back to 222 lbs.  I was diagnosed with depression last semester and most of the last half of the semester was me skipping classes, drinking heavily (hard alcohol mixed with sugary soda and/or gatorade) and going back and forth between eating nothing for almost 2 days and eating a whole pizza while not leaving my bed.Once I got home for the summer, I got sick of dealing with it and decided to make a change.  Following in the footsteps of a friend who recently went from 280 to 185, I cut out carbs almost entirely (I try to stay under 40g a day), I go lifting 3 times a week, and I got a warehouse job in an unconditioned building.  Since the beginning of the month, I've lost 12 pounds.  I have about another month before I leave for school again, and hopefully with continued weightloss and gym habits, I can keep that inertia going throughout the semester.  I'll get a lifting partner and keep gyming it up, I'll start going to university yoga classes again, keep eating healthy, etc.  I am worried about depression setting in again once school starts stacking up on me, but now I have connection with my university counseling services, and I can tell exercising has made me feel better as well.  **The Take away**I suppose I made this thread to show you that no matter what situation you come from, you can fix your diet and exercise habits.  The hardest part is getting started, and once the ball is rolling, you have enough momentum behind you to keep it going!  I come from a household of parents that dislike the taste of most veggies and cook nothing but frozen pizzas, spaghetti, etc. and my family does nothing physical.  So I've been raised with horrible dietary habits and a nonexistent level of exposure to physical recreational activities.   But by embracing one of my favorite hobbies, cooking, i can make healthy meals for myself that actually taste great, so I barely even have an incentive to return to my old dietary ways.  Pizza and big sandwiches taste good, sure, but eating that many carbs in one sitting anymore weighs in my stomach like a brick and I just feel bloated/lazy.  Yay for making positive changes!  I'm shooting to be well under 200 by the time I go back to school, around august 20th.  Let's see how low I can go! [info] None [info] 1437952811
zvive [info] Congrats, my highest was 699.I lost 49 in 2012 before having vsg. Since then I lost down to 500. Then I started drinking soda and eating cake/candy/etc.I would go on and off diets since then always getting down to about 460, stalling, and going back to soda and 515... I still can't eat a ton, so 515 is about as high as I go... But it's still not great.August I was severely depressed, my wife encouraged me to start therapy, I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD. Two weeks later I saw an ad on FB for a CrossFit weight loss challenge. I enrolled. I also started ADHD meds (amazing, my brain works now). Since September I went from 515 to 422. I'm almost to 100# lost. I can't remember the last time I was under 400, probably when I was 17 or 16. That's 100 in 3 months, my goal is 122 by the end of the year, I think that's pretty conservative actually and definitely reachable. I'm excited to get there. I'm sure you can reach your goals just don't give up, don't stop at 500, and don't drink soda it's evil. [info] None [info] 1546748001
Trans_Autistic_Guy [info] I don't know if this belongs here, but it's at least related. I have a lot of trouble with sleep. I have for almost my whole life. It's always been attributed to my depression, but that could be because I was diagnosed with depression at 13 and wasn't diagnosed with ASD till 25. I have yet to receive any services for it 2 years later, but that's a whole different post. My troubles can be summarized as can't sleep at night and can't stay awake during the day. This has obviously caused some problems, especially now that I'm employed again for the first time in about 3 years. I'm on a medicine to help me sleep, but it's far from perfect and doesn't really help me get up in the the morning. So I use alarms. A lot of alarms. I've even started to use them to keep me on track during the day which is a huge step as my partner has been begging me to try this for years, but I always felt some overwhelming opposition to it, not sure what changed. Anyway, I'm mostly writing this post because I'm an hour and a half late to work because I slept through several alarms. That reminds me of another issue I have with getting going, which is that I find it almost impossible to wake up early. And if, by some miracle, I do, I get so antsy that I either leave ridiculously early or, more likely, get distracted and end up late. So this is something I hate about myself, but I've never figured out a good solution to it. I even have my alarms set up to tell me the time so I don't get confused about which alarm it is.

inkwitxh [info] Lonely It’s 16 years since I was diagnosed with depression, and 5 since I was diagnosed with bpd. I’m really struggling to make friends in the new area I live. If there’s anyone out there that is alone, and wants someone to talk to, I’m here. I had to quit my job, due to physical injury, so I am always so bored. Sometimes I’ll write a little list of things to do, to keep me busy throughout the day whilst I wait for my bf to get home. I know this illness sucks ASS, and I wanna try and make someone’s day a little better if I can. I am so alone, I have no family, only bf and his mother. Who are wonderful and do so much for me. I had one ‘friend’ but was subsequently ’dumped’ for not wanting/being a fan of children. That obviously destroyed me, but I am proud for saying what I feel, sticking to it and not turning back just so I have someone. I have tried joining groups and stuff in the area, but I dint feel comfortable in group settings. I just wish I had a friend or two, in England, and build a friendship based on mutual support. I feel like this is too much to ask. [info] None [info] 1579959647

pmmeyourbucketlist [info] I always hated to think I had depression because of the stigma and the self diagnosed kinda sad people. It took me to the point of staying in bed for a week without having a meal, exercise, work completed and twice walking to the bathroom for water and on top of that only getting up to stare at the wall before trying to sleep again. At that point I overcame my denial and made an appointment with a therapist with which I was diagnosed. The degree that I deal with it now is significantly better than it was before but I still use the word infrequently.  If you try can you have a happy moment? Hypothetically if you were sent on a vacation with the person of your choosing expenses paid with no other obligations would you be able to feel happy. If you can honestly say that there is nothing that will make you happy you might want to consider that as a sign of something. If they still don’t really understand I tend to either explain the difference between sadness and depression.I also might use personal examples if they were one of the few that know I am diagnosed with depression. Another note: I blame the phrase “that’s depressing” and attention seekers for part of the misunderstanding Odds are it is slightly upsetting and you don’t try draw attention when you are depressed.

_daniel23 [info] The MCU is the only reason why I’m still alive. I’m not usually the type of guy who shares his life story on the internet;  I was thinking about it this morning and thought that I may as well post my thoughts here. I’m 16 years old and I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago now. I grew up watching Marvel movies, obviously starting with Iron Man, and as stupid as this may sound, Marvel movies are my only true source of happiness. Every time I watch a Marvel movie I zone out, and pretend like I’m not me. Like I’m finally free.Anyway, last year I decided that I had had enough. I finally agreed with myself that the only way I can find peace is by killing myself. This was at the same time as the trailer for Infinity War was released and Thanos being my favourite comic book super-villain of all time, I said to myself “Maybe I’ll wait until I watch Infinity War before I decide to...” Time passed, and as hard as it was, I finally saw Infinity War. By the end of the movie, I was speechless.I found myself saying “Hmm... I guess I’ll wait til the next movie” because I couldn’t imagine leaving this world, not knowing what happened at the end of the Infinity Saga.And here we are, I watched Endgame on release day and was emotionally wrecked by the end. I’m glad I decided to wait. I don’t know where I will go from here but I do know that I’ve already pre-booked tickets for Far From Home on release day however, I fear that after that I’ll feel the same as I did before all of this. Hopefully not. I just want the pain to end. If you’ve read this far I genuinely thank you for taking the time to do so.Edit: I just woke up and saw all of the kind comments everyone has left and I would like to say thank you and that I greatly appreciate everyone who took the time out of their life to comment here. You guys are the best. [info] None [info] 1558390889

LegendaryLGD [info] This is a great connection.Lately, I've been thinking a lot about how my breathing &amp; digestion &amp; sleep &amp; sexual &amp; mental problems were all linked in more than just unidirectional ways.&amp;#x200B;I learned recently about the potential link between depression and inflammation. One day I got a major allergic reaction and while the shot I was administered calmed that down I was left with my current breathing problem: a chronic sinusitis, which means I have had an everlasting inflammation for years. I was diagnosed with depression around 4 years after that episode. Unrelated, I had a bad doctor that over-prescribed me antibiotics and after years of antibiotics abuse I assume my gut microbiome is shot, hence my digestive/stool problems, which seem unresponsive to probiotics. Add to that some PSSD and insomnia and you got yourself the healthiest human being!&amp;#x200B;So, the idea is that my allergy (sinusitis) causes my sleep problems (difficulty breathing, potential snoring, apnea, etc.) and due to the poor quality of life and also the inflammation itself, my depression is caused or exacerbated. Poor sleep due to breathing problems and depression are said to cause sexual problems. And now I'm learning of yet another potential connection between my sleep, digestive, and mental problems. This is such a sad cycle.&amp;#x200B;Fascinating how it's all related!&amp;#x200B;I've started taking around 10k IU of Vitamin D since apparently it helps against inflammation and maybe it's placebo but I feel like it helps. Maybe I should get on that probiotics/prebitiocs train and see if that does anything in doses higher than what I'd previously tried because apparently cheaper supplements are less 'dense' or whatever. My ophthalmologist (yes, just as small-talk not in any official capacity) mentioned they take melatonin to help their sleep and recommended I try it. This is even more reason to consider melatonin supplementation, if it could help with my gut situation.&amp;#x200B;My ARAS and gut microbiome being potentially shot, chronic inflammation, sleep problems, etc. the bidirectional pairs create a nice little web.

yung_erik_ [info] I have an urge to cut but I dont know where it's coming from In spring 2018 I was diagnosed with depression. Nothing too special besides the normal depressive episodes and the normal things youd expect. When I started class in August, my depression sort of changed to where I dont really feel any emotion. I could concentrate on my schoolwork perfectly and I didnt really have anything in my head going on. I've been this way ever since and like I'm doing really well. Straight A's right now going into midterms so like that's great and I'm happy.This past week I've had an urge to cut. In the beginning of the school year I've had thoughts about it but nothing like an urge. Last night I sharpened one of my knives and made 4 short slices, all right next to each other so it isn't noticable unless you really look for it.I dont know what's driving me to do this. Nothing is affecting my daily life besides that and I dont know where any of these urges are stemming from. It just feels so good and like that's obviously a problem. It's just scary not knowing where it's coming from. I know I need to get help but I dont want to go out in the real world to do that. If anyone at my school finds out and tells the mental health offices or any profedskrs, I'll be put in a hospital and I really dont want that to happen. Schoolwork is the only thing keeping me occupied and happy, besides my friends here, and I cant be taken away from any of that. I dont know what to do. [info] None [info] 1539812295

alderfae [info] I am definitely aware that I have a mood disorder. I was diagnosed with depression several years ago. I'm pretty sure I am relapsing. I forgot to take my meds for a while, then just stopped taking them all together - big mistake! I've stopped eating, sleeping, I am irritable. I didn't even realize it until my boyfriend brought it up. We were arguing about the ex, bc I was crying bc I felt like he will never love me as much as he loved her. He said I was crying over nothing, and I had nothing to worry about, and politely asked if I was taking my medication or if maybe it was close to that time of the month. I realized it had been at least 2 weeks since I'd taken my pills. I'm going to the doctor next week for a refill and to ask her to increase the dosage and to recommend a therapist in my healthcare network. I was seeing a different therapist for a while, but in my opinion, there is a conflict of interest since she is a friend of my mother and my mother was encouraging me to see her. The drama that was the catalyst for all this has been the rough patch in the relationship with my mom. It may sound paranoid, but I do not trust a therapist who is close friends with her. Also, my mom was/is a client of hers. It's just too much for me. And my mom and I got in a fight and she implied that the therapist is on her side and agrees that I am a liar/there is something wrong with me/etc. And this was long before I started breaking down. It has just been a lot of stress to deal with. My mom hates my boyfriend and he hates her back bc he does not like how she speaks to me. It's a long story, and I've got an extensive post history about it through r/raisedbynarcissists.  [info] None [info] 1547171584
bluntbangs [info] I think there are a million people out there who can relate, but since this is reddit and we share stuff, I'm gonna share. If you looked at me you'd think "wow, this is someone with their shit together!" I'm halfway through a PhD, moved abroad in my mid- 20's alone for work, have a great partner, have numerous awards to my name and have an active life, both physically and socially. I was diagnosed with depression at uni, but I'd struggled for years. At high school I was on a list of students they were worried about, but I never misbehaved. I still fight it today but my scars are nearly gone and I know how to fight and I know I've won before so it's easier. The thing is, no-one ever tells you that you're not supposed to find it easy. Life can be the shittiest, most miserable thing in the world. Today I wanted to scream. But I've had the most wonderful moments and each one builds upon the last and I don't want to die anymore. I don't want to just survive even. I want to experience more moments. I want to create moments for other people. I never thought I'd enjoy a sunset, but last year I found myself smiling happily at one. I never thought I'd see a face that made me happy but there's a whole load of faces now that bring a smile to mine, and one that just makes me warm and glow. I never thought I'd push myself to my physical limits and enjoy it, but the rush was incredible. I never thought I'd fall over and get straight back up again but I did. You have to work but there are two very simple things you already know:1. You don't have to make it hard2. It's totally worth it Right now you're paralyzed by the thought of that pain of studying, as I was this afternoon and as I've been before. You get your big, mountainous task and you break it down into smaller chunks, and if they're too big you break them down even further. And again, until one of them you think "hell yeah I could do that in 60 seconds" and then you take that list of small, manageable things and you pretend only one thing exists and you do it. And then you tick that off and congratulate yourself because (hell yeah) you took a step towards something and that was easy, right? Easier than working in a minimum wage job anyway. And then you do more tasks and it starts to feel good that you're doing stuff (even if that stuff is "wash the dishes" and believe me that's on my list too) and suddenly you find yourself looking back on a decade of doing small stuff and you're living a dream you never thought you had and you look at that huge task in front of you and after a brief scream (because that helps) you know you've got this, and you don't know where you're headed but there's something inside that's just a little bit excited.

Coolguy4002 [info] My name is Marianne von Edmund. My name is Marianne von Edmund. I'm 17 years old. My room is in the northwest section of Garreg Mach, where all the nobles are, and I am not married. I study as a student for the Church of Seiros Officers Academy, and I get home every day by 8pm at the latest. I don't do herbs, but I occasionally drink tea. I'm in bed by 10 activity points, and make sure I get no hours of sleep as I lay contemplating life, no matter what. After having a glass of Dorte's warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches while in the roster menu, I usually get no sleep and wake up in the morning with bags under my eyes. Just like a baby, I wake up with great fatigue and stress, crying in the morning. I was diagnosed with depression at my last check-up.

I take care to never trouble myself with any enemies, like Hilda and Lysithea, that would cause me to get my life under control.

rightsbot [info] [COPY] Are you depressed? A lot of men are, but they probably don't know they are, because they haven't been told how to recognize it. Below is a copy of [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/19k5s1/are_you_depressed_a_lot_of_men_are_but_they/)by [dalsgaard](http://www.reddit.com/user/dalsgaard) at 2013-03-03 03:57:04 UTC, as read at 2013-03-03 03:58:09 UTC.**THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL POST. PLEASE DO NOT COMMENT IN THIS THREAD.**----------I'm listening to an interview with the first researcher on men in Denmark, and he mentioned something about depression that I found quite interesting. I have been diagnosed with depression myself, but I found the process rather odd. The doctor had this 'score card', where she asked a couple of questions like: "How much do you sleep?", "How is your appetite?", and the like. It occured to me that the process where she rated each question didn't readily take male psychology into account. Because men who visit the doctor have a tendency to underrepresent their own psychological wellbeing. We don't want to appear weak, and we have a tendency to make light of these things, or not make it seem like we actually suffer. Because a man who suffers... Well. And later, when listening to the interview, I found that there were a lot of questions that she ought to ask men that she simply didn't.So I got diagnosed to have a moderate depression, but when I thought about it afterwards I concluded that it's probably a severe one. When she asked me if I had thoughts about suicide, I sort of wavered on that question, even though it actually does come into consideration once in a while. We don't want to seem weak, and even as a mens rights activist I don't know the extent of my own role well enough, to actually open up and say it.But back to the interview.... Basically, the researcher Kenneth Reinecke explains how men often have different way of expressing depression. The reason men don't ask for help, or even makes less of issues that are quite severe, is because we don't want to lose status. Men may become more agressive, more irritable, and more defensive. More... For the lack of the right word, bitter. In society we have this perception that depression is a sort of sorrow, crying, public displays of sadness and so on. And it really is - for women. But for men it's another story, and it's something we're not trained to watch out for or recognize.So I think it's something we ought to spread around. Men and women are different psychologically, and we have different ways of expressing how we are. The suicide rate is so many times higher among men than it is for women, but imagine if we could lessen that statistic, by informing people about this psychological research?So, yeah. Here's an article that actually seem to cover what depression looks like for men:http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20521449,00.htmlTake care of yourselves!

i_always_give_karma [info] My freshman year of college I felt this big time. I talked to a therapist and all I can really tell ya is time heals these things. I was in this hole for atleast 6 months and I didn’t notice a change until one day I realized I didn’t feel so trapped anymore. Take a day to just do whatever you want sometimes. I still get overwhelmed like this (still in college) and I’ll make sure to devote a few hours in one of the next few days to relax and do what I want. Skip a class and have a self day. Mental health is very important and it’s perfectly normal to get that overwhelming feeling of dread you have! Pm me if you ever need to talkOh ps I was diagnosed with depression when I talked with my therapist. It’s always there but you kinda learn to cope or learn how to make yourself not feel as bad. I still have days where I wake up and feel like I’m small and worthless but I have to remind myself that I have a mental disability and hope when I wake up the next day I’ll feel better.

A year or so later, I was diagnosed with depression and went through long phases of feeling like nothing I ever did was worthwhile and just wanting everything to stop but every time I think about that one innocuous comment, I feel a bit better.

ebony_vint [info] Running out of Options. Constantly thinking about not wanting to be here anymore. Hello,I'm kind of at my last options here. I've had a very rough time as of late and just need some support. Earlier in the year, I was diagnosed with depressions. Sucks but what can you do, what put on antidepressants straight away. I am currently a Uni student so I went to their services here in the UK. I was only allowed councilling for 6 weeks, it wasn't very helpful. In March I meet this wonderful man. Things were great but I had trust issues from my previous relationships. In August my friend died, one of the worst pains I had ever felt and then 2 weeks later my Nan also died. To make matters worse This "wonderful" man broke up with me the day after my friend's funeral. I was heartbroken. I still am.I moved 100 miles from my friends and family but they are not very supportive anyway. Every time I ask them for help they just say "stop feeling like this". I haven't even told my family as they are very closed-minded and would give me the same old "What do you have to be depressed about". I am alone, the only person down here is him and he has blocked me on everything. I didn't do anything wrong and I am certain other people meddled. Thoughts turned to suicide very quickly, I don't want to end it all because of a boy but he really was amazing, I was never happier. To have 2 people pass and then the best thing to happen to me ripped away kind of just made me not want to be here anymore. I was told by people to phone 111 but I am too scared to pick up the phone and I have no one here to do it for me. Here in the UK if you want someone else to ring 111 (which is a non-emergency line) you have to be in the same room as them. I asked him for help, via a friend, he blocked them too.I have been emailing the samaritans but they don't seem to offer much help, they are just asking me a lot of personal questions that I don't feel 100% comfortable telling someone over email, as I said I have trust issues. Most of my life I have never really been alone, I have 4 siblings so my house was always full and I had a group of friends. But now I have no one and people are "sick" of helping me. I feel like a burden, I feel it will be easier if I wasn't here. People keep telling me to think of those 4 siblings, but right now I would rather be selfish and just stop the pain. Every night I just sit in my room. I have these very strong painkillers 500mg ones, I just want to pop all of them out and take them all, see if I can finally be at peace. I am running out of options. I really don't know where to turn anymore. [info] None [info] 1572633797

madlyinlov3 [info] Sleep way too much, doesn't like coffee but looking for other sources of caffeine What are things you eat/drink to keep awake and to stop needing naps throughout the day?I've been diagnosed with depression a few years ago when I visited a psychologist but it's never been the serious kind, I just sleep way too much even if I'm excited to work on projects (think like, 9 hours of sleep along with 3 20min naps throughout the day). Unfortunately my insurance only covered a few visits so he wasn't able to really prescribe me anything, but it really seems like the best thing I can do is develop a caffeine addiction. I can't stand the smell or taste of coffee. Any recommendations? [info] None [info] 1548861540
MaxScar- [info] I was just diagnosed with depression that i've had for years. There's only so much motivation and whatnot you can do on your own. Sometimes, which is mostly the case with depression, it's more of a chemical problem. If taking medication helps me live a happier healthier life then sign me up because I'm tired of living life like this. It's cause me soooooo many problems that I don't have the space to write about. And a psychologist will also know if you do in fact need meds and will be able to prescribe if need be, whereas a psychiatrist can't prescribe if need be. Then you'll have to go through a whole new process, talk to someone new and have and pay for more appointments. I do think its important to have someone to talk to though, so maybe both in conjunction. Not everyone has to stay on meds forever, but they do help. [info] None [info] 1551968351
khmer703 [info] I was diagnosed with depression since I was 13 and have learned to live with it. No medication, no therapy, just learned to cope with it throughout the years.You know how it goes. It's not as simple as labeling it a mental health disorder. It's not as simple as just having a bad day, or feeling shitty. It's psychological and emotional. It's compulsory. When our mental health defines actions, or our emotions compel us to make decisions, we may not necessarily really want or believe.For example, you've probably experienced this too. When you lack self esteem or self confidence and you project it upon yourself to the point where you believe it and act on it. Saying things like:&gt;Baby I'm worthless, I don't deserve you.&gt;I offer your life no benefit, you could find someone so much better than me.&gt;I love you with all my heart, but my own personal inadequacies are just a burden, and it's not fair for you to have to deal with it.The thing I learned about depression and living with it is, it takes a certain amount of self awareness to realize that it's happening, and to consciously control it, so it doesn't control you. Most people don't have the self awareness or that level of control to realize that their going through an episode, and it is defining their actions, and causing them to react a certain way. That's why some people need medication or therapy or a combination of both. Even though the problem might be obviously apparent to you, he may not necessarily realize it for himself or he may not know how to control it and address it proactively, and that's where the problem lies. What you have to do is help him to understand that he does need to seek out help for himself and that you will support him through the process. Don't give him an ultimatum but explain to him that his mental state is what defines his actions, and the best thing for a healthy relationship is for him to act and make decisions in the best mental state possible. Seeking professional help to address his depression will not only benefit him personally in the long run, but your relationship together as well because it gives you both the best opportunity and the best chance for success. Tell him that you'll support him throughout the process, but you can't make that decision for him he needs to make that decision for himself, if he has any hope of successfully managing depression.That's the thing about depression, it never really goes away. We have to learn to live with it, and manage it in a way, so that it doesn't manage us. [info] None [info] 1516561712
cloudsrpretty [info] Life is going. I'm making lots of progress though. I was diagnosed with depression a couple of months ago. Honestly, it was a relief, to finally know what was wrong. I'm trying college again for the third time (UK), and I'm not actually doing that bad. I'm on medication and having counselling, so I'm oh so slowly getting there.

SidusObscurus [info] It frustrates me too. But also I understand. I've been diagnosed with depression. I didn't have depression before all this bullshit was going on. It is unlikely you'll hear the optimistic side of me, because even that comes with caveats. Caveats because previous hopes have been dashed again and again (Well maybe the Republicans will let the investigation proceed unimpeded. Well maybe the Republicans will override Trump's non-enforcement of sanctions. Well maybe Republicans will acknowledge Russia's attack on our country and join the Democrats to do something bipartisan about it.)For example, me being optimistic is this: Well the investigation is still proceeding, and there is still an election in November, and Trump may still be impeached.And it comes with caveats: Though Trump tweeted an order for Sessions to end the investigation; and we know the Russians hacked the 2016 election and they are hacking the 2018; and even if my hope does come true, history suggests the extremized Trump supporters will not quietly accept the peaceful transfer of power.Some of this is depression, but certainly many of these concerns have substantial historical evidence to back them up. It is extremely difficult to be optimistic under such circumstances. Especially when much of your support group (in my case, my family) will not validate your concerns and reassure you (instead my family keeps asserting "this is just politics, everyone has their opinions", even though this is *demonstrably* not normal).

Rhuey13 [info] Neil Young helps me through the day I'm only 17 but I've been listening almost exclusively to Neil for about a year now. I've listened to it all: studio, live, bootleg, in person. Neil's music has helped me through a lot this year. My ex's have attempt to degrade me into nothing, I was diagnosed with depression, my aunt nearly died from being an alcoholic, and I couldn't afford my dream college. Life's rough but the music is always there. Sometimes it's Massey Hall, that On The Beach live acoustic bootleg, Zuma, whatever.

deathday [info] I started having a lot of problems at 15. Then at 17 they turned into legal problems. I was diagnosed with depression too but I could never stand the medicine they gave me. My only advice is to try and weather the storm because your mind will get a lot more stable in your 20's. I'm 33 and I wouldn't say I'm as happy as other people but I'm not thinking about suicide anymore or the much worse things I used to think about when I was 15. I was incredibly unstable then like you seem to be now. If you can make it through without doing anything final and without getting anything on your permanent record (like I did) then you'll go on to have a pretty good life. Good luck.

I just had sound enough of a mind and a supportive wife to know I couldn’t handle it myself.Cutting out drinking has done wonders for me. I still need medication for balance but alcohol tips the scales on my sanity. I work in the industry as a salesman for very large brands so I have to pretend around coworkers.

robbdire [info] &gt; I tried the ways without it for a good six months.6 months? That's not that long. I was diagnosed with depression in 1996, it'll be 20 years mid July. I was on medication for a few years, didn't really work, but made it a bit easier. Eventually we had to try other things, counselling, breathing exercises, just trying to get myself to a better place within my own mind. That took 4-5 years overall until I was able to do it myself and keep it up.You took 6 months, that really isn't all that much.However, despite offering advice, suggestions, ideas, reasons, you seem set in your way to be a failure. No one can help you unless you are willing to try and help yourself. From what I see here, you are not. So I'm done.

kerkypasterino [info] I'm a complete failure I'm not sure if I'm actually gonna post this, I'll see how I feel when I finish writing.I'm a complete failure. I've never succeeded in anything in my life. I'm 19 and was a low achiever at school, to the point that I barely made out of it. The thing is, it's been this way throughout my entire life. Ever since kindergarden, I used to fail to do the most basic things, and that includes making friends. I mean, I had friends back in that time, or atleast I thought I had. Today I realize I was just an annoying kid who'd follow a couple classmates around while they told me to leave them alone/mocked me, bullied me, etc. That went on until I was 15, I think, when I realized what was happening and started changing and tried to make actual friends who'd actually want to be around me (in which I guess I succeeded, so there's that). However, the constant abuse that I received from those so called friends plus the expectations from my parents not being met (which lead to several fights at home) completely destroyed my self-esteem, that is non-existant nowadays. It was around this time that I was diagnosed with depression, but I refused to believe this and basically ignored the treatment for as long as I could.So I said that this kind of stuff happened up until I was 15. During that year, I failed school, and then switched schools to a new one where I made lots of friend. Well, probably not "lots", but for me it was a lot, since I never really had many friends. It was around this time that I met her. God, she was amazing. The coolest person I have ever met. After a few months of being extremely close friends, we started dating, and everything started going great, I was doing okayish in school (a lot thanks to her, she'd help me studying and what not), I was happy, my family was happy, I had a reason to keep going and to try my hardest. Then, one day she said she wasn't sure if she wanted to keep dating, and everything fell apart. She was in another city spending her vacation with her family, and I was working in our hometown. Everyday I'd call her and ask her to please not break up with me, and then she'd say that she was really tired of it all, and I' say that I'd change anything she wanted for one last chance. Then she'd say "Ok, one more chance." and that was it. This conversation happened the exact same way atleast 30 times, until one day she blocked me on Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram and Snapchat, and I'd never hear from her again. I was crushed. I still am. Fast forward 2 months and she finally answered one of my calls, and right then and there we "officially" broke up. I think the hardest part was to hear that she never really loved me, and that all that was said and promised was a complete fucking lie.Summing up: The girl who was my best friend and girlfriend dumped me after spending 2 months without talking to me (or letting any sort of information about her get to me, essentialy).I tried to get my shit together, but I just can't. I've been on medication for almost a year now, whilst seeing a psychiatrist, but nothing seems to help. I started smoking weed, which was a great relief, and my parents are extremely disappointed with this. I think I never saw them so unhappy and just generally worned out by something. I've contemplated suicide a few times, but I'd never have the balls to do it. I'm a complete failure and disappointment to anyone I've ever loved, and I just wish I didn't feel this way anymore.Thanks for reading this, I guess. If anyone did read the whole thing, please leave a comment. It doesn't have to be anything big or whatever, it just comforts me to know that someone knows what I'm going through.

RipleyRiot [info] I can't animate anymore and it breaks my heart. I'm not sure this is the right flair if it isn't I apologise... I just need to share this with someone who will understand I always like bed animation. Ever since I learned to rewind and play a VHS I would watch again and again any Disney movie I could get my tiny hands on, I would put paper over the screen and copy frames because those were he most amazing friend I've seen and I wanted to make movies when I grew upI bet many can relate to that.... When I was 14 I went to the doctor and learned  the tendons on my wrists have a malformation, there's something similar to a cut on them so they work as two weaker ones where there should be one thicker one. He said they could attempt to surgicallyend it but here was an almost equal chance of loosing my hand movements as there was of fixing it.He said I shouldn't use my hands to type, brush my teeth, write, draw or eat. Of course, I might as well not use my hands at all then. At 15 I drew so much. Leaned so much. And of course as any teen I did a lot of fanart. An art teacher said I had talent and she wanted to see my folder to pick a drawing for a local competition and I was so happy and proud and excited.But as she looked at my drawings and I excitedly today her what they were and who the characters are and all the techniques I used she only said "So, none of this is yours.. there's nothing. No original work whatsoever in this folder?" I was devastated I drew all of that. Myself. I posed those characters I colored them. I used character sheets for reference, I made them wear different clothes.... But... So that doesn't count? At all???I used to complete 400 pages of sketchbooks with colored drawings in 3 months at the time.After that I was lucky if I could find it in myself to draw a page a month.Nothing was good. Everything I did I was afraid I already saw somewhere else, I hated anything that resembled anything, I'd scrap out any tiny line I wasn't happy with.I went to college for graphic design at 17, I still loved animation, drawing, art... I just couldn't produce as much... But I picked up a pace then.I finished 4 100 pages sketchbooks in 2 years, which wasn't so bad I guess..I went to college for that because my father wants some to get a "real degree" but in exchange he promised to pay for an animation post grad if I got the diploma. And so I did. And I went to vancouver for a classical animation one year course. It was the best year of my life. Not the place to talk about it maybe but in school I was bullied and had an eating disorder and one friend, in college I was bullied again and managed to have two friends.But in animation? I was friends with everyone! Everybody was great and kind and passionate about the same things, we stayed at school late drawing together, went out to life drawing sessions on weekends, watched movies and tried to animate the FX.... I was drawing again. I felt like what I did was good. I was being productive and passionate. It was amazing.But when winter came and every hour  of the day we got out of the building was dark and cold I started having a hard time getting out of bed, found it difficult to feel joy when a few days ago I was ecstatic... And I was diagnosed with depression.I knew it'd come. All women in my family have it... And so my Visa ended, and I had to come back home. The industry here doesn't pay well and I was sick. My eating disorder came back, I had month long depressive episodes... I was a mess.Fast forward a little I met my now husband and I did a course in tattoo. It was a lot of fun, and I even started animating againBut... This time I couldn't draw for more than a few hours and my wrists would be killing me... It'd be difficult to open doors, and carry my plate to the sink...it'd be hard to pour juice into my cup even...We're soon moving to California and now I'm heartbroken... I always wanted to work with art... But now... I spent a lot of our money learning to tattoo and getting equipments... getting into animating and doing drawing freelances...Only to find out that I can't do it.... I physically can't do it. I think this wasn't so much about just animation... more of a rant/ off my chest thing... But I'd just like to leave a tip... Please artists take care of your hands. Even if you don't have a condition like mine, where it's genetic It's truly sad when you CAN'T do what you love....I catch myself super excited to draw bit I can't spend more than 10 minutes with a pencil now....I just realized this because we were talking about what kind of work I could do over there and.. I had to hold back my tears because lately I've been ignoring this as if "oh I just don't feel like drawing as much, it's fine" But it's not fine. That's a lie.

WhyNot1138 [info] I suffer from anhedonia too! I was diagnosed with depression at an early age. I lose interest in every single thing I've ever liked. No matter how much joy it's given me in the past, when my depression takes over I can't see how I ever enjoyed those things. I feel like I just want to be in an undisturbed comma. Those around me try to cheer my up with things that they know I like doing, but can't seem to understand how I don't like those things when I'm sunk deep into depression. It feels like hopelessness.

Fortunately, we'd only dated about a month when I broke off clean, and he never had the chance to meet my friends/family/etc. Guy still sends pics of any business bearing my name and selfies with this dog he sits occasionally. He was fun, but quickly saw his judgement and mean-spiritedness (he called himself "opinionated and high-spirited") toward anything he didn't understand (depression, "how can someone allow themselves to fall for the bullshit old wives tale of ADHD? That's weakness.") As soon as it clicked that he was no longer on his better behavior an this is the real thing I quit. I told him that I always feel shitty around him, thinking he'd understand because I've been diagnosed with depression (also had neurosurgery years ago) so he should be glad to be free to pursue someone who fits him better.. yet here I am 10mos later, still getting holiday wishes and pics showing he hasn't yet let go. Why?? What drives obsession like that? Isn't it obvious that it's done, over?If it's not too personal, what'd this guy do to harass your inner circle of people, and for how long?

butterflywolves [info] I've been told that the diagnosis is really only necessary if it can get you what helps you function. If needed to say "I have been diagnosed with depression" allows your school or work or insurance to help you, then that is very important and understandable. The difference may just be in the comfort that the diagnosed person has with having a title. It can be really affirming to have the diagnosis if you deal with mental illness because it validates our experiences. [info] None [info] 1561860847

yourfrigginguide [info] Considering I've been diagnosed with depression it's hard to tell. There are also other factors in my life such as relationships, friendships, schoolwork, stress, exercise, overall health, financial matters, etc. One thing I did when I was religious was that I worried about being save not for my own sake but for my future spouses(I was a mormon). Overall in just that consideration I think I'm happier. Though the harassment from some of my mormon "friends" isn't too pleasant. [info] None [info] 1370576869
backsideslash [info] I was diagnosed with depression in college, most likely from excessive alcohol intake and a couple other things. I went through 3 different depression meds before I finally found the one that works for me (Welbutrin XL). The medicine, combined with a deeper understanding of my thinking patterns and emotional reactions, has really helped me tremendously. While I don't work in the beer industry, I am a big (literally and figuratively) homebrewer and have many friends in the industry. I've got 5 taps in my basement and most of my social life revolves around beer or breweries. I'm definitely not an alcoholic, but beer is a big part of who I am and my biggest hobby so I couldn't see myself giving it up as part of my weight loss plan if I wanted it to be sustainable. While I'm still new to the weight loss game, I've found that limiting my beers to Friday and Saturday has been very successful. I lower my calorie limit during the week and then increase it a few hundred calories on those days to allow for 1 to 2 beers and I'm still within my calorie goals for the week. I've lost 25 pounds in the past 2 months doing this with really no change in diet and only light to moderate exercise. I'm never going to tell someone to drink if they think they have a problem, but I know from my own experience that if I drink every day, even if it's just 1 drink a DAY, or if I get drunk the night before that my depression is at its worst. This is likely because alcohol is a depressant and most depression meds explicitly warn you not to drink alcohol on them. So, my recommendation would be to talk to a doctor about meds, stop drinking, and monitor your calories. If you want to try drinking, I'd definitely recommend not doing it every day or to excess and making sure you count the calories for the Beer you're drinking and not using Bud Light (barf) calories or something.

glqck [info] I'm nothing without my medication. Hey, i'm Bradley. I'm turning 16 close to the end of this year. This year's exams that are upcoming are really, really important and will determine my near future. It's stressful, but I always avoid getting stressed. Here's where the first problem comes in: when i'm not stressed, I don't worry about the exams. So in the end, there's completely no effort when the day comes.Medication started about a month or two ago. So far, i've missed some days and yes, my psychiatrist knows. I won't elaborate on my problems but basically I have been diagnosed with depression after close to 3 years of suffering in silence. And it has been tough. Seeking help didn't relieve me that much, but it did. My mood changed a little, i'm kind of more positive in terms of my everyday life. Just school, sports and home. A cycle.Everytime there's signs (which are triggers, but i'm afraid of telling my teachers or psychiatrist because i'm just too scared to) i'm always getting into that depressive episode. I get easily angry, especially to my friends and I tend to be impulsive during these "anger moments". It's tough dealing with depression. Really tough. Medication just makes it seem like I can't handle things on my own, and drugs are needed just for my mood to get better (I mean, when I was a child it was so easy to be happy, why not now?). I seem to never forget that without medication i'd be dead. I don't know if I should see it that way or whether I should take things on my own. It's masculinity, right? If we could handle this, we're stronger than others, right?People always tell us that it'd be better if they understood what I was going through, but must I really tell _everyone_ that I have depression?

Deadamisa911 [info] My husbands parents did this to him all the time. When he told them what they said bothered him they would say, "You're turning into a woman." "You're too sensitive." "You're such a snowflake." We had to go no contact with them. (I say had because they gave us no other choice.) At first we just wanted to limit contact like through social media and stuff. They freaked out because we blocked them on Facebook and Instagram. They called us demanding that we unblock them. Through out the entire phone call we were incredibly polite, but they refused to listen to what we had to say. After that they started harassing us, and we had to block them or we wouldn't have been able to go to sleep. Then they went nuts. It's been about a month, and we've been forced to change out phone numbers. The things is they seem to think I'm convincing my husband that he's depressed. However, I never once said that he was.

OmnisLibera [info] My Birthday Had Just Ended, And I’m Sitting Here Balling My Eyes Out. Every birthday, it happens. For the past 3-4 years, I get an overflowing sense of emotional fatigue during the day of my birthday, only to come crashing down in the night. I was diagnosed with depression back when I was in 7th grade, and I like to think that I’ve overcome it. But it’s days like this where sometimes I question that belief. All of my close friends are now out-of-state, and I have nobody to go to. Family is tough, so that’s a no-go. So all I can do is sit in the dark of my room and listen to music until it goes away, like it does after a few hours of this. But why? I never feel this way on Normal days, but right now I feel like my soul is crashing down on itself. I don’t know how to explain it, but it hurts. Every little inconvenience today hurts. Every kind word, every card, every gift. I’m so grateful for it all, to the bottom of my heart. But I’m in pain, and I don’t know why. [info] None [info] 1566533958

Misogynist-ist [info] Resubmitting: General advice and improving weak arches Typical sad story. I used to do folk dance, but got married, moved, and didn't have the opportunity to continue. That was my main form of fitness and at 5'0" I was, at one point, between 90 and 95 pounds. I didn't even eat well, I just exercised and walked a lot, and I had accountability in the form of dance competitions and dance friends.Six years later, I've gradually gone up to around 150 due to a number of circumstances and am tired of it, so this summer I am trying to turn things around. I really hate gyms and classes, because my self-consciousness becomes pretty crippling. It's also not really something I can afford at the moment.Now, for the things that have been making this more difficult:I've been diagnosed with depression in the past and for a few years, was on medication. I haven't been on meds for about the past eight years, but have noticed an increase in my symptoms lately. I'm being open with my loved ones and support network and at this point don't need to consult a doctor, but if they feel it necessary, I will.It just means I have had more bad days lately where I don't have the energy to do much of anything. On my good days, though, I'm pretty good. I like going for walks, and I live in a place where there are ample opportunities for birdwatching, which is a good reason to get out of the house.I just got a bike. Yes, it's weird, but the last bike I had was a tricycle when I was 6. It's more than 20 years later and I'm finally trying to learn, because it's become necessary. I don't have a driver's license in my second home/country and buses or walking don't solve everything. Learning it is going to be an uphill battle but I'm confident that I can get it done by the end of the summer. I learned the very basics of swimming last year, so this should be a piece of cake.One of the things I've been doing in order to make exercise a habit is gamifying it. I love DDR and used to use it on non-dance days as a way to maintain endurance, balance and body awareness. I have a dance pad now and Stepmania, and it has been fun. I had about a week where I was doing it everyday. Today I did my first in about a week and a half, but I've been doing a lot of walking in the meantime. All in all, I've been upping my activity, and generally, it's improved my mood on days when I have the energy to do it in the first place.That brings me to my main question, besides the general advice on what kind of schedule I should be setting for myself, is about foot pain.I have pronating ankles to begin with and extra-stretchy ligaments that proved problematic when I was dancing. Those aren't such a problem with DDR, but when doing jumps, I've started to notice a 'thin' feeling/pain in my arch, as if it's a rubber band getting pulled taut that is asked to stretch even further than it can. I thought it was plantar fasciitis, but upon getting some advice from a friend in the know, it was suggested that weak arches might be the culprit. Sometimes it's in one foot, sometimes it's in the other.If I end up going to the doctor about this, I'd like to have an idea of what to ask. How can I improve weak arches if that's what's going on? How do I differentiate between that and plantar fasciitis? [info] None [info] 1464190340
MemeGodAshton [info] I’m having a rough time, I don’t feel wanted, and I’m struggling to find motivation anymore So over the past few weeks, I’ve been having quite a lot of trouble. Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile, sorry for grammar as well, I’m not very good at writing.Let’s begin 9 months ago, I was diagnosed with depression. I was never really happy and constantly felt unwanted or unneeded, and I didn’t have many friends. Fast forward 3 months, I meet my best friend (R). R was a kind, pretty girl that I had a crush on for a while. 1 month after we met each other, some of my very few friends decided to tell R I had a crush on her, which didn’t help my situation at all. I didn’t know what she thought about me at that point and we just started to talk differently to each other. R started to show interest in me and I started to feel really good about myself. This goes on until about 2 months ago where we started to fight and argue a lot. This hurt me quite a bit and I was trying to make it stop. After about a month it started to become a daily thing.2 days ago R texted me “I think it would be better if we weren’t friends anymore,” and I started bawling. What I responded to her was “I think it might be for the best.” Over the past 2 days I’ve lost all but 4 friends. R is constantly trying to make me angry by making rumors about me and I don’t know what to do.Also if anyone wants to talk sometime, I play Xbox a lot and my gamer tag is TornadoSmash999 [info] 14 [info] 1557029036

leadpainter [info] I am not trying to be a contrarian but I believe my first LSD trip did the opposite to me. I have many brothers and none are alcoholics or addicts of any sort. I didn't have any addictions or any real addictions until that night. In fact it changed me for the worst. I couldn't hear the word *acid* for years without a flashback (sometimes lasting a second to months) and extreme anti-social behavior. I was diagnosed with depression, PTSD and GAD. It did make me stop smoking cigarettes and playing with all drugs for a period of time, but my only escape from the confines of my mind was alcohol and drugs. After years of guided imagery and EMDR therapy I was able to get ahold of my mind. Around that time was when I realized my coping was actually an addiction. I've been able to get off all serious drugs through power of will but landed on Alcohol hard. I can't decide if the first trip or Alcohol has been more damaging to me as I can't decide on cause and effect. I sometimes believe I am better and stronger for it but other times I am convinced I am different, not exactly better, while trying to live my life as another plagued alcoholic.

HellbornPhoenix [info] Should I (25M) travel to meet my online friend (23F)? So basically about 1-2 years ago I wasn't in a terrible place, but I wasn't in the best place either. I was very sick from a chronic illness, lost my job, had to move in with my grandfather. And was so distraught that I was a bad dad because I couldn't pay for anything I was diagnosed with depression and put into the hospital cause my dad thought I was suicidal. On top of that my grandfather was yelling at me for not working because I was "perfectly capable" I wen through job after job and the illness makes it so hard. That's the backstory of where I was during this time.&amp;#x200B;Back then I played a lot of game (which caused more tension with my grandpa) just to cope with all the emotions I was having. The games were a very good distraction. One game I played a lot was an MMO, final fantasy 14. I ended up meeting another player in the game, we both played tanks when the new expansion came out. The game was full of bugs and we got past a part that was congested. We joked about it and continued playing together. Everyday we would get on and grind the story out and dungeons and such. Everyday for about 7 months I'd say. We would talk about each other's life issues, hobbies, jobs aspirations, family, we talked about meeting up and stuff too. She's seen pictures of me and my son and stuff. I believe we became really good friends, I think I may have developed a little crush on her. My friends were mad that I played so much with her, and referred to her as my Final Fantasy Girlfriend (we were married in the game and she was the one who said we should.)Then I got a job and had to stop playing as much, and she switched games (as did I). So we would occasionally chat through messages but not as much. She was a major part in getting over all my ailments as I'm relatively healthy now. (Chronic disease has periods that suck, I don't suffer from depression anymore, and my work life is stable and successful.)&amp;#x200B;Recently we have been talking a lot more and she's been telling me she misses me and that we should game together again.

The individual often doesnt even know they are unwell because they have suffered through it their entire life since, and whatever they become addicted to offers them respite from the psychological pain.Depression is very often correlated with Video Game addictions.

Mazlon626 [info] There’s a girl I love so so much I’m not in a relationship with her, I only talk to her from times to times, but goddamn I wish I could say she’s my girlfriend. I’ve never met such an amazing girl, the way she talks about what she loves, how she’s always so passionate about everything, even just the way she smiles, to me she’s perfect. Chatting with her makes me really nervous, but spending time by her side makes it really worth it.Now, the problem is, I’m really scared I might end up screwing up things and destroying all my chances with her. I have been diagnosed with depression, I’m also on medication, my self-esteem is already really low, so I’m terrified at the possibility of falling even deeper due to the possible failure at building a relationship with this girl.

specialkake [info] This is all just my opinion, but I think that we're living in an extremely technologically accelerated time, and our priorities are changing, cognitively. I've been diagnosed with depression and ADHD at various times, and I think that the symptoms associated with ADHD are our brain trying to adapt its function to match its environment. I think that people with ADHD symptoms who also get depressed, we tend to devote as much time to depressive rumination, but we tend to think about things in bits and pieces, rather than long, deep sessions. We process the information, but we're so used to constantly changing modes, it's almost more of a background process. Kind of like how, on reddit, you will absorb, over time, information regarding some new political scandal, just by skimming through all the headlines on the front page, because there's 50 reposts. But the only links you're clicking on are lolcats. Later, someone will mention it, and you'll be like "oh, I heard about that somewhere."   When I'm depressed, my girlfriend will know several days before I do. My behavior changes before I even realize it, and by the time I figure it out, I'm almost over it already.

throwa2934 [info] Four years ago (when I was around 18-19 years old) I used to run 8-10 miles a day. Ever since I was diagnosed with depression (around age 20) my exercise habits deteriorated along with a lot of other stuff in my life. Now that I've been out of college for a year, I've had time to think about my life and get myself together, but unfortunately my depression has still been eating away at me.Throughout the past two years I've exercised but only on occasion and in moderate amounts. Whenever I thought about exercising, my depression would get the better of me and I would justify and rationalize reasons not to exercise. I used to think things like "Oh, having a sexy body is only egotistic and narcissistic" or "Exercise is just a momentary, temporary pleasure to distract you from real, important issues." Like, I just couldn't convince my mind that exercise was something that I should be doing enough to the point where I would actually will myself to exercise to do it.Today was the first day in years when I engaged in serious exercise. I'm going to try to get back in shape. I went for a run today. It was only about 20 minutes, but it was painful, stressful, and made me cough up. But I did it. And I'm going to work my way back up to that previous pace I had 4-5 years ago.Fuck depression. Forgive my language. [info] None [info] 1529197594

faeriesprite8 [info] The System is broken I want to start of saying that I am grateful to live were I live (Australia), It could be so much worse and I am grateful for "mostly" free access to mental health care. Today though, today i felt like there was no one who could help me. I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 14 (10 years ago) over those 10 years i have seen 8 different therapists. 8! Recently I had been seeing a therapists that I really connect with and I had been seeing her for a long time, she really helped and had been with me through a number of bad times. I was told just a few months ago that I could see her any longer as I was no longer studying at that institution and she had no other practices I could see her at.  So that is, I was drinking myself to sleep every night and calling suicide hotline and I could no longer see my therapists... great. Today I went to the doctors and got a new referral to a new therapists and I started the process again... I feel sick and sad and over it all. To top it all of, her next available appointment is 3 weeks away, I booked in to see her but 3 weeks. Really? [info] None [info] 1551935777
pinkempyreal [info] Losing interest in hobbies is one of the many signs of depression. Gaming is a serious passion for me and a great way for me to escape after a hard day at work or just from life in general.  I am diagnosed with depression and even with meds I still occasionally find myself in a rut and I don't feel interested in gaming... during those times when I try to play it feels like a chore. Burn out is definitely another possibility and it happens to everyone at some point but if you have any other symptoms akin to those of depression you may want to look into talking to your doctor. Best of luck! [info] None [info] 1573871125
Ab10ff [info] This always pisses me off. I was diagnosed with depression about 6 or 7 years ago. I wasn't upset or sad about anything, I just felt shitty so I saw a doctor like you should. Guess what? I got some medication, changed some stuff in my life, and I was fine about 1 year later. I also never told anybody while I had it because why would I? It's a sickness. And what do you do with a sickness? You fix it before it gets worse. It's not something to be romanticized or used to gain attention.

I've been on medication for four months and I feel like a different person. I don't want to rely on this medication so I've been seeking other resources to help out and have made a lot of changes in my life. I never felt like I wanted to kill myself...but man, did I ever feel completely miserable and useless.

UmiFish [info] I'm diagnosed with depression, I never had a loving non toxic relationship but I can tell you that having someone by your side is important to me, when I'll go into depression-like state I useally push people away from me, even when I wished they would stay. Having someone fighting you for staying near you at those moments is really helpful. Moreover when depression hits, I lose all motivation , I get confused and I don't know what I want or feel, if he's at that point I think giving him motivation to move forward is keyWhen I'm depressed, I can't manage asking for help, even if I want to. If he experience similar things , you shouldn't ask him if he's ok when he is clearly not, you should try to understand what happend and help him, you need to initiate.Being in a relationship with someone who suffer from mental illness means practically sharing Thier pain, that's probably the reason why people avoid these kind of relationship. If you love him and seeing him smiling is worth it, keep being there for him, even if it's though. Telling him that's your are going through all of this because you love him and want him to be happy will probably motivate him to better himself and make you happy aswell [info] None [info] 1554215597
ehsahr [info] Yes, but there's a range in which the highs and lows are normal &amp; healthy. One of the major symptoms of depression is that the highs and/or lows are way out of that normal range. This is something that is often intuitively known by people who have experienced it, but it's difficult to express to people who haven't. That's why it's so difficult for other people to accept that somebody else has depression without any other severe symptoms. Doctors know what details to look for that indicate the highs/lows are out of the normal range, which is why people shouldn't argue when somebody says "I've been diagnosed with depression."

mrpickles1234 [info] Always!Why I say that, is I was recently diagnosed with ADD, at 19 years old. Originally I was diagnosed with depression, but my antidepressants weren’t cutting it. I experimented with stimulants and told my doctor how my experience was better, so he changed my diagnoses and gave me adderall. After awhile on stimulants, I started to make connections with friends I knew in high school, my family, and acquaintances. I noticed some correlations between all the symptoms of depression you can see in ADHD, and those I know who had a more stimulated upbringing and what not.

marlerr15 [info] My fragile mind So I was ban for an unknown reason on r/offmychest but I figured being a teen myself I'd post it here.I been keeping this to myself for over 2 years now. But it started on grade 7 with this guy name Paul he bullied emotionally and mentally throughout that school year. That the reason why I got to a lower section. It did stop for grade 8 due to Paul not being my classmate anymore. But it came back at grade 9 and even worst from the past 6 month I never felt happiness a chuckle, a smile but not happiness. After talking to some people I was diagnosed with depression. Through the first month of grade 9 I felt unwanted by the whole class uninvited by my friends they just seem to be friends when they want something. My family didn't help due to me being secretive I never told and even if I did they'll just tell me to man the hell up due being a 15 y.old Filipino. Sometimes I find ways to forget my problems by writing poems, bicycling to calm places but I sometimes think of ending it all. I was think of a quick and painless death I also considered drown myself a couple times by thinking of  jumping of bridges. Then it came to me a gun just a bullet to my head can end it all but I then realized it was impossible. Then my next suicidal thought was to crash my bike to a barrier at 30 mph or jumping of the church's roof. But sometimes I get my shit together a calm the hell down by stress eating which damages my savings and health. Sometimes I just go to my room and burst into tears while setting the TV volume to 70. Just as I said never shared about this until today. So this my pain in on paragraph. One question should I end it? [info] 15 [info] 1573394238
Kung_Fu_Kunta [info] Help me Hi I don’t know how to start this post, I’m pretty sad ?I was diagnosed with depression about a month and a half ago. I’m 18 years old, male and live in Canada. I was diagnosed with ADHD (severe) when I was 6. My dad also has a pretty severe ADHD but was never diagnosed until long after he finished university. And two of my three brothers also have ADHD. So ADHD has always been a big problem in my family. I’m also the second child out of 4, just for your info. I also have a Tourette syndrome, if it even matters that I mention it.All my life in school, I was always the moony kid, someone recently told me that I was the most oblivious person he’d ever met, now that really hurt. I once asked a girl in my class if she could hook me up with a sheet of paper and as she did just that she joked with me (without any mean intentions) that this sheet fitted my personality... it was a rough sheet. Now that you know what of person I am.I got through high school with minimum effort, and then I went to college, that’s when my problems really started.Don’t worry I wasn’t bullied, no one ever bullied me anyway, they were just kids being painfully honest with me, And ever since I can remember, I was naturally marginalized. I don’t wanna blame anyone for that. I’m not mad against anyone, I’m just really depressed that wherever I go I always manage to be known as a muddle-head.But anyway, once I got to college I couldn’t handle the work and I would just procrastinate until the last minute to study/work for my exams and essays. And so,on the first semester failed 2 classes And on  the second semester I failed 4 classes, and right now I’m in my third semester and everything was going great, I managed to motivate myself enough to currently pass the first 4 courses (out of 5). But that was until I sensed that the finals were coming, I started procrastinating again, I started to miss classes accidentally again ( by forgetting to set up my alarm, by staying up late and not waking up etc ...)All the while I start having two contradicting thoughts inside of my head; I want to succeed, but at all costs I don’t want to study. It’s hard to describe but when I try to motivate myself to study, I like have the book in front of me, all that’s left to study is to pick up the book and read it, and somehow, I can’t. I struggle to get myself to actually open the book, and study for more than 10 seconds. All I can think of when trying to study are dissonant thoughts, I shouldn’t study; it’s so boring; I should do something else. I have like a 5 second attention span so I like have to read the same sentence like 20 times over just to be able to not forget what it said right after I finish it. This constant rollback when reading only happens when I’m reading something I don’t want to. I have no self-discipline, I’m civilized don’t get me wrong. But I can’t ever guarantee to get something done by a certain date or a certain hour, or guarantee to not forget something. My mind is also very disorganized and my thoughts come in an anarchic order, for example: I never know where to begin to explain a concept to someone, random informations about the concept will just quickly come to me, but in a disorganized way. Sometimes i stare at my study books until like 1 to 2 am in the morning without being able to convince myself to study for my own good. It’s the exact same feeling you sense when you want to talk to a girl you find cute, can’t find the strength to do it. Today I let down my team members in college by arriving 20mins late to their presentation because I forgot to set my alarm. I’m tired of being me, getting up everyday feels like I’m watching a movie, no matter how hard I scream inside my head that I want to change my behaviour, when the time comes to change and take my responsibilities it feels like I’m being asked to put my hand on a burning pan. What is wrong with me? I don’t want to live like this anymore. Help me, please. [info] None [info] 1544224355

As many have said already on here, he is responsible for his mental health, no one else. A support system is essentail, but he seems to be an asshole using the excuse of a mental illness. I was diagnosed with depression around 15ish. I took me a long time to get all the help I needed, but that's exactly it, as I'm sure you know as well, I needed to want the help to really receive it. I had a friendship that became toxic because of just this. He admitted that he probably had mental health problems but refused to get help, and didn't want to get it. I had to cut him off. Haven't talked to him in over 5 years and I know other friends that had to cut him off too. You did the right thing OP. I wish you the very best!!! [info] None [info] 1547481781

Beginning_End [info] I'd like to point out that clinical depression isn't really "being sad all the time."Depression is actually more a sense of emptiness. That feeling of, "Why bother?" It's not being butthurt about your current problems, that's a completely normal reaction. It's about feeling empty, unsatisfied and unmotivated ALL THE TIME, for no real reason. I've been diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder and I can tell you one big difference between "being sad" and having depression. When I was suffering through depression, **I wished I could even feel sad, or angry or anything**.Feeling nothing about anything for months or years is far more fucked up than feeling sad.Being sad or angry might make you want to kill yourself, in it's extreme states.Feeling nothing makes you think that there's absolutely no reason not to.

Blade4u22 [info] True happiness vs happiness brought on by Adderall *TLDR: Has my Adderall made me ok with living a mundane life or was my thinking pre-adderall the problem and I'm chasing an unattainable /unrealistic form or happiness on days I don't take my pills. Does anyone else feel this way or have any experience or advice*I just found out about this subreddit a couple of minutes ago so I thought I'd get some advice. I've been 25, turning 26 this month, and I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD a few years ago after a trip to the hospital. Since then I have been on Adderall, which has helped me in school and in general I've been happier. My problem arises when I stop taking because I don't have anything going on. I don't feel withdrawals or anything like that, but I start to wonder "Are my pills the only thing keeping me happy?"Growing I've always been a risk taker. From cliff diving to stealing from department stores in high school, I loved the rush of living life close to the edge and being spontaneous. Fast forward to now and I'm with my girlfriend who's the opposite of that. She's sweet but hasn't taken a risk her whole life and judges me when I don't want to plan ahead. I know she loves me and things seem good as long as I take my Adderall. If I don't I get caught up thinking would I normally be with her or do the pills make me content? These thoughts scare me and keep me up at night because I can't figure out which thoughts are the right ones. Does anyone have any advice? Anything would be great even if it's anecdotal stories.

Okay, so a few quick things about me:20 years oldFemale 5'11"170 lbs(ish)WhiteCondition has been going on for 3 weeks as of today- coincidentally after a doctors appointment I had where I was diagnosed with depression. I know this may be gross, so I apologize, but most my bowel movements have been practically complete liquid/very soft. Yesterday, I had one that seemed more solid where one may not classify it as diarrhea, but it still came out softer than what was normal for me before. Other than my mental health, my body has been in almost perfect health and I'm relatively active, haven't had alcohol since august or so, and my diet isn't terrible.Also I should say, I go have a lot of gas and moments where I suddenly have to run to the bathroom to relieve myself. This all has never happened to me before and I'm very nervous, because my mind automatically fears the worst. I fear I might have to end up with a colostomy bag or something. I have another doctor's appointment scheduled in a week or so, but do any or you have any ideas of what could be happening and steps I should take in the meantime?Thank you.

mimidudette [info] I'm sorry you're in that limbo-sort of mood, I've totally felt that weird listless empty feeling before and it's definitely weird because it's not like you're sad and can do something to cheer yourself up, you just feel ... empty???? Usually I smoke pot when that happens but then I end up either sleeping or eating so idk if that's necessary a constructive solution lol. I'm definitely not a psychiatrist but I was diagnosed with depression a while ago and I associate the 'empty' feeling with depression, i.e. as I've started taking meds I've experienced it less and less. Sometimes stretching and going for a walk helps me feel better, or at least makes me feel calm and serene about it, maybe that'll help? Either way I hope you feel a bit better tomorrow.

HowlingFailHole [info] I can't handle my life but every way to change it feels overwhelming and impossible I don't even know if I want advice or not... the problem is I feel like each option I have is completely, insurmountably impossible for me to actually do. I am completely stuck and feel my only option is suicide.I have had mental health issues for at least 15 years and was in inpatient this time 10 years ago for anorexia, but bar a month off work for stress when I was about 24 I have held down a pretty high stress consulting job. In the past I have been reasonably successful, but I now feel unable to do anything. I can't do my work. I keep messing up. And I can't interact normally with other people and I feel like a freak all the time. (I've never been able to interact normally, that's not new.)I think maybe I only ever felt like I was worth something if I was achieving something, and now I can't do my job anymore so I feel incompetent, and so I feel completely worthless. I know that's irrational and I would never judge someone else to be worthless just because they struggled to hold down a job, but in my case I feel it's true. I have nothing else to offer. I can't reason myself out of that feeling.I feel like I cant carry on at work. I was struggling massively anyway, have been for months, but then I took on a role that requires 3-5 hours of commuting each day depending on how bad the trains and traffic are and it's killing me. I feel pathetic, like everyone else commutes, I just never had to because I always made sure I lived close to work, even if it meant sharing somewhere really shitty. I can't so stuff normal people can do. I can't talk to new people without it taking everything out of me. And yesterday we had to commute to another country so I had to leave at 4am and get back at 10pm and spend almost the whole day interacting with new people. I spent the entire train ride there and back just going over and over how I have no option but to kill myself.My bf says I should ask for stress leave from work but I feel like I can't. I agreed to this new role and if I pulled out it would screw things up for one of the only people in my company I actually like. It would mean the weeks of induction I've had (why?? so unnecessary) would be wasted. It would be embarrassing for my company. And fundamentally I just can't face having that conversation. It feels like suicide is a much more realistic alternative. I know that's dumb but I can't express how impossible that conversation feels any other way.My bf says to at least speak to my line manager about it but I can't. He's obviously clueless about mental health stuff and I know he'll just react uncomfortably and dismissively. This should be stuff I can handle, it's just not. I know it's bullshit to say I can't and I should just do it but I don't know what to say... it feels so much like I can't.I feel like I have to mentally bully myself every second of the day just to get myself to at least be at work, but then when I'm there I can't so anything because it's really hard to mentally bully yourself into cognitively difficult tasks, even if they're things I would have been able to do in the past. But if I let up on the bullying myself I won't get up, so it's not like I can just do self care or be kinder to myself. I called in sick today which I feel pathetic about but I couldn't face how many people I needed to talk to today. I woke up literally shouting in fear multiple times during the night, then again every 20 minutes even after I'd called in sick. That's how I wake up every day at the moment. Like I'm coming out of a nightmare but I'm not, I'm just waking up to what should be a good and totally handlable life, that I just can't handle. It's pathetic.Oh idk if it's relevant but I've been diagnosed with depression, anorexia, and adhd in the past. I take meds for adhd but I don't want to go back on ssris. I'm in therapy but when I explained this to him last session I couldn't properly articulate this or even properly look at him. And he's not the type of therapist to give his opinion on things or give advice. I think I need to leave my job. I hate it with a passion. It's soul crushingly  pointless. But I can't face the whole process of leaving. I feel like I need to ghost my job. But if I stay for another few months I might get a fairly significant pay out as I have stock options. It's such a privileged problem to have a hate myself for not being able to cope with this. [info] None [info] 1574434144
zack2491 [info] My girlfriend is a type 2 diabetic. We've been doing keto for ~8 weeks now. Her bg was all over the place for the first couple weeks. Your body is currently freaking out, pulling glucose from muscle stores, afraid it's about to starve. You've taken away the fuel source it's been dependent on for years! The best advice here is to keep calm and keto on. Give your body a week or so to become adapted to running on fat as fuel, and your BG levels will likely stabilize and be lower than ever before.Last week, my gf went to the doc. She'd been taking metformin, jardiance, and injecting insulin on a sliding scale. After 2 months of keto, her A1C is down to 5.7 and her doc took her off all medications. Side note -- I was diagnosed with depression last year. After 2 months of keto I'm completely off my medication as well, with my doctor's blessing. Never felt better!

white_crust_delivery [info] &gt;Since they have chosen to kill themselves, why don't they choose to actively improve their situation? Call me an optimist but I sincerely believe that if a person tries with the best of their ability, they can improve how they live. This misunderstands a lot of what mental illness is. Firstly, your analogy with alcohol/drugs is very misrepresentative of the situation. People are accountable for their actions when intoxicated because a) they choose to be in that state, which is also temporary b) this accountability usually applies to the ways that they harm others, more so than themselves. Its wrong to equivocate suicide to a crime like murder. Furthermore, your notion that somehow people can just improve their lives if they're depressed is severely misunderstanding what depression is. For instance, I have been diagnosed with depression amongst a couple other mental disorders. I've worked very hard at self-improvement. I take antidepressants, and I see both a psychiatrist and a therapist regularly. I exercise daily and eat healthy. I stay really busy with school and extracurricular activities. But at the end of the day, I still hate myself. I still think life is pointless. I still don't understand why I'm bothering with any of this, and I constantly think about suicide throughout the day. I can't help it. Depression is feeling like this in spite of one's situation - I have no reason to feel this way, yet I do. That isn't something somebody can just completely change with a bit of effort. [info] None [info] 1427037124

tdot456 [info] Lost friends I’m not sure if this is really a question or a rant or something in between but I feel like I’ve lost a ton of friends over this stupid damn thing and I’m wondering if anyone else has been in the same situation? I was diagnosed with depression and I feel like I’m just not the same person I was as before. I used to be part of a big group of friends but I feel like I sort of just drifted out and now I’m at that awkward place where I’m not feeling like I’m unwanted but at the same time, I’m either not invited because people forget me or because I gusss I’m not part of that inner knit circle.Now I just feel like no one is really close to me anymore. And I know sometimes people will say stuff like oh if they aren’t there for you now, they weren’t really great friends to begin with but we’ve known each other like half our lives (granted I’m in my early twenties).Shit just sucks.

Flurzzlenaut [info] Having a really bad month. I’ll start of by saying I was diagnosed with depression when I was 7. I’m 20 now and it only keeps getting worse. This month has been especially bad.  I’ve been looking for jobs for the past month since I’ve finished college and was ready to move out on my own. I can’t find anything and I’ve been feeling like it may be because people in this town know me and don’t like me for some reason. My parents are mad that I can’t find a job when my younger sister found one earlier last week. They’ve been yelling and of course this makes me feel like a total waste of air. It’s been keeping me up at night for around 2 weeks now. On top of this I’ve been noticing more and more that my boyfriend finds his work more important than me. He often chooses more time at work rather than hanging out with me. He was supposed to be off this weekend but that ended up changing for some reason so I’m all alone. I have no friends I can go out and do things with to get my mind off of things either. I feel trapped. I feel like no one actually cares about me. And honestly it hurts worse when even the person you thought you wanted to marry chooses his boss over you. I just don’t know what to do anymore. It’s been really hard and I just feel like giving up.

NotARobot-IPromise [info] NTA at all.  I was diagnosed with depression in middle school, major depression in my twenties, and I still struggle sometimes.  When I was going through the worst of it, I’m sure I leaned too hard on my friends; but your reactions / distress are totally reasonable, and the boundaries you’ve set are, too.  It’s really, really hard to be someone’s sole source of support when they’re in a deep depression.  Unfortunately, from what I recall, it’s also really hard to control yourself when you’re in a deep depression, so your boyfriend’s ability to comply may be hit-or-miss; but if it’s too much for you, you’re allowed to set boundaries (up to and including leaving, if you ever feel like that’s what you want / need). I don’t know much about alternatives to SSRIs - they’ve always worked great for me.  (I took SNRIs once for like, three days, and was like *“NOPE, I do not think norepinephrine is my problem”*.)   Hopefully, whatever he’s taking starts working soon; also, hopefully your bf is being open with his prescriber about his continuing symptoms.  Depending on the drug, and how long he’s been taking it, the dosage may need to be adjusted.Also, FWIW - my best friend experienced very severe depression in his teens and early twenties, and he is also resistant to therapy and SSRIs (he had a very bad reaction to Zoloft as a teenager).  He still has days when he gets very gloomy (usually related to politics), but overall, he’s okay now.  I think maybe his brain just evened out as he got older; he mellowed.  (To be fair, I didn’t know him until he was in his late 20s, but  from what he’s described, his depression was quite bad before that.)I’m *not* saying everyone mellows – my parents didn’t mellow, and I have only reached the higher plane of comparative serenity that I am currently delicately balanced on by taking the right dose of SSRIs - but it seems like some people do.

bubble_gum272 [info] Last year I wasn't feeling like myself. I couldn't see it but others could. I was apathetic, unable to sleep, and depressed. My mother made me see my family doctor and within 2 days of seeing my family doctor I had an appointment to see a psychiatrist. That appoitment lasted 3 hours and I was diagnosed with depression that day. I saw my psychiatrist every 2 weeks for 3 months and then once a month after that. Each appoitment lasted an hour. I'm glad to say that I'm doing much better now and am back to my old self.The Canadian healthcare system works when you need it too. My doctors were concerned about me and made sure that I got the help I needed and that I got it fast. I was amazed that I was able to see a specialist within 2 days of seeing my family doctor.

Walda_Hamish [info] I don't know if I would have boiled it down to "superior genes", but my N-mother felt the health of her children was reflective upon her success, or lack thereof, as a parent.She could never, ever wrap her head around the notion that even the best of parents have congenitally sick children, children with mental and/or developmental conditions, etc. These things were an embarrassment to her, a black mark on her image.Bad and trashy people had sick or mentally/physically/developmentally challenged children, not good people (according to her). She felt because she was the "perfect parent" (which she clearly was not), she should have perfect children. She was embarrassed that her children suffered from disorders and congenital illnesses because she felt she exuded perfection and someone as perfect as her could not have an imperfect child.Most of this was beyond her control, yet, I think that is one thing that literally destroyed her for most of her life as a parent, and probably as a person. This is one thing that caused her to come undone. She was devastated and disappointed when I was diagnosed with depression. Not because of her empathy towards me, or because she couldn't watch her child suffer, but because it ruined her reality of her being the perfect parent. Same happened when my sister was diagnosed with a congenital illness. She was embarrassed and shamed by this because she felt it meant she failed as the "perfect parent".Other things she didn't acknowledge...that she came from a family plagued with alcoholism, substance abuse, addictions, compulsive behaviors, mental illness, absenteeism, infidelity. Hell, she wouldn't even acknowledge when family members had cancer, hypertension, heart disease, even arthritis. When one of her family members got stricken with or died from such illnesses, she would say either nothing was wrong or they died "mysteriously" or there was "no proof" they had such illnesses.She would hunt me down and tell me to "never" tell anyone that Aunt [] or Cousin [] had cancer...or had a stroke...or whatever because the world would judge me and put shame upon me. Well, yeah, Aunt [] was clearly at least 150 pounds overweight, had spoken of suffering from hypertension...and Cousin [] was a known lifelong heavy smoker and drinker. How is this a surprise that they died from related illnesses?It wasn't until I became educated about narcissism that I realized how detached from reality my mother really was.And, like your dad, she prided herself in that she wasn't "messed up" like most other kids' parents, she would tell me to be thankful she wasn't one of those "immoral mothers" who had to work, who "didn't care" about their kids, and that her parenting skills were, hands-down, most superior compared to any other kid I knew.

MrsBadExample [info] SSRIs have saved my life, seriously.I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago now, and they started me off with Wellbutrin, a fairly low dosage. It worked decently, and I felt a bit better, and had more energy. But it wore off pretty fast. I had an entire year where it wasn't working but I didn't understand, and I dragged back to suicidal thoughts and tendencies, and became a recluse in my own house.My doctor, who is pretty amazing, recognized the problems without me even saying anything to her and prescribed me Prozac. The adjustment period was extremely rough - I was very tired, I felt extremely flat and kind of "bleh" about a lot of stuff. But after being on it for over a year, I feel fairly normal besides being maybe a bit more tired than normal, and I don't want to kill myself every day. I still get depressed, however the suicide thoughts have almost completely ceased, which is *absolutely wonderful*. It's also helped immensely with my GAD, so I've been happy with it.Therapy also helps, but the medication is an insanely helpful tool. Being off of it is terrifying, and the backlash is literally frightening. [info] None [info] 1494328548

tamnan [info] I just had what I think was a productive conversation with my dad. I was diagnosed with depression a little less than a year ago. I only sought help (and got diagnosed) after failing out of an entire quarter in college. That’s four classes all at once I got F’s in. My dad started off very upset and pushing me to go straight back into school and get my life back on track. After I was diagnosed with depression, he got a little better because at least there was some reason beyond what he assumed was just me being lazy, but he still wasn’t understanding. He told me to just go back to school and try again, and just do my work this time around. Essentially the equivalent of the “have you tried just not being sad” argument. Hoo boy, did I not realize just how frustrating that actually was until it was happening to me. Shoutout to [r/wowthanksimcured](reddit.com/r/wowthanksimcured)Since then I’ve been seeing a therapist and working to build confidence in myself and my ability to complete tasks. I’ve also learned how to better catch my negative thoughts and analyze them to see if I’m being realistic or assuming the worst case scenario. I’ve learned how to better communicate with the people around me and tell them not just how I feel, but also how they are affecting how I feel. The deadline to apply for readmission to my college for the next quarter is coming up pretty soon and I’m planning on applying. I think once I step back into the classroom, I’ll be able to focus on schoolwork better than the quarter I failed out of. I’m more comfortable with myself and have gotten much better at kicking or controlling my bad habits. I have a solid support system of a few friends I’ve known for years - one of which just transferred into my college, so he’ll be nearby if I really need someone to go to. And he knows what’s been going on with me, so it wouldn’t be a shock to him. And I know me asking wouldn’t be a burden on him (something else I’ve learned to realize through therapy). Just about 30 minutes ago, I had a conversation with my dad about where I was in regards to going back to school. He was upset that I hadn’t submitted the readmission application yet and started to get on my back about it. He did not yell at me, though, which is something that I explained to him doesn’t help when communicating with me. Thank you therapy for teaching me how to approach that one. Really, therapy has been a huge help to me throughout this whole ordeal so far, and I’m still going. Regardless, back to the conversation with my dad. I explained to him that, while I get his focus on me getting back into school (he dropped out of college and is now struggling financially), him tunnel visioning on it makes it feel like all the littler improvements I have been making don’t mean anything to him. He admitted that he hasn’t really noticed these smaller things, which I then had to concede that since they were smaller (I stopped biting my nails, started sitting up straighter, am prioritizing small tasks better, am reading more instead of being online all the time, shorter showers), it makes some sense that he wouldn’t necessarily notice them, but that these are still important things to be doing that help me feel ready to tackle school again. The whole conversation felt a lot more productive since it didn’t turn into a yelling match between the two of us, and I didn’t end up crying myself to sleep. And by the end of it, I think we mostly came to an understanding - at least on some level. But those are smaller tasks, and school is a big one. And I think I’m ready, but I’m also still kinda scared that I’ll fail again. I brought this up with my therapist and he pointed out that I have a longer track record of academic success than I do of failure. That does help. This turned into a bit of a rant, but I felt like I kinda needed to get this off my chest and I’m already in bed, so I don’t have the notebook that I sometimes write this kinda stuff down in on me. If you’ve read through the whole thing, thank you. [info] None [info] 1550041903

mairodia [info] I still have nightmares about my middle school bully, and in a way it makes me feel sort of good? Justified? Idk [Conflicted]**Background:**I was treated pretty horribly in middle school by an entire friend group (*supposed* friend group, I should say), but one girl in particular was very awful. She never said anything outright awful really but she would make sure to purposefully exclude me from things in front of others and would spread rumors about me and talk with the others in front of me about how horrible I was using a different name so I wouldn't know that they were talking about me... Actually now that I write it all out I guess she did do very awful things outright. Hahaha.Anyways, I tried to kill myself twice because of all the treatment I received from that friend group, I felt worthless and horrible. The school found out and I had to start going to therapy and I was diagnosed with depression, but I've never really felt like I... *deserved* to say I'm depressed, I suppose. It's been a long time since then and I've grown up and moved on a bit and generally am less depressed. I still am depressed most likely but I haven't seen a therapist in a few years now and I never took medication for it, and my symptoms aren't so bad that I feel like I can never get out of bed or do anything, so I feel like maybe I'm not *really* depressed, or at least not *that* depressed, and I often shove my mental issues aside and try to discount them because it's not like I'm currently being bullied right now.**The Present:**Even though my middle school bullying is done and over with, sometimes I still have nightmares about that girl who treated me so horribly. One moment that stuck with me in particular is her turning to me and telling me that "You know nobody likes you, right?" And sometimes she'll pop up in my dreams telling me that. A lot of the times I'll be having a perfectly normal and nice dream, hanging out with my friends and my SO, and all of a sudden, she'll appear and tell me that nobody likes me, that all of the people here are pretending to like me, that I'm a loser, that I'm a horrible person, etc etc etc...It's awful, obviously. And I wake up with my heart pounding feeling scared and alone and mostly feeling weak and helpless for still being traumatized by some shit that some dumb 13 year old said to me nearly a decade ago. But in a way, it's also a bit of a reassurance. As mentioned, I feel a lot like I don't really have mental problems or that my mental problems aren't really that big a deal. So these nightmares give me a bit of a feeling like, "Hey, yeah, your brain actually is pretty fucked up," which makes me feel not so horrible about the times when I feel depressed and like I want to be swallowed up by the floor and not exist anymore.It's probably not at all a healthy method of coping, hahaha. But I don't know. It's working. I guess.I feel like this is sort of stupid to post, but when I reread this to check for spelling errors it's making me shake and feel sick so I'm pretty sure I definitely have issues. I'm just in this weird limbo between feeling guilty that I have mental issues and feeling guilty that my mental issues aren't that bad. And the dreams/nightmares make me feel more justified in wherever the hell I am on that spectrum. [info] None [info] 1515627577
FatLute94 [info] Yeah man. I've been diagnosed with depression ("diagnosed" but I don't buy into a lot of mental disorder shit just because of how rampantly people are diagnosed and abuse diagnoses like that) for a few months now and in the past few times I've visited my therapist or psychiatrist I've realized that when we go back to the start of this increased state of depression I was in for a few months, it actually lines up with around the same time I felt that I wasn't getting as high or "having as much fun" at least.Hopefully that makes sense, basically I just discovered that at least for me, personally, my own depression wasn't really being helped a whole lot by smoking. Yes, it totally helped me just zen out and not think about things, but because of my "condition" (again, eugh, but not too sure how to refer to it) I still was exhibiting all the physical signs; not doing anything, not wanting to socialize, staying in my room. Thankfully today I'm doing better *and* have been trying to remedy my depression without medication and doing wonderfully.

ianratman [info] what the fuck is up with me okay so I paint I guess? And I've been in my room for a whole week without really doing anything. Then today I had to draw something because I got inspired out of nowhere and I drew 5 digital pieces on my drawing tablet real quick but then my nose started bleeding. I didn't have a tissue, but I did have an almost empty cup of water next to my bed, so i just kinda let it drip in there til it stopped. Because I didn't want to get out of bed. Then I did anyway because, hey, god or the force of the universe or whatever has given me free paint (dumb-assery starts about here)! I started painting with the noseblood/water, but I didn't like the red because it was too diluted, so without really thinking I snipped a cut into my arm with a pair of scissors I had on my table. Mind you, I don't self harm by cutting. There wasn't enough blood to deepen the color as much as I wanted and then I??? took a sip???? What the fuck? Now I'm just sitting here with noseblood in my paintbrushes and throat and I'm not sure how the hell to process this lmao.I'm not trying to pull a WebMD, but what the fuck? Am I just an idiot with one brain cell or is this something else? I'm diagnosed with depression, but depression doesn't usually make me into a gross fuck :/ [info] None [info] 1546633397
kwarner93 [info] Hormonal birth control Hormonal birth control almost ruined my marriage. My husband and I have been together almost three years, married for two. After our daughter was born I went on “the pill.”It was a gradual change but we began fighting. A lot. I was mad and sad and depressed all of the time. No motivation to do anything. I began to pick apart every little thing my husband did. He finally demanded I seek help &amp; I was diagnosed with depression &amp; PMDD.My doctor suggested I go off of my birth control for a little while as the synthetic hormones in the pill adversely effect over 50% of women on it. My husband agreed.I’ve been off of hormonal birth control for two months now. I haven’t felt this happy in ages. It’s like a fog has cleared in my brain. My sex drive is back, I’m motivated, I don’t pick fights anymore. I can see how I was spiraling, when I couldn’t see it before. TL;DR Never going back to hormonal birth control.

youngest_wren [info] 1. To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee—read this religiously in middle and high school. 2. Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman. Some of the first real poetry that I read. I was amazed by how much Whitman loved the world. 3. The World According to Garp by John Irving. Such a strange and awesome novel, and one of the first great books I read on my own as an adult. 4. One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, for the same reason as above. 5. The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. It was really important to me when I was diagnosed with depression. 6. The Virgin Suicides by Jeffrey Eugenides. I thought the narrative style was so interesting and unsettling. 7. Wild by Cheryl Strayed. One of my all time favorite memoirs. 8. Hyperbole and a Half by Allie Brosh. I think this counts even though it started out as a blog. I’ve never read a funnier blog, and her posts about depression resonated so much with me. 9. The Son by Philipp Meyer. Anyone who has been even vaguely interested in Native American history should read this book. 10. The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver. Searing and haunting novel.

pyperproblems [info] My dad has dad jokes -- he has a restaurant joke, a golf joke, etc. just depending on what we're doing, he'll pull one out. He has a joke about counselors, "if you can't get the help, get the degree!" I've probably heard him say it 100 times. When I was 16, I was diagnosed with depression and had to take medication. I also started really getting into my Psychology class in high school, and I wanted to do counseling. When I told my dad this, he pulled out his dad joke. I ended up getting a bachelor's degree in psychology, and always maintained that I didn't want to be a counselor. I never wanted to be that person my dad talked about. So I applied to 10 different PhD programs, all revolved around research, and I got a job working with autistic kids. The place I obtained my undergrad just opened a new clinical program a few years ago. I spoke frequently with the director, asking a lot of questions and telling him my dilemma. Right before graduation, he offered me a spot in the program, and I accepted. So now I'm enrolled in a masters program, intending to do clinical mental health counseling. I'm home for Father's Day, and last night some talk show host was giving people advice. I made the comment, "I hate when people without real degrees, who aren't qualified to do counseling, do it in a public forum and tell people what to do." He said, "even people with the degrees aren't good enough to fix people. If they were, they wouldn't make any money so they have to keep people screwed up." My mom says he "doesn't know what he's saying." IDK I think that's bullshit. I've tried to chalk it all up to him being a traditional conservative dude but it's definitely affected our relationship, unbeknownst to him.  [info] None [info] 1497794357

OBSDEC [info] PSA on depression. PSA: if you have depression, seeing a doctor should be your number one priority. Number. One. See your doctor regularly, too.Backstory: I was diagnosed with depression many years ago. Got on meds, saw my doc regularly to check up, and all has been good since.My work life has gotten super hectic lately. I figured that was why I hadn't been sleeping well, and why my spiritual life seemed so...empty. Like I was going through the motions. This feeling is not unusual for a Christian, so I did my usual and made sure I was extra-disciplined in my prayers. I also haven't seen my doctor in awhile, because my schedule is ridiculous.I am taking a weekend-long class soon, so I was getting together my medications to pack. While looking at the dosages, I noticed that with the brand-switching on my antidepressants, I had started taking only half my usual dose. For at least three months, and perhaps longer.Of *course* I can't sleep well! Of *course* my relationship with God feels different. If I'd kept my doctor appointments, this probably would have been found out long before now.Depression affects your relationship with all facets of reality, including your spiritual reality. God can slap down a miracle right in front of you, and you might be totally blind to it. At its worst, you can feel like everyone and everything has abandoned you, when it is *not true.*Sorry for the ramble. I just see people post about depression in here often, and while I am always happy to pray for someone's well-being, depression is an illness, and like any illness, it requires a doctor's intervention.Please, from someone who went from the verge of suicide to living a pretty decent life, God calls people to the medical profession for a reason. Please see them. [info] Episcopalian (Anglican) [info] 1569557171
NewBelieve [info] In a similar situation, consultation regarding scheduling of the sleep study is in 17 days, worried I won't have it.  I've been fatigued almost my entire life, originally I was diagnosed with depression, but even in times of my life where it had faded temporarily I still have been so damn fatigued.  I remember being much more energetic when I was younger, around ~7, maybe all kids are like that. I hope I'll be able to have an ounce of that energy again.The issue is that after losing weight I no longer snore, even if it isn't necessary for sleep apnea.  Each day I get more and more stressed about this, I've been trying to get a consultation for around 3 months and now that it's coming up soon it's just a waiting game.  I'm 17 at the moment, 140 pounds, male, healthy on blood tests as well. Studying for the career I want to pursue has been hard, I have such intense brain fog that absorbing information is difficult and frustrating. Have you had this issue as well?  It takes me about 3 hours to consume the material it would take a normal person 1 hour (from anecdotal experiences). Surprised my GPA close to 4 considering how hard it's been.  My diet is fine, and others have recommended exercising, which I took up, even after a month of running every day there had not been much change in energy levels. I don't fall asleep randomly like most people with sleep apnea (from what I've read). I'm just insanely ~~tired~~ fatigued  and if I have the opportunity to sleep during class and such, I always will.  It's frustrating really, I wake up with a really fast beating heart, lasting for around 20 minutes+ and I'm always extremely thirsty regardless of the nap/sleep length. I expect it to be UARS.I read your follow up post, and I wish you luck in that your case will be resolved. [info] None [info] 1573959298

When I meet my friends they are all very well employed and full of plans and I keep saying "yeah, when we get stable...when we get a fixed income..." I feel like a failure repeating this Everytime, for almost a year now. I was diagnosed with depression for about two years and I thought this was getting behind me.

greaseyspoonbob [info] When I first went to the dr about my mental health I was diagnosed with depression and put on an SSRI and it put me into a manic psychosis.I've only recently gone back on one (2 months ago) and this time I've avoided the mania, probably as a result of the mood stabilisation of the lithium.It took about a month to get the dose right and then a couple weeks for the dose to have the effect bit the last couple of weeks I've felt better than I have in years. Obviously it's too early to say whether this will last but so far I seem to be managing both mania and depression really well. [info] None [info] 1567909470
WryLeo [info] I was diagnosed with depression in college, and spent some time with a therapist, but it’s been years since I’ve been to one. After the last few months I’ve been through, I’m too exhausted to try and search. I’ve been experimenting with different boosts for my shakes, but I know I can do much better. The prices are so expensive, so I’m hesitant to try a bunch unless I do research first.

Zernos [info] Isolation Recently, I have been wanting to isolate myself from people. I feel like if I talk to people, my opinion won't matter. I try to make friends but they all end up hating me for some reason or thinking I'm a creep for no reason at all. I have had enough, and I just want to isolate myself. I just don't really like life in general and don't really care anymore about socialization and all that unnecessary stuff. I have been hurt too much to point where I just don't see goodness or benefits in this so-called "Socialization". I just think that I would be better off not talking to people. Of course, if I am in a job area I will, but out of that, I won't. One more thing, I haven't had a girlfriend in 3 years because I just gave up on that too. I have been diagnosed with depression and that is probably a part of this. This depression causes me to get away from people. I don't really like myself because I have pushed people away and I have been hurt so much to the point where I don't want to make contact with any human being ever again. I just have so many regrets and I really, like I mean...really hate myself and this so-called "special" life that was given to me. I honestly hate God for making me this way. How would a loving God make me this way? I don't see no light at all at the end of the tunnel. I have never attempted suicide because I am too scared, so I am just patiently waiting on death to come.

Upgrade30 [info] Extremely contradicting I’ve been told I was extremely handsome since middle school but now it seems no one is impressed by my looks and I’ve only had one girlfriend my entire life. I’ve been flirted with a few times but now I get nothing. Since I was diagnosed with depression I have gained some weight and now my confidence is lower that ever.

Pragmaticom [info] It's been a struggle, but honestly now I can say I'm happy. It was rough at the end last year. I was working at a McDonald's which slowly fell into disrepair because of how ignorant the owner was, and the only thing that kept me there was my co-workers, and my then partner whom I also worked with. Later that Winter, I learned about how bad my best friend's abusive relationship was. She was horribly manipulative, and it went almost to the point of him committing suicide, but now I can gladly say he's out of that relationship and is doing markedly better. During this I was diagnosed with depression by my therapist, and when brought up to my PCP she prescribed me Zoloft, and at the time my head was so clouded with emotion that once the meds took full effect I thought I was fixed, I felt better, didn't want to die, and thought that I made it. I thought I was happy again.I was back to normal, is what I thought. Because what's the likely-hood of having two mental illnesses, right? I've already got one, so since that's fixed now my thoughts and actions must be those of 'normal' people. So if I'm normal now why do I wake up in the morning angry over literally nothing, as nothing had even happened that morning? Why did I want to cry for seemingly no reason? How come my brain still goes back to my ex's and I's last fight, focusing on what went wrong, and what did I do to make her lose interest in me? I found myself in the same spot I was before I started on depression meds. But this time I thought everyone felt like this, I must just be too sensitive, or too day-dreamy to get anything done.A few months ago my therapist diagnosed me with ADHD after doing the "Adult Test" or whatever it's called and scoring pretty high (At least it's one test that I can get a high grade on). After some consideration I told my parents about the diagnosis because It was getting to be too much for me to keep living in an endless cycle of pure unwarranted emotion, I was burnt out. It was a two month waiting period for me to meet my new psychologist, which is why I regret not taking action earlier. I started Ritalin last Monday, and it's like a huge weight has been lifted and I'm no longer being weighed down. I exercise every morning now, I enjoy sitting still, I read a book (hadn't finished one since 4th grade, I'm 18 now.), and I've drawn more in these past two days than the last 17 years of my life. I want to live again, and this is something I never thought I'd see for quite some time, and although it was terrifying to admit I had issues and get the required help, I am so glad to finally start working on living 'normally'.I still hate the fact that I can't tell a story without making it waaaaay too long, because God knows if I tried to go back and proof-read this I'd probably end up doing something else.TL;DR Last year sucked and I wanted to die, but after being diagnosed with ADHD and Depression, and being prescribed the proper meds, I like doing things and can function semi-normally now.Bonus Story: So I started typing this with the intent to ramp up to and tell this little tidbit of a funny, but ended up just writing my life's story... so ooops. Anyway, this is the story I \*meant\* to tell.I had been diagnosed with ADHD for a couple of days, and my best friend mentioned previously and I were driving around as we like to do some times just to get out of the house. I decided it was time to bring up my diagnosis while there was a lull in conversation. I turn to him and explain my situation and he replies, "Wait you didn't know? You've been like this your whole life I thought you would've realized by now." I start doing the half-angry-but-not-really sort of laugh-tone I use when we dicker about something obvious that I didn't realize before and say, "No I just thought I had a shitty brain and forgot stuff easily! Isn't everyone like that?" Apparently everyone else had noticed I had ADHD but me, it would've been nice for at least someone to tell me.Bonus TL;DR My best friend knew I had ADHD since I've known him, he never told me.

AT-ST [info] &gt; And I am curious what types of mental illnesses he had and what types of illnessesIt could be anything really.  He could have been diagnosed for depression or PTSD years ago and has since recovered.  He could have also been diagnosed bi-polar recently.  The term "History of mental illness" looks scary and is really a hot button issue.  But the truth of the matter is that there are plenty of mental illnesses that shouldn't prevent you from buying a firearm your entire life.For instance, I was diagnosed with depression in High School which was over 17 years ago.  This means I have "a history of mental illness."  Should that preclude me from buying a firearm?  No, I have since recovered from it and not currently taking any medications for depression.One of my best friends was diagnosed with PTSD back when it was the cool thing to diagnose every Veteran with.  He didn't think he really had PTSD so he got a second opinion and that doctor said he doesn't exhibit any signs of PTSD (which he didn't).  The doctor diagnosed him with PTSD simply because he had trouble sleeping, something he had been dealing with for years.  Even though a second doctor said he didn't have PTSD that original diagnosis still follows him around.  So he "has a history of mental illness."So whenever I see an article say "has a history of mental illness" I roll my eyes a little.  It is such a vague term that most readers don't understand.  There needs to be more information given before you can determine if that history should be taken into account.Now I'm not saying mental history shouldn't go into background checks for firearms.  If I was currently being prescribed medication for depression sure don't sell me a gun.  If I had a bout of depression 10 years ago, then I think it would be reasonable for me to purchase a firearm.

AlCrawtheKid [info] Oof. I'm from Alberta too and I'm worried about this happening to me. I'm so close to ruining myself. I can't focus in class. I can't do my homework. I can't focus. I used to do well academically too \(I'm a highschool stuent, mostly honours classes, a lot of 80s and 90s from elementary until grade eight because I never had to try at all\) but I was always disorganized and all of my projects were always late. I just had really forgiving teachers who were glad I handed it in well done instead of staying up all night and handing in a half\-assed piece of work. Now I can't get my notes done, I can't do my homework and I've been diagnosed with depression, get 70s in math class, one of my best classes and I'm scared I'm progressively getting worse and worse and worse. I hope you find a doctor before you run yourself dry and end up in hospital like me, dude. Any doctor who brushes you off is not worth your time. Push and push until you get to see a psychiatrist.

statsigfig [info] Have you been diagnosed with depression? I’m not trying to diagnose you, but that’s pretty much what happened to me before I was diagnosed with depression in my third year of university. I think you should talk to a doctor and an advisor at your school to try to figure out the best way to deal with this. At my university, if something like what you described had happened, and you were diagnosed as having an issue by a doctor, you could typically get your courses from that term wiped away. You’d need documentation and to be getting help for your issue to show that it wasn’t likely to happen again, but it’s definitely better than failing your courses and losing the entire term. Every school is different, but most that I’ve seen have some sort of policy like that.On positive side, you had control before. That means you can get there again. Living with a brain that’s inconsistent is really hard. You can’t be too hard on yourself if for no other reason than it will make it that much harder for you to pick yourself back up. Talk to people around you. Tell them what happened. Work on getting supports in place so that if it happens again, you’ll be ready for it. [info] ADHD-C [info] 1552961760
ItsSaturdaySunday [info] 5 hours of hypomania daily with Lexapro I’m wondering if this is normal. I was diagnosed with depression and GAD so I was prescribed Lexapro (Escitalopram). It’s been working well for me and I’m near 6 weeks. Although I noticed that I’m too happy and too chatty at night as if I’m tipsy/drunk. Also too engaged and adventurous. I usually can’t sleep without a sedative. Friends find it uncharacteristic of me as I’m usually quiet. It only happens in the evening after 7pm. I take Lexapro at 9pm. Is this a normal side effect of the drug or is this something that I should take up with the psychiatrist? I’m normal and relaxed during the day. Evenings are just weirdly manic.

ddixonr [info] I feel like this guy. Although, while I'm worse in that I can't keep a job for more than three months, I do a little more than he's described doing with the kids. I only have one toddler-aged girl, but I still relate. Once the wife gets home, I do tend to get lazier with my daughter. I've been diagnosed with depression, and have tried therapy and meds, but neither took. The therapy went well, but I eventually needed to take a job and they don't have a whole lot of non-business-hours appointments. I would say that you should plan more events, social things with the entire family. Get him to work harder with the kids while you're all together, and hopefully it leads to improvement all around.

MossWolf [info] My mom has also been a bit resistant too, although I think she's getting better lately. Still not 100% on board, but she's not being negative about it anymore, so that's good. I was diagnosed with depression and GAD by a different psychiatrist than the one who suggested OCD. I've lost contact with the first one because I moved away. The second one I was referred to by a GP, and she was fucking terrible. (She straight up asked me "Are you even depressed? Like you don't look depressed", and when I pulled out a list of symptoms I was struggling with, so that I didn't forget any, she looked at me and went "Uh, well, I don't have much time today. You were just kind of squeezed in for 15 minutes between my other appointments"). Soooo I'm never going back to her lol. I haven't found anyone else yet. A true formal assessment won't ever happen though, because of that good ol' $1-$3K price tag. I would like at least a nod of "Yea, sounds about right" from a professional, that would be good enough for me, but I don't know how to go about it. I'll likely have to go see another GP and see if I can get another referral to someone who isn't that terrible woman.I do feel like our experiences sound pretty similar too, thanks for sharing yours! I don't want to necessarily explain myself to everyone, but at the same time, I have some *extremely* "autism-phobic" family members, if I can make up such a term lol. One of my cousins is even the type that refuses to vaccinate her kids at all, ever, because of the autism fear mongering. They're not hateful people though, just ignorant and misinformed, so part of me feels like... it would be really nice to be able to show them what autism can actually look like, that it's not some guaranteed life sentence of being a screeching vegetable like so many people believe. Basically I'd just like to feel like I *can* tell people if I need/want to.I get the looked down on thing though. Especially when people try to make light of or dismiss your problems because you're "high functioning", but then at the same time still treat you like you're just a little bit stupid. People are dummbbbbb.Edit: Forgot to throw this in, even though I know you're not a professional, I still appreciate the validation of you saying you think I'm on the spectrum. It's nice to hear, from anybody, especially when others keep giving you that suspicious side eye. p: [info] None [info] 1518578268
Graiid [info] I am glad the subreddit exists because the YT community scares me to talk about this kind of shit. I know what that kid is feeling. I grew up in an abusive home. Long story short my mother favourited my older brother, claiming I was the "daddies daughter" (cause they had it worse before I came along) but my dad was the primary abuser growing up. As such, all sides were against me. The Mom/Bro duo would verbally/physically abuse me, (respectively) and my father would as well. When I would get upset (a lot like this kid did) I was told I should quit my crying because it was worse for them. Then my brother would come home from school and kick the shit out of me because he had a bad day, and no one would believe me because "he wouldn't do that". When at the age of 11 I was diagnosed with depression and my mother was told I was told that I "shouldn't be depressed because your brother had it worse" and later told to just go kill myself if I was so depressed. I was an emotional kid. I spent a lot of time crying and being told to stop. I spent a lot of time screaming like that kid was on the toilet and hitting myself because I was told I wasn't allowed to cry and be upset.To this day, years later, no one will ever admit to what happened. No one will apologize or acknowledge the shit I had to go through. That kid needs his parents to fucking listen to him and stop focusing so much on their god damn fame. They do not give one shit about their kids well being. Phil is right, it's like "I'll give you $50 if I can slap you". You are going to say yes. Kids even more so. We don't know if they told their kids "This is how we make money. You don't want to end up on the streets do you?" When they bitch. Fuck, that kid saying "at least you don't beat us like everyone else" sounds like a line fed to him because that really doesn't happen as much as that. It pisses me right the fuck off.

Wyntarian [info] Today is the day I cried. My life cannot be compared to others who have lived.I only know my own experiences, no one else's.This is my story as of so far. I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 14. For almost 45 minutes I had watched a man whom I called "Dad" brutally beat my mother within an inch of her life. I have walked in on a friend who hung himself in his room. My best friend throughout all of my school years died the morning of my 18th birthday due to a drunk driver running a stop light. I was sexually assaulted by a man I thought was a dear friend to me, but no one believed me.March of 2016 I could feel myself slipping away into something. I did not know what my was, but I did not like it. I ended up moving out of my Mom's house into an apartment with my girlfriend. About six months later I ended up dropping out of college because I did not have the drive to show up. Shortly after I ended up getting fired from my job. I had to look for a new one. I found a replacement. It wasn't good but it was a job to help pay for rent. I wasn't making the same amount of money that I previously was. My car ended up getting repossessed by the bank. My phone got shut off. My bank account was almost always in the negative. My credit cards got cut off because I couldn't pay them off. All of this drove me deeper into this thing. I cut off all ties with my family because I felt like I was a disappointment. I was at my lowest of lows for the past two and a half years.I walked 2.5 miles to work everyday. My girlfriend was stressed because she was working overtime to keep up with the bills. I became closed off. She was drained. I believe she only stayed with me because she felt bad. I contemplated suicide many times. She was the only reason I couldn't go through with it. After a year of having a crappy job, no car, no phone, and no life I ended up getting a job offer from a person who was friends with my girlfriend. She managed a restaurant and told me she would move me up to management. I took it immediately. It took about 6 months to make it to management. I ended up being able to get a phone again. I still walked to work everyday. Shortly after becoming management I was able to get a beater of a car.  I was finally able to pay more than my fair share of the bills. I wanted to make it up to her. Life was looking good again. I thought we were doing better. I started looking at engagement rings. We had been together for almost 4 years. We made it through all of this. . . together. I had one picked out. One day she comes to me and says, "We need to talk." My mind went blank. I did not know what to think. All I knew was that it was not good.She ended things. I now sleep In the office. Luckily, we had a spare mattress. About a week later she had a new boyfriend. After finding this out I saw how delusional I was to think that she would ever say yes to marrying me. To think that what I had done to her wouldn't have had a huge price to pay. People kept telling me that she was shitty for having another boyfriend after only a week when she was in a relationship for almost 4 years. I defended her saying it was okay. They did not know what I put her through. I couldn't blame her.She is a good person. She waited until I was on my feet again before ending it. I still love her. I tell everyone that I'm fine. I'm not.I go about my days now working on myself. I finally got a haircut after a year of not having one. Just the other day I went to the bank and opened a checking account and savings. I got up today 2 hours early before work. I turned on some music. I got into the shower. Then it hit me. I haven't done this in almost 2.5 years. I started crying from what this meant. I'm getting better. I have been crying this entire time. I have to keep wiping tears from my face because I cannot see what I am typing. Today is the day I cried.Today is the day I cried for making an improvement in my mental health. [info] None [info] 1562773122

BLUE_WAFFLE_GANGRAPE [info] Welcome friend! All I can give you are my personal experiences and observations as they relate to my recovery.1. I stay away completely from anything that has anything to do with drinking. This includes not using non alcoholic beer or anything like that. Sparkling water, coffee, and cigarettes replaced beer for me.2. I have, yes. Some people have them for years and years, others (like me) have the craving removed very quickly. That being said, my alcoholic brain loves latching on to anything that might change how I’m feeling. So while the craving for alcohol / drugs might be gone, I definitely see when I get the craving for other things (gym, women, sleep, sweets, etc).3. Being able to live honestly. Factual honesty and emotional honesty. Being able to ask for and receive unconditional help from people who I can relate to better than anyone else. A sense of belonging and community through shared experiences and thoughts. Knowing that I can never actually let myself believe that I am alone again.4. I was diagnosed with depression during my drinking. I have over the last 6 years gotten off my meds. I don’t know for sure if I have medical depression, and I CERTAINLY get depressed from time to time - but that’s life. I didn’t get sober to make my life perfectly happy all the time, I got sober to be able to handle life on life’s terms through relying on the fellowship and my HP. I need help with a ton, and I have the resources available to not only be comfortable asking for and receiving help but to also get through the best and worst life has to throw at me, all while knowing that I never again need to drink to cope. Keep coming back and keep asking questions. [info] 2203 days [info] 1555871053
RoastedBroccoli [info] Hello, I'm not quite sure what to do. Hi, I am 17 years old. About a year ago I was diagnosed with depression and started medication for it. But for about the last month, I've been hearing voices and most recently having delusions. I'm not quite sure how to deal with it all. It's very scary for me and I tend to overthink everything lately. I have only told 1 close friend and I am debating telling my mom. Any tips or suggestions would be appreciated.

OneRepulsiveFlamingo [info] Does anyone else’s depression get worse with PMS? I was diagnosed with depression last year but I’ve noticed especially recently that it’s worsened. Normally I am still able to function though I do have less energy and feel sort of empty, but the days before my period starts it feels like I’ve been whacked. I have no energy whatsoever, I feel miserable, I get really existential and I don’t see the point in doing anything at all. Is this common for depression? Is there anything I can do about it? I’m not currently seeing a therapist. [info] None [info] 1565369883
EianSiCK [info] I'm a chronically ill non-binary trans guy, and probably would never have come out without the sudden influx of trans/non-binary people in the media and online. I had a conversation with my queer godfather(in his fifties) who told me that if there had been the vocabulary when he was younger he would have identified as non-binary. The world is getting smaller and the queer community is getting bigger because we have the vocabulary to define ourselves now. More people are being exposed to it and therefore more people can say "hey that's me." Also mental illness rates have gone up over the last several years due to economic decline and life-quality decline. I will probably never own a house, I can't afford to finish college and if I did I'd be in debt my entire life. I've been diagnosed with depression and panic disorder, along with OCD. I can't speak for other physically ill or disabled folk but I'm sure there are rising statistics there too. [info] None [info] 1542870511

DarkHippie420 [info] New motivation Hello all.So I started reading about how alcohol affects one's mind. I learned a little about depression (I've been diagnosed with depression for a good ten years or so), gray matter and sensory perception (I'm a synesthete so this really hit me hard) and "brain fog" and such. I want my mind back and feel like I've wasted so much time, money and potential just to get heavenly highs and hellish lows from alcohol. I also changed my phone's lock screen into the art on this card, because that's THE picture I relate to most when being hung over. I wish it helps if and when the cravings hit me. Here: ( http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=86&amp;type=card )I guess I would like to discuss about what kind of changes YOU have experienced mentally after quitting, and what was your biggest motive to do so. For the former I would especially like to hear from fellow synesthetes.Thank you, this support group rocks. IWNDWYT. [info] None [info] 1526489503

CapComOnTheCob [info] Age 13, mum was emotionally abusive and step dad was physically. Not so much physically but little bits here and there. Any argument, whether I was right or wrong, ended in me being stripped of all privileges and my mum acting like she won. This went down to the point of me sleeping on carpet in an empty room when I ran off out the window and stayed with my dad full time since then. I always thought how it wasn't fair that my life was like this for me where even after I left my mum still controlled me, while my friends houses were in complete harmony. Had a wake up call when I was diagnosed with depression later that life wasn't fair to anyone. [info] None [info] 1544963497
Baloogab0t [info] I have been diagnosed with depression by a few different doctors. Once when I was twelve and a few other times since. I started taking Zoloft last year and it helped but the script ran out and I can't afford to make an appointment with him yet. I just came here because it helps to just put it out there. And as the great user below your comment said, my wife's behavior can be toxic but I don't think she is. I think she just has trouble understanding. I mean I hardly understand it and its been going on for 25 years. I mean she let's me rant and then when its over we let it go. She never hits me with the "just calm down" and I like that about her. She makes me feel justified until I finally relax and realize I wasn't justified at all and then we talk. It really is healthy how she handles it, truthfully. [info] None [info] 1545696729
elalmohada26 [info] In my early 20s I was diagnosed with depression and went on anti-depressants for a while. In hindsight I think I was just overly self-centred, had an unhealthy lifestyle, and in a funk and needed to get my life back on track. Only when I realised this did I start truly feeling better. It sounds mean to say, but I know lots of people who say they have depression who eat like shit, drink/smoke too much, and never get any exercise. Then, you have the real depression sufferers. The ones like OP's boyfriend who suffer terribly. They constantly feel unfathomably bad, potentially driving them to suicide.  I feel like as a modern society we normalise the first type too much, over-diagnosing depression, and meaning many people are all out of empathy for those who really suffer. I guess what I'm saying is the lack of common appreciation for the difference between serious, clinical depression, and the low mood (often somewhat self inflicted) that many people feel at some point of their life is harmful.

BobJuan0902 [info] I am living breathing proof that people can overcome mental disorders of almost any type. When I was two years old, the doctors told my mom that I would not intellectually age past 5 years old, obviously that didnt happen since here I am typing. In 2nd grade the administrators said that if I kept on the track I was on that I would need to be permenately institutionalized by 16, or put in a home. Once again obviously that didn't end up happening.I can still remember when I was younger being restrained, and locked in a closet by my teachers. I  still remember my only assignment being a cursive book being handed to me, every day I would trace and write in cursive. (Its the only reason I know cursive to this day) I was so lonely and spent so long in that closet that I would talk to my hands (specifically my knuckles and fingers) I can remember my special ed teachers names, and some of the only memories I have of elementary are the long days I spent in that closet. I can still remember that patterns on the wood in the walls and the texture of it. It was only big enough for me to sit with my legs scrunched up against myself and had a single barred window with  3 old wasp nests on it.But, I bettered myself. Even at that young age I knew I didnt want to spend forever in that closet. Every time I saw that damn cursive book was only further motivation. Eventually I started going to regular classes, I managed to eventually leave with top percentiles on my STAAR tests (standardized testing)In middle school I was taken from my mom, my cousin committed suicide, my grandparents had to move because of taxes, I was bullied to hell, and all sorts of other unpleasant things happened. I still remember being told to go to the bedroom when the cops arrived. A few years later I was diagnosed with depression. I managed to get over it and got off of my anti-depressants within 2 years. Recently I got off of my ADHD medicine. While I might seem a little odd the long story of my mental health issues has finally come to a close. You can fix yourself no matter what you have, you have to just want it EVERY single day. Every day that you wake up until you go to bed that is your goal that you are working towards. Dont let go, if you want something remind that person every day until they go insane but never EVER give up.It doesnt matter whatever experts tell you, you can accomplish anything if you put in the effort and want it hard enough.

SeeYouSpaceCorgi [info] My discovery of Yatta and how it helped change my life for the better. When I was 14, 2008, I was diagnosed with depression. I was going through a pretty tough time and life was pretty dull. I remember I was pretty new to the internet, so before any entertaining websites were discovered, the only whackey stuff I got to see on the internet was the Friday Funnies on The Age newspaper website. I was super excited to see this stuff every friday, and I asked dad every friday to go check to see if they'd put more funnies up. One week, they posted Yatta. And that was the week that my life started to improve. I don't know if it was the cheery nature of the song, the obvious parody of it all, or the 6 Japanese men dancing around in a nappy and a leaf, or a bit of all of it. However, when I saw Yatta, I felt so happy again. I began to smile and laugh, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I wiped the tears from my eyes and hit the replay button, trying to make sense of the lyrics on the 240p video fuzz. "We are the world", "I drink water that's tasty!", what the fuck was this? Why were they so happy? I heard they were comedians but jesus, they were really fucking committed to their act... whatever it was...I downloaded the song to my iPod Mini, and listened to it every morning on the way to school. My spirits were immediately lifted, and it felt like every line I learned by heart, a little chunk of depression was lifted off me. Soon I was able to see so much happiness and was a much more open happy person. There's been bumps in the road since then. But whenever I listen to this song, for at least a little while, my life becomes just that bit more bearable. We did it! Yatta! [info] None [info] 1437309187
walkingupstream [info] Yes, I was diagnosed with depression 25 years ago, and again about 18 years ago. This past summer i was diagnosed OCD. Depression never really explained everything, but absolutely my main symptom is rumination. Depression hits when my ruminations are allowed to persist too long. The biggest difference in the treatment of each is that medication for ocs is 3-4x the dosage of ssri than for depression. Anyways people here dont seem to care to hear about OCD, judging by the downvotes, so I'll probably just quit visiting this sub in the future. Good luck to you, im doing better with the whole mental heath thing than ever before.  [info] None [info] 1538771439
Know_What_Fvck_This [info] Well, my parents don't want me on anti-depressants, I don't trust my friends, at least not after the last one to know I had depression, and, I haven't seen my therapist in months, not that it matters, all they care about is money, they don't give a shit about you personally. I'd try group therapy, but, my mom says changing therapists is too hard. My parents, despite knowing I was diagnosed with depression, would rather pretend I don't have it, so, if I live they'll at least notice, and, if I get committed and put away, I finally get to escape. Not to mention, I'm about to fail a midterm so, either death or commitment gets me out of it, even if I fail I don't have to think about it nor any of my other failures. I have one person I trust, I love her, we're not together, and, she doesn't love me romantically, but, I do consider her one of my closest friends. She knows about my depression. However, after my best friend, my former best friend, up and abandoned me, I don't want to get too bad around her. Which is why, I wanted to thank her for her friendship and go away so she doesn't have to see me bad. [info]  [info] 1448288981
Lynkeus [info] For me it is overthinking. Kinda obsession. I have been diagnosed with depression and mild paranoia (it was beginning of it, but it was there) before and have been treated for it but occasionally I see it re-emerge.

deltadiamond [info] Grandmother miraculously understands depression A little background here: I was diagnosed with depression a little more than a year ago and for personal reasons I was raised by my grandparents.Anyway, depression has been really hard on me (by which I mean I mean ruined my grades in uni). My grandmother loves to tell me about how I was so lucky to be born in the situation I was and how I need to start trying harder in college. At which point I try to explain how hard it really is to cope with depression. She never understands, and usually *refuses* to understand by saying that no, she gets it completely.Well yesterday was the worst time of all. After rehashing the same tired old argument, she told me exactly how she understands depression. Because sometimes in the morning she doesn't want to get out of bed. Because apparently laziness is the same thing as a severe mental illness. The worst part is I can't tell her she's wrong because then I'm being mean to her.So what the hell am I supposed to do? I depend on her for a place to live, so It's not like I can just cut her out of my life. [info] None [info] 1485442761

kelbarbs [info] Tired of my parent's decisions constantly having negative impacts on me. First and foremost, I'm F19, about to go into University soon. Perhaps saying I'm from an Asian family might help too. My parents had 4 children, all girls. I am the oldest, middle two are 14 and 13,and then 8. They told me they kept wanting a boy at the time. When I was in my teens, my parents were constantly fighting and the family was dysfunctional. I had nobody to turn to when I was sad. Later dad was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. Episodes come and go throughout my teen years. I was diagnosed with depression myswmd at the age of 16. It's a lot better now. I've also been having to step up to the mother role lately by being the confidant to my sisters, which I'm more than happy to do as I only want the best for them and I know growing up can be hard, and I always tell them they can tell me anything and I would never judge them.  This all happened because my mother said she was burnt out from raising kids for 20 years and wanted to take time for herself. So she's hardly at home and also very short tempered and judgemental all the time. Fast forward to now, I'm looking at going to university abroad. They've agreed to pay for it (money is no problem in the family) very early on and promised me a university education. Some years ago I took a major exam and had to choose between 3 years in a specialised course or 2 years in a generalised study. 16 yo me had no idea and just agreed with whatever they recommended. I was miserable the whole 3 years as I hated the course of study and the school and it was a very toxic environment. I know where I want to go but it would require an extra year of study as whatever course they asked me to do doesn't qualify me for university right away. Initially they agreed but then now they are saying otherwise as they have this delusion that if I spend an extra year studying I will not get hired into a good job out of university. Keep in mind because of their decision at the time for the specialised course I'm already a year later than my peers  who went to university. At this point im just sick of it. Sick of the one taking the emotional burden of the decisions they push onto me. I feel like as an adult now I should have the say of where I want to go in life. I also constantly worry for my sisters not having anyone to confide in when I move out and they bottle it up.I don't know what to say them anymore. I just want to have a say in my decisions, for once. I know they mean well but id rather face the good or bad consequences of my own decisions than theirs.Thank you for hearing me out.TL;DR I'm sick and tired of my parents poor decisions constantly having negative impacts on me. Need to make life decision soon and don't want them to make this decision for me but it seems like it and I don't know how to stop it. [info] None [info] 1578498943

Administratr [info] I've been depressed all my life and managed to find sexual relationships and been in love once or twice. As I've gotten older I find myself like you falling head over heels with girls who show the slightest interest in me which worries me cos it's obviously very weird behaviour and not normal. I think as a man we maybe confuse ( I don't know why) simple kindness with attractiveness. As I consider myself worthless and literally don't leave the house unless it's for essentials, it's likely we have trained ourselves down to a very, very small likelihood of interaction occurring and therefore feeling like a lottery win when it occurs.Maybe I'm wrong. I have been diagnosed with depression clinically and was told I have " insight" and with that comes an understanding of the triggers and dangers.There is nothing wrong with feeling attracted to others, it's how we deliver it, saying nice things, compliments and thoughtful conversation instead of " omg boobs marry me" which is likely what our brain is telling us.

FrontpageWatch [info] &gt;So a little bit of a preface:&gt;&gt;I'm 19, a student in the UK, I was diagnosed with depression at sixteen and I'd dealt with it by overeating, skipping on medication and locking myself in my room whilst playing videogames. I used to use dumbells when I was bored, and I paid for a gym membership when I got here in October. I went a few times in the first couple of weeks, but a heavy workload and a lack of motivation (as well as a relapse into depression) meant that I stopped. The Christmas break is over and I got back to university a few weeks ago. I quickly fell back into old habits and was ignoring my work.&gt;&gt;This week, I started going to the gym. I'm not sure why, really. I suppose I got tired of looking like a slob and feeling alone. My New Year's 'goal' as it were was to get healthy, or at least fit, and, like lots of people who start exercising, I suppose I was hoping for a bit more attention from the ladies.&gt;&gt;I've gone five times in the last five days, mostly working on upper body (triceps, biceps, pectorals and lats). Tonight I'm trying legs and core, and here are my thoughts so far.&gt;&gt;1) if you are feeling depressed, you should really consider exercise as a viable aide (though also, certainly see a doctor or professional, SSRI antidepressants have been hugely beneficial to me). It's been about a week, and I feel more motivation, more passion for life, and I no longer lie in bed and think about how shit my life is, I think about how sore my muscles are and how I'll look six, twelve or twenty weeks from now.&gt;&gt;2) There is *NO NEED* to fear being judged at a gym (particularly a university gym). I'm a pretty chubby guy. I wouldn't say I was fat, but I lack any noticeable muscles and have a bit of a beer belly (university). I was really quite worried that people would look at me using the 15kg barbell for curls, particularly the guy stood next to me curling waaaay more. Since I've been going, I've not felt judged or intimidated at all. I've asked a complete stranger to spot me on a bench (even though I was benching very, very little) and he was really up for it. He gave me advice on how to improve my form and kept pushing one last rep out of me. I don't look at the people squatting enormous amounts with fear, I look at them as a goal. A year from now, I won't be there, but I'll be closer than I am right now.&gt;&gt;I went for a 5am jog the other night and, as an ex smoker, I was coughing and panting after a hundred meters. I stopped in the middle of the pavement and felt like I was dying, I was coughing up phlegm, and a jogger passed me. He was in his forties, and he gave me a thumbs up and told me to keep at it.&gt;&gt;3) **Anything is better than nothing.** I might only be curling a 30kg max right now, but it's 30kg more than I was curling two weeks ago. I feel endorphins when I leave the gym and just feel better in who I am, more confident, more motivated. I feel like one day, I'll be comfortable in who I am.&gt;&gt;This really wouldn't have been possible without the /r/Fitness community, where the FAQ and exercise tips have really helped me sort out how to get started and the /r/EOOD community is great for anyone in a similar situation. Thanks, everyone. [info] None [info] 1453226849
kkburch [info] Is it possible I have some kind of fatigue disorder? I was diagnosed with depression and take low doses of both Cymbalta and Wellbutrin. I'm also anemic and take iron supplements everyday. I'm still exhausted all the time. I could sleep for days on end if I were able to. My family always remembers me being a sleepy person. But around 20 I almost dropped out of college because going to classes was physically exhausting. That was when I was diagnosed as anemic and being treated for other emotional issues. I started taking iron supplements and that as helped some. Just this year (at 27) I started taking anti depressants again. The goal was to increase my interest levels and energy levels. It has helped to some degree as well. My sleepiness is interrupting my ability to live my life. I'm working from home half the week so I can nap during the day. At this point am I just being lazy?   I'm practically connected to a caffeine IV all day long, not sure what else I can do. I eat healthy and workout regularly (I always do when I have the energy to do so). I'm not overweight.  I work a desk job. 27 year old female. Any advice on whats causing this persistent fatigue would be very valuable to me. Thank you. [info] None [info] 1520386480
iGuy243 [info] Hi,You are never alone. Not on this Subreddit, not where you are from, or where you reside. I can relate to the emptiness feeling that you are having. Feeling like you don't know where to go next, it be a convenience store for some milk, or the next chapter in your life.I was diagnosed with depression when I was 17. I fought hard to keep it away by myself. But, it always takes for anyone to have somebody by their side to talk to in these circumstances. If the people you talk to have a feeling you need someone who is medically authorized to tell you what to do next, you should listen to them. Ask your friend to take you to the doctor. They should see your pain and have the care to bring you there.Stay safe. Shalom. [info] None [info] 1530895135

IamAFortress [info] After 5 months NC... My expwBPD and I broke up about 5 months ago. Life had been wonderful and I've literally been basking in my newfound freedom and life without his insane toxicity and abuse. I was diagnosed with depression and ptsd after our 2yr relationship so needless to say I've had things to work through. I was finally getting to the point where I was beginning to feel completely moved on, where my mind wasnt constantly reminded of him and I wasn't always looking over my shoulder until 2 recent incidents. The first one I saw him waiting at a bus stop very close to my house. He saw me drive by and knows I saw him there. It was the first time I saw him since we broke up and my body immediately went into fight or flight mode again. Heart racing, muscles shaking, lump in my throat. Then about a week later out of nowhere he sends me an email with a simple "look what I came across " and a picture of a valentine's day card I'd given him.I didnt respond so he has no idea I read the email. But it seems to have triggered my mind to be constantly worrying he will show up again. Everywhere I go I'm watching in case he shows up. I've been feeling depressed and anxious again because just those small incidents made my brain snap into a place where hes suddenly occupying space in my mind once again and it's awful. I have no desire whatsoever to have his abuse and dysfunction back in my life and I'm realizing how mind fucked he had me. [info] None [info] 1563890675

RacyFry [info] How to cope with ADHD without medication in a country where mental health care is stigmatized? I live in a small town in India. Here  amphetamines are illegal and methylphenidates like Ritalin are not supplied to common pharmacies as ADHD is not a popular diagnosis. People talk about making schedules to cope but not able to stick to schedules I make have been my primary problem. Earlier this year I attempted suicide and ended up in therapy. I was diagnosed with depression and some levels of OCD traits. Turns out my undiagnosed ADHD was the root of all problems. I cannot continue therapy any longer as there is a lot of stigma attached to mental health problems here and my parents want to cut off therapy to save their face (I'm a girl in young 20s, it will affect my family's reputation). School and college was easy for me, I never paid attention to any classes but I could get away with enough marks by cramming the night before exams. But adulting has been tough. I've not been able to stick to a job, I've been disappointing loved ones and colleagues with my chronic inattentiveness and procrastination habits. I've tried things like yoga and meditation but I'm just not able to stick with something for long. How can I cope! Please help! Seeking medical help is out of question! [info] None [info] 1545933842
rtjy [info] I went against my own rule I went on tumblr (yeah I think you know where this is going) to follow up on some art blogs I follow, when I came across a post about a recent spike in hate crimes.  What followed was an hour of hopeless article hopping just to feed my bias and possibly raise my self esteem.  Thankfully, I stopped myself from going down the political rabbit hole before it got any worse.As I snapped myself out of it, I felt upset at the world but mostly with myself.  I  broke my own rule of avoiding political posts.  Sometimes when I do come across one, I just scroll right past it.  Because if I do, I'll relapse into a bitter ball of hatred.  Ever since my diagnoses of depression, I tried to avoid things that trigger me.Why did I start a tumblr account despite me being fully aware of its reputation for being politically correct to a sickening degree?  Well I joined to follow artists who... ummm... let's say draw "very lovely" art.  Maybe some funny memes, but that's it. But why did I look at the post despite my pledge to avoid all things political?  Well, after both this and last presidential election, I made a vow to always avoid polarizing politics.  That belief hardened when I was diagnosed with depression.  But there was a side affect to this vow.  I grew this nagging inner voice that scolded me every time I avoided political discussion of any kind.  It would always say that I am some stupid blob of a person who doesn't care about my country and would rather lounge around and watch tv instead of fighting for the rights of other people.But the thing is I do deeply care for other people.  I empathize with hate crime victims and others who are/will be hurt by Trump's presidency and my heart goes out to them.  The thing is that I avoid politics because I cannot get angry over things I can't control; that's what led me to have depression in the first place.  Another reason is.. well.. this is going to sound both bold and sappy, but... I want to be one of the people who wants to heal the political divide, and one of the many things that is creating it are the toxic political posts on social media.Besides, I need to focus on me right now.  I have to work on my career goals, get money for taxes, and work on moving into a new place.  Also, I just racked up $650 in unexpected expenses this past week and I don't need politics making it worse. [info] None [info] 1488916766
KAMIKAZEOVERCOMMAS [info] I understand, it's a motivational issue. I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago. I'm good now. One thing I'll tell you is that you'll NEVER be "ready" to get out of bed. It's really a matter of forcing yourself out of bed. You can't "think" yourself out of these issues. That's why it's rare for someone to fully crawl out of it. I don't blame this guy for his depression, if anything I empathize with him and would love to talk with him anytime. BUT, you'll never "feel" ready to overcome this, your mind will give you a 1000 reasons to stay in the state you are, but you have to rewire your mindset through exercise, a healthier diet, a better lifestyle, etc. There's no magic pill no matter what people may claim.

My mum says there is nothing wrong with me and that I've had a wonderful upbringing and that I'm just ungrateful. Is this something that resonates with you guys?Her attitude?  Oh yeah.But she's wrong.  Depression is a brain chemistry thing; it really has *nothing to do with upbringing*.  Even people who had picture-perfect, non-abusive childhoods with supportive, loving parents can develop depression.  You can even tell her this!But yeah, IMO being raised by a BPD certainly doesn't *help*. 😒Welcome home!*hugs*PS.

frostfluid [info] I hope to kill myself by next year I'm just tired of living. I was diagnosed with depression in 10th grade and ive been feeling this way since 9th grade. My mom was evicted from our apartment, so we had to move in with grandma. I was expelled from school in 10th grade. My mom and dad are fighting in court again. I'm always subject to be complained about by grandma because I'm breaking the house. Despite the fact that whenever there is a problem like say the house is infested with fruit flys she just ignored it so mch until it doesn't register to her as a problem. My dad once showed me a documentary about people in Liberia and how I shouldn't be depressed because there are people who have it worse then me. Honestly I'm planning on killing myself by either my 17th birthday or early winter next year. Nothing has gotten better despite the fact how mother tells me thing's will get better eventually. And the worst part is I have people who tell me I'm not depressed despite being medically diagnosed with it. I'm done [info] None [info] 1574018574
thatkittymika [info] 2 days sober and got not much information to help. But hopefully i can help your perspective. You sound exactly like me. You want weed not to be the problem so bad you've convinced yourself its not. I've been smoking on and off for two years and recently became a chronic user. I was diagnosed with depression and could barely work. I blamed it all on my "illness" even though I'd had depression before and it felt different. Depression is way easier to blame because we all hate depression - weed is harder to develop a negative view of. I've also had a pretty cruisy life. Nothing like yours - yet i was still ensnared by the black hole. For me it made less sense - "i am so happy! Or my life should be... Why am i not? Weed will help me forget the fact that im not."Please be honest with yourself. It seems shocking that such a small thing is affecting you so much, but it is. Smoking isn't helping your emotions. It isn't helping you get to school. All these commenters are right. I am 2 days sober and already feeling so much better. Please, please, please, try to listen to all the other commenters - they have very good advice.  [info] None [info] 1540945809
bichimiAllen [info] There is no justice anymore So, last year I found out my dad is suing me for "taking advantage of him" by taking alimony ever since I was 13 years old when he left. I'm 26 now. And the thing is: for most of my childhood he abused me and my siblings constantly, him and his brothers and my older cousins would do things to us, from sexual abuse to just physical and emotional abuse. For almost all my childhood, I was in kindergarten and learned to make myself so small I would not be seen or noticed. My older brother got frequently humilliated in public by my dad and we'll, he was just a bad person.Eventually, my mom was able to get us away from him and set herself free. I'm still scared of loud noises because it reminds me of his outbursts sometimes. Im also scared of the dark and when men try to be intimate with me I almost always have panic attacks. On top of that I was diagnosed with depression and it got to a point where I couldn't finish college because I just felt like dying. I just.. suicidal thoughts were so common on a daily basis and I was basically just thinking "soon,soon I'll die" but at the same time I didn't want to die. I just didn't. So I dropped out of college, and tried my hand at being a freelance artist, still receiving alimony from him because I know is the one thing that hurts him. It has been rough, but it's what I dreamed of doing ever since I was little, I've wanted to tell stories, and I've loved to draw. But sadly, the world is not nice to artists and it doesnt leave much money. Well, now he's suing me over it and it looks like he might just win and stop paying it or reduce it considerably. Today my lawyer told me that. And I know it makes no sense to feel bad over it,but I do.I can't feel any other way about it. I feel is unfair because I've got to live my entire life with what he did, what him and his family did to us, and the one way he could pay for it was that, because he didn't care for anything ever other than his own money. It's the one way I can hurt him in an even remotely similar way than what he did to us. And now even that I won't be able to do. I must admit I knew I couldn't keep doing it forever but I never knew it'd end like this.it somehow feels like he wins, like I have no chance to win against him ever  and now he's even dusting me off, the one repercussion he had for all the awful stuff he did to us, just like it's nothing so he can finally forget about us while we have to live with what he did forever. I feel trapped and completely crushed and I feel like he will always win and no matter what I do hell always be present even if he isn't, like he ruined my life and then gets to feel the satisfaction of winning again. I want to die. I think if I had died then it'd be easier. If I had died back when I was little maybe my mom could've had a case against him and people would've believed her and then at least he'd be in jail and my siblings would have justice. But I didn't and now justice doesn't exist and even more so, he gets to win again. I'm sorry, I just wanted to vent and I didn't know where to do it. I just had to get it all out of my chest.

Still no medicine or therapy worked (vit D supplements, light therapy etc). I've had a total of 26 diagnoses tested on me, nothing stuck.

puuvillakoira [info] I have a question I don’t actually know what I should do. I’m kind of struggling whether should I keep trying to contact my violent, alcoholic dad or should I just let him do his thing. He has not contacted me in 6 years. Not even when my mom, who raised me all by herself, died on cancer two years ago when I was 18. I have been diagnosed with depression and PTSD. It just starting to feel like nothing is really helping. Kind of ironic that I am living in Finland, which is officially #1 happiest place on earth.EDIT: I'm on medication and have been talking to a therapist for over a year.

IfYouHaveGhosts824 [info] Four years ago, I was diagnosed with depression. I was managing a work project and it failed miserably. Some employees quit, we lost money – it was awful, and I had nobody to blame for it but myself. I was convinced my dreams were never going to come true and that I was destined to be a failure. Right as I was about to kill myself, a thought popped into my head: “If I'm dead, who's going to take care of Mom and Dad when they get old?”Just like that, it was over. Something changed in me. I was still horribly depressed, but I knew killing myself wasn't the right option. I was sick and tired of being depressed, and I was desperate to make a change for the better. I went to the doctor and they prescribed me Zoloft. It wasn't a one-and-done fix, but it was the first of many steps towards feeling better. I opened up to my family about what I was feeling. Not only did they take sympathy on me, but they gave me the finances to get my life together. It would've been so much easier to slam the door in my face, but they called me to check on me and offered me a place to stay when I needed it. If it wasn't for them, I probably wouldn't be here. Fast-forward several years. My life is now better than it's ever been. I have my dream job and I'm happier than ever before. Things are so great, I honestly can't imagine being gone. I've made it my mission in life to help other people who are struggling, the same way my family helped me when I was struggling. In a weird twisted way, I'm grateful for going through depression when I did. I had to be broken before I could be made whole again. It taught me some valuable life lessons and changed the way I look at the world. It taught me how to appreciate the good days and realize the bad days are only temporary. Being in a dark place taught me how to be more sympathetic to other people. It taught me everyone is fighting a battle we know nothing about, and sometimes, something as simple as a smile or compliment can make somebody's whole day. If it wasn't for going through depression, I doubt I would be as happy as I am now. In the end, it made me into a better person. I'm sorry for what you're going through, but I hope you can find it within you to keep pushing forward. I wish you all the best in the days ahead. You can do this – I believe in you!

The_Korean_Zombie [info] I used to trust my gut in terms of acting impulsively. As I gotten older, I like to get feedback from people more knowledgable than myself to assist me to form conclusions. A lifetime of experiencing consequences from my actions conditioned me to this point.I am not sure if I am introverted. My whole life until I was diagnosed with depression I was energized by people and would get bored outta my mind without them. Nowadays, I appreciate alone time as long as I have internet and games. I can only play multiplayer games, not sure if that means anything. I chill with my girlfriend on the weekends.Whenever I take online tests I land as a STP or NTP.

Perthguv [info] In the past I was diagnosed with depression by a GP but he didn't suggest any treatment or anything else at all. He just said: you have depression. I have had it off and on ever since but have never sought treatment. With anti-depressant drugs, you don't have to be scared of them but you do need to pay attention. When you start taking them you may have some strange side effects or they may not work. If either of these happen then talk to your GP. There are a lot of anti-depressants and it might take a few times to find the one that works for you.https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/antidepressants/art-20046273Something to consider is that research shows that cardio exercise is also an effective treatment for depression in some people.

ShabbySheik [info] I have been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist (for ADHD medication, and I had seen him years ago for anti-depressants)  but I don't feel they are giving me what I need. I've been seeing them since October. This was my third long term relationship I've been in. I was in a really bad place after my second one (after I broke up with my first LTR, I met the second girl two months later.) For well over a year, I hated every day. I hated myself for remembering something that reminded me of her. Her nickname was Pi, so whenever the time was 3:14, or I saw Pi being mentioned in my math classes/work just to give you an idea, not to mention all of the insides jokes you develop and the fact that I shared all of my favorite things with her over our two years.I thought of ways to hurt and or kill myself a dozen times a day, I was diagnosed with depression, but couldn't stand the medication as I couldn't eat anything more than a few small bites.I'm just trying to make sure I don't go down that road again.

throwaway29254 [info] Thanks. Yes, I was diagnosed with depression ten years ago, have been in therapy for nearly 4 years after that, but I can't say it helped me much, neither did trying out medication for depression. So I tend to be wary. I'm much better now, no suicidal thoughts or anything, even though my life is still a mess. But I credit getting older, better coping mechanisms and less dramatic in my mood swings, not my therapy back then.Anyway, my futile experience with therapy is what makes me want to avoid another waste of time and money. Apart from that I don't think I could afford it right now, this stuff is very expensive. But I'm thinking about giving it another go once I have the money, this time more focused on getting an ADD diagnosis (or ruling it out). But sometimes I wonder... I don't know if you're familiar with Gretchen Rubin's Four Tendencies, but I'm a "rebel" in her terminology, which makes me quite resistant to advice from others. ;) [info] None [info] 1551215523

molgera85 [info] Anyone else feeling depressed during quarantine? First and foremost, I’m not looking for any sympathy or anything like that. Just wondering if you guys are experiencing something relatively similar. For some context, I am diagnosed with depression and occasionally go through those stereotypical depressive bouts. Quarantine has been a good and a bad thing for me. I’ve been able to study a lot more effectively for my calculus class and play guitar more often than usual. But at the same time, I have had no social interactions with anyone (other than my family, and even then, it’s pretty rare, I’m usually isolated in my room for the majority of the day) for the past like 2 (maybe 3?) weeks. I don’t know, it feels a lot longer than that. Fuck, I’m not even a social person, I’m ridiculously introverted, but having nobody to talk to is pretty weird. I’ve also been noticing that I haven’t been eating as much recently. Like, I haven’t had a proper lunch during the majority of quarantine. Sorry for that long winded rambling.

rabbitrainbows [info] I think it's all correlated? I was diagnosed with depression 4 years ago, then adhd-pi 2 years ago and surprise surprise, narcolepsy 2 weeks ago. I assume if I had decent sleep and didn't feel like garbage during the daytime, I would've dealt with my issues during the time of depression much better. I would've been less passive, indecisive, and have more confidence/energy. Because I was so tired all the time, I procrastinated dealing with my problems which made them drag on and the self loathing increased. I honestly think my depression really resolved after I got diagnosed with adhd-pi and the meds (+ consistent therapy) helped give me the energy to tackle my issues. &amp;#x200B;Ironically, during the initial chat with my sleep specialist was confident I DON'T have adhd-pi, but the narcolepsy caused my adhd-pi behaviors lol. The medication I took for adhd-pi also works for narcolepsy tho, so yeah.&amp;#x200B;I'm surprised you sleep specialist didn't want to give you a test, it's much easier/straight forward imo to test for narco than depression. The only drawback is the test was really expensive.. but if you think your case might be a sleep issue, i'd push harder for a test. Good luck! [info] None [info] 1559680587

CAUK [info] A.B.D - I dropped out of my Ph.D program because of mental illness, but I'm better now. I finished all my coursework, achieved candidacy, did my research, and started writing my dissertation. I invested over 7 years of my life and accrued six figures in student loan debt. However, during the final year I floundered. I was diagnosed with depression and my marriage was in trouble. I dropped out. I broke off contact with my adviser and avoided contact with anyone associated with my program. My spouse and I separated, and I was in deep-deep trouble with debt collectors. I was getting back on my feet for a little while, but then I was abruptly laid off from my job. I became suicidal and had to move in with relatives (at age 37) to support and keep an eye on me.That was three years ago. My finances are now in order, my divorce is almost final, and I feel like my mental health is in a good place. Last year, just the thought of reaching out to my adviser, or anyone else in my old department would cause a panic attack, which would take hours to subside. Now, I've reached out to my adviser, who dispelled my fears that I had permanently soured that relationship. My adviser is still just as supportive as ever.So, does anyone have any advice for trying to re-enter my Ph.D program and finishing after 3 years absence? [info] None [info] 1500682097

parsnippity [info] &gt; However, an emotional support animal is in fact a "service animal" for purposes of the Fair Housing Act.I'd correct that to an emotional support animal CAN in fact be a service animal under the Fair Housing Act. An animal isn't necessarily automatically a service animal if it's an emotional support animal. You still have to have a disability and the animal has to alleviate one or more issues the disability causes. I'll give an example. Let's say I have a cat. I am diagnosed with depression and I love my cat, and getting rid of the cat would upset me, but the cat itself doesn't make my depression any better. That's not an emotional support animal.I'll give an opposing example: I have a cat. I'm depressed. My doctor recommends focusing on the animal as a creature that needs me and stroking the cat when I get anxious. This alleviates some of my symptoms and I'm better able to cope on a daily basis because I look forward to time with my cat. That is an emotional support animal.Finally, I'll give an ADA example. This one actually applies to me. I have a seizure disorder. Seizures are uncommon for me, but they do happen from time to time. My doctor talked to me about dogs trained to work with and for patients with my disorder. Together, we found a (ridiculously expensive, but that's off topic) trainer, and I bought a dog. My dog can break my fall if I have a seizure, go alert my husband if he is with me, he can press a panic button to alert EMS, and he can guard me while I'm having a seizure.

I warned them a few months prior that I was diagnosed with depression and got the usual "we're there if you need to talk".Well, after something happened with my best friend (I was down one time too much, she got fed up and wanted out), I went to them for help to cope...

I found this all out over Christmas when I just broke and tried to kill myself. I spent 2 days in the ICU and 5 in a in patient facility. I used to self harm in June. I burned myself where my watch sits. And know I am impulsively cutting to deal with anger and grief. My mom never found out about it in June and I've been lying to her face the whole time. I feel like shit about it but she is going through s ok much with the attempt. She's reading books and stuff and I think it makes it worse. I should have just told her.

Boxers10 [info] You have described high functioning depression to a "T". I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago after a life time of wondering what was wrong with me. It is hard to put on the face every day...a lot of days I just come home and crash, BUT there are good days...just enough to keep me pushing. It was a relief for me to find a doctor that listened to me. It was hard hearing you have "Depression with fear" and the big one was when therapist updated it to "Depression and passive suicidal"...BUT it does get better so hang in there you know what is going on and can work on it.

DaCrispyBacon [info] How about a story? I was diagnosed with depression a long ass time ago, I can’t even remember any tests that were done to get the official diagnosis. So it came as no surprise when I first said to my therapist “hey, I don’t think existing is as good as everyone says and I kind of feel like ending my existence.” You want to guess what was done? They locked me up in a mental ward in the hospital that made me feel even worse. The fear of being locked up in a mental ward again has made me keep all of my emotions I myself, meaning that when I start to feel suicidal all I can do is open up the “suicide resources” bookmark folder on chrome and cry my feelings away. I try to use humor to ward off all of these shitty feelings but eventually I’ll run out of jokes, eventually I’ll lose the battle, eventually, I’ll take my own life...This is why when Instagram thots decide claiming they have depression would be a good idea because it’ll get them a few extra followers it brings my blood to a boil. Waiting to find out my mom stalks my Reddit and I get locked up again... That’d suck. [info] 16 [info] 1556869725

PancreasPillager [info] Someone else here commented this, but to reiterate—depression is depression. It’s a chemical imbalance in the mind related to serotonin and other neurotransmitters. Sometimes there are triggers (major life changes, serious problems at work/school/home, etc.) that can cause an imbalance, and thus an episode, and other times depressive episodes will just creep up with no discernible external cause. In my case, some of my depression triggers are linked to bad ADHD habits. For example, letting my schoolwork spiral out of control (due to ADHD) can launch me into a depressive phase that will last months, even after the problems are resolved. Other times I just wind up depressed just because, which is why i take antidepressants along with Adderall. **If you believe you are depressed, its absolutely worth seeing a psychiatrist**. Depression is its own diagnosis and illness that requires its own special treatment—even if it may be “caused” by ADHD.On a side note, I just want to toss out something i think is interesting! I was diagnosed with depression long before ADHD. After some trial and error with medication, I found my magic combo—Effexor and Wellbutrin. Pretty high dosages too. Most antidepressants just target serotonin, but these 2 target norepinephrine and dopamine! When I was diagnosed with ADHD, it all made so much sense. In fact, I cut my antidepressant dosages in half when I started taking Adderall and I feel wonderful.  [info] ADHD [info] 1548355617

Ethicusan [info] &gt; Psychology and psychiatry are a lieDefinately. Pure quackery. I was diagnosed with depression and suffered those quacks for years.

Took a test and I was right. Started taking testosterone, blackmarket stuff cause the quacks wouldn't give it to me and all better.And don't start with the old I had bad luck choosing my quack. I saw dozens of different quacks. As for the rest of what you said literally noone said that.

Beckshniddley [info] I'm so sorry youre going through these new emotions.  It's interesting how, I think we feel once we are adults we're "done cooking" so to say.  Of course, that's not the case unfortunately. I have felt similarly recently.  I had a rough start to my marriage but it has grown and is amazing now.  There is trust, stability, structure. But also, a childhood friend died. Fragility, death, sadness.  And one night I just fucking broke down.  HARD.  Like.  Cried.  And I'm sure in another language a word suffices that would describe that feeling.  And I was diagnosed with depression in high school.  Idk if that's true sometimes, because I've been very happy in my 20's. Can anyone really tell you how you are feeling?  No way.  And I hope that doesn't make you sad but instead liberates you.  Instead of the external, think inwardly.  You should know yourself best. And sometimes, sure, that comes from therapy if you think that would give you insight.  But processing emotions is so important.  I hope you can feel these emotions, understand them, and move on. Good luck! [info] None [info] 1557662157

tarantulawarfare [info] Today I’m going to start teaching my son how to cook. He’s 9. My boy isn’t into sports or band or a lot of the other usual extracurricular school activities. I’ve never tried to push them on him and overwhelm him with things he doesn’t like to do. I had him in wrestling briefly, but I could tell he didn’t like it and only went along with it to please me. He Iikes being outside in nature to catch frogs and bugs. He’s artsy Iike me, and enjoys spending his time doodling or building with LEGO. I keep a lot of scraps of junk and cloth that he builds zombie hunting weapons or dolls based on video game characters. He got a tool kit for his birthday last year. Lately I noticed he’s been helping himself to the kitchen. He’s still little so he has to push a chair across the room to get into the cabinets. One day I could hear him working in there, and next thing I know he shows up with an entire snack tray for everybody, full of assorted fruit and veggie snacks he’s washed and chopped up all by himself. I’m not a great cook. I’m ok, and I can do a decent job when I’m inspired to. I was diagnosed with depression and had PPD shortly after giving birth to him. Cooking is one thing I have to force myself to do because I’d rather make some quick ramen and be done with it, and many times I’m not hungry at all and have to force feed myself just to get minimum calories in. I’ve got a husband and two kids and our well being and nutrition requires more out of me. My husband has no problem stepping in, but I’d rather do more because he’s just as tired as I am at the end of the day. So I’ve got my boy wanting to learn. There’s a new place opening up soon that offers cooking classes, and he was so excited when I told him. Meanwhile, the obvious thing to do is teach him what I know. So tonight it’s meatballs, my boy. Roll up those sleeves and prepared to get all up in the spices. I’m hoping this will be good for both him and me. [info] None [info] 1551810164
HanCurunyr [info] My mom is a narcissist, since I was a kid (27yo now), for my mom, I was never good enough, never smart enough, poor grades (even if I never failed any classes in school and college). I always was a little sad kid, at 13 yo, I was diagnosed with depression, and spent the next 3 years of my life fighting that goddamn disease, and fighting my mom's bad influence. Fast Forward 14 years, I am graduated, have a nice paying job, depression still lurks from the back of my mind, like a caged animal, I got promoted on my job, earned a health insurance along with the promotion, nothing fancy, but better than a public hospital, the downside, the insurance covers only me, no other family members. When I got home yesterday, I shared the news with my mom, and, she got pissed because I had the audacity of getting a insurance that doesn't cover her, shut herself from any interaction, and we haven't spoke since that. I never had the chance of saying that I can now look for a insurance for her, since I got a better paycheck and my insurance is covered by the company.&amp;#x200B;Well, Here I go for another week or so of tolerating my mom in complete silence, until she asks if I want to say sorry, because I am always wrong, even if the decision is not mine to make.

I was already hesitant to even come in here and ask, even if this sub Reddit is specifically for things you were too afraid to ask. Some background, I am a male, 24, and used to see counselors and therapists when I was a teenager. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13 years old but refused to take any sort of medication because at the time I thought that was for pussies. To this day, I don’t talk to anyone about what is killing me on the inside because I was raised to believe that of you talked about your feelings you are a pussy. The most I do is give small and subtle cries for help. I can’t come to any of my friends about any of my problems because I feel like we are all too manly or they wouldn’t care.

xAstrologyx [info] Yesterday I was in crisis... Today I feel fine? Hopefully someone can help to reassure me that this is fine. I'm 26F living in the UK. Yesterday during work, I confided in a friend about how I was feeling and stated I was having suicide thoughts. We ended up calling my GP who told me to go straight to the Crisis Team at my local hospital. I got my mum to pick me up and we went. It wasn't the best experience ever and caused a lot more stress than it should have. Today, I've been to see my doctor to get more antidepressants. No support was given, so mum being mum really wasn't happy. However, I'm feeling a million times better today. Yesterday I was thinking how I was going to do it. Today I'm not happy, but I'm not sad. I suppose I'm a bit numb. It's making me feel like a fraud and that how I felt yesterday was exaggerated or faked despite me knowing it wasn't. Is this normal?

DexterMcSnuggles [info] I'm 19 And Completely Fine With Death... Even though I've been diagnosed with depression, most of my family thinks that it's just an excuse to do what I want; as if I wanted to lose that scholarship and forfeit my future, as if I want to be terrified of leaving the house, as if I want to contemplate death for this long...  Suicide is not an option for me; my religion (Islam) forbids it, and I very much care about my afterlife; I'm just waiting to die, preferably doing something heroic like saving someone's life, and dying in the process.  The way I see it, if I die, 1 of 3 options will happen:  1: My religion is the right one, and I will most likely go to heaven, the odds will be amplified if I die heroically.  2: My religion is not the right one, but I've done good with my life, I'm a good person, I help people when I can, and most religions show god as a merciful being, so my chances of going to heaven are reduced, but I still have a good chance.  3: I'm completely wrong and there's no afterlife, would it be so bad? Was life bad before you were born?  So yeah, 19 and ready to die, anyone else here had similar feelings? [info] None [info] 1390364749

DaddysLittleShadow [info] Emotionally Abusive Mother Hello... I just recently found this sub. Whilst I’m looking for places to vent. I’m 18F and the other Important figure is my boyfriend 22M.My mother has been a huge cause of chaos in my house since I was younger, I’ve always been a daddies girl, and bonded with my father because he worked less than my mom. All of the emotional abuse became apparent once I was in middle school, essentially as soon as I got an iPhone/iPod, I was bullied all my life of course which doesn’t help the fact either... so I was diagnosed with depression when I was around 11/12 I had recently come out as Bi-Sexual to both my parents. And had a girlfriend at the time. My parents are both Christians and my mom took it the worse, she took my iPhone away, broke up with my girlfriend on me, and stuck me in therapy because she thought I was confused, I also was of course the Emo kid... which didn’t help with my taste in music. My mom did nothing but shame me for my choice, and she still does. And she tends to “forget” when she insults or berates me. Anyway, skip to now, I’m 18 and my boyfriend whose 22 moved in with us a few months back. He had broken his hand and he was staying with us so I could help him out. My mom has done nothing but diss on our relationship and cause havoc, everything in the house is left for me, my boyfriend and my father to do while she sits in her room, when she does come out of her room, she starts some sort of fight with anyone she can. She blackmails me because I don’t have a job due to being in school. She pays for my truck, my horses and everything else in my life essentially, which really makes my situation worse. If I don’t do something she wants she’ll take the truck from me, and then demand I go take care of my horse....which I can’t do if I don’t have my truck to get there.Skip to yesterday, I’ve been sick all week with the flu and a kidney infection, I asked her if she could feed my horses and let them out. Because I haven’t been able to get out of bed. She agreed originally but yesterday she forgot and blamed it on me, and said I abuse them, and that I’m cruel and don’t love them (they are my only therapy) she also says she wouldn’t care if I killed myself, after an attempt causes by her 2 weeks ago. So I had gone downstairs to get something and she started a fight with me, eventually with her getting in my face and hitting me. All I did was push her away from me and she threatened to call the police and said she could hit me because she’s my mother. She has continued on today to call me dilusional and say my mental illness is fake and it’s just an excuse. That I’m lazy and going down a dangerous road. She has cornered me and I have no way to leave, currently I’m trying to set up an escape plan with my boyfriend and one of my friends. But I’d have to drop out of school and get a full time job....I know this has all been one big jumbled mess, but I don’t feel safe at home, and calling the police really isn’t an option...

SaturatedPhats [info] I was diagnosed with depression 9 years ago when I was 16. Many books helped me depression--if only through escapism--but I'll throw down one that's very different from the others: *A Confederacy of Dunces* by John Kennedy Toole.My favorite fiction books can essentially be parted into two categories: Books that make me confront my depression (The Bell Jar, Nine Stories, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Corrections etc) and others that lifted my depression (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, any Ray Bradbury, etc). Dunces, however, is perhaps the first and only book that required some very deep introspection.The novel is about an intellectual in 1970's New Orleans who, through his own laziness and arrogance, is forced into situations very unbecoming of a man of his intelligence: working in a pants factory, selling hot dogs to tourists, etc. The book is enormously funny yet also a heartfelt journey into a deluded mind. The main character (Ignatius J. Reilly) and his behavior opened my own eyes to the shortcomings as a person I shared with him. He's supposed to be this offensive oaf, some cartoonish version of the sort of person who considers themselves above actual work and worthy enough to criticize everyone around him. Basically, he's an asshole. I, too, am and asshole. I was indifferent as my parents suffered from addiction then died two years apart, I regularly push people away by being snotty, rude, and just plain trying too hard. I've worked only a handful of jobs anyone would consider "real" work and bet on the idea that politeness, empathy, and love can be replaced by intelligence, cynicism, and the absurd notion that I am better than anyone (I've had at least one therapist float the idea of NPD as a diagnosis). While somewhat aware of these facets of my personality, Dunces drove them home in a way I never could've expected. It's a very difficult thing to despise a character yet relate with them. It's a feeling I haven't really felt since I realized Michael Scott was the character with whom I related the most on *The Office*. To realize that you are alone because you deserve to be alone is a harsh reality to confront, and one I likely wouldn't have without Dunces.I think a lot of depressives tend to feel subjugated for who they are, and oftentimes the response is to blame the outside world. Fuck that. I'm a bad person, and I'm going to continue being a bad person if I don't respond to criticism well and assess what is true and what is simple trolling. Other people are the best read of your behaviors and accomplishments, and until you can allow yourself to trust them, you'll be left as ugly a person tomorrow as you were yesterday.

thecarrotsgrew [info] I agree with you *and* I think your counter-argument could be viable. Anecdotally, I did very poorly on timed, pen-and-paper writing tests because I am a scatterbrain and need a lot of time even to understand what I’m thinking. I also need to be able to go back and edit, which you can’t do as easily on paper. Once I got to college and started to have longer take-home writing assignments, I realized that I could in fact write. I’m one year into my first job and have been told by two supervisors that they’ve put me on an assignment (writing a report, drafting emails etc.) because I write well. Granted, I work for an engineering firm so the competition isn’t exactly steep, and I’m not a native English speaker so people generally have lower expectations of me. At any rate, I learned, much to my relief, that in the real world I’d have time to reflect.  I also thought I’d point out the nature of the condition that necessitates the accommodation. I received test accommodations for the first time as a Master’s student when I was diagnosed with depression and put on medication. In this situation the condition was acute and temporary rather than chronic, and I felt that extra time would help reflect what my performance would be if I was working at full capacity. I’m not sure that it did, though. [info] None [info] 1564588464
ManSoldWorld [info] Kobe really inspired me during a very tough time in my life (long). Back in December 2017 (my first semester of college), I came home for winter break a complete mess. I just managed to keep myself from having a nervous breakdown that semester, being 7 hours away from home in a whole new world and having a hard time adjusting. I came home and sought medical help, and I was diagnosed with depression and ADD. After I started going to therapy and taking medication for my ADD, I was ready to go back to school for the spring 2018 semester, but I was really lost. I didn't know who I wanted to be and the kind of direction that I wanted my life to go in.It was this search for direction that led me to a motivational video made around Kobe and this mentality. I found myself agreeing with everything he said - that you should strive to be the best at whatever it is that you decide to do. That you should look to constantly improve yourself day after day, month after month, year after year. That you should stay curious, fearless, and unperturbed by what other people think. All these things and more opened my eyes and I started realizing the direction I want to go in. As you can imagine, I tried to watch as many videos centered around Kobe and his thought process as I could. He was one of my favorite basketball players growing up, and I loved trying to mimick his moves on the basketball court, but I never thought too heavily about his thought process until I focused on trying to find my own direction.It was his words and his approaches that led me to decide to be an Accounting major before my sophomore year; even when people told me it would be tough and that I'd constantly be busy, I didn't care one bit. I was determined to pursue the toughest business major out there, work hard every single day to absorb as much as I could about the subject, and sharpen my professional demeanor as much as possible. Most importantly, what I've taken to heart the most from Kobe's words were to never take shortcuts - it's paid dividends as I've built my academic and professional reputation.I want to retire someday knowing that I gave my all to my passion in the same way that Kobe did with basketball. Whether that's as a CFO, a CEO, or a partner in an accounting firm, I want to look back many years from now knowing that I lived with the Mamba Mentality, and that I gave every single day my best and looked to improve myself every step of the way.I'll always be thankful for what I learned from him even if it was through a screen. He impacted my life in a way that no other celebrity has before, and I'll carry his lessons with me forever. [info] None [info] 1585854768
Ctuck19 [info] Thank you for your input. I have been on many different medications until we finally found the right ones (the ones I’m currently taking) that actually help me. I think I was on Paxil after my son was born which is when all this mess started. I was diagnosed with depression and GAD two years before I got pregnant but I wasn’t having any problems with this then. I wish I could get off my medications (if they are the cause) because I’m so tired of this. I can’t wear makeup, I can’t wear my hair down or do anything with it because it gets ruined the minute the sweating begins. I just want to not sweat! [info] This user has not yet been verified.

TheAmazingJuicyBeast [info] A little while ago I took 300 mcg of 1P LSD and it got me thinking about my life. I realized I have always felt kind of unhappy; below where I felt the average should be. It wasn't a sad or bad trip in any means but it caused me to seek mental health. I was diagnosed with depression and was given medication. I feel much better now and I believe a big part of it was the acid making me think about who I am and where I want to go [info] None [info] 1533216211
grentacular [info] I could say that it was the fact that I was diagnosed with depression and she didn't know how to handle that, but that's not entirely true.  That was what finished it, but there was some deeper underlying incompatibility between us.  She was pretty resistant to thinking on her own, and I wasn't responsive to her desires.  We probably stayed together out of stubbornness more than anything else.I learned a lot, though, so it was worth it. [info] None [info] 1396443325
sybildb [info] Has anyone here tried lithium or ECT therapy for depression? I was diagnosed with depression at a very young age (as well as DPDR) and have been going to therapy consistently for the last 5 years as well as trying Zoloft (which i’m currently on) as well as Wellbutrin &amp; Effexor (neither responded well with me). I’ve been considering seeing a trauma specialist and I’ll be visiting a neurologist soon. I’m considering discussing ECT therapy or lithium with my therapist/neurologist. Has anyone here tried either one for treating their depression? I’m kind of going to the ends of the ropes and will try anything to get out of my depression, everyday is miserable and is only getting harder. I’ve been experiencing brain zaps from my Zoloft and am looking into trying a different medication, yet again. [info] None [info] 1556030086
Frag_Owt [info] I was diagnosed with depression 6 years ago but I know I had it for at least a few years before. I applied for my PAL 4 months ago because 1) while not 'cured', I am much better than i was because of therapy and meds, and 2) ive been shooting with friends several times before and like you i find popping gophers, clay discs, cans etc to be a release and quite enjoyable. I can't see your guns being confiscated unless you either have any violent history (not likely seeing as you've owned guns this long), or pose  a serious and explicit threat to yourself or others.I don't know where you are with your condition but speaking as someone who has been through therapy and all that fun stuff, my advice is as follows. Seek help and be honest. Your therapist/psychiatrist won't have your guns confiscated unless they absolutely deem it necessary so it's better to just put it all on the table. If you're really worried about confiscation, turn your guns over to a friend or family member until you feel comfortable handling them again and tell the therapist you've done that.Good luck on you're recovery!

LaughingBadgers [info] I was diagnosed with depression and went on a 4 year trip with anti-depressants. &amp;#x200B;Depression isn't just sadness, it's the emotional equivalent to watching paint dry. It's a the utter feeling of "meh". It's not controlable, something that one can just snap out of. It's the absence of a chemical in your brain, so just as physical as a broken arm.Anti depressants doesn't make you happy per se, they put a damper on bad feelings ASWELL as the good ones. Essentially they prevent you from emotionally crashing, at the cost of never feeling really overly happy (I'm exaggerating a bit here). What those drugs do, however, is make it possible and easier for you to live your life, have a normal day, which in turn gives you the peace and quiet you need to deal with the depression itself.&amp;#x200B;Now I'm drug-free (been for 5 months) and I can honestly say I owe my life to those anti depressants.

MediumOstrich [info] Reasons for quitting? I’m at a place in my life where I’m happy and am on track with what I want to do. I feel mentally able and don’t see how weed is affecting me negatively. I have been diagnosed with depression and I find that weed helps with it sometimes. I’m only 17 and have been smoking dabs almost all day every day. Money is not an issue at the moment either. What were your reasons for quitting as I’m 3 days sober now and I’m still searching for reasons to stay sober. All answers are appreciated and congrats to everyone who is staying sober. Edit: I don’t feel the urge to smoke but I feel as if there wasn’t a reason to stop. I still enjoy everything the same and I don’t waste money when high or do unproductive tasks. I also have a gf and a job and workout and do sports daily so I’m really just trying to see some of the reasons you guys quit. [info] None [info] 1557348193

polarisnico [info] I'm just gonna say it: Being that judgemental won't help a person out, who considers rehoming their puppy. In fact, your tone will raise the frustration in people that already take rehoming into consideration and make it more likely. I have 3 dogs, one of which is a puppy, and every time puppy blues hit me pretty hard. I'm good at dogs. I'm well-informed. I know they're work. But: A puppy almost always takes a part of your freedom and it's always easier said than done - that's why so many things in life fail. I've been stripped of my freedom two times now and it was messy; I'm diagnosed with depression so even worse for me. If you never felt what true helplessness felt like, you will at the moment you sit in front of a puppy with massive diarrhea at 3 AM when you just got home from late shift and have to work early shift (6 AM) the next morning. You will feel like shit and overwhelmed at work when you didn't sleep. You will consider rehoming at least a dozen times when frustration hits damn hard - but considering does not mean acting out on it. Every little thing that's a step forward nullifies a month's worth of consideration and frustration and makes it better. When my first puppy didn't go potty for a day because he was stubborn and shat and pissed all over the place, when he kept me awake the same night - I asked myself if this was worth it. When I checked his crate and saw, how bad he felt upon doing what he just did, I knew he understood. I was disgruntled, cleaned it al up, went to sleep for an hour and he did the same thing again. He barked at every little sound. But when he fell asleep in my lap the next day for the first time it was all worth it. The night before I always told myself I'd rehome him tomorrow. Never did it. It's been a good one and a half year.  [info] Owner of 3 :ExpOwnerBlack: (Chihuahua adult &amp; BMD puppy) [info] 1547189056
chronickiddo [info] Corona Virus has ruined over two years of mental stability I was diagnosed with depression when I was 12, things were really bad for a long time but I started feeling in control again my freshman year of high school. I’m now a junior, and I haven’t had bad depression in at least two years. Being stuck inside with my less than supportive parents while attempting to force myself into online learning is sending me in a downward spiral. I’ve never had any motivation for school, I also have Aspergers and ADHD which makes focusing on things I don’t care about impossible. When I’m at school I have friends and counselors to help me get things done, but at home I just have frustrated parents and the occasional email from a counselor. What’s getting to me the most is that I don’t feel like taking care of my pets anymore and I hate myself for it, usually they are the most important thing in my life. I’m so afraid that I’m not going to take good enough care of them, but at the same time I feel like I don’t care anymore, and that’s what hurts the most. I don’t know what to do, sorry for the rant. I just don’t know where else to go besides here. [info] None [info] 1585611290
Chosenminecraft [info] Trying to get into a decent relationship, any advice or tips? M/18. TL;DR have had only shitty relationships, would like a dating 101 so I can have a decent, local one. Alright. I'm not even sure if this is the right sub so if not, let me know where I should post it and I'll move it there. I am a 18 year old male, and have been in 2 relationships in my life. First one lasted 10 months, it was long distance. (I'm in Minnesota she was in Ontario) While it started great, over time the relationship started going south and she was starting to abuse me mentally and emotionally.I first noticed it about 4 months before I broke up with her. After I did break up with her, I felt really guilty about it. And beat myself up about it. Afterwards I was diagnosed with depression. I didn't take anything to regulate it, I relied on friends and basically talking issues out with them. This worked great when I was with them, without them, however I was definitely feeling the effects of depression. I got into another relationship over a year after the break up and that lasted 4 months after she cheated on me and lied to me about having a boyfriend the whole time we were together. Needless to say, that didn't help either. I eventually dealt with the core issues I was facing at the time and now am reasonably happy again. I feel that I am ready to start dating again. The problem is, I have absolutely no idea how to do it. Both of the girls I have been with came onto me and made the first moves for everything. So I'm trying to figure out what cues I should act on. I'm looking basically for a fresh start on what I should be looking for in general. Kinda like a dating ELI5 if one of you would be willing to do that, that would be great. Thanks!EDIT: I am also looking for signs that women would likely give off if they're interested in me. I know I said the last 2 came on to me first, but I only noticed after they explicitly told me that they wanted to date me. [info] None [info] 1442544521
BastianBa [info] i worked in 7 different call centers that basicly worked all the same way, outbound, inbound, telecomunication, assistance (like getting cars towed and organizing leasing cars), directory information etc.all were just prioritising their revenue over the customer support.One supervisor told me back then to only help my customer if he buys something from me. Another one fired me bc i missed to call in late bc my mother died. One manager attended the funeral of my best bud and colleague who committed suicide without being invited and layed me off afterwards 'cuz i took a month off bc i witnessed his suicide. the manager even yelled at his dad who had to travel 1.000 miles to get here. "your son is absent from work without notice for 2 days - why do you inform us this late".The directory information line did an assessment at how good i am with googling and layed me off later bc i was too fast with finding and giving information (bc they got \~5$ per minute on landline) and bc i put too little customers through to their wanted number (which is impossible when doing night-shifts).If someone would've asked to escalate something we were ordered to tell them to write either a letter or an email.Funny thing was, that we were also the guys who worked on that in times with low call volumeand in none of the above mentioned companys a single supervisor knew how to use the CRM or what the processes are. Only AHT, CHT and sales figures.now i'm diagnosed with depression and been off for about a year and i guess for atleast two more to come - payed by german health insurance and pension fortunately until i'll be able to start again.

Alypius [info] About 4 years ago I went through a really bad breakup.  I was diagnosed with depression and GAD shortly before the breakup and was put on remeron as well as weekly visits with a counselor.  The remeron made me feel totally numb to everything and I was off it within 8 months (it was also not available in the country I was moving to).  Shortly after that I moved overseas and started working.  I did see a couple doctors in relation to some stress-related incidents about a year ago, I was prescribed Valium, or something similar, for a couple weeks.  We discussed other long term medications, but the medications that were available, I had already tried back home and they did not work with me very well.  They had some weird side effects.I haven't been to a doctor since then about it.  I don't think any medication that is available here will help me. [info] None [info] 1423977070

UnoriginellerName [info] Is it possible that I was traumatized by this event, or was it too miniscule? (info in post) Basically when we were small children, my older cousin (m) and I (f) often hung out at my grandparents house, because both of our parents worked. One day, cousin said he wanted to play a game with me called "present hiding" (something he made up). We went into the basement, into a room and he closed the door. He told me to close my eyes and to lay on the floor and I did. Then he sat on my chest, pulled of his pants, pulled out his dick and told me to put it in my mouth. I refused of course, and he told me it was a "rolled up piece of pizza". But I had my eyes opened a bit, and I knew he was lying.I don't remember how the whole situation resolved, but in the end, he never actually did anything to me and let me go. We were still friends afterwards too, just went back upstairs and acted like nothing ever happened. I was 4 or 5 when this all took place, and he had to have been like 8 to 10. We were literally two clueless, stupid children.Yet nowadays I think about the whole thing a lot, and for a while I cried about it from time to time. I'm also asking myself if this thing also contributed to my shyness growing up, and to my self esteem issues. Is it possible that this actually contributed to anything, or am I making a mountain out of a mole hill right now? After all, nothing ever happened(I also posted this in tooafraidtoask, but didnt get any response over there. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I don't know where else I could.

delightfullydemented [info] I hear ya. I was diagnosed with depression a couple of months ago and have had to have a lot of awkward conversations with my boss about it. I had to tell her because it's been affecting my work and stuff. I had a meeting with her a day or two before Kate Spade died and she was super frustrated with me and even said at one point "Okay, I get it, you're sad all the time!" And if I hadn't been bawling my eyes out at that moment I would have unleashed all kinds of fury because "sad" doesn't begin to describe it and there's so much more to it than that.So when my boss found out about Kate Spade she went on about how "devastated" she was and I took that opportunity to talk to her about it. I told her that if someone like Kate Spade who by all accounts has it all could be suicidal then imagine how someone like me feels who *doesn't*. That seemed to resonate with her somewhat but I'm still looking for another job, that kind of dismissive attitude is why people are hesitant to speak about mental illness in the first place...

DarkQuasar [info] I literally can't bring myself to DO things I want to do. Does anyone else have a chronic motivation problem? There are personal projects I've wanted to do for, well, ever; honestly decades. But I literally can't bring myself to start them. I think about them all the time, I *want* to start them, and I go to bed every night regretting I didn't start them. For whatever reason, I **cannot** bring myself to begin.I am diagnosed with depression, but I'm being medicated for it (and consistently monitored), so I know that has to play some kind of factor. Aside from knowing this, though, I just want to be able to break out of my endless "planning" phase and get the ball rolling. I feel like it would get some of this stuff that's built up in my head out and make me feel better? (Maybe that sounds weird.) I know a lot of folks say, "You just gotta do it." or, "Dive in!" but that's not helpful for me. I need something more.Does anyone have any similar experiences and did you break out of it?

carmen2211 [info] I'm so sorry :( That sucks. NParents are so heartless. I totally relate, so you're not alone. I was diagnosed with dysmenorrhea, a year or two after I got my first period. Which is basically every month when my period comes around I have immense pain and (tmi) lots of blood, more than what's good I guess. The pain keeps me up if I don't take pills on time, it makes me bedridden for a good 3 days. It's like the worst pain imaginable. I'm actually going through it right now again lol, but I took my medication early. (every month. yay me.) But yeah, some nights I'd be up until 4am just sobbing in the bathroom, not even able to move because the pain is too much, and my parents would come in and yell at me and tell me to shut up. They'd mock my crying the next morning, mimicking what I sound like, and telling me I just have low pain-tolerance. Nmom always says, "You're just sensitive. When I had my period it never hurt like that. If you know you're going to have your period why don't you take care of yourself?" Even though the doctor straight up told them that it's not regular period cramps and a lot more painful than what regular people go through.  Also, my period is irregular, not because of my condition but it changes with stress and my environment, which obviously living with n-parents doesn't give me consistent healthy bodily functions. So I can't exactly "keep track of it" or "know" when it's coming. I can estimate, but I'm usually a good 5-10 days off. this time I was a week late. Whenever I'd be crying because of the pain my nDad would enjoy it, saying this was gods way of punishing me for not listening to him. Also, when I was diagnosed with depression and supposed to go to a teen psych ward for further help, NMom got super angry at me and told me I'd be wasting her money. When I told her I was getting a therapist and needed her to sign papers, she spent nearly 4 hours yelling at me and making me feel like shit telling me I had no reason to be depressed, and making it all about her, telling me how bad her life is in comparison to mine. So yeah. . totally relate on the "I'm not allowed to feel, only she can."  [info] None [info] 1537129540

mmpb [info] This is me irl. I grew up in a homogenous population (I’m not sure why but I think this is important), and did a bunch of random stuff as a kid, so I learnt really random info on a lot of random things. I was also the only girl child growing up, was babied but also treated equally (we all had the same chores regardless of age or physical appearance)...I grew up to be very approachable and have always been described by adults in the family as a “people’s person”...the end result of all these was me having very different groups of friends, I know everybody everywhere and I can connect people from different social groups that otherwise don’t interact, I’m able to hold a conversation with most people regardless of race or religious or political views...I never had a best friend growing up, I was always hanging out with different people all the time. I never felt weird about it until I was diagnosed with depression, so I only really feel lonely and sad when I’m depressed, which I guess is what depression is anyways...I always enjoyed my own company as much as I did others, I always believed that I need to love myself before loving others, and that I am the only person that can hold myself accountable for my own life. I love watching movies alone, or going to dinners or trying out new restaurants alone...as much as I enjoy my friends of different circles, I think having different groups of friends and knowing many people has made my life more interesting and helped me a lot growing into the human I am today. I’m now in my late 20s and just last year I realized that it really doesn’t matter whether someone consider me as their best friend or not, I can still consider them my best friend. Everybody meets different people in life, why do I want to control other people’s friend circle? I’m very happy to have them on this journey with me. Life is short, live your life and love your life.

bendy-trip [info] LSD first time experience trip report. LSD helped me with my mental illness. In 2015 I was diagnosed with depression and an emotionally unstable personality disorder. After around 12-18 months of therapy and trying multiple different medication options, I felt as if I was empty and nobody could understand let alone help. I became suicidal and even  planned on taking my own life on two separate occasions.  After months of research and seeking advice from anybody that would listen I stumbled across an article that talked about the potential therapeutic and mind altering effects of phycedelic drugs. That was it. I was intrigued. It took me around 6 weeks to acquire a reliable source for LSD and once I did, I bought 4 200ug blotters. So, after about a week of getting the LSD, me and a friend (A) agreed we would take 2 blotters each, 400ug. The day of the trip:: I put the first blotter on my tongue, eagerly waiting for a horrible medicinal taste. Nothing! After 10-15 minutes I swallowed the first blotter and walked to the local shop for soft drinks. We got back and instantly took the remaining 2 and had 1 each. About 20 minutes passed and “A” decided it would be a good idea to go to the public park. Me being me and being high from a packed out marijuana joint, I agreed. On route to the park, wich is only a 10 minute walk away, a plane trailing a banner flew over head.  I’d never actually seen one until this day. I swear I lifted my head to look at the plane for around a minute and as soon as I lowered my head to look straight, the whole world had changed.  I had heavily misunderstood how intense it was going to be! I suggested we retreat to my apartment to stay safe and try to enjoy the experience, “A” agreed 110%. We got back after a sketchy 10 minute fast paced sweaty and anxious walk, “A” had already began to freak out at this point. 30-40 minutes passed and I was having the time of my life. “A” meanwhile was insisting he had to go home or he was going to die! This began to have a negative effect on my trip so I eventually walked him across the road to his house and once again, retreated to my bedroom for safety. Around the 2 hour mark is where I peaked and I believe this is where I had a shift in my mental state and everything from this moment onward changed. I was riding a bicycle through multi coloured geometrically shaped mountains that where pulsating waves of love outward like a heartbeat while being followed by an entity that I can only describe as feminine, if that makes any sense at all. Yes I know!As I was coming down hours later, I had motivational thoughts racing through my head inspiring me to change my life. I was filled with positivity to the point I literally cried with happiness. I sat in my bed, eat a full packet of Oreos that tasted unbelievably amazing, little did I know that food is amazing while coming down on physchedelics, and fell asleep. This experience happened to me 14 months ago. I’ve had a single DMT session since about 2 months ago, and my life has changed completely. I feel better, I communicate better and believe that I am also a better person to be around. I’ve had no thoughts of suicide, I have had no need to contact a doctor or any “down” moments concerning my mental health. IMO LSD has made me a better person. Sorry for the long post but I had to get this off my chest.As for “A” he contacted me the very next day and said he didn’t enjoy the experience and would maybe try it again another day. My next experience is scheduled very soon. I’ll keep you posted. [info] None [info] 1542485330
Old_Army90 [info] It's rough. I've been diagnosed with depression in the past, but I've been on meds and have checkups every three months and have been doing well for years. At what point though would a legislature (or scientific panel for that matter) says "Yes, he's proven that he can own a gun and not be a risk to anyone." Would someone disagree with their assessment? What would they do if they disagreed? Could something change to where my ability to own a gun *was* taken away at some point?It's a tricky issue, but most definitely one that needs to be addressed.

meganahs [info] I decided to get up (with help). A visual of my depression. I was diagnosed with depression several years ago. I haven’t been on medication or sought out therapy after the effects left several years ago. I understood my depression and battled accordingly. The last few months have been rough though. Every aspect of my life has suffered. From myself, family, career, body image, house, friends, to everything in between.Now let me make this clear, I am not suicidal. I am a glass half full person. I love and enjoy life. I appreciate the beauty in the world and my personal relationships. I love my job and my passion that I have for it. I recently sought out help though. I reached out to my father and communicated my feelings. Now you must know I am a visual person. I try to understand things by relating them to something I already understand. When talking to my father, I reassured him that I am not aiming to harm myself and that I am just stuck. I relayed a picture/story of what I was feeling and he ultimately understood. I just wanted to share.Picture a simple building. Four brick walls and a large window in the front. The window can be anything you attribute to happiness. For the sake of the image, picture an item or a painting that you can admire. I can understand the artwork in the window. I enjoy every aspect of it and feel happiness in addition to admiration. The only problem… There is no door. It should be there. Either to the left or the right. I can’t find the door. I feel content standing in the window but still desire to find the door. The longer I look for the door the further I am from the window. The last few years, I have been able to find my way back to the front. Jumping over obstacles or pot holes that I didn’t fill. I always had a desire to get back to the front of that window. Only recently, the obstacles became more difficult. I find myself sitting in the back alley wondering if I should go left or right. I have been living on the instant gratification but not moving. I sat down. Sure, I can see the billboards of hopes and dreams. I see them but I don’t bother to get up. I have watched my friends, family, career, and responsibilities pass by. Yet, I did nothing. I feel that I have waited too long. Yet, this last week I reached out. I asked for a hand up from several people. I stood up. I must say… That’s a big step. The only issue is whether do I go right or left to get back to the window?At least I stood up. That’s all that matters right now. [info] None [info] 1480691772
FaceMace87 [info] Depression isn't like that. I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago.I didn't even really notice, it was my girlfriend that did. She noticed I would spend more and more time just sitting without doing anything in particular. Whenever she asked why I just sat I would reply "I am just chilling".It got to the point that just sitting was all that I did but because it happened over a long period of time I didn't notice.I was finding it hard getting up in the morning and I just said I was tired but in reality I was depressed.Don't believe what the movies tell you.

pizzalover9a [info] Advice - telling my employer I am severely ill and may get worse. Hello r/uk.I was hoping someone here maybe able to help me or point me in the right direction.I am 29 year old male who works for a large corporate in central London. For the past 6 years ive been battling a degenerate autoimmune disease. It has a long latin name but in a nut shell its the inflammation and artheritis of my lower spine.Over the past 6 years ive had to give up a lot such as running and now even walking without pain. The past two years have seen it get really bad and i am worried for my future. I have been diagnosed with depression from my GP (caused by slowly losing the ability to walk pain free).My employer who i have worked for now for 18 months doesnt know i am ill. I decided not to tell them as i could still get into work and continue to carry out my role.It is now getting too unbearable to commute in and focus on work and i do not know where i stand from a legal point. Does anybody know any source or know which direction they can point me where i can speak to someone to understand my legal rights, also how to tell my employer in the right way without being sacked (and it being blamed on another reason) that i have degenerative conditon that may cause me being unable to work by this time next year?edit: unfortunately there is no known cure currently. thank you [info] None [info] 1509371433
Fastuchera03 [info] I have felt exactly like you, for months on end, in the past. I feel my own low energy, lack of concentration, haziness, etc. in the end, were related to chronic depression. This hunch was confirmed by a psychiatrist (a few different ones, during different periods of my life). I think sometimes that if we’re not crying all day long we think, “I can’t possibly be depressed.” And yet there are many other symptoms of depression. I would talk to a psychiatrist. Fighting an uphill battle everyday, feelings of guilt... I personally don’t feel that’s anyone’s normal. I was diagnosed with depression and took an SSRI. I had done CBT - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy- in the past, and that may be your best option, since you’re pregnant and it is treatment sans medication. In my opinion, I am at my best with a combination of an SSRI and CBT. I was just pregnant (but I miscarried) and stopped my SSRI as soon as I found out. I would prefer to be on one, as I feel it genuinely helps in many aspects (mood, energy levels, etc.) but plan to continue trying to conceive, so can’t go back on one. I realize this may not help, given SSRIs are probably not possible for you right now, but I would consider that your mood, energy levels, feelings of failure etc., might be tied into something larger than just “I need to be more motivated and why am I unmotivated and unaccomplished ugh.” Pregnancy hormones are another complicating dimension to this. I wish you the very best. [info] None [info] 1569595910

bigchungy [info] My father made me go to 5 different doctors after I was diagnosed with depression until we ran into a doctor that agreed with his notion that "you can't be depressed, you're too young" or whatever stupid shit he believes. Eventually he actually started only looking for middle eastern doctors because he thought they would agree with him. The last doc I went to was this young middle eastern woman who seemed like she went through the same shit I did. She actually sat down my father and lectured him for how shitty it was that he was fishing around for a doctor that would deny me medical care.I think he just didn't want me treated for depression in case the secret "got out" to our family and reflected poorly on him. I feel the same way about not wanting to come home from college, but unfortunately my college is small so the dorms actually close and require you to leave most holidays.

abigaell [info] Hey there,I was diagnosed with depression from a very young age, but like you, I was afraid for a long time to call anyone and ask for help. One idea is to look online for practices in your area, and send them an email. More and more counselors these days share their email for communication purposes because it's usually faster to reach someone by email than by phone call. Express your fears about talking to someone. They can usually arrange a phone call with the clinician first as well.I believe online therapy is a thing now, too.Sorry if this didn't help. I will try to think on more solutions.

buterbetterbater [info] The worst part of being bullied that people don't talk about is the "odd" kid is often perceived as a scapegoat by kids AND teachers. Being ugly or fat or whatever can make the adults around just as inclined to ignore, berate and abuse a child. I had the trifecta- physical and emotional abuse at home, abuse and alienation from schoolmates and mistreatment and targeting by teachers. There was no safe place. When a 7 year old is seeing suicide as the only relief from torment, it's disgusting. My experience has made me a firm believer that schools have no place administering physical punishment. I was being beaten severely at home and was being paddled as well at school.  Being the fat awkward kid left me vulnerable to abuse and no one offered protection. I don't know that I ever got over it- I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I still lack the trust to have close friends. I feel so vulnerable around people that I stay to myself and my partner is my only regular interaction. I don't talk to my surviving family often. I don't understand how someone could be so heartless and cruel to a child (maybe if I didn't have the contrast of my sister who was given all the affection and attention anyone could want). I was the last child and my mom ran off when i was a baby and I think I just became a sorry reminder of her to my family. I haven't any kids yet, but now the thought of doing that to a kid is so fucking infuriating that I don't know what to do.   [info] None [info] 1351082404
aweitscerulean [info] Im destined to be a loser because of my depression. [Long] I'm desparately trying to figure something to do with my life other than work at a gorcery store my entire life. I was in college but when i was 19, I dated a guy thay was way too old for me and was completely toxic to himself and everyone around him. I knew he wasnt the best boyfriend in the world but i didnt care, i just wanted to feel loved consistently. I made the dumbest decision of my life and flunked out if school because he wasnt attending college, i was very overwhelmed with my classes,  and i just didnt give a fuck what happened. I remember repressing my worries in my head about the consequences of flunking college, but would be willfully ignorant about it.  I want to join the Air Force so that I can attend college again, but I was diagnosed with depression last year and that is an immediate disqualifier, as i have to have neen off medication and not taking therapy fir at least 3 years. I cant fucking handle the thought of not going to the military at this point becaise i have tried to save money over and over again to pay off my community college so that i can attend achool again but i can never save up the money i need. Ive tried several times and something always happens. The last two times, someone t-boned and totalled my car and then the next, my (new to me) car needed a new transmisson. I called the recruiting office the next day and lied, saying ive never expirienced depression, so i wont have to wait 3 year, when ill definitely feel too old to enlist. I know it may not be a good idea but i feel like im on my last option before being a loser for the rest of my life. I never ever thought as a child that i was going to grow up to be a failure, but here i am.  I was also a very heavy marijuana user up until yesterday, so that i can have a clean system by the time i get to MEPS. I cant sleep, its almost 3am where i live and i work at 11 in the morning. I cant sleep because i keep thinking about how my father permanently warped me and now i have depression that i could otherwise probably fight it off if it weren't for him making me feel like a fucking burden and literally enjoying watching me stress and even cry over stuff. I haven't spoken to him in almost 10 years and i hope i never have to see his face or hear from him ever again. I feel like i could handle stress and coping with reality sober if it werent for him. He also beat the idea into my head growing up that the military is not for women (I'm a woman), that "all they do is go in and get knocked up. " So as you can imagine, I never thought of it as an option  until recently, now that I'm older and haven't spoken to him in almost a decade.  Im so fucking sad and lonely right now too.  Which also got me feeling really fucking guilty because my mother lives by herself and has no other children but me and I never really talk on the phone long or visit for more than an hour at a time because she's jobless and has no friends and shes extremely boring and suffers from depression as well and gives HORRIBLE life advice so i cant trust her with shit. She doesn't even seem to listen when i try to talk to her about my worries with my life and its not like im constantly complaining. Im actually quite ashamed of myself when i feel crappy. She always wants me to come visit and i always dread it. i feel like Im a horrible fucking person for treating her this way but I feel so fucking weird to be emotional at all with her, and I think its because my dad was just really bizarre in that category. He never told me he loved me and we certainly never hugged eachother. and i never referred to him as dad. I would call him by his first name.  So now i feel cold to my own mother and i think its because if i show too much emotion  i feel  like i lose my dignity. Like its super cringe to have to tell anyone in my family that i love them. i fucking hate that. Im just fucking so miserable and i want to sleep but i can't and now im  currently ruining my full day of work for tomorrow due to not sleeping. fuck this shit. [info] None [info] 1529564677
redraven_adamw [info] My depression story. I am a 27 year old male with chronic depression. This is my story so far. Growing up not remembering anything before I was 6 or 7. This was also the time my parents got divorced. I have very few snippets of my biological father. I was told he was very abusive to my mom.My mom got remarried a year later to my step-dad. He had 2 children of his own, both male. One was 4 years older and the other 8 years older. Got bullied by the youngest most of my life. The older one and I just never got close.In elementary school I was diagnosed with ADD. Never had friends. And got bullied. I tried to make friends, but I always felt like an outcast. I eventually made a friend in 5th grade. But he went to another school in middle school. So I lost contact with him.In middle school same thing pretty much same thing has happened. I tried to make friends to no avail. I started to swim and play football to make friends, while I was great at both I still felt like an outcast.  Got bullied in school and felt like an outcast once again. Wasn't until the end of 8th grade, we where assigned to do a group movie. We where able to pick your peers for your groups. I didn't know what to do and eventually all the "weird" kids formed a group. One of the kids  invited me to come play AOE2 at his house. His two friends and I played for 8 hours straight on one game . Turned out to be best time of my life. Later they became my best friends.High school came around I decided to play on the football team and the swim team. I had to pick one of the two because I was great at both, but the issue was that they ran on similar seasons. I picked swimming because it was the better fit because for the life of me I couldn't catch a ball. But I was one of most athletic on the team. I evetually went to state sophomore year and junior year. Fast forward to senior year is where my depression started to kick in. A swim coach from one of the top architecture schools took interest in me came to my swim meet but this was the time I blew up and quit out of the blue and never showed up. I was just overwhelmed at the time because I still felt like an out cast and never befriend anyone on my swim team. On top of that my parents where always working and rarely ever supported me at events. While other parents always congratulated me. It took a hard toll on my life. This was the time I was diagnosed with depression. My step-uncle was a doctor knew I was depressed before I was even diagnosed. My parents both born in Poland never believed in depression. I was given lexapro for about 6 months and saw progress. My parents saw this progress and told me to stop taking the medication because I was happy again. I was naive at the time and didn't know what depression was.I still ended up going to the architecture school even though I didn't join their swim team. Same thing happened and felt like an out cast never made friends. Still had those 3 friends from the end of middle school though. Grades slowly started to go down not because I didn't have potential which I did, but because I started to stop trying and slowly stopped doing assignments and started to miss classes. In the mean time I had a girlfriend but was too ashamed to tell her what I was going through and that I had depression. My parents finally found out that I dropped out of school the same week my step uncle died (I was really close to him) and at the same time I found out my GF cheated on me. Lost 10 pounds the next 2 weeks. I started to get treatment for my depression finally but my parents still thought I was making excuses and being lazy. I was seeing a therapist and started to take medication. Started to get better and wanted to go back to school. I did and again same thing happened started out great then started to slip once again into depression. While this was happening both my best friends ended up moving away due to the military and my 3rd friend ended up ghosting all of us.Parents had enough and told me to get a job even though I was working as a pizza delivery guy they said a real job. I got a job as cnc machine operator. Was easy for me but stress induced because I was learning to code by hand and if I made a mistake it would be on my head. I was learning to program on master cam on the sidelines. But again I got overwhelmed I just quit. Decided to go to a community college took 12 credit hours was a straight A student then again I just quit. At this point I started to notice a pattern of depression and normal every 4-6 months or so maybe more .Went to TMS therapy didn't work.Went to outpatient therapy to further understand and what to do. After 2 months my parents told me to get a full time job I told them I could barly handle a part time job. Ended up working full time after 2 months again I quit due to being overwhelmed. In order to cover the fact I quit I still drove to my former job and sat in the parking lot for my "shift" so my parents wouldn't find out. They evetually did.This when I was bed ridden for 3 months just got up to eat and shit. Was suicidal and eventually agreed to go to inpatient because my mom didn't know what to do. My step dad didn't give a shit. After inpatient then outpatient I started keto therapy.  Thought  it worked and started to take it once a month after the initial 6 doses. Things where looking up. Went out of state to a private program for 6 months to work on my self.Life was looking good. Had a few slips here and there but I got out of it in a week . I called it progress.Got out came back home things where great. But life hit me hard. My last friend moved due to college.  I did move out to get away from my toxic step dad. Got a job at ups but again things started to slip and I quit.Now present day my mom wants to help me. I refuse because I am tired of trying. I lost all my friends and can't make new ones unless it's in a closed environment like the program I went to. But that's not real life. I fully understand I am not fit to have a GF. At this point in my life I see no point in wanting anything because it eventually goes to shit so why try. I stopped talking to people because I don't see the point. I just make enough for food and rent. Don't see the point In making more. My hygiene is shit because again if I am staying inside all day and no point on impressing others when try. Only good thing is I am not suicidal. Just because I know it would break my mom's heart. Even though it already feels like I am breaking heart for being the way that I am. I just fully accept that I will be miserable for the rest of my life, I can't enjoy anything anymore. I am done trying. [info] None [info] 1578962239
wafflekonez [info] Grew up in a Christian family, can confirm. First time I told my mom I was diagnosed with depression she shook it off and told me to just go back to church, that the Devil was targeting me in my weakness. I’ve gone on to forgive her for that because after a year of therapy I’ve realized a lot of people don’t really understand what exactly depression is, hell I never did either besides it being a “chemical imbalance”.I’m grateful for having gone through depression though, it’s taught me so much about what’s important in life and the importance of being there for others. I have a much greater appreciation for life, and after seeking profession help and talking out all my shitty issues, I feel in control of my life and 1,000,000 times more positive about everything. Reading Mark Maron’s book also helped iron out the remaining kinks.Tips for anyone who thinks they’re going through depression: Find someone, anyone to talk to and tell them everything you feel, even if it doesn’t make sense. Seek professional help if you can, it’s definitely worth it. And though you may not see it or believe, it can and does get better if you’re brave enough to face it and put in the effort to work through it. It’s not an easy thing to live with, but you can make it out, it’s just a matter of understanding your mind and your body and why things affect you the way they do. EDIT: Though I’m not the best Christian, I do believe in God, and I think in his own way he walked me through my recovery process to give me an understanding of it, so that I can use my experience to help others. I’m a firm believer in the power of Love and loving others regardless of their background/situation. There’s too much hate in this world going around, we need to be brave and fight back with compassion, patience, and kindness. [info] None [info] 1520976281

Langoustina [info] I had just gotten diagnosed with severe depression and had started seeing a therapist. It took months for the therapist to convince me that medication might help, and while I was thinking about it, I messaged a friend that I hadn't yet told about my diagnosis. The conversation went something like this: (bear in mind that I'm translating this so it's not quite exact)Me: So I've been diagnosed with depression, and they want to see if meds will help. I'm starting to consider them because I can't live like this anymore. Her: Depression isn't cured with meds, my dear. It's cured by being with family and friends.Me: I mean, I'm with my family and friends all the time, and I'm exhausted every day even after sleeping plenty, and I'm just so fucking sad even thought everything is fine in my life. I don't understand it.Her: Well being depressed is bad, there's nothing good that comes of it. Life is too short to be like that. I lost my grandma about a month ago and I didn't expect her to die so soon. You can't waste your life being depressed.Me: No but that's what I'm saying, I am thinking about going on meds because I don't want to waste my life being depressed.\*At this point she falls asleep (we live on opposite sides of the world) and I don't hear from her until the next day.\*Her: Is your "depression" better today? (Laughing emoji, heart emoji)Me: \*Basically explains that no, it doesn't work that way, I'm trying my best but it won't just disappear\*Her: Well, quit working yourself up over nothing!&amp;#x200B;Needless to say I just agreed with her after that and quit talking to her as much. I felt absolutely gutted. And the meds did help once I went on them. Things improved so much. But yeah, I felt let down by that.  [info] None [info] 1551742940

(I just hate everything that requires work and don't care about anything) and my boyfriend *was* supportive at first, but since the past month, he's been controlling. And by controlling, I mean not only do I have to ask my parents (which is obvious) to go out with some friends, I have to ask him too if it's a day where he's working. I find this stupid. I told him, "I don't like the way you're acting like another parent." B responded with "I'm only doing this because I care about you." I think that was a red flag, not sure about that.After a bit, we agreed we'd go out with friends together, last Friday. We all meet up with our regular crew all aged from 16-22. I was super excited, him not so much. As I was chatting with the others, I look over and he's hunched on his phone playing an app. After a bit, he then murmured to me, "I'm going to go work on my car." I was confused, but watched him walk and sit in his car.After an hour or so, (he was in his car for about 10 minutes at this point) my friend wonders what the hell he's doing there and to ask him if he'd like to go to the hookah bar with all the others. He's really against smoking, so go figure. However they didn't know this, so I asked him if he was going to go, he said no. I said I wanted to, but then got into an argument about how he doesn't want to and wants more time with me alone so he starts to leave while the others go to the bar and I stay behind, a little pissed. So there was a Notebook moment with me saying, "Fine, I won't go." He comes back.So today I told him I don't like how he treats me when it comes to me going out and the relationship as a whole.I tell him: "Look, I want to let you know. Since last night, I've been questioning whether or not I'm happy in this relationship. Well, I'm not. I don't like how controlling you are. I don't think we'll be happy together. Maybe we should just take a break."Him: "I'm not controlling."I told him I just wanted time away from working on a relationship, and I want to try to make myself happy. So once I get back on Facebook, he unfriended me. I asked him why and he says: "I'm trying to give you as much space as possible. Want me to not care? I won't even see your posts. Okay?"So currently we are on a break. I'm not upset, not crying waterfalls, and if anything I feel happier and more free than ever. I kinda wished that we would have taken that much more mature.**tl;dr** my boyfriend treats me like his child and it's rather annoying, and somewhat wondering if I should even try to fix this relationship.

spidersarefab [info] From the UK as well and I couldn't agree more!I was diagnosed with depression at 17 and given sertraline to manage it. It didn't work, wanna know why?It was actually ADHD and I was misdiagnosed for 6 years because the docs didn't listen to me properly. A lot of people I know are just put on it and that's it. It even says that you have to have been experiencing these symptoms for at least a year (I think?) to be diagnosed so why are doctors not even questioning it? Let's not forget that it can actually make you feel worse when you first go on it! It seems to be something taken so lightly. [info] None [info] 1559219089

outdoorwoman84 [info] Old Habits, laziness and a bad mentality die REALLY hard (Long post) I've attempted to keep at it with CICO for 1 month.   The first two weeks I was able to stick with it, track almost everything and keep the motivation and mindset.   The last couple of weeks,  not so much.   They say it can take 21 days to make a habit.  I didn't make it 15 days. A little bit about me:   34 Female, weighing in around 244 pounds.  When I started CICO I was 248. I did not weight myself this morning because I was afraid of what it would be.   At the beginning of this year I was roughly 255-258.  Winter always becomes my very sedentary time and once Spring hits I become more active with my kayak fishing competing (yes its a thing).   I have been through cycles of becoming a couch potato in the late fall up until April for several years now.  I hate winter, I hate dark mornings and dark evenings,  I hate the cold, and any activity outside in the cold is somewhat impossible due to cold induced asthma.   I have also given up very easily in the past with other diet trends, mainly because they were so restrictive and knew it would not work and also didn't have the mindset.I had been in a funk for about 2 years with no reason/motivation/mindset, etc to try or even attempt weight loss.  I knew I just didn't have it in me mentally to do it.  I recently got married 9/8/18 so there was a lot on my plate for that.  The week off after the wedding something inside finally woke back up.  I got motivated, I got the mindset back. Its like the on switch that I couldn't find was on full power.  I was ready to make a change. There is literally nothing keeping me from loosing weight but myself.  I kept seeing posts on this subreddit and it gave me even more inspiration.  I bought resistance bands, printed off motivational posters, I did things to prep myself and hoped I could keep at it.  I didn't want to let myself get into my normal winter potato mode.  I wanted to get myself in better shape for the kayak bass fishing national championship next March down in Louisiana.  (Kayak Fishing is my heart, soul and passion).  I had the vision of being slimmer and in better shape for this event.  I had such good intentions, motivation, and support from my husband who I had tried to get into it years before. Now it feels and seems that I have just automatically given up, but the switch is still somewhat on, which I'm terrified I'll loose access to completely again. I tracked my food/calories with the loseit app and made a simple goal to track everything and keep my calorie limit within reason (1600-1700/day). Sounded and seemed easy enough.  The first 2 weeks I was able to stick with it completely and logged everything even if I went over, but it wasn't going over by much (70-100 calories).   I didn't limit myself on certain foods, etc but realized within the first 2 days that it was still going to be a challenge mentally since I have a big sweet tooth and its really opened my eyes as to how many calories are in anything and everything.  Around the end of the 2nd week  I hit the wall again.  I would track most of the day, or parts of the day, then the evening is where I would run into trouble.   I would want to have larger portions of dinner and have that evening snack.  I couldn't deal with actually seeing how bad I did by tracking and it would make me feel ashamed of myself if I did.  I also have had issues with binging (usually around the time of the month).  I used the resistance bands once.It's so easy to get off track, go back to old habits and just continue to be lazy because its the EASY thing to do and requires the least amount of effort. It's easy to come home, get dinner ready, etc and then just sit on the couch because its easy and requires little effort/energy. It's easy to give up right away because there has been no progress visually/mentally/etc and its the easy thing to do.It's been easy to always think I'm never going to be good enough to loose weight because I have always failed or given up and have constantly yo-yo'd throughout the years.It's easy to get discouraged and give up when the scale barely moves.It's so easy to make whatever food you want and not have to count calories for every single ingredient because that can take alot work and even investigation.  It's easy to give up looking for better and different foods, recipes, etc because its an endless monster in itself since there can literally be 100 variations of 1 recipe.  There's also a lot of really weird shit out there for recipes and foods.  I was also faced with the reality of the meals I had made in the past were HUGE calorie eaters.  My ghoulash recipe is 650 calories alone.... not a lot of room for other meals and foods in the day.   &amp;#x200B;Now the positive side of things that my mind has accepted/realizes (My mind has a hard time seeing positives as this has been a struggle since high school, which is when I was diagnosed with depression).  By doing CICO there has not been any junk food, candy etc in the house for quite some time. Even when I gave up I have still not succumbed to buying crap food from the grocery store. Its a matter of not having the temptation in the house  and also budgeting since we are working on paying off credit card debt to eventually be able to buy a house.    Meal planning and prep has been on Sundays and made things easier for knowing what lunches and dinner will be, but on the other side of that is that there is alot more for me to do, since I do 95% of the meal planning, prep and 100% cooking.  My husband is supportive, encouraging etc, but couldn't cook to save his life.  Our kitchen is tiny in a house we rent so that makes things challenging if he wants to try to help  Our local Krogers now has the Clicklist where you order ahead and pick up your groceries.  The only downside is that it has to be made within 4 hours of wanting to pick it up and they stop pick up after 8pm. I'm trying to see the how/why/what etc that got me off track and has caused me to automatically think I have failed.  There's one part of my mind that desperately wants to keep trying,  but another part that is already in the given up and lets go back to easy/lazy mode. The battle in my mind seems to be the wall.   I wish I could just shut this part off so I can keep myself going. [info]   [info] 1541090923
ILikeToPetDogs90 [info] "I have no reason so to be sad but i am" this is because of "I was diagnosed with depression" This, I have Major Depressive Disorder and in my experience I went from being suicidal when I was unhappy with life to being healthy when my life started turning around to being suicidal when my life was objectively great, it ruined my relationship with my Fiancee, ruined my health and ruined my career, there can be causes for MDD and other types of depression,Diet and health is a big one, since I have gotten back on top of my issues with Chronic pain I have been getting a bit, better, I had a great week, and I'm having a shit day, but trying to stay positive helps me, levels of minerals and shit can do it too, but don't shy away from the fact that you have depression "I want a quit my job and just spend all day in my room" that's depression, whichever type it is, you need to try to reflect on your problems, which honestly is the hardest when you're depressed, friends and a good support network who understand what you are going through and who you are honest with is the only thing I have found that helps me, it is very hard to maintain such a network without asking too much of people you rely on though as well, people only have so much emotional willpower themselves. anyway sorry for the rant, having a shit day like I said, but I hope this sheds a little bit of light on things? sorry if it doesn't, and if you need to talk man, feel free to hit me up :) I'll try to help with some of the things that have plagued me and some of the ways I try to cope if you like. Have a good one though man, hope you're feeling better soon, and if this is hitting you when you've been super unhealthy, that could well be the reason, talk to your doctor and see if there's anything they can check on that could help.

sadthough [info] The feeling of nostalgia actually really hurts sometime I've been diagnosed with depression for a few years now, but one thing that gets me the most is this really painful pang of nostalgia. I could just be sitting and minding my own business, but suddenly it hurts so much - like I'm longing for something. A lot of the times, I don't even know why, but I suddenly feel like I need to go back to my childhood, and that I want to leave reality. The pain actually feels physical, and I clutch my chest to stop it from hurting. Sometimes I think about the things I miss, and I remember this scent I used to love in my bed sheets. However, this scent was lost over a decade ago, and I can only just remember how it "should've" smelled like. It was a mixture of detergent, my mom's scent, and just the scent of my house.    Sigh.

IlixAquifolium [info] Is anyone here managing to be successfully employed or self employed with CPTSD? I'm looking for some hope that I can achieve this too. For as long as I can remember I have struggled with feeling like 'a loser' or 'a failure.' I think this came from childhood when my mum was always saying that I was 'too timid' and needed to be like this other girl who lived down the street who was loud and tomboyish. It felt confirmed in primary school where I was bullied for being 'weird and posh' and day dreamed a lot spending the lessons either tuned out and looking out the window or drawing. I would get distracted by things like the chocolate bar pictures in the maths books, focusing on how 3d and chunky they looked and how I wanted to draw them (and eat them!) rather than work out some maths equation relating to them!I went to a school in a new area for secondary and felt absolutely DETERMINED to turn my lot around so aged 10 I started pretending to be an extrovert and made friends with a lot of cool rich kids, mainly because I knew it was my best bet against bullying. I also learnt study skills from these children and felt happy to be included but also struggled because there was always a very bossy girl in charge of each group who would put me down, mock me, use eye rolling etc. This was much more tolerable than outright physical bullying from boys so I just tolerated/accepted it. I started to do well in school and got good grades, then went to university and also got a good grade and felt on top of the world remembering the promises of all the adults that good grades = good job = happy life. Things fell apart as soon as I graduated and was in my first job which a menial minimum wage admin job that had nothing to do with my degree, which made me want to kill myself. I was diagnosed with depression and since then (now mid 30s) I've been in and out of therapy with a new diagnosis every few years.I tried another career later in my twenties partly to avoid the dreaded admin but to my absolute horror I started failing at it - I just couldn't keep up with the workload, the demands, all the people. I was working 80 hour weeks on little sleep and my brain felt like it broke. Since then I've never felt quite the same. I have held down one job for about 8 months but it felt like hell and I started having panic attacks and was once again signed off. I hated it so much it made me feel both filled with rage and also suicidal at the thought of having to keep working in a job like that my whole life (admin/reception).I've been on disability since then as everyone seems to agree that I 'have mental health problems.' I'm so grateful for the disability money but I would love to be able to be independent again. I tried a couple of self employed ventures but struggled to make any money from them, which has just added to that 'loserish' feeling. I want so badly to be a self employed creative but my CPTSD symptoms are so bad at the moment I can't even remember things I have just done 1 second before (ie. when I'm in the shower, I can't remember if I have just washed my hair etc, so end up washing myself 3 times because I keep tuning out and forgetting). I also dissociate quite a lot, cry most days, pretty much always feel really spaced out and I get sensory overload leading to panic attacks if I'm around a lot of people or have to talk to people too much. I need peace and quiet to feel calm and balance.I don't want to just waste away, I want to make something of my life. I'm not sure what I'm asking, maybe my question is How do I get back into work/self employment and make it work for me with my symptoms and be successful? Does anyone else struggle with CPTSD and also manage to be employed or self employed with some semblance of success? I've started therapy for my traumas and finding it really helpful but don't want to wait another few years to start working again, I want to get working again ideally in the next few months.Thank you for listening and for any helpful tips, advice or inspiration.

Austifox [info] I'm not sure where to go. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 23, and have been on medication since 26 (28 now). at the same time I was put on medication I was also diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. which is basically a less sever form of schizophrenia. but still pretty terrible. I hear voices all the time that tell me to kill or hurt myself, which just feeds into my depression.about two months ago my pharmacy ran out of my antipsychotic and I went a month without medication. during this time I cut up my arms pretty bad, went to a mental hospital for treatment, failed my semester at college, and lost my job.I've run out of money and relay on my parents to fund my living, but they can only help so much. I applied for disability with social security, but they said it could take 3 to 6 months to get the application processed and that doesnt mean I'll be accepted. I've tried applying for jobs, but no one will hire a schizoeffective person with a history of not performing at previous jobs. I called my dad today to let him know where I was financially and what I needed to get by. he said he would do what he could and get me the money, but I could hear the strain in his voice that I. a burden to them that they cant exactly afford at the moment.on top of that, my pharmacy ran out of antidepressants so I've been a week without those meds and my depression is really starting to hit hard. I've been feeling like the only escape is to harm myself, possible to the point of death, in order to get by and finally escape this hell of being a burden to those around me.I keep telling myself that eventually things will turn around and I'll get better. but I'm 28, jobless, still in college, and cant seem to find a break. I feel like I'm drowning in the sea with no land in sight and my strength is starting to give out. the endless abyss of the ocean is starting to look inviting and that scares me.

I was diagnosed with depression in my final year of undergrad, did cbt for a year, didn't work, and was eventually prescribed Escitalopram. Being scared of the potential side effects (and thinking perhaps my symptoms were more just me being a shitty human being than depression), I just never took it.Went through my masters with the symptoms, now started a PhD where the symptoms are amplified beyond what I've ever experienced, and I am likely dropping out in April once my classes are over. I do wonder how my life would be if I had stuck with the Escitalopram prescription... [info] PhD Neurophysiology [info] 1490797476
applebreadsticks [info] My life fell apart and I'm so heartbroken my body is breaking down Hi reddit. I'm (17F) struggling a lot to type this out, and have been since it happened even though I know I'll feel better after sharing it. I'm going to do a very very short version of The Downfall, and then maybe come back to elaborate when I feel like I can. Right now I truly just need to get this off my chest.I've been wanting to post on here for a while, but I've been struggling to communicate my feelings and haven't been able &amp;#x200B;I was diagnosed with depression a few weeks ago, before everything fell apart. Ergo I'm feeling pretty low already. Friday night I found out my grandmother and father both have cancer. My grandmother is close to dying and my father hasn't gotten the 'final results' yet, so his fate is currently unknown. I'm not very close with either of them, but it still hit me very hard as I don't have a lot of family left. I didn't tell anyone about it really, including my boyfriend, who cluelessly broke up with me about three hours later. I've been in relationships before, but never one as serious as this one, and he meant (means) the world to me. He simply just fell out of love. He was my biggest supporter and I've never confided in and trusted another person as I have him, so losing him also meant losing my best friend. I feel incredibly alone, and I don't recall when I last felt a pain like this. Since friday night I can count on one hand what I've eaten, I've been drinking a lot of alcohol to numb it all a bit, and now my body seems to be trying to tell me a thing or two. I woke up last night covered in my own blood experiencing the worst breakthrough bleeding in my life (i'm also on the pill, so this should not happen), am still bleeding heavily, which is scary. My hair is falling out in chunks, my skin is breaking out, I have excoriations around my eyes from crying, I cannot sleep, and my depression seems to have doubled in severity. Oh, and I also had a terrible pregnancy scare from two inconclusive tests this Monday. I can't believe my life was fine literally a week ago. I feel so lost and alone and see no hope for the future at all.&amp;#x200B;**Tl;dr: Was diagnosed with depression a few weeks ago. My boyfriend/best friend/biggest support broke up with me on the same night I found out my grandmother and father have cancer. Since then I have been unable to eat, drink, or sleep properly, and now I'm experiencing heavy breakthrough bleeding, acne, hairloss, and even worse depression.

sigmatic_minor [info] I'm sorry but your logic there is very broken. &gt; Was on the adderall for about 6 years. I moved and switched Primary Physicians he really looked into my health history and got me off of it. It was amazing how better i felt after i was weened off this stuff. That's like saying "I was diagnosed with depression and tried an antidepressant. I felt way better after I stopped taking it, therefore depression doesn't exist"Sounds like you were just misdiagnosed or the medication you tried wasn't the right choice for you. ADHD has been researched in countless independant peer-reviewed studies and it most definitely exists. It is also proven to be 75% genetic and you can be tested for the specific genes as well as do some reading on what particular neurotransmitters are affected and how.&gt; Even Leon on his death bed said it was fictitious.You may want to fact check this yourself. This isn't correct. See below (many sources for the full interview with proper context all over the internet):&gt; The claim that Dr. Eisenberg asserted “ADHD is a fictitious disease” is reproduced on countless web sites as something he said “seven months before his death in his last interview,” which would place the date of his utterance around February 2009. When documentation for the putative quote is provided, it references an article (often described as a “cover story”) published in the German weekly Der Spiegel on 2 February 2012.&gt; We found that the German-language version of Der Spiegel ran an article in 2012 that skeptically examined the large increase in diagnoses of mental disorders in recent years and quoted Dr. Eisenberg on that subject. A software-based translation of that article from German to English does describe Dr. Eisenberg as the “father of ADHD” and report that during his “last interview” he said something similar to “ADHD is a prime example of a fictitious disease.” However, when one allows for the vagaries of translation from German to English and reads the statement in context, it’s clear that Dr. Eisenberg wasn’t asserting that ADHD isn’t a real disorder, but rather that he thought the influence of genetic predispositions for ADHD (rather than social/environmental risk factors) were vastly overestimatedPlease do some more independant research (google scholar is fantastic) and be more open about the process of critical thinking.

xavyera_grace [info] Did you just read my mind? This is absolutely me right now. I have just started my second term as a first year and I am lonely as fuck. I mean, I've got 'friends' but I feel no connection whatsoever. It  hurts when I see everyone chatting away with their friends and generally enjoying the uni experience, while I'm here hating every moment of it. I don't have anyone to share a house with next year as well (will be living in student accomodation), and it just makes me feel so unwanted, especially when others I know are all able to find housemates. I literally have no idea if I can even get through these three years and have seriously considered taking a year off. I just don't know anymore.

I know I can’t just flip a switch or drink a potion for it to stop, however what I can do is challenge my mindset and ways of thinking. 2019 is my year to take back my life, gain confidence, and really just strengthen myself both mentally and physically.Regardless of whether you have a New Years resolution or not I wish you all the best. Be you, be true, be happy. Also don’t forget to be fabulous ☆〜（ゝ。∂） [info] None [info] 1546403970
FuzzyLittleBunnies [info] I was diagnosed with depression and put on prosaic about 10 years ago. Fast forward to now. My depression is the worst it's ever been. I'm just waiting to get my shotgun back from a friend so I can end it. I don't think it's clinical. But I'm fucking depressed. [info] None [info] 1572855287
Eunomiac [info] I think one of the things you should definitely do is read up on the symptoms of depression, and/or take a quick online screening test [like this one](http://psychcentral.com/quizzes/depquiz.htm).  Then discuss it with your doctor (you don't need to go to a psychiatrist/psychologist---GP's are much better equipped to diagnose and treat depression than most people give them credit).I say this because a lot of what you describe sounds to me like symptoms of clinical depression: feelings of being overwhelmed; inability to self-motivate combined with feelings of guilt; loss of interest in things you used to enjoy; overly negative self-perception and self-talk, and---*especially*---the way that you distinguish yourself today from who you "used to" be.  That last part suggests to me you're not grappling with some deeply-rooted character flaw, but rather that you've experienced a negative *change* in your mental state---one that may have been triggered by something (like stress or burnout), or simply by a quirk of brain chemistry.  Regardless, depression is a nasty beast, and you really want to rule it out:  Untreated, it's very good at making itself worse---lack of energy/motivation leads to more social isolation and negative self-talk, which worsens the depression, which makes you even *less* energetic/motivated... and so the spiral goes.  Obvious disclaimer:  I'm not a doctor, and this isn't medical advice.  I have been diagnosed with depression and am responding well to treatment, though, so I do have "life experience" as they say.  Importantly, depression in men doesn't necessarily mean feeling sad or having suicidal thoughts: rather, it frequently presents as a decline in energy, motivation and sense of self-worth of the kind you describe.**EDIT:** I just wanted to add:  A lot of the advice in this thread is really, really good---particularly meditation, which science is increasingly revealing the benefits of.*However,* we live in a society that stigmatizes mental health issues, such as depression.  It's very easy for well-meaning and insightful people to suggest things that may, and probably will, help.  But let's pretend instead that you have a broken finger.  It's painful as hell, but it's not as if it's rendered you nonfunctional:  You can still drag yourself to work, feed and clothe yourself, etc.  People might suggest you compensate by using your other hand, or dull the pain with Tylenol, or tell you to take care that no one bumps it while you're waiting for it to hopefully heal on its own.  It's all helpful advice.Or... you could go to a medical expert, get x-rays, and get the bone properly set.  Not only will it heal faster and cleaner, but it won't hurt as much in the meantime.In my opinion, we should look at depression (and other mental health issues) in the same way.  We don't, but we should.   [info] None [info] 1459759779

weeabootits [info] Hey OP, this sounds like me. I'm a 18 year old female, in my first year of college. As a kid I was accelerated a lot and always did very well until around 8th grade, when I was diagnosed with depression and ADD. I would just not hand in assignments throughout high school, even though I knew the consequences. I kind of felt like I was already failing and there was nothing I could do about it anyways, so I didn't try. I just wanted to sleep and play video games all the time. It's very hard for me to explain - and sometimes I don't even understand it - but it was just a mental block due to my depression I think.  [info] None [info] 1422045627
CIthrowAway [info] I think my job is making me more depressed Hi guys, I've never posted here before so if I go off course let me know. So I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 18. I'm 27 now. It waxes and wanes a little bit. Right out of college it was the least symptomatic. I believe this is because right out of college I found a job in my field and then married my college girlfriend. Flash forward a year and I get laid off. The company goes belly up a very short time after. I was unemployed for a year. During this time, my depression started creeping back in, but I think this was because of the financial stress my wife and I were under. We worked through it as a team though and by some huge stroke of luck I found a job just a week before my unemployment was due to run out. This job is with an absolute giant in my field. They pay a lot more than anyone else I could reasonably get a job with would. I've been here a year now. However, there are a few problems. First it's a "contract" position that is completely open ended. Everyone starts as a contractor, sometimes for years, but it really sucks that when I get sick, I don't get paid. And, every 3 months they "review" my contract and that puts stress on me knowing at any time they could just axe me. The main thing though is the schedule. It is Tuesday through Saturday 3 PM to 1130 PM. This makes it very hard to see anyone, including my wife. My wife has to get up  very early for work (around 5) and she's gone when I wake up and asleep when I come home. Sunday is the only day to see each other. Also, I don't get to see my friends too often or my family.I think the lonliness is what is making me the most depressed right now. I just hang around with my cat all day waiting to go to work. Anyone have experience with this? [info] None [info] 1412187964
tanoren [info] Why is everyone so afraid of suicide and death? Hello. I've had depression and suicidal ideation for years now. I was diagnosed with depression at a young age and have had suicidal thoughts daily since I was around 9 or 10. Depression seems to just be something I will always live with; I don't remember a time it wasn't there. I would have gone through with my death years ago but those I love is what keeps stopping me along with the future. Up until this year, anyway. I met my goal of getting to college. I always meet my goals, even if it kills me; I lost over 50% of my hair my senior year of HS due to stress because I wanted to get an honors diploma last minute along with some very hard classes and taking care of my grandmother.Now the future is uncertain and I don't entirely want to be here to bear witness to it.To me, life only has purpose if you give it purpose; what that purpose is is at one's discretion. I don't see it.Suicide has always been a comfort to me. Why does everyone fear death? I don't see many asking that. The default response is always, "don't do that, it's bad!"... but why? There's many on this earth and I would only be missed for so long by the majority of people who know about me if at all. In the grand scheme of things, I don't really matter. And to me that's freeing. I just want to go. I'm tired of the fight. I feel like I'm only living for others even as I'm getting a near-full ride to uni for my own sake. [info] None [info] 1511672285

liliannereid [info] Any way to help people and not feel like you're dying inside? Hi! I'm an infp and I'm diagnosed with depression (and adhd). I love helping people and I feel like it's my life's purpose to do what I can do make the lives of others better... but the thing is that even though this is what I feel gives my life meaning, I really can't handle it. It always gets to a point where I'm completely drained and I end up spending weeks in bed, not being able to "give" anything, avoiding all contact with others. Is there any way that his can just *not* be like this? I'm asking here because I'm hoping somebody here recognises this and can give me some tips. Thank you for reading. [info] None [info] 1459203703
Zediac [info] Thanks, but I'll pass. I've been a psychiatrist and a therapist. I've been diagnosed with depression but so far nothing has helped. And there's so little options for mental health care in my area that even if I wanted to try again no one is taking new patients.Suicide isn't an option for me. My sense of self preservation is too high for that. I know myself. Maybe a little too well. But I know that this will never be an option for me.I've done a lot of talking over the years. I'm just tired of it all. I don't have the energy to talk anymore.Thank you. I mean it. But I'm not going to take you up on that offer. [info] None [info] 1473893555

adoboislife [info] I have been diagnosed with depression. I have tried and stopped taking anti-depressants because it made me feel kinda dead inside. I thought I was going alright and managing it well with regular counselling. Most days, i feel like I'm too busy to think about my feelings anyway. As long as I'm well enough to go to work, i soldier on with my full-time job. And when I'm not at work, i always try to keep a cheerful face for my daughter and husband. But today, I realised that maybe I'm not going as well as I thought because of a conversation I had with my 4-yo daughter while i driving with her this afternoon. We were silent most of the car ride, but out of the blue she suddenly blurted out," You know, Mommy, we should take care of other people." Surprised, I replied "Oh that's a kind thought sweetie. Yes, we should definitely take care of other people." Then she continued, "I wanna take care of you." Tickled by such thoughtfulness, I said "Thank you! I'd love for you to take care of me when I grow old." She went quiet for a few seconds and then said, " I wanna take care of you because you're sad." I said, "Sweetie, yes, Mommy is sad sometimes. But that's alright. It's normal to not be happy all the time." She responded, "Yeah, sometimes I get sad too... and sometimes I become angry.. and sometimes I'm happy... But mommy, you're always sad. And daddy is not always sad. I wanna make you happy." 😶😳😑(Sometimes I wonder if my kid is really an old lady trapped in 4 year-old's body.)Anyway, like a well-practiced spiel, I knew just how to change the topic when our conversation became awkward. I simply wiped the tears that almost instantly flowed from my eyes. But yeah, that's the most personal thing I can share with you today... the day i got caught by my kid.

Stevewoody82 [info] I’ve been where you are and I’ve come out the other side.There are a few things I can recommend 1, a label is optional. I was diagnosed with depression, ptsd, bi-Polar and said fuck it to all of them. I choose what I’m going to be, not a doctor.80% of mental illness starts with your thought patterns so control that and you stand a chance of winning. Yoga, meditation and Dota can help achieve this in moderation2, don’t feel sorry for yourself and don’t be a victim. Life is shit and it does not care for your emotions. Also people have there own shit so please learn to control your happiness and moral in other ways because relying on others can often disappoint.3, as mentioned above, moderate. Dota is fine as long as it’s not obsessive, like anything. Find balance. The gym will help and if you can’t afford it, simply go for a walk / run. It’s shit at first but the chemicals it releases will help combat the shitty feelings. Eat healthy, workout and play hard. That has helped me over the years.This community is the most loving and toxic I’ve ever encountered at the same time. Take what helps and leave the rest. Always here for a chat or to own your ass in a game ;)GL HF x [info] None [info] 1537275888
joeybuns [info] [Light] I went to therapy to help me my depression and it didn't help So 3 years ago when I was 16 I started going to therapy because I was diagnosed with depression and the doctors said I should go to YPAS (Young Person Advisory Service) which is to help kids &amp; teens deal with stuff such as depression, anger issues etc. Basically I get assigned my therapist who is in training and records are sessions. But it didn't help, every week I went there it just made me feel worse. And honestly my therapist was trying his best and was a nice fella and all but being in the vicinity of the building I dreaded, I would get buzzed in and would wait in a waiting room with other people who are in the same boat as me. So we'd sit down for the hour session I'd have every week and he'd start off by asking me how my week when I told him how I was basically failing at everything and how my family had their problems and how I wasn't every my ex gf etc. And then I would fill out some stupid form about how I would be feeling over the week.The form itself annoyed me it would give you a statement for example I was feeling restless this week and then you'd rate it one to five. Then after I finished the form we would talk about it for an hour. And we'd go back and forth and nothing really changed. I'd end up giving the same answers because of my routine with college nothing really changed eventually I fell behind with my work so much college basically gave me an ultimatum, my mental health or staying on the course I obviously opted to stay in the course.How I kinda got better was my friends at the time they helped me get out of it at the time because we made each other laugh anyway thanks for reading.

mscullin75 [info] Will probably get buried with all the comments but here we goTo put a timeline on this, I was a freshman offensive lineman at the University of Georgia and had enrolled in July of 2013 instead of the typical June with all the new athletes. I felt like this may have had contributed to a moment where I felt helpless and felt like taking my own life back in September of 2013. I said to my roommates "I felt like killing myself last night" and that obviously threw them for a whirl. As a result of this, I was forced by the athletic department to go to CAPS, our mental health and psychological program. During my first visit, I was diagnosed with depression. However, I didn't continue going to CAPS after that. I didn't want to talk to someone I didn't know about my issues. I didn't feel comfortable. My teammates told me "just be happy" numerous times and to this day I'm not sure if they realize that simply saying something like that doesn't make a depressed person feel better. I continued my freshman year of college feeling depressed in random, heavy swings to the point where on May 2nd of 2014, I tried to take my own life. I pulled a kitchen knife out of my kitchen drawer and tried as hard as I could to slit my wrists. I tried 5 or 6 times and I threw the knife down while crying. I realized I could learn how to control my depression swings by seeing the happiness in everything in life and realizing that I could tackle anything I put my mind to. For the next year I had to wake up every day with the mentality that nothing was going to stop me and that helped me so much with dealing with depression. The last few months of my 5th year of school, I'd gotten very frequent, but lighter depression swings. I say lighter because learning how to control it feels like a superpower. I'm going to get depressed but knowing I will not take my own life from this Earth is a very powerful feeling. To know that you can see happiness in any miniscule thing is one of the biggest things I've learned while dealing with depression. To this day, I still have that knife and I still cook with it. Yes, it probably seems sick to keep it and do something like that, but it helps me have "power" over how I tried to take my own life. Like I said, I still struggle to this day with depression, but it's learning how to deal with it that gets me through each and every day. I actually just moved to a new town and I feel quite happy with where I am in life.  [info] None [info] 1528476522
LoveDemNuts [info] I was 22 when I was diagnosed with depression now I am 27, I avoided meds since they made me feel like I was weak, so I avoided them for years and essentially was a low functioning depressed personMy experience has been that I tried meds when I finally hit the lowest low I could, i felt completely hopeless and excited to end it. To this day I have never regretted trying meds, I only disliked that it took me this long to finally have some happy moments in lifeI’m sorry meds haven’t worked for your mother and friends, I’ll say for myself it’s all depending on the user, some drugs will be like night and day difference whereas others won’t work for you at all.The best advice I could give is at least try some, since depression fucking sucks! what do you have to lose? Even if they don’t work and you have to try another, I think it’s better than living each day in a dread Also with your age you could be able to get a good handle on this early!

avacatt [info] This was helpful. I wish someone had told me when I was younger that my high processed high carb diet was contributing to my hormonal imbalance. No one did, not even my endo who diagnosed me with it in the first place. I was diagnosed with depression but I started to realize that my hormones had an effect on my mood, not my brain chemistry. So the SSRI's I took I feel like didn't treat the root of the problem. Not even my psychiatrist asked me anything about my hormones even though hormonal imbalance is such a big contributer to PMDD and mood issues.I notice my mood issues and depression get worse when I'm eating bread, pasta, high GI. So I am laying off that for now and I see such a huge improvement. I just don't think some people's bodies were meant for those foods.Aside from that, I did want to also mention that while diet is extremely important, so is dealing with past traumas that can also lead to actual hormonal change. I had really low self esteem as a result of a bad upbringing and I know that in addition to diet I also have to heal from my past. [info] None [info] 1507656891

callesucia [info] Studying abroad and depression finally hit So I was diagnosed with depression about four years ago and in that period of time I've had my ups and downs. From wanting to kill myself (just mild suicidal thoughts) to being extremely happy. I've learned to handle my depression with a routine of work, study, running and reading. And it worked, until I'm six months in studying in Argentina.I came over with friends, and made a couple of new ones. Days were pure fun and joy. Classes started and I started working in a kitchen, which I found out I loved. I had a small fling with a coworker and life seemed to be incredible, it seemed like I could get everything I wanted out of it. Couple of months go by and due to the economical situation of the country, the restaurant I worked at closes and I'm out of a job. I thought not working would be like it was when I first came, but my friends have remade their lives, they have found partners and even though we all sleep in the same room we barely talk. I guess their lives continued and mine went back. The girl I was seeing moved to Brazil, and well, I really don't know what to do from here. Last couple of weeks have found me in some pretty dark places. Not the darkest I've ever been, but pretty dark. Some sadness falls over me and I can't seem to get it off me, even though I can't find a reason why. I'm guessing it comes from feeling lonely now that my friends spend their time with their SO and I'm just, you know, alone. I've lost my ability and desire to interact with other people, and when I find the strenght to go out I just walk and walk and I do feel better, but that only lasts a bit. I know I have to go out and do things by myself, experience new things, meet new people, but I don't seem to be able to get myself to do that. Even if I went out to a bar or something, I think I'd just sit in a corner, drinking. At this point I think I actually am a bit afraid of strangers.Since I was diagnosed with depression I've been taking 20mg of Lexapro daily, and still do, consistently, but I'm not sure it's been helping a lot lately.

Well isn't that nice to know it's over once it comes out of your ass.

SparklingLimeade [info] This outlook has always baffled me. Happiness and sadness to me are like light and darkness. Darkness means there's no light now but it doesn't take away anything and it doesn't preclude the existence of light in the future. Do you seriously believe that there will be nothing pleasant for the rest of your natural life? I was diagnosed with depression and I still never wanted to end anything. Sometimes I want to sleep till things get better but I always anticipate that there's another shit and a giggle somewhere in the world. If you have a problem in this area I recommend professional help. I don't know why it works but it helped in my case.Friends can be difficult. How long *exactly* have you been trying? How well traveled are you? Where have you looked? I moved around quite a bit and usually found a few people who were good for spending time with. Sometimes I didn't though. Didn't meet anybody really interesting till college. Those are good for finding interesting people. Go to some meetings and hang out. Get comfortable. See how it goes. Alternatively, I find the internet to be a pretty cool place. Make some friends regardless of distance. Many online communities (reddit included) are full of friendly strangers and at times I prefer that odd openness that comes with anonymity.You could also just say "to hell with people" and be a hermit. Chill out and do your thing. Get into your hobbies and go out only when necessary if that's what works for you. Some people pull that off and I've enjoyed the occasional bout of solitude. Especially now that we have the internet to balance that out I think there's a lot of opportunity to lead a balanced life with minimal human contact.tl;dr: Get professional help for serious issues. Making friends is tough but doable. It's also optional though. Hobbies are good. [info] INTP [info] 1483620019

Dying_Letective [info] First time here, sorry if it's trash. I've been diagnosed with depression for about 1.5 years. I used to be going to school everyday, and had a successful year last year.But then everything crumbled like the ruins of an ancient clay tower. The one friend I opened up to had moved away to a different school district. My brother was still stuck in the Marines for even longer than we thought, another brother moved out of the house and got stolen away by his girlfriend, and my sister is always busy with work now.A struggle to find a reason to do anything now. Everything just seems to be a gray blob, and I'm expected to build a cathedral out of it. I haven't brushed my teeth in weeks, and instead just chew gum to make up for not brushing them. I'm always tired and never have energy. I always am relying on my mother and other people to make up for my shortcomings. Everything just seems like there's no use to even try doing it. And even if I do try feels like the only thing I can do is fail.When I'm talking to people I'm always known as the happy one, the one who's always trying to make everyone cheer up and always is there for you, but I think what I need is just a duplicate of me to do that for myself. I crave attention and affection from other people to make up for the fact that I can't do that for myself. Depression has taken every chance of a good life and has turned it into another reason to die. I'm at home right now and I still feel like I want to go home. I want to have that feeling of finally being done with everything and being able to finally relax and just collapse. I had built an entire pyramid of friendships and a social life but instead of being able to maintain that, I've pushed myself away from others. I only have one person that I consider a friend now and I don't even know what their name is in real life. The only thing I know about them is their gamertag. They're the only person that I actually want to talk to you and miss being around whenever I don't get to hang out with them. I feel really stupid now that I'm actually typing all of this out but I guess it was good to admit all of this? I'll admit I did give me a feeling of relief to just get everything that's been on my mind out onto something. [info] None [info] 1572877690

mylifeisanocean [info] one day of several feeling depressed. Watching "veronica decides to die" Been NC since last august. Ok, my Nmom did visit me twice just to see her grandson.Now depressed..again, been for 10 years.Has anyone seen the movie "veronica decides to die"? Watching it now. I feel jealous. Jealous that she had the meds to try suicide. And especially jealous that in the movie she has such loving parents who would put her into a good hospital and visited her.My dad visited me once when I was diagnosed with depression to cheer me up. He took me to a cafeteria and we had a walk in the city. That was 11 years ago. Nmom has never showed me any feelings. [info] None [info] 1467226305
Don_Balon [info] &gt;The Tottenham full\-back, 27, made the admission in a frank interview with several national newspapers.  &gt;  &gt;"It's no secret that I've been through a testing time at Tottenham this season," said Rose.  &gt;  &gt;"It led to me seeing a psychologist and I was diagnosed with depression, which nobody knows about."  &gt;  &gt;He added: "I haven't told my mum or my dad, and they are probably going to be really angry reading this, but I've kept it to myself until now."  &gt;  &gt;Rose said the treatment of a knee injury sustained in January 2017 \- which saw him sidelined for eight months \- was the start of a period of personal turmoil.  &gt;  &gt;"My uncle killed himself in the middle of my rehab, and that triggered the depression as well," Rose said.  &gt;  &gt;"Off the field there have been other incidents: back home in August my mum was racially abused in Doncaster. She was very angry and upset about it, and **then someone came to the house and nearly shot my brother in the face \- a gun was fired at my house.**  &gt;  &gt;"England has been my salvation and I can't thank the manager and the medical staff enough. It was really hard, and being referred to a doctor and psychologist by the Spurs club doctor helped me massively to cope." [info] None [info] 1528322832
waterisue [info] It can  happen. My doctor, who was already pretty shitty and which I wanted to switch anyway, didnt take me seriously at all anymore when I told him that I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD. Like I was reporting serious physical symptoms and instead of clearing that up ir sending me to a specialist, they send me to a neurologist. They didnt even seem to believe my diagnosis, eventhough I told them it was from an ADHD specialist. They started talking to me as if I was intellectually inferior. After I inquired wether he did it because I just told him I have ADHD he gave me very patronizing non-compliments along the lines of "I think you are a very special person who does think alot about alot of things". It sounded like cheap copy pasta and I was insulted that he thought I was too stupid to see through it. I haven't been at the doctor simce then, but when I do, I won't get around looking for a new one [info] None [info] 1544295251
tjenator [info] Hey y'all, maybe not the right place to post this, but I recently got some bloodwork done. I'm 19, and my test levels came back at 390 ng/dl, which does fall within normal range. However, I've always had trouble losing weight, I've been diagnosed with depression, and I am pretty constantly tired. I figured it was just a luck of the draw thing, but I was comparing my levels to my mother and father for fun, and my test is about 150 ng/dl below my fathers. He's 43 and pretty overweight, so this is rather frustrating to me. So my question is: Should I consider testosterone supplementation, whether through a doctor or on my own?Additional relevant information: I haven't grown in 4 years now, so I figure I'm pretty much done.

jld2k6 [info] The hell are you talking about? lol. I did NOT KNOW I was going through opiate withdrawal. You think I went and put myself in a psych ward to hide the fact that I was doing opiates a few times a week? What you are saying is just not making sense because I was put in the psych ward against my will based on a statement I said that they construed as suicidal. Because of that statement, I was diagnosed with depression and forced to seek treatment for depression while in there. What does that have to do with the fact that I chose not to tell them about doing opiates a couple days beforehand? If I would have known I was feeling the way I was because of the opiates I would have taken the proper steps to remedy the issue, which is exactly what I did when I figured all of that out. Edit: If you are amazed that somebody lied to a doctor about their drug use, when even a marijuana user can be fucked by telling a doctor he uses it, you must be a very very sheltered person to think my situation is insane lol.The situation was not created by my lying either. It was created because of my statement that if God does not exist it wouldn't really matter if you just drove your car into a tree because you won't know any different in the end. This statement was created by the opiate withdrawal which if you want to look at it is what caused me to end up in the ward. Even if I told them I did opiates 2 days before visiting them I would have still ended up in the psych ward because of the statement I made. I don't know if you are reading some part of my story wrong or what but your reaction is just not making much sense to me lol.   [info] None [info] 1388748330
Cumdumpster71 [info] I was diagnosed with depression and was put on a variety of medications for years (none worked). I just forced myself to overanalyze why I feel bad, and usually I have a thousand reasons (almost none of which are pertinent to the moment). So although I still don't feel good, I have mental tricks to help me when I'm feeling really bad: I just tell myself my issue is a physiological one and that I'm coming up with excuses to justify it.I'm not trying to say that your issue isn't a big deal because it really is. I'm just saying what has helped me personally and hope it may help others as well. [info] None [info] 1508627632

Tobizz3 [info] I’m sorry that happened, but I’m glad you “chose” to leave. I went through something really similar. When I started a new study I moved in with 2 classmates I barely knew. They turned out to be assholes, and that was also when I was diagnosed with depression (not because of them necessarily). I left. They scammed me for a couple hundred bucks though, just because they could. A couple years later I’ve now found a study subject which I love, and I’ve surrounded myself with people I click with. I’ve been very cautious about not attracting the wrong kind of person again. My social life determines a lot for me, I’ve come to see. I hope you find something you really enjoy doing. And I hope the people you meet will be different from the ones you’ve had to deal with. All the best! [info] None [info] 1522250566
Netflixandzzz [info] 1 year, 2019 can F off now! 2019 has been my worst year ever. I tore the ligaments in my foot in February and its only just starting to be pain free. I had to give up yoga because it was too painful on my ankle. My knees are shot and cause me pain daily. My allergies got worse and worse, and the allergy clinic I've been to all year informed me their medication didn't work on me. I have marriage problems and I was diagnosed with depression 2 weeks ago.But through it all, I haven't had a single drink. I batted off naysayers, friends questioning my motives, accusations and rude comments. I battled with the idea of downplaying my drinking or being honest about how it was a problem.Exactly 1 year ago today I made the decision to never touch a drink again. I got lucky, it's been a pretty easy non drinking year, but hard in every other way.Thank you all for those that helped here, thank you for not judging and being a safe space. Good luck to everyone starting their journey today after a rough Christmas, I feel ya buddy. And to everyone else who's got days, weeks, months or years under their belt, I'm proud of you.

hazzeFox [info] Drank yesterday while on Zoloft (sertraline 50mg) I was diagnosed with depression about two months ago, and I was prescribed Zoloft 50mg, which I've been taking for exactly 8 weeks now. Since day one on Zoloft, I literally ceased to take any other drugs (in my case: weed, alcohol, and Xanax for occasional panic attacks I used to have), and the ONLY drug I've used in the last 8 weeks was Zoloft itself.&amp;#x200B;But yesterday was my friend's birthday, and she decided to prepare a special cocktail with chocolate, sugar, and an alcoholic beverage (in this case Japanese sake, with about 14% alcohol) that she had in her house. She's been telling me about that special drink she likes since last year, but we never actually prepared it, until yesterday. I reallyyyy wanted to drink it and taste it for the 1st time, so I googled a lot about whether it was safe or not to drink any alcohol while on Zoloft, and pretty much all medical websites said it was "safe", although advising against excessive drinking, since it could lead to blackouts or memory loss way faster than if I wasn't taking the antidepressant.&amp;#x200B;I only drank one glass of it (slowly), and then I ate pizza and drank soda afterwards, which I believe helps "eliminating" alcohol better from my organism, than if my stomach was empty for example. I didn't feel anything bad, or even dizzy or sleepy, in fact I was fine and I'm still completely fine right now (physically), but as the overthinking person that I am, I'm kinda anxious that somehow that bit of alcohol could "worsen" my depression or delay the treatment. Am I just worrying too much? I don't really plan on drinking again, nor using any other drugs during the treatment. [info] None [info] 1554023308

F22man [info] Started talking to myself positively. I used to always make self-deprecating jokes and they were genuinely funny to me, but people start to see you as that person who hates themselves and it gets old. I stopped doing that and my confidence has shot up *so* much. People actually come to me first about hanging out or just messaging about things. Its a massive 180 from the beginning of this year. I was diagnosed with depression and struggled with it for so, so long (there's probably traces in my comment/post history somewhere), but talking to myself different and accepting me for who I am, being proud of my likes and interests has made people wanna be around me. I spread positivity and think things out and try to give equal respect to everyone. Basically, be a positive influence on the people around you, and they will want to be around you more. Make them happy and and they'll do the same.  [info] None [info] 1542972172

ohnothebanjo [info] I don’t want to be dealing with this illness anymore. Background: I was diagnosed with depression at age 13, but the doctor who diagnosed me expressed that I had depression probably before that. I remember feeling symptoms of depression since about age 10/11. I used to self harm between ages 12-14, along with suicidal thoughts. Long story short, I was talking to my mom and the conversation led to mental health. She obviously knows about my depression but because I haven’t expressed my thoughts to her, she thought I was getting better. I haven’t, I just haven’t told anyone. I tried to get help by telling her that it’s getting bad again but she refused to hear me out. This made me realize that I have no one to talk to about this. I have no friends left who care about me that much, my parents will just judge me and say that feeling depressed like this is a sin. I’m not in a romantic relationship either so I have no significant other to go to. I have no one. Even if I did, no one would understand this. I’m so tired of having depression. I have been struggling for 7-8 years. It has stolen all of my teenage years and a large portion of my childhood. I have no option to get better, I’m stuck. My parents refuse to send me to a medical professional to seek treatment. They can’t afford it and neither can I by myself. There’s no hope for me. [info] None [info] 1561977384
Useful_Atmosphere [info] Alright mates listen up This is a post about depression inspired by a post saying you aren't depressed unless you are diagnosed. For those who care I was diagnosed with depression like 4 years ago. And I gotta say, when I got diagnosed, nothing changed, I still felt like shit, I just knew why.Now depression isn't something that can be scaled, it is different for everyone. And effects each of us in different ways. To say someone can't be depressed because they aren't diagnosed is bullshit. It's like saying you can't have a disease without being diagnosed. Now I will admit some people go too far and say they are depressed when they are only sad. But that isn't a reason to disregard everyone else's feelings. If you feel depressed, then you might have depression. Just cause you aren't diagnosed doesn't make your feelings false [info] 16 [info] 1547978510
MishakovPoeziya [info] I've been diagnosed with depression for ~8 years now, since I was about 12, but I've had symptoms since around age 9. It fucked with the way my brain developed, big time. I had no sense of self worth or self preservation growing up, and that lead me to surround myself with some really terrible people, because I genuinely believed I deserved mistreatment. There was a long while where I only justified keeping myself alive so that I could make others smile. I thought that was my purpose in life, and because I based my self worth on how happy the people around me were, the fact that I surrounded myself with people who did everything to self destruct and take me down with them was doubly hard on my mental health.Because of that, as well as the fact that I was dealing with being closeted and trying to cope with an undiagnosed eating disorder, between ages 13 and 18 I had probably 10 suicide attempts, 3 of which lead to hospitalization, and 2 of which were very nearly successful.*"How are you?"* is kind of a loaded question when dealing with depression, honestly, because there are definitely good days and bad days, but I'm so, so much better than I was as a teenager. I still *have* depression, but I'm no longer suicidal, and I've actually been clean from self harm for a little over two years now. Getting rid of the toxic, manipulative people in my life has been integral to my recovery, but it was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, because despite what they'd put me through, both intentionally and unintentionally, I still loved those people a lot. Therapy has helped me realize that I have worth outside of what I can do for other people, and that I deserve the same kindness I extend to others! It's been a steep uphill battle, but I can see myself with a future, now, and I have a very kind, loving social circle, who I adore to the ends of the earth.To anyone still in the throes of dealing with depression, dear god, despite how overused this phrase is, it really does get better. It might be the hardest thing you ever do, and it might hurt like hell, but it is so fucking worth it. I'm so grateful I didn't die, because if I had, I'd have never known what it means to be happy.

AnxiousIntender [info] When does it get better? You know, the old saying goes "It gets better". But when? I've seen many others who have suffered for years and it's been one and a half years for me since I felt like I have depression for the first time. I was diagnosed with depression soon after, and I'm still receiving medication and therapy.But when I take my meds, it's just like drinking water. It doesn't help at all. The psychiatrist keeps increasing the dose and prescribing new meds but at the best case, all I get is drowsiness as a side-effect.Also therapy feels like a waste of time and money, because all I do is talk but the stuff my therapist tells me is nothing new. She just says "Don't worry about the outcome, tell yourself 'I'll do it'." or stuff like "It can't be too bad if you fail, can it?" or "Don't be a perfectionist and stop thinking in black and white". It kind of helped once, when I had to get some text printed, but I still can't talk to people casually (or do anything that requires self-confidence).Finally, it was my aunt who got me to start  getting help. I couldn't talk to mom or dad because they always said "Think positively" or "It's just a phase". Well, my aunt also had depression, and hers was severe depression while mine is just mild depression and she got over it in one and a half years with medication only, no therapy or whatsoever. And here I am still struggling with "mild" depression with medication AND therapy yet I still can't get over it.I'm losing hope and getting more suicidal day by day (though I really don't wanna kill myself, at least while my parents are alive), so here is the question: When does it get better?

AnimeGurl678 [info] Well, I personally think that depression isn’t about a person’s mental state but rather the state of society. With political correctness on the high, you can’t hurt anyone’s feelings, leading to society not being able to cope with life. This was normal decades ago, which led to people easily able to overcome it because they weren’t constantly getting *depression* drilled into their head. Now you are expected to show emotion (which is not a bad thing)  but in this case it isn’t just showing it, but making it and excuse for feeling down all the time. And, before anyone asks, I have been diagnosed with depression, I have a fascination with history and psychology, and I have explained this stuff to other people who have depression, and it has helped them overcome it by realising that everyone else has gone trough, is going through, or will go through the exact same thing.

anjewthebearjew [info] Long time lurker, finally posting. Hey everyone! I just wanted to post and yell about my experience.I have known I was bisexual since I was 14, I am now thirty. I have hidden this fact for over half my life. Recently a lot of things fell apart for me...jobs...housing..etc. It was all due to problems from substance abuse.I finally decided to seek help and I've been in a substance abuse treatment center in Alabama since August 4th. There I was diagnosed with depression and finally got on the right medication. The counselors there have been so wonderful. They encouraged me to change...be honest...hold no secrets.Since I told the counselors I was bi I was slowly emboldened and accepting myselc. Then I told the community in the inpatient facility I was at. Then my family and friends. Everyone so far has been supportive and I haven't noticed any different treatment.After I get out of treatment here on Oct 12th I'll be going to live in a sober living facility in Pensacola, FL. I am finally looking forward to a sober life where I can be myself. I will be back at the treatment facility tonight...I'm on a weekend pass until then. I will have to give up my cell phone but until then I can chat if you like.Thanks to this community for all the insight I've gained from lurking and I hope to contribute more in the future!

preternaturous [info] I need to rant, and only you girls have the potential to understand... First off, this will probably end up a pity party. I don't want it to end up that way, but it probably will, so I'm sorry. Some important info first: I was diagnosed with depression a little over a year ago, and I began taking medicine for it. My counselor advised that since the meds were working so well, I should try tapering off and seeing if I'm feeling better without them. I was. So I haven't taken my meds in months. Like 6-8 to be exact. But in the past couple days (mostly last night) my depression hit hard.Here's what's up. First off, I feel like I'll never belong anywhere. I was actually hanging out with my gay friend the other day and some of her friends, and without knowing me, the topic of transgenderism came up, and that led to crossdressing. What I never realized was how much resentment there was towards crossdressers. I mean, I've experienced the alienation first hand before, but not like this. Apparently, crossdressing is "transgenderism's bastard child." I don't fit in with gays because I'm not gay. I don't fit in with lesbians because I'm not actually a girl. I don't fit in with cis-gendered people because I obviously have some sort of gender issue that borders on dysphoria, but I don't fit in with transgendered folks either cause I don't make the full time commitment to get a sex change. I feel like I'll never belong with anyone. And my girlfriend has been trying to help, but honestly, she'll never truly understand how I feel. No one will. Except for you girls and others like me, but that doesn't help cause I only know you girls through reddit and the internet and that just isn't the same. It's like being an astronaut all alone in a module through space. I mean, sure I can radio home and talk to people over the comm. But I'll still go crazy from loneliness cause there's no one physically here. I just feel like I'll always be alone.Furthermore, I feel like I'll never be truly happy. I mean, I'm in a lot of financial trouble which I'm working hard at, and it seemed like I was going to finally get it fixed, but then Sallie Mae contacted me and now it's like, no matter how far ahead I get, something else will show up to ruin it. I'm in the running for an awesome teaching job that would pay really well, be a very nice launching point to get into the career path I choose and would overall turn my whole life around and make me happy, but there's one teacher who could (and probably will) ruin this chance for me, just cause she doesn't like me that much. I feel like none of my friends are truly my friends. I mean, they all know about me and my crossdressing. And some are okay with it. But most of the time, I still have to hid it because they're all, "You crossdress. That's fine. I don't care. But I don't want to talk about it or see it, so never bring it up."I'm unhappy with my body. I haven't dressed up in 4 months and it's incredibly stressing not to, but I can't enjoy it if I do, because the whole point of doing it is to feel attractive and fool people into thinking I'm actually a girl, and with my body the way it currently is, I can't do that, so I refuse to dress up, cause it'll only make me more upset. I have a plan to fix my body and get into shape, but I just can't stay motivated to do what's right and keep me happy, so I keep falling into bad habits and take the easy way out which depresses me more.I feel like I'll never attain any of the goals or wishes I have for myself. I just can't do anything right, ever.I guess the bottom line is, I'm so depressed, that I'm at the point where I would honestly commit suicide to escape, cause I feel it's the only way. But I can't even do that because I'm too much of a coward to take the coward's way out. I'm too afraid of pain and death to do it, so I'm just condemning myself to a life of loneliness, pain, and misery. A torturous existence like that of the Greek Titans Atlas and Prometheus.Anyway, I apologize if it sounds like I just want you all to tell me how great I am. Cause I don't. That's not the point of this, truly. I just have all these depressing thoughts in my head, and although they'll never truly leave, I still needed to get them out somehow.

I've took my life where I wanted it to go, I'm paid enough to never have to worry about my financial situation, I have an amazing partner and I'm starting to get into shape, if I starve myself for a week you can even see a hint of a 6 pack (don't do that). But I'm fucking exhausted, and there is just nothing I can do about it. I just want to sleep constantly and when I do it doesn't help. I feel like I'm getting trolled here. two decades of not feeling happiness and when I finally get to a point to do it my body is like "´Well, we can't have that". It feels like a betrayal tbh.

GotThatBass [info] To me, the reason why I started listening to “sad” music (to me it was goth, metal, emo, rock etc) is because I could relate to it.

pm_me_Spidey_memes [info] Fucking preach brother. I was diagnosed with depression years ago and that diagnosis changed my entire outlook on life. I told myself I could beat it. I told myself that from then on I’d do my absolute best to only do things that make me happy. I’m doing that now, I’m off meds, I’m happy and content. I found a job that I love, a place I like to live, doing extra-curricular activities that I love. I changed my life around and it seriously helped ME. I’m never going to say that this is the solution for everyone, but like you said, I’d rather be out finding and doing the things I love than sitting inside playing video games all day feeling sorry for myself.

MaronaPossessed [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was 12. You don't have to ask your parents if you don't want to. There are people at pharmacies, emergency rooms, and government facilities. Depression is no laughing joke or something to brush aside. Of course, there aren't any over-the-counter stuff.

Zero9194 [info] I was diagnosed with depression and I wouldn’t say I feel sad, I honestly just feel nothing. Sometimes I feel sad because I never feel happy and feel like I’m missing out, but that’s not directly caused by the depression. I don’t enjoy doing things and am tired all day for no apparent reason. The worst part is how difficult I find it to do the smallest of task due to how low energy I am and my lack of tolerance for the most minor of inconveniences. [info] None [info] 1556121640
puremystique [info] I know I'm ruining my family relationships coz of my anger but I just can't stop A little bit about me, I was diagnosed with depression this year once I realised that I was getting sad a lot more frequently with it being more pronounced. A lot of it stems from bring an emotional kid (crying EVERY day over the littlest things) and being told to just stop crying in high school or I'll get bullied.So, I did just that and bottled up all my emotions for the past 9 years, with me just about to finish uni this semester. However, this year I've been losing all my distractions that have let me ignore my emotions, as I'm no longer enjoying my studies which has forced me to confront my actual feelings.Unfortunately, for the past 9 years I've got it stuck in my head that showing any emotion is a weakness. Any form of vulnerability is a weakness. Standing down from your views (no matter how wrong) is a weakness. And thus I have become so much more defensive and instead of simply crying, my first response to anything I don't agree with/anything that upsets me is to express myself with anger and then cry.I have hurt my family's feelings on so many different occasions with my outbursts, saying things I don't mean but strangely feeling a need to stick by what I said because "I don't want to be proven wrong and back down". Even today I had a disagreement and called 3 of my family members idiots, even though I couldn't properly come up with a coherent sentence. Like, I know what's going on in my head but I can't tell them properly coz I'm getting upset and angry. In turn, I feel like they aren't properly listening or understanding what I'm saying and are just using any attempt to belittle me. Was I in the wrong for calling them idiots and making them upset with me? Of course I was. But I can't apologise to them coz I've got too much of this stupid pride in not wanting to back down. I feel like every argument I'm having with them is fracturing my relationships with them, but I just can't stop. I constantly think that maybe it'd be best to move out of home even though I have next to no money because I'm hurting them. But in the same token I am twisted in thinking that I should move out as that will hurt them too. I don't really want to hurt them, I love my family to pieces and I know they care for and are worried about me, but I don't know how to stop getting angry all the time. I just don't know what to do.Sorry for the rant, I've just had a very emotional day today. [info] None [info] 1564927466
We_so_pro492 [info] 2019 has been the best year of my life. As of today I am officially a 17 year old male and a lot has happened in this year in particular that has made my life worth living. In 2017 I was diagnosed with depression. I hated my life and wanted to die at times I didn’t have many true friends. I am an athlete but I never felt like I belonged in the popular group. I was always kind a troubled kid and got in trouble a lot. When I figured out that we were moving to a different state in 2018 because of my dads job I was completely crushed because I thought it could only get worse. I moved after Christmas time and was really nervous. The high school I was going to previously had about 1,000 kids and the school I was moving to had double that amount. When I first moved I was so nervous that I would make one mistake and mess it all up again. I met this kid my age let’s call him Peyton. He was really popular and had a lot of friends. After about a week I kinda mended into his group. It was the popular group I thought they just let me in so I didn’t feel bad. I started getting invitations to party’s. But foolishly I was to sceptic to go to any of them. A few more months past and it was about the end of the school year and I started feeling more happy overall and I started to remember what being happy felt like. Summer time came like a lion and before I knew it I was hanging out almost every day with my friend’s. We were going to party’s going to the beach and I was having the most fun I ever had. It was nearly the end of summer and I could officially say I had beat depression. Football started and I was hyped. During school I was opening up to more people and getting to know everyone. During the middle of the season I had a massive crush on this cute girl I had known for a while at that point. I built up the courage to ask her out to homecoming and she said yes. I was so excited my legs about gave out I went home that night feeling like I’ve done it. We started talking on Snapchat and she admitted that she had liked me for a while and my heart about beat out of my chest. We went to homecoming and dancing with here was the best time of my life. We continued dating through the rest of the football season. My team made it to playoffs and lost. I felt like it was my fault and that I had failed my team. But out of anyone I knew my girlfriend was there for me the most. I knew then that I wanted to marry this girl. Wrestling season started and we began getting more serious about us. Just this week I lost my virginity to this girl. I feel that this year saved me if it weren’t for Peyton,my girlfriend,my team and all my friend’s I probably wouldn’t be here today. To everyone who has ever supported me I thank you for giving my life purpose again. 2019 has been the best year of my life. Thank you all so much for reading this. [info] 16 [info] 1574031491
ganzas [info] Hey OP :) I get the feeling. If it's ok with you, I'd like to share my story. My hope is that my experience will give you the hope that you're not alone in the struggle to live your life. I see you.My experience I've been in therapy off and on for years. I finally found a therapist that I was able to work with about 2 years ago, and I'm still with her (1 hour a week). I've been diagnosed with depression and ADHD-PI, but at one point or another I might've fit the bill for a lot of other things as well. I also take medication. Duloxetine (cymbalta) 60mg, and atomoxetine (straterra) 80mg. I've been on one medication or another for about 7 years now. I've been on this current combination for over three years though, because it helped me through period in my life where I was falling down a mental black hole. I mention all of this because I wanted to say that I get the desire to avoid medication. I'm not a fan of a lot of it: the payments, the scheduled check-ins, the questions it leaves me about my worth and abilities as a person. BUT. I wouldn't change it for myself, personally. Where I was in my life, medication saved me. And although part of me wishes that I didn't take it, part of me also knows that there's nothing inherently wrong with medication. "If you can't make your own serotonin, store-bought is fine"That is not to say that medication was or is the only thing I needed. Ultimately, my life didn't get *better* (as opposed to circling the drain) until I started doing the work of therapy, trusting myself and my therapist. I was in a holding pattern until I committed to the process of sharing with  my therapist and trusting their intentions and ability to be kind. I hope that you're experiencing this as well :) it sounds like your path might've been the opposite of mine: where I relied on medication to do the work, you're trying to "run with a broken leg or sprained ankle" perhaps?On side effectsIf you're worried about side-effects, and that's what's preventing you from trying different depression or GAD-related medications, this is understandable and normal. Side effects aren't what you're looking for, and dealing with them can be really scary and consuming. But if you have a good support network, they will help you through this. They will help you find something that you can live with. For example, I put up with stimulant-related ADHD meds in high school, and I had really bad nausea for years because of it. Eventually, with the support of my therapist who validated my desire to not feel that side-effect any more, I had the strength to mention it to my prescribing doctor. With their support and medical knowledge, we instantly switched to a non-stimulant medication. I no longer throw up every morning now, haha. And I still have the medical benefits I was hoping for. Have you heard the comparisons made between mental health and physical health? It goes something like this: if you had a fever, you might try to wait it out. But if things don't get better within three days, you see a doctor and try some medications for it. In the same vein, I think that if you're struggling, trying to improve your situation yourself (and even with a therapist) is good. But if the problem persists, it's ok to need a boost.Kindness for yourselfI'm glad that you find your therapist wonderful, and are seeing results :) as soon as I found one that I was comfortable with, I started seeing differences too. My personal trauma that I'm working through is quite embedded, so I've been cautioned repeatedly that it might take years to want to put the past behind me. I don't know your situation, but I do want to offer the same idea: patience and time, with kindness and thoughtfulness from your support network, will do wonders. Be gentle with yourself. I believe that forgiveness from ourselves can change the way relate to ourselves. It's ok to feel numb; you're doing a lot of emotional work right now, and it's hard. I can't even begin to write down how hard it is to see ourselves. And it's ok to want something more from life; you deserve a rich and satisfying life with joy and beauty.

Dogeek [info] I don't think this is BD related, but is there a correlation between the time required to ejaculate, and depression? So, I've been diagnosed with depression last September, and I've always had trouble to cum, even by myself I'd easily last 45-90 minutes. When I started taking my medicine for my depression (escitalopram aka seroplex) I began to last even longer, which was very annoying. Now, I've stopped taking my medication as I don't feel I need it anymore, I'm not happy per se, but I don't wanna kill myself every day. The thing I've noticed though, is that I'm much quicker on the trigger, I lasted only a few seconds inside a woman last night (the whole ordeal took around 30 minutes, as I love foreplay, and we even did some outercourse which was quite stimulating), therefore I'm wondering if there's indeed a correlation between my now premature ejaculation and depression?I have a theory that could corroborate this hypothesis. Given that depression inhibits serotonin and dopamin production, and that serotonin I think is part of the equation to trigger ejaculation, there might be a link. And for the medication that slowed me down even more, the escitalopram, maybe it triggers unnatural increased serotonin levels, up to a cap that the body has trouble going over to trigger ejaculation? I don't really know, and I'd love to hear your thoughts. [info] BPEL : 7.5" x 6.7" (19cm x 17cm) BPFL : 4.72" [info] 1494064583
Drama_Dairy [info] Nah, it's not about the dogs, my friend, though I thank you for your kind suggestion. My dad died some years ago, and she never really recovered from the loss. She just gets more and more depressed and bitter these days, and she's leaving the house less and not taking care of herself. She has all the hallmark signs of depression, but she refuses to get help for it, even with me offering to pay for it and take her to her sessions. :( It's killing me to see her degenerate like this, and I really don't know what to do about it. The weird thing is that she was all about getting me treatment when I was diagnosed with depression as a child, but when it comes to herself, it's like she has blinders on. She's even gone so far as to comment on the fact that my grandmother (her mother) has depression and needs to get help for it, but we can always see other people's blemishes before we see our own, I suppose. I can't leave her alone, because I know it would spiral her down even further if I did, and I'm the only one who can convince her to go out and do anything.Sorry to unload my problems on you, mate. You're just trying to be helpful, but I don't want to take advantage of your kindness like this. It all just started spilling out before I knew what was happening, lol. I'll figure something out. I can't *force* her to get help, but maybe I can find another way to get her to help herself. [info] None [info] 1528750765
bh_bohrium [info] First thing to say: I promise it will get better. Life always does. That may sound corny but please, hang in there, it will be ok in the end. When I was younger, I was diagnosed with depression.

Just be positive, and handle each day as they come. [info] None [info] 1557173236
pickadillybeans [info] I think depression is a wound that stays with you for life So I was diagnosed with depression in my early 20's, so about 10 years ago. Since then I've vowed to find the source of it and to overcome it. I've been through cognitive therapy, psychotherapy, spiritual healing, am dealing with childhood trauma, and am working on earning my major in psychology. I study the brain everyday. I have an extensive knowledge on healing, and most of the time I am a happy and functioning individual, and I consider myself (for the most part healed). But, then there are those days. Those days when you wonder what you're doing it all for. Does anything matter? Do you matter? The days when we retreat from everyone else because their reality is happiness, a reality far from your own. Your bed beacons you  like a long lost lover and whispers  to you to close the blinds, and promises you comfort so you can weep in silence. And on those days, all the healing I know, I seem to lack the strength to practice it. This depression is like a dark entity that comes and goes as he pleases and blindsides you just when you think you're on top of the world. [info] None [info] 1486421761

I have explosive anger and I've lost everyone in my life due to it. I put my partner through hell with my emotional outbursts and temper tantrums.

saturn1000 [info] Does therapy actually help? Every time I fall into a depression spiral (which have been a lot worse and happening a lot more recently), I just want to talk to someone about it.I have plenty of friends who I could realistically talk to right now, but it's late and they're all hanging out with other people and having fun and I don't want to bother them. I feel embarrassed almost immediately after talking to them anyway.But I just want to talk to someone and get all this shit off my chest. I'm crying. I want to scream until my throat bleeds. I'm bottling so much shit up and I feel like I'm going to explode. I'm so fucking sad.I would like to go to therapy. That would be someone who I'm guaranteed to be able to talk to. But I went to therapy when I was diagnosed with depression as a kid, and it didn't do anything for me. I went for a few months before my mom pulled the plug because it wasn't doing anything.That was a long time ago. I feel like it could be different this time, since I would feel more open to actually talking about things. I have so much shit I want to say but no one I feel like I can say it to. My only problems are therapy is fucking expensive and still has the potential to do nothing for me.If you go to/have gone to therapy, do you think it's genuinely helped you?

star-of-morning [info] Weird, but I can't eat or think about food or calories. I feel nothing. So since the 1st of the month I've been fasting and restricting. Lots of plateaus and fluctuations. But in the last week I've been going through major depression. Like, severe as fuck. I don't remember ever being this depressed and I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 14 (I am 24 now). The depression has cut my appetite in half, if not more. Since Sunday I've been eating exactly 180 calories per day. Even those 180 calories make me feel like I'm gonna puke afterwards. I don't actually purge, it's just nausea. Nothing tastes good. I don't crave anything. I don't want anything. Eating feels like a chore.I don't feel hunger during the day but I force myself to eat *something* so I can get schoolwork done. In the evening I do get hungry but I don't do anything about it because I'm too fucking depressed to feed myself. This is not sustainable. Less than 200 calories a day for weeks, or even months on end is not sustainable. Even my ED brain knows that. *I* know this. But I feel like I can't stop. I leave for college at 9:15am and get home no later than 4:30pm and my roommate works 3pm to midnight. My biggest fear is that I'm going to faint and there won't be anyone to "wake me up" or whatever (if I'm unable to wake up naturally, idk, the last time I fainted I was around friends who immediately picked me up and put me in bed) and I'll just be lying on the floor for hours, totally unconscious. I feel like I need a "reset" day to get my appetite back. But I don't know if it will work. I don't know if I can even do a reset day because I get so full so quickly on less than 200 calories. I'm at a point where I'm *terrified* of eating over 300 calories even. I was going to have half a Quest bar to get close to 300 but my depression wouldn't let me. If I did a reset day I would probably just try to eat one full proper meal. Preferably something I really, really enjoy. Have any of you been through something similar? Where you are eating so little, you *need* a reset day to not...die? I mean I know I'm not going to die anytime soon but...you know what I mean. Have you done a reset day so you don't completely fuck yourself up physically? [info] 5'2" | went to treatment | send help | 24F [info] 1521000034

etherealpwincess [info] YES! I was diagnosed with depression a while back, but I honestly think a lot of it had to do with the BED, feeling like no one understood me, not performing well in classes that actually required mental effort from me for once, etc. I was never really able to find an answer for why I was so depressed, but I finally think I might actually have one.I was worried about how long I could stay on the vyvanse, as I'm new to it, but what you said is actually quite hopeful. And what's more, you personally could just stay on vyvanse until you're independent enough to get an ADHD diagnosis on your own? But I definitely understand the "trying not to push it" sentiment. Now that I actually have vyvanse for BED, I'm hoping I don't say anything wrong that makes the psychiatrist take it away from me.

cclites [info] I was diagnosed with depression a month ago, and I hear you. In spite of doing everything right to get my arms around my ADHD, I would wake up every morning thinking 'not good enough, not good enough' on a repeat loop. Basically my ADHD was 'under control' (ha-ha, under control.... right), and the underlying depression sort of came to the forefront.Doctor prescribed Lexipro, and wow, what a difference. My patience level is better, and my self-confidence showed up after being non-existent for most of my life. If you can, see a therapist or doctor and see if they can help.My therapist gave me a good suggestion that helped a lot. Instead of letting my negative self-talk loop kick in, she suggested that I evaluate how I feel, and decide what my 'best' will look like for that day. Some days my best is to eat a meal and bathe. Bonus points if I brush my teeth. If I eat, bathe, wash a load of laundry, brush my teeth, and play 8 hours of video games, then I've had a great day.  [info] ADHD-PI [info] 1542841035

"Clinical depression" is not a stamp put upon you saying you will never be happy or have any joy in your life ever again because you are physically broken.&gt;The DSM-5 outlines the following criterion to make a diagnosis of depression. **The individual must be experiencing five or more symptoms** during the same 2-week period and at least one of the symptoms should be either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.&gt;1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day.2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day.3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.4. A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).5. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.6. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day.7. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day.8. Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.That is not diagnosis that says your brain doesn't work properly, it's an observation of outward symptoms.  It's more a diagnosis that things aren't working properly at the moment.  Sure I will say there may be some cases of uncurable or untreatable depression, but they are few and far between.  Yea it might take a lot to change things, and you might need a lot of help to do it, but I wouldn't jump to such a conclusion about your inability to improve your life.

mindyourownbusiness3 [info] I was diagnosed with depression about age 11. Was on medication for the majority of my adolescents. When I realized I didn't want to be on medication anymore, I weened myself off and started training for the military. A couple of years later, after being completely honest with my recruiter, I enlisted and was shipped of to basic training. 6 1/2 years later, I have a small collection of guns, and am still in the military. Now would it exclude you from certain jobs like intel and spec ops? Yeah. But there are plenty of other jobs out there. Talk to a recruiter about it. It also depends on the climate of the military. We just had a huge draw down, and are now trying to build back up, so they might be more willing to let you in. PM me if you have any questions.  [info] None [info] 1495302540
jemminger [info] &gt; I have been diagnosed with depression by two different doctors, and went to therapy in the past. I am way too shy and way too paranoid to tell them anything personal, and will only answer questions very generally.You need to trust that the therapist is there to help and not judge, and that it is all confidential.

IVGreen [info] If you're having trouble budgeting it might be your brain and not your finances So basically the last 5 or so months I've been having a bitch of a time paying bills. I've been behind on everything, robbing Peter to pay Paul. I'd create a budget. Pay day would come. And in 48 hours I'd be looking at our bank balance to figure out how the shit did I not pay the bills but still have no money. Or it would be a few days til pay day and I'm digging for change in the car to buy milk and bread. Frantically refreshing the online banking app to see if the direct deposit is available yet. Basically totally financially screwed. Meanwhile, someone mentioned that my Facebook posts had gotten increasingly prosuicide and death. I always make jokes like that but in retrospect I reviewed the last 2 months of posts and basically other than news it's all suicide and death jokes. This same friend suggested I should talk to a doctor about depression. Now I have been diagnosed with depression in the past but it had been very manageable for a long while. And from my perspective I was doing really well. Anyway, I talked with my doc and she got me on appropriate medication. I mentioned the budgeting problem and she said that is a common problem that comes with depression. That was 2 weeks ago. Over the last week I was able to create a budget and stick to it. I have 1 more bill to pay for the week which I'll do later today. But after that I'll have a decent amount of money left over for random expenses. Now, I have an accounting degree and have the knowledge to budget and manage m finances but I just wasn't able to execute it properly. So if you don't know how to create a budget it's likely not a mental health issue that is causing your financial troubles. But since I know how to budget, should be able to budget and just couldn't get my shit together, I was glad to find out that it was health related. The worst part is that I realized that I should have been able to put away 500$ a month to savings. (Approximately 20% of our monthly income)Hope this helps someone in their financial and other life goals. **Tl;dr: couldn't make a budget work realized I was depressed. Got help and now I can pay my bills** [info] None [info] 1471073862
PrincessTiffany [info] I’m not entirely sure why. Probably because I said being overweight contributes to depression. It does. See, years ago during a shit time in my life I was diagnosed with depression and given Prozac. They did nothing but make me want to cry all the time. So instead of that I self medicated with alcohol and codeine and dove deeper into the depths of hell. I was overweight and addicted to codeine, what did I do about it? Started meditating. Got a gym membership. Stopped eating so much sugar and refined carbohydrates. Quit alcohol. Started taking vitamin D and potassium supplements. That was about a year ago. Now I’m healthy my mood isn’t really something I ever dwell on, it’s not that I became ‘happy’, it’s that it ceased being important. I don’t feel like shit all the time, which means I can focus on things.  [info] World's Best Narcissist [info] 1519583080

lanibanani11 [info] Help find my type from the questionnaire More in the comments:How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.I'm a 17 year old female. I'm the type of person who doesn't really have a consistent personality tbh. I can either be really mean and rude, a jokester, or someone who's there to help people's problems. In some moments I'm reserved and quiet and others I can be loud and outgoing. • Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?I was diagnosed with depression in middle school and I'm just not mentally stable in general. It made me more reserved than I wanted to be. • Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?My upbringing was okay I think. I did live in a household where arguing and yelling was a frequent occurence, some including myself in it. But my family was somewhat diplomatic and never really used violence against each other. I live in a Buddhist family but they're not overly strict or obsessed about religion, except possibly my mom. But even she doesn't really enforce it that much. I don't really care for religion much and I think my family is okay with it.• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?I'm a senior in high school. Whether I like it or not depends on my mood and class. I sort of keep to myself during free time since I have no friends and I'd rather just get the day over with than mingle with anyone. I do get lonely and hateful thoughts against people having better times than me though but everyone already kinda avoids me because I have a very snappy and rude demeanor.• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?It depends I guess. I wouldn't feel refreshed by being alone for a long time and probably would get bored out of my wits. But I do talk to people online since I can easily change my persona with someone I don't know and it makes me less lonely.. [info] None [info] 1568488578

Tyfoon555 [info] Recently found out my sister was a victim of sex trafficking (very very briefly, in Seattle). So that was fun.

kms2547 [info] I don't believe in God because I grew up.  And much like growing up, it didn't happen all at once.  It was gradual.When I was little, I subconsciously sorted stories into three categories: Fiction, Nonfiction, and the stuff they told us at Sunday School, which sounded like fiction, but they told me it was real.  It never quite sat right with me.Like many kids, I thought dinosaurs were super cool.  I read about how they lived tens of millions of years ago, long before the evolution of humankind.  This was at stark odds with the Biblical narrative I had been taught in Sunday School.  I asked my dad about the contradiction.  He told me that parts of the Bible should be thought of as metaphors and moral lessons, and not necessarily as historical fact.Later on I was taught that the only way into heaven was faith in Jesus.  I had Jewish friends who were genuinely good people, and I knew some Christians who were assholes.  That didn't sit right with me either.In High School I was diagnosed with depression.  My parents enrolled me in a Christian counselling service.  An hour or two on a weekly basis of one-on-one time with a counselor and I could talk about pretty much anything.  For the first time in my life I really opened up, not just to this man, but to myself.  I became a much more introspective person, and started really asking myself who I am, what am I about, and what do I believe?  Ironically, the Christian counseling service was the last big push I needed to realize that not only did I not believe in God, I really hadn't for years, and I hadn't really admitted it to myself.Ultimately I am a much happier, thoughtful, and self-actualized person than I was back in those days.  **I grew up.***When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, and I reasoned like a child.  But when I became a man, I put aside my childish ways.* [info] None [info] 1542219468

Rydakule [info] I was diagnosed with depression and severe sleep apnoea at my highest weight (135kg) a few years after losing a family member. I had been overweight since high school and a lot of my constant weight gain had stemmed from a shitty childhood and a history of alcoholism and recreational substance abuse (pretty much weed and pills). After I lost my younger brother, I spiralled out of control and put on heaps of weight and would barely leave the house despite being a year into my PhD. My supervisor was the first one to realise my absence and I decided I would try and do something about it.I saw a psychologist and vented out my history which did lift a huge weight off my chest. She was pretty much overwhelmed with the sheer amount of baggage I’d dumped on her and decided to focus on one thing we could fix, and booked me into a nearby sleep clinic. I went for my sleep study, was diagnosed but it didn’t lead anywhere for months because all of the sleep technicians that read the results had all been charged for embezzlement or some shit. It was bizarre, but it basically meant there was going to be no progress for months.I kept going with my shitty lifestyle and for a month after my sleep study nothing had changed. I then decided that I needed to take action or I was going to eventually die in my sleep or die from obesity. I started counting my calories and walking every day. Exercise and diet was something I’d tried many times before and it was never something I could stick to long term. So I started out slow by walking 30 mins a day and eating around 1700-1500 calories a day. I dropped like 9 kg in 2-3 weeks. This made a huge impact on my mental health but I was constantly in danger of slipping back into my depression and I needed a way out of that. That’s when I found Taoism. I’ve always been a huge Bruce Lee fan and I’ve had a copy of his Tao of Jeet Kune Do on my bookshelf. One day I opened it up looking for stretches and exercises when I noticed the Taoist priest and the poem on the first page. I delved further into investigating Taoism and now I’m here. The Tao helped me to focus on life one day at a time and to leave my past behind me. It helped me to regulate my mood and it helps me to moderate my urges. I still fail daily, but when I fall down I centre myself in the present and begin again. Taoism didn’t help me to conquer my problem with food, CICO and regular exercise did that. I’m now 30kg down and feeling fantastic. Also, I did eventually get my sleep study results and now have my own cpap machine which has made a huge difference as well. However, Taoism did help me with my mental health which I think was the more important, underlying reason for why my lifestyle was so poor. So, I wouldn’t claim that Taoism is a good way to fix your eating disorder. However, I feel like Taoist philosophy can help you to improve your life in general and the effects of this may improve your relationship with food. I wouldn’t rely solely on Taoism to do this. Instead, take the necessary steps to fixing your problem and use Taoism to frame those things within the greater context of your life. Don’t be afraid to seek help. Whether it’s a psychologist, a nutritionist, a personal trainer, whatever. Take the steps to change your situation and let the Tao take care of the rest. Hope this helps. Good luck on your journey.

All the time before my bf of almost six years did not believed me, when the test came positive he fell into a state of shock and said some mean things. I knew they were articulated in a state of fear but nonetheless it hurt so much. Now (2 weeks later) he could be up for a child, but actually doesn't want to. He sees all the money we don't have to give the child a wealthy and carefree life. And is asking for an abortion with the wish to We both are 32, i'm only one semester away from finishing with a bachelor's degree and he's a freelance coder. I love our live as we lived it all those years.  I'm diagnosed with depressions and I had two abortions by the age of twenty. I had to do it at that time but it's still hurting. I repressed my secret wish for a baby the whole time. ( I got secretly upset when I saw young woman with Babys ore someone I knew got pregnant). Now it feels to me that I have to choose between our relationship or my sanity, TBH I think I can't go through another abortion without hating myself till the rest of my life. In the other hand: I can see myself with a baby but I'm sure if I can be responsible enough for a child or a teenager.

insane677 [info] Prozac, and increased sex drive? Possibly (Nsfw) (First post, about to break my r/depression cherry)I was diagnosed with depression about four months ago, and have been taking Prozac for about three months. I started at ten milligrams, and then I was bumped up to twenty. (I actually experience less side effects with twenty than I did with ten. Weird.) I've heard people mention decreased sex drive with Prozac, (being unable to 'perform' and such.) but I (M18) have actually experienced the opposite. Before my medication and talk therapy, I had little to no sexual interests. Sure, I've checked some girls out and watched porn and I masturbated and stuff like that, but I never had any crushes or made it anywhere sexually with a girl. Whenever a girl showed interest in me, I either ignored it, or it flew over my head entirely.But, ever since my medication, I had my first crush ever on a girl at work, and even asked her out. (She turned me down, but that's fine.) And I've started noticing girls more than I ever had before. I even had some light flirting with this cute Asian chick at Starbucks this morning.Anyone else experience this? Thoughts? [info] None [info] 1496500889

RAndrewOhge [info] On Depression - Dec 19, 2016 - By Natalie B. (natalieslovelyblog)I’ve been trying to write something like this for a couple of years, but it has been difficult for me to find the right words. I am not sure if I have, even now, but I think it is important that I try.When I was diagnosed with depression, it was late summer in California, and I was wearing an itchy skirt, sweating slightly in an air-conditioned doctor’s office. The psychiatrist asked me a bunch of questions, wrote a couple things down, and then called in a prescription to the pharmacy. “You’re depressed,” she told me. And despite everything, despite expecting to hear her say it and knowing that it was the truth, it still confused me to hear it out loud. “I’m what,” I said.For weeks after, I could not shake the sense of alienation or the feeling that something was terribly wrong with me. When I was finally able to tell my best friend, she told me that she got sad, too, sometimes, which just made me feel worse. It wasn’t sadness that I had been dealing with. It was something else, something more much permanent. It was the most difficult thing in the world to explain, but it wasn’t just when things were hard that I got sad. There were ordinary moments, too, when unhappiness would spread through my thoughts. At the most mundane, unexpected times — coming up for air in a swimming pool, drinking a glass of water on the back porch, stringing up laundry — I would suddenly be overcome with hopelessness. This was something I had been experiencing since I was about fifteen.When things got really bad, I attempted to detach myself from reality. I hardly spoke to anybody, and when I did, my words were heavy and cruel. I drove spaces between myself and the people who cared about me and felt no remorse as I did. I grew my hair until it reached my hips, I stopped wearing shoes, and I scrubbed my hands nine, ten times a day. Somehow, they felt unclean no matter what I did. I only took cold showers, and I ran every morning until the only thing I felt was the ache of my body and a heartbeat in my left ear. I figured the more worn out I was, the easier it would be to sleep again.I hated how cynical I was about everything, but I also didn’t know how to change what I thought. I only listened to very soft or very loud songs. I recoiled into my music and my writing and my silence. There was a simultaneous rapidity and idleness to everything; months passed with a persistent sort of speed, but the days were long and tedious. People who did not understand the tenacity of depression told me to “just be happy,” as though being happy is a decision we make. Maybe it is, but I don’t know how it could be.Without getting into a lot of the things that lead to me actually going to a psychiatrist, because that’s really not the point of why I’m writing this, I will say that, generally, what a lot of it came down to was sticking around places and people that were not good for me. My problem is that I have such an incredible amount of fondness and love for all of the people in my life.And yet the most important thing I’ve learned over the past couple of years is that it is possible to love a place or a person, but also know that they aren’t the right fit in any sort of permanent way. I have also learned that it is possible to know a lot of different things about a person but nothing about what they are actually like. I do not know if I will ever get used to it — having to quietly get rid of someone, having to leave some place — but I do know that it is the only thing I can do to help myself sometimes. It is the most difficult and important thing to understand that just because you need something to end in order to move on, doesn’t mean it wasn’t once the most significant, beautiful part of your life.Another reason is that I have often found myself fixed in a horrible, temporary way of life, stuck between trying to start over where I am and being unable to forget what it was like somewhere else. It has taken me a long time to come to terms with the fact that so much of my happiness depends on how I perceive everything and everyone around me. And so I am learning to find the benevolence in everything and everyone.Today, I can honestly say that I am content with where I am and with the people that I have surrounded myself with, but that is not to say that I am not still depressed. I am, but I am also so much better at dealing with it. Today, I know that learning about happiness has made me so much sadder and I know that summer is the same as winter, only warmer, and I know that, above all, it is okay to get like this sometimes. This past spring and summer especially, I poured my focus into the world around me. It didn’t fix everything, but it made me feel less isolated from myself and from other people.I went to film viewings uptown and art galleries downtown. I bought a New York Times on my street corner every day and read it cover to cover. I read a lot ~ non-fiction pieces on grief, collections of french poetry, textbooks about the economy. But more than anything else, I wrote. I filled about a journal a week, and I spent the entire summer traveling and writing and writing. I finally finished my novel. And the day that I did was the only cold day of July but I was happy and impossibly full of love and empathy and care for everything and everyone.I guess that we can’t really account for each other’s unhappiness, just like we can’t account for our own unhappiness. For a long time, I thought it was the most important thing in the world that I understood the sadness in me and in him and in her, but the truth is, I can’t make sense of any of it. That’s not really the point. A long time ago, somebody told me to look at the world with a certain disinterest — without any sort of selfishness or innocence or anything and I am trying so hard and it is making everything so much easier.~ NatalieAdditionally, some songs, art, books, and films that have made things better:SongsNew Slang ~ The ShinsBlack Flies ~ Ben HowardRe: Stacks ~ Bon IverDo You Realize?? ~ The Flaming LipsDown By The Water ~ The DrumsRed Eyes ~ The War on DrugsApril Come She Will ~ Simon &amp; GarfunkelA Rush And A Push and the Land Is Ours ~ The SmithsArtTrust Me ~ Moyra DaveyAny of Nan Goldin’s photographsPorte-bouteilles ~ Marcel DuChamp12 Shoes For 12 Lovers ~ Sebastian ErrazurizThe Plum ~ ManetA Lot of Sorrow ~ The NationalBooksThe Year of Magical Thinking ~ Joan DidionSlouching Towards Bethelehem ~ Joan DidionThe Bluest Eye ~ Toni MorrisonThe Dharma Bums ~ Jack KerouacChanging My Mind ~ Zadie SmithSouth of the Border West of the Sun ~ Haruki MurakamiFilmsGoodwill HuntingAmerican BeautyAlmost FamousDriveSleeping GiantEternal Sunshine of the Spotless MindWhiplashLost in TranslationPalo AltoAn EducationArticle: https://natalieslovelyblog.com/2016/12/19/on-depression/ [info] None [info] 1482171187
Illumithottyy [info] Does anyone else feel aimless? Like you’re just drifting, with no real purpose? I apologize for the long post and mobile formatting. TL;DR at the bottom.I was diagnosed with depression about a year ago, after I went off to college. I always did well academically in high school, and got both scholastic and sports scholarships for my college. However, I had a lot of trouble going to class. Not because I didn’t want to, but sometimes I felt like I couldn’t. I would make up excuses, things about myself that prevented me from going. From there it progressed to me rarely leaving my dorm, and then hardly ever leaving bed. I quit the soccer team I went to the college to be on and over the course of the 9 months I was there I gained around 30-40 lbs. I broke up with a long term girlfriend of 4 years and subsequently flunked out due to awful attendance.Fast forward to today. I moved back home, and am going to a community college to try and earn enough credits to transfer out again. But I’m having the same problem with going to class, and feel like my life is headed in no real direction. I’m only 19. All my peers are doing big things, making strides towards meaningful careers and degrees. I feel like my life’s going no where. I’m having the same problems I did a year ago. I’m too embarrassed to talk to my teachers about it, and even if I did I feel like I’ve done too much damage for them to be able to do anything effective to help me. I feel like life is passing me by. I feel like I could wake up 1 or 5 or 10 years from now doing the same thing. I was always told I was gifted, told I was succeed. I feel like I’ll never live up to those expectations. I’ll be another sad story of someone with wasted potential. I know I’m in this rut, but I don’t know how to get myself out of it. I don’t have a job, I ghosted my friends, and I feel like I’m just leeching off my parents. I just want to feel normal again. To have motivation, to enjoy life. I just don’t know if there is any way out of this. TL;DR: I have depression, no purpose in life, struggle to attend classes, felt the same for a year and feel like it will never change.

QuinoaOddysey [info] Trying meds? I was just diagnosed with depression recently. I truthfully don’t have a lot of knowledge on this, I feel like I am dismissing meds as an option because I am coming from a  place of ignorance and I keep thinking that I’m just really lazy and not clinically depressed. My therapist suggested continuing to talk things out, group therapy, and trying meds. I’ve never taken anti-depressants before, does anyone have any advice on how they went about making the decision on what to do to treat their depression? I would like to give meds a fair shot but am also nervous about side effects and not being able to function without them. [info] None [info] 1554407633
Slymsh [info] She left when I told her I was diagnosed with depression. Then she came back only to abuse me. She left for a job across the country when I told her we needed to support each other, then she started abusing me over the phone, and when I stopped answering her calls she came back to abuse me in person. I just told her not to contact me again and cancelled my proposal, then NC. [info] None [info] 1569059255

Life-is-Apples [info] This is going to sound like a few others here that I've read but I need it.At the beginning of December I admitted myself into a mental hospital. My ex girlfriend (then girlfriend at the time of 4 years) was seriously considering leaving me and it had definitely set something off in my head that I haven't felt in a very long time. Before seeing her, of course. I was diagnosed with depression. I'm in disbelief that any of this happened.I grew up with a rough childhood witnessing all points in the triangle of abuse. This including marital infidelity with my parents, and my first girlfriend (the one before the one I just spoke about, she had cheated). It just stick with me. I wasn't supposed to make it this far. Now that I have, I feel like I've been punished for it ever since. I'm not me. I'm buried. I don't want to be around anymore. I live like this every single day making decisions with the flip of a coin. She made me promise her I'd search for help. That I would do whatever it takes. Even though she's me ex I know she cares. It tears me apart piece by piece every. Single. Night. Because I don't know if I'm moving forward or not. For fuck sake I drove 4 hours to the fucking beach just to see the ocean again in the middle of the night just to do it. Whatever it takes.I see a therapist every week. But I need something more in this life.I'm falling apart. Thanks for reading. [info] None [info] 1518413532
Wadls218 [info] That's actually my "friend", I said once that I was diagnosed with depression (I actually am, I'm getting the help so that's rad), and he went of on this whole tangent about having cuts on his arms and being like "YoU'Re nOT dEpREssed, YoU dOn'T cUt Yourself", it was just really fucking stupid.

Garbanian [info] I haven't been a teen in a long time but I have been diagnosed with depression and I was a teen, and haven't found a method to cope. Been thru wards upon wards with no luck, limited insurance to help with meds if I get any, and limited support lines outside of medical professionals. The saddest part to me is how little people care. How much people post reach out I'm always there but actually aren't. How many people say they care so much but never reached out after I was foun mid OD. Not everyone has people that care and I hate to say it but that shouldn't be a reason to stay either. I think both sides are selfish. One wants to end their life over whatever they can't escape. The others expect someone to suffer constantly just because death is hard.  [info] None [info] 1552811400
HanLeonSolo [info] Sometimes I feel like I'm not actually depressed To start this off, I have been diagnosed with depression, so I know that I do suffer from it. But I rarely feel like crying, I just lack emotion. I literally go days without thinking about anything except going back to bed or hurting myself. when I'm at work I can laugh and smile, but the second I get in the car to go home it's back to staring at the gun cabinet and wondering why I'm still forcing myself to suffer. It makes me feel even worse knowning there are people worse off than me who can't even make themselves function, and yet here I am, able to function and laugh in public. It makes me wonder if I'm actually depressed or if I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. [info] None [info] 1530344779
quintindt [info] AITA for asking my friend to smoke with me? I used to have this friend who was a girl that was my best friend for around 2 years. We hung out like 2-3 times a week and always were doing something together, and these were some of the best years of my life. I am diagnosed with depression and I find one of the best things for my depression is smoking weed, which I have since stopped because of how dissociative I get when i’m sober. She has ADHD and is often depressed so I suggested one day I bring my wax pen and we smoke a little bit and see if she liked it. At first she was saying yeah that would be great it’ll help a lot but soon she got paranoid thinking her neighbors would get all upset and get her in trouble, to which I said wax has no smell and we could just smoke in her backyard. She just kept saying no and I just said okay, and this apparently was a big mistake. We still hung out that day and had a lot of fun, she seemed unbothered by the conversation and was in a better mood than usual. After this day we didn’t hang out for a while, she stopped texting me and I never could tell why,  but I just kinda shrugged it off thinking she was just busy. Flash forward to another couple weeks when I finally thought to myself “she really must be mad at me” and she went on this long rant about how manipulative I am and how I can’t ever stay in my lane. Now mind you this is weeks after we hung out and she seemed fine, and all I wanted to do was try to help how she was feeling, and now she hates me. So am I the asshole?Edit: I texted her a paragraph asking why she was ghosting me, and then she proceeded to explain. [info] None [info] 1549214214
staseyA [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was very young. I was told that was why I always had low ambition and the reason I was tired.For nearly 10 years my doctor was changing my daily dose of my antidepressants and changing it to different ones because nothing ever changed. As I got older I would just fall asleep all the time. I never wanted to do anything or go anywhere because I just wanted to lay in bed. I never really had close friends all through out school and even into my earlier years as an adult because I could never find the energy to form close relationships or memories with people. I started to feel isolated and alone. That lead to feeling sad and lost all the time. All the depression poster symptoms. I thought my depression was just getting far worse and came to the conclusion that it was who I was and how I'd have to feel for my life.&amp;#x200B;When I got into my twenties I went and saw a sleep specialist because I realized it was not normal to feel this way. I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy. I was put on new medication and realized that I was never depressed.  Within a a month, maybe even less, I was on a normal sleep schedule. Instead of sleeping 12+ hours straight with naps during the day, I was sleeping 7 hours a night and for the first time held a job because I had energy. I was able to experience having SO much time to accomplish so much that I just couldn't do before. I started working out, went back to school, arts and crafts, ect. Its been two years or so now. I'm married, hard working, became a wonderful cook, and have a life. Still don't have friends, decided that people aren't really a thing I enjoy a whole lot. [info] None [info] 1560341963

A couple years later she’s having problems at work and is also diagnosed with depression, she called me up crying about it and it took every fibre in my body not to hang up on her.

A coworker killed himself in late October. I just got a therapist for the first time in 15 years this week. I was diagnosed with depression, I have all the signs of it. Right now because of my situation the symptoms are just like yours and how I feel. When my ex gf is in the picture it's there but masked a little better...still fatigue, sleep issues but I hide it.I'm trying supplements and working out 30-1hr everyday which is a stretch for me.

ALMOST_GHOST_19 [info] Well, what you described sounds like depression, and being diagnosed with it doesn't take much. I was diagnosed with depression by doctors and a therapist even though I can tell you with a 100% honesty, I've never felt or been depressed. So, you should definitely tell your parents. Inform them. Although they might be taken aback, or even react with hostility, reassure them that you want to improve your mental health for their sake. Because even though that video opened your eyes, your thoughts will return eventually. And as someone who has attempted and will eventually take myself out by suicide, I can tell you that in suicide, selfishness lies in both sides. And soon, you'll be asking who's happiness is more important. Yours? Or everyone around you? And it's hard living for others when all you want is to just leave. So seek help, because I can tell you want it. And suicide that can be prevented, should be.  [info] None [info] 1554111339
doritios_makeup [info] I can't do this anymore. Hello, apologizes for the wall of text that's about to be thrown at y'all. First time posting on here so I want to give a bit of backstory before I jump into my problems as of today. So I'm 19 years old, I live in one of the the most expensive cities in Canada(important, I swear) and I'm living with a fucking narcissist. My mother has been the worst parent for my entire life. Never has she once supported me; she wanted me to end up like her-- a lazy freeloader that gets handouts from the government. Growing up, we lived in a 1.5br (1 bedroom and a small den/office that was my room) that my dad bought for incredibly cheap. My dad would go out and work 12 hour days and my mom would spend her entire day at home doing absolutely nothing.. She wouldn't even walk to my school and get me. I'd have to walk home with my friends and their older siblings or hope that my dad had a break long enough to come get me. She was never there at my soccer games, wasn't there when I broke my first bone, wasn't at my piano recitals, wasn't there to take me skiing for the first time, when I was diagnosed with depression she wanted to start me on pills right away instead of sending me to a therapist. If I'm ever anxious, instead of leaving me alone she tries to give me a pill to get me to shut up. She never once supported me throughout anything; at my high school graduation she sat 2 rows away from the rest of my family and made a big deal about it AFTER the ceremony. My aunt was more like a mother than her. &amp;#x200B;My mother blames all of my mental health issues on my father. My father is a very stressed and tired man. He's 53, he's still young; but my mother stripped him of most of his youth. She's 10 years older than him (she was a golddigger, FYI; my dad was successful in his early 20's which is when they first met), she took most of his money when they first moved in together. She was emotionally and verbally abusive to him; and at one point she took a majority of his savings and gambled hardcore. Her brother gave my dad $15,000 to buy a garage for his business and she took the money and blamed it on my dad so that her side of the family hated him; but everyone knew the truth. They were just too tired of her to say anything. She was addicted to opium throughout my childhood, a vivid memory I have is her smoking out of her makeshift pipe in our kitchen and me thinking it was neat and trying to go smoke out of it.. She didn't even stop me. She would smoke cigarettes in the same room as me, and she'd refuse to wash my clothes once a week. It was usually once a month. So I'd have to go to school smelling like cigarettes.. The kids called me ashtray. My dad tried so hard to give me a better life, he'd work overtime to support me in the things I wanted to do, but he wasn't able to give me the one thing he tried his hardest to give me: a stable home without her. &amp;#x200B;She'd kick him out, leave him on the streets with no money.. Nothing except the clothes he was wearing and his shoes. Thank god he'd always keep $20 in his car. There were times where she'd take his car keys from him just to torture him, leaving him alone in the dead of winter. My dad endured so much pain because of her. The days she'd kick him out would be the days she'd be most abusive towards me. She didn't start hitting me until I turned 16 but still. The stuff she called me weren't things a 12 year old should be hearing. My dad got sick of her and decided to leave. He moved back in with my grandparents, and he's been saving up so he can buy an apartment for himself. My grandparents don't expect him to pay for anything; which is a good change from my mother. &amp;#x200B;The past year has been painful for me. I've come close to committing suicide twice. We live in government housing, and I know I should be thankful for a roof over my head, but I'm not. I'm disgusted that we live in government housing because there are people that need it more than her and I do. She has been abusing the welfare system for over 20 years, and she can work if she got off her lazy ass and worked. Occasionally she cleans houses, but then complains about it for an entire week. I work two jobs, 14 hour days, but if I complain I get hit. The day of my most important exam, I asked her for $10 because I had to pump gas after my exam and I had lent her $100 a week before. She lost her shit, and punched me in the jaw and pinched my bicep so hard that it left a bruise. It was right before our grad camping, so I was ashamed to wear a swimsuit or short sleeve because I didn't want anyone to ask me about it. I pushed her into the wall and slapped her as hard as I could because that was my initial reaction. She ended up crying and told her 1 friend (that is a complete enabler) that I hit her out of the blue. She called my dad and told him the same thing. My dad knew from the get-go that she was lying, but didn't say anything. I had to spend the first 2 weeks of summer wearing long sleeves/putting makeup on my bruise because it was so bad that it took 12 days for it to fully go away. &amp;#x200B;She has always told my family how much of a bad child I am.. Recently, she texted me and told me she was coming home at 4 am. I had been asleep since 11 at this point, and I assumed she was going to be out all night, so I locked both our normal lock and our deadbolt. I didn't see the message until I woke up at 6, and I called her and she didn't pick up, so I freaked out and drove around the city for 2 hours trying to find her, she finally calls me back and starts going off about how much of a shitty child I am for forgetting about my mother in the "freezing cold" and how she was walking around the neighborhood crying her eyes out before sitting in the bank until her friend (the enabler) picked her up and they went to the casino. At this point, I don't care. She can do whatever she wants with her life. Just recently, I got lip fillers because my lips have always been a big insecurity of mine; and it was my birthday recently so I decided to get it as a one-time only sort of thing for myself. I didn't plan on telling my dad because I was too scared to, and he has always preferred me to look natural (no makeup, normal wavy hair, basically like I'm still a kid) and she ended up telling him. She BACKED ME UP on getting lip injections. She told me she wanted to get them as well, and she supported me through the ENTIRE THING, and then tells my dad how disappointed she is in me and how she told me that I shouldn't because the hyaluronic acid (which your body naturally produces) is cancerous. I'm trying so hard to save up and move out, but my city is so expensive to live in, I feel uncomfortable living with people I don't know, and I can't live with my dad/grandparents because they live an hour away and I'm selling my car so I can't get to and from work.. And I can't just get new jobs either because I get paid really well at both.&amp;#x200B;I've been thinking about getting a third job, just to help a little more with moving out; I can't keep living with her; my depression has hit it's peak and if by this time next year I haven't moved out I am most likely going to kill myself. I told my entire family I haven't gone to university because I want to save up, but really it's because I don't want to go to school AND live with her. In grade 12, I got accepted into a school 4 provinces away from me (my dream school) and she threatened me and told me I had to stay, so I stayed.. I shouldn't have done that. I feel so alone in this world. I can't do anything about it either; I feel stuck in this life I live. I want to try and go back to school next, next summer (May 2020) and just work as often as I can. &amp;#x200B;I got her a gift for Christmas. The first, and last gift she'll ever be getting from me. It's a nice necklace. It's a sphere/ball inside of a cube. She'll think it's cute, and she'll wear it everyday; but really I only got it because it symbolizes me in our relationship. Trapped.&amp;#x200B;I feel like a loser. Everyone I grew up with has their life together except for me. I don't even have my life partially together. I dreamed of going off to university in high school, getting my life together, meeting new people. Now I can't even have a boyfriend without breaking up after 2 months because of my issues.I don't really know why I posted, I guess I just feel alone. I just need people to talk to. My best friend tries her best to motivate me.. But it only works so much. I guess if someone here can just talk to me and help me out.. I'd be much appreciative. &amp;#x200B; [info] None [info] 1543785010

Sadamatographer [info] Sensitivity to noise with depression? I was diagnosed with depression about 3 years ago but I think I have had it longer than that. Anyway, for the last month I have been living at home on winter break from college. My younger brothers all still live here, so there are 6 people in the house. Holy hell this is a loud house. The TV is on from 10 am to midnight daily, my mom plays the radio in the kitchen when she is home, nobody has an indoor voice, people have conversations across the length of the house, etc. My bedroom is near the living room so I can't go there for quiet. It feel like an unwavering wall of sound just bearing down on me.When I am alone I listen to music and movies at a high-ish volume, so the total volume is not the problem. I have never noticed this problem before, but the constant noise is making me feel irritable and beaten down. Is this something to do with my depression or is this just something else? Luckily I get to move back to school in a few days so it will be over soon. [info] None [info] 1547089735

Ewrong [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was a teenager because I was really angry and hated everyone, and I remember thinking to myself "I'm not depressed." but I went with it because I was too young to understand and too lost to figure it out. When they put me on Lithium, that's when I really sat down and thought "God damn, I am so depressed." but it wasn't because I had depression, it was because I was angry and all I wanted to do was lash out and talk to someone but I couldn't because I was so drugged up. Took me almost a year to convince my "doctor" that I just needed to see a therapist. If that's what I felt like on depression *medication* I just can't fathom how hard depression must hit people who are actually depressed if that is the solution. It just ruined my soul.

TheSaladLeaf [info] Weaning a toddler Hey everyone!I have been breastfeeding my 2.5 year old daughter and was hoping to let her wean herself off gradually but I've reached a point now where I'm going to have to give her a bit of guidance. I've been diagnosed with depression and I have been signed off work for a couple of weeks. The doctors has prescribed some breastfeeding friendly antidepressants with a view to wean my daughter in the next month so I can move on to a more suitable antidepressant.She nurses once before bed and usually once in the night. We have been talking about her future school and she is excited to be a big girl but she has made it clear that she wants to stay a baby if that means more mama milk.

MuffDragon [info] My junior year of high school was when I was diagnosed with depression. While my doc and I were still trying to work out a good medicine/dosage based on a few other medications I'm on, I was still all over the place. During a major depressive episode, I had a dream that I took the barrel of my dad's pistol in my mouth and pulled the trigger. I woke up crying. That was when I realized I wanted to live. Thankfully, I didn't need a suicide attempt to show me that. [info] None [info] 1510522864

Optimus_Pitts [info] I was diagnosed with depression over 10 years ago and even after this time it's still so difficult to explain how it feels. I think I finally was able to describe it enough to kind of explain pretty recently.When I'm going through it, it begins with me feeling sad about nothing for a day or two and then 100% void of feeling. At that point I don't feel sad. I'm not upset about anything. Nothing has me mad, or nervous, or upbeat. I'm just existing. I would be at work wishing for anything to happen to get ANY emotional response out of me. Happy, scared, sad, or just anything. Even if it's not a good feeling, it can't feel worse than not feeling anything. The longer it goes on, I start to feel like something is broken and I get too introspective and just can't block it out or shut it off. Just all day digging deeper at my own insecurities flaws to find out what broke me or why I'm like this. Eventually I'll get focused on one thing someone said to me in an argument or a thought that I have about myself and it's just there all day. Think about when you hear a catchy song on the way to work and you can't shake it all day. You try to drown it out with other songs, you try to talk to people, and you do almost whatever you can to lose it but it's still there. That's where my depression goes, but it's not Work Out by Chance that I'm hearing. It's some shit like "you don't deserve to feel loved" and "no matter what you're always going to be completely useless until you die alone". [info] None [info] 1537681034

Eventually I got myself in to therapy and on medication again and I took the initiative and found some temporary contract work (one of which actually lead to my permanent job), stated volunteering with a voluntary bar associations pro bono group, and forced myself to get up and out of the house more often.

Sm4cy [info] &gt; only a small percentage of people can't breastfeedI heard this so many times when I was pregnant and about to breastfeed. All the pamphlets were like, "Our lactation consultants will come see you before you leave the hospital, but in most cases, this is all that's needed!" BULLSHIT. I saw FOUR lactation consultants. The first two didn't help at all, the third helped make me feel better about pumping, and the last was a freaking FAMOUS lactation consultant, and I happen to live in a city where I could get an appointment with her. I'm one of the only mothers I know (or maybe the only one, actually) that successfully breastfed a baby and it makes me mad that they all felt so ashamed that they couldn't. It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and luckily I didn't suffer from PPD (ironically, considered I've been diagnosed with depression, so I assumed I'd get PPD). Honestly I haven't decided if I'll fuss with it if I have another kid. Yes, I'll try my damndest, but I'm not going to miss out on some of the best moments of my kid's newborn life because I'm stressing about breastfeeding. Sleep is FAR more important for new mothers than making sure their baby is exclusively breastfed, imo. I could go on forever about this but I'll shut up now. I should add that I ended up nursing my daughter until she was 2.5.TL;DR Breastfeeding is hard AF.  [info] None [info] 1549854158

xrelaht [info] The thing about the increase of suicidal tendencies is that that statement, while not inaccurate, is misleading. The problem is that one of the things antidepressants do is help increase your energy level. That means that if you were suicidal before but stopped from actually carrying it out by a lack of energy/motivation, you can suddenly find that you are still suicidal but have the energy to carry it out. After a while, most people find that their mood improves as well and the suicidal thoughts go away entirely.When I was diagnosed with depression, Sertraline (a different SSRI) did nothing for me. I was never suicidal, but I did have essentially zero energy, focus only on the bad parts of my life, couldn't sleep but was always tired, etc. What worked for me was getting an obscene amount of exercise. I was working out twice a day six days a week and once on the seventh day. [Exercise has been shown to help with depression in general,](http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression) so if your lady friend is wary of pharmaceuticals, that's one way to go. Just don't let her overdo it and end up doing physical therapy for six months like I did! [info] None [info] 1378603317

Guiltylemon88 [info] Dealing with anger towards a family member. Hey guys,I'm [28/ M] and today I hit an all time low, I shouted at my Grandmother and I can't shake my feeling of anger towards her. As awful as this sounds, please let me explain my situation.&amp;nbsp;So I've been living with my grandparents for nearly a year now. My granddad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease about 2 years ago and I've been staying here to help out with him and while I'm at university.  About 4 years ago I was diagnosed with depression and ultimately it led me to leaving my job and even failing a year at university. I was left in a position where I had debt to pay, child maintenance and some other utility bills that had yet to run their course.   My Nan is a generous person and she doesn't ask me for any rent or money for food (I don't have a job currently) and I try to be as helpful as I can around the house to show my gratitude to her, for making my current situation easier. However, she is not the sweet old lady that everyone assumes her to be, she has a huge gambling issue and has done for the past 45 years, any conversation we have about money or how much she spends every week gambling, puts her in a foul mood where she shouts and generally has a massive tantrum. She will even put her gambling needs above the care my Granddad needs for with his condition and/or anyone's birthdays or special occasions.  This is just one of the things that makes me angry at her.  &amp;nbsp;Now, this morning I went downstairs to have some breakfast and she was in the kitchen. For the past few months, my uncle and his kids have also been staying with us, due to a break up with his ex-partner. There isn't much room, as this is only a small house and tensions are running a little high, as there is no privacy, anywhere. He, has a full time job and takes him a considerable wage, yet he does not pay her any money as he so bluntly put it "If your grandson doesn't pay, I'm not paying".  &amp;nbsp;Anyway, he has recently met a woman (has known her for around 5 weeks now) and she now stays with us too. She has been kind and has lent my Nan some money to help her out, which was a lovely thing to do. However, this morning when I mentioned to my nan that it's getting a little crowded and I'm worried with all the people that my granddad is going to get more confused, she actually turned around and screamed at me. She went on to mention that I don't pay her anything and that I have nothing to say on the matter. It took me by surprise and I couldn't help but shout back, very loudly, making my poor granddad jump. I stormed upstairs and slammed my door and I've been shut in my room ever since.  I feel like I'm getting too angry to be around her, some of the things she says, the obvious disregard for my granddads health, amongst other issues, is really starting to get to me. I don't know who I am anymore, I'm always so angry and I snap at her so easily. I feel like I'm taking her for granted and I don't know what to do.  I have no where else to go, no job to support me anywhere and I really need to get through University and make my life better.  I just don't want to be this angry anymore, I feel like I'm starting to really hate her. What can I do? [info] None [info] 1477040336

SAGNUTZ [info] I was diagnosed with depression when I was 15, it was never resolved and it doesn't just *go away*. I've tried 3 different meds during the 2-3 year time I was actively seeking and receiving treatment. None of them "fixed" me and they all had sometimes unpleasant side effects. My focus shifted though, from raw pain and contemplating suicide to more of a disturbingly emotionless numb feeling. The thoughts of suicide stopped and I was able to shift my awareness to trying to acclimate to these new states of mind. Theres a quote "When in the face of extinction, any alternative is preferable." I forget who said it and in this case its your personal life instead of extinction but the message holds true. Edit: see a doctor. Not being able to focus is a pittance in exchange for keeping your life. Its irrational and uncharacteristic to choose death over any possible side effects. The drugs are all different and do different things, its a process and it may take a wile to find whats right for you(I thought you said "Medication" and the previous statement is out of context but still relevant). I can say EVERYTHING right and give you all the answers but none of it will would matter if you lack the will power to work toward normalcy. I have said everything I can that is helpful without being dangerous, I will pray for you and if youre just trolling people with this, I will egg your house.  [info] None [info] 1480769265

KoalaniB [info] While I agree with the idea of mental health check, how do we decide which mental “illnesses” get put on the list? I see a few issues.1. The person’s privacy.  People have a right to privacy here. That’s why we have HIPAA laws. Do we violate those in order to keep them from buying guns? Perhaps one way around it is when they are diagnosed with an illness it goes on their background “Not fit for gun ownership” 2. How do we decide what illness don’t make the cut? Depression? I was diagnosed with depression as a teenager... so I can never by a gun because it may come back? I’m a decent person who would never do anything like that but just because that’s a mental illness I can’t purchase a gun to protect myself. I’m sure there are other illnesses that might have similar issues. I’m sure I’m missing an easy solution but that’s all I’ve got this early in the morning.  [info] None [info] 1518787042

Yeahnofucks [info] I had very bad ppd with my first, eventually diagnosed at 4 months. No medication (personal choice), but I saw a therapist for a long time to manage it. I didn’t have it with my second, despite a traumatic birth and difficulty bonding in the first few weeks. I have been diagnosed with depression before having kids, so ppd was always a possibility but I think the difference was in the amount of support I had with each child. With my first, we had just moved 8 hours away from all family and friends, I lost my job as I didn’t get maternity leave, my husband had a new job (hence the move) and was working long hours (and no paternity leave). My son also had colic/reflux and didn’t sleep, screaming for hours on end.With my second, we had moved back nearer family, we had been living there years so felt settled, and my daughter was very healthy and slept well. Support, both medical and family/friends makes such a huge difference.  [info] None [info] 1546464837

If it would’ve happened outside that would’ve been a completely different story and when I try to explain to my mom how she’s in the wrong she goes and plays the victim and it only makes my depression worse I wanna leave them and never return and ignore any calls or anything they give me because they don’t act like they love me so I’m not gonna love them as long as there treating me this way but I’m not 18 yet so I can’t legally leave them idk what to do if this keeps up eventually I’m gonna get suicidal I want my aunt and that dog kicked out of the house but no my parents don’t care how I feel they only care about the money and they’ll do anything to keep her here as long as she’s giving them money which is what infuriates me most about them taking money over there own daughter that’s not right on so many levels and tbh that cat that was killed was the only thing keeping me going he was the best boy I ever had and without him nothing in this world Is even worth living my parents have always been like this since the day I was born I wish I had different parents that actually care about me [info] None [info] 1563859773
agalix [info] I relate to what you're saying. My particular pattern is being down for a few to many days where I'm down and behaviorally stuck, and then a couple days where I am good. It's common for these days to be hypomania type things like you're saying. Lots of ideas, thinking is kinda fast, I try and do 3 things at once and often these days I have trouble sleeping.What matters is the treatments and tools you use. Cognitive behavioral stuff is great (Feeling good by David Burns) and group therapy does wonders (if you're lucky theres SMART Recovery in your area). That's what matters more than the diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with depression but my friends and family and professionals have questioned that, especially based on my reaction to SSRIs. Bipolar II or schizoaffective disorder.The biggest thing to be careful of is because you have this neurology, too high a dose of SSRIs may do harm. They can mean more frequent and more intense hypomania, and possibly mania. A good practicioner will up a dose only slowly. [info] None [info] 1571994666

I give myself treats every day and look forward to getting that treat. It could be a movie, a hamburger, or maybe my favorite book2.

I was so desperate that even I, a pretty profound atheist and nihilist, took to studying Chaos magic in search of a cure.I've practiced daily meditation for the last 2 months, read some basic books and online texts, done a pretty decent job at suspending my disbelief and cast a few sigils.However, I haven't been able to manifest anything that couldn't be written off as coincidence or confirmation bias.  I'm just so desperate to feel better, and I understand that the desperation can interfere with my ability to manifest change...it's sort of a vicious cycle.If I could only just have a single awesome unexplainable experience, I feel like that would cement my belief and confidence that there is something I could do to heal myself.

evilblackbunny [info] I tell people that I'm feeling pretty okay right now. The truth is I'm scared for my future,  and passively contemplate suicide on a daily basis. I've gotten help, I'm on medication,  I've been diagnosed with depression.I could hit the lottery tomorrow, get a book deal, meet the love of my life, but I'd still have these thoughts,  every day. Knowing that this is who I am bothers me. Telling people I'm okay is easier for everyone.  [info] None [info] 1415609324
wiccedd [info] My boyfriend (we both are 22) have been showing a lot of passively aggressive behaviours. What should I do? I'm a bit emotional, reliving all that I'm typing... Furthermore, I'm on my phone so I'm sorry about spacing or typo issues.We started dating about 3 years go in our first year of university. Both of us are immigrants, he's from Asia but he lived most of his life in Middle East, I'm from Europe. He is a sweet and caring guy, but he can get very, very emotional. I have not experienced any issues with his behaviour up until 2nd year into our relationship. We moved in together and more and more I had to start doing the chores, such as cleaning the house, doing the dishes, laundry, etc. I was the one who was doing shopping and taking care of him. I didn't mind that at the time, but I was also in a relatively fresh (in my opinion) relationship.With time it started bothering me more and more, but I decided to blame it on the fact that our previous place was very small and crowded. People get irritated in small spaces. We were about to move to a bigger apartment with separate rooms for each other to keep our stuff sorted. The problem started when I moved in with him to the new place. His behaviour has not changed at all, what's more I got a burden of cleaning a bigger space. He dropped a lot on me and that just became so much I fell behind. That became an issue itself. There's also the problem of his emotions. He is a smart and capable person, but when he is stressed out or scared he is always reaching out for me to take care of him. He is not returning the favour, tho showing signs of irritation when I reach out to him. Many times I had to lift him up, which this year cost me in failing 3 modules during my final year and effectively ruining my chances for good masters and any prospects for PhD. He failed a year of uni and I had to crutch him through that. At the time I did not mind it or look at it that way, though. I honestly perceived it as help that was needed, so I was there when he wanted to talk or cry or vent. Then this year he failed again and I have to lift him up, which costs me a lot of nerves due to my own emotional strain caused by a family situation I would rather not discuss. That has led me to think if I want to break things off, but the problem is I already tried. Some time ago I broke things off with him, because I caught him messaging other girls. He then proceeded to cry to me for a long time, not giving me much space for myself, constantly entering my room. I finally gave in and went back together with him but nothing is the same anymore. He doesn't give me space, he calls me every hour or so. When I ask him to sleep alone after work (I work nights, hence I sleep in the morning. He works from afternoon) he just suddenly appears in my bed and wakes me up. I get grumpy and complain about it and he proceeds to call me a bitch for being nasty to him. He says I should wake up to spend time with him before he goes to work....I honestly want out, but I'm so scared to do it. I need help, I need a pep talk. I love this man, he's a great friend, we have a nice history and all, but we are so incompatible. We argue non stop. It's getting to much and I personally feel I need some time alone. Some time off... How do I do that? What do I do? I'm too scared to make a decisionEdit: I forgot to mention an incident that has been a big red flag to me and might add something into the story. So I have been diagnosed with depression and I'm on very mild medication, since I don't want to go with anything heavy. I had problems with grinding teeth at sleep and it bothered my boyfriend. He says that since I have been taking the pills I do it even more and louder. I told him it's not my fault and it's subconscious. I can't do anything about it. I already have a teeth protector for the night to prevent it, yet he still gives me shit for it. So a few days back he just came at me out of nowhere saying I need to stop taking pills because it's making him lose sleep and they are not helping. I proceeded to explain to him that it's insane, since I take them for only 2 months and it's barely any time to see any significant changes. He then started screaming at me and saying I'm wrong, pharmaceutical companies only want to make money off of me and pay off doctors and I shouldn't take any medication at all. Then he proceeded to do something that I just can't get over with. He took a slip of my pills and threw it out of the window. I am not mad about pills (there were only like 4 on the slip), but about the fact that he did it. I was dumbfounded, he kept yelling at me and I left. After about an hour he came to apologise and I said to leave me alone. Prompted by that he went to look for the pills and didn't find them. I'm still mad and very confused. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I just keep thinking about this and about what can I do... [info] None [info] 1567284527

RogueDarkJedi [info] If just one person, believes in you [Just watch this. It helped me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zzfdlxjx4Y)Hello everyone,Recently I was diagnosed with depression, and after talking to RainbowCrash, I feel like sharing.A couple of months ago (think around Parasprites celebration) I had lost my house. I had failed a class I could not fail and I had run out of money.I was in tears. I had no money. The government claimed that because of my parents credit ratings, I could not qualify for financial aid to continue my education.I had lost faith in myself. I fell into this spiral. I became obsessive. Being on the subreddit allowed me to escape. To run from my fears. To run from failure.But it never worked. As much as I tried to fight it, I kept failing. And finally, I had hit it. Someone said I should just leave. They didn't really mean it, but I couldn't interpret that. I took that as I was not wanted (I worked it out with this person later).So there I was on a Friday night sitting on the floor in my empty room in tears. No one wanted me. I was seriously considering deleting my reddit account. I don't know why. There were people on Reddit trying to help me. I don't know why.I don't know why.I was crying. I felt like I had nothing. Tears streamed down from my face. I hadn't slept in three days. The video I linked to was playing in the background.I was trying to escape. But I couldn't.Suddenly Illusion messaged me over Steam. I apologized for being such a self-righteous dick. I knew no one wanted me. He said that I was valued. I didn't feel valued.Then Crashy messaged me and told me everything would be alright.The mods made me feel welcome.Over time, I started working towards overcoming my depression, and while I still haven't done it, I'm getting there.I know this sounds corny, but if it weren't for this subreddit, my friends, Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, ReillyBoy, this TV show and my family I probably wouldn't be here.So I want to thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart.Thank you to:* Rollout and the other RAOP mods for providing me dinner on that night* Reillyboy and others for buying me new clothes, food and allowing me to keep my place for another week* Our mods* Illusion &amp; Opti for telling me I was valued* RainbowCrashy for sending me money to pay for food for 2.5 weeks* Pyrotix for trying to cheer me up* knocknix, Dorigard, TNF, kin, ovenmitt, Books, Emu, and everypony else from Synchtube* CrimsonBristle for always being there* Moon for being so damn positive* ILF for just being you* Fabricant for listening* timbaer for being willing to help at all times* Killbunny and Mcore for believing in me* Cookie for being awesome* Cheesemoo for being excited over all my little successes and cheering me on* Nom and Psychoduck for just being there* pariah1165 for teaching me to value others* TVF for inviting me to make stencil art* My teacher for giving me another chance and letting me pass the class* My friends* For all of you for believing in meThank you guys for being there for me. I don't know where I would be without you.*tears**I just don't know.*---EDIT: So it's been over 10 hours since I posted this. I've been reading all of your comments. And let me tell you, I was crying the entire time (both Psychoduck and ILF can attest to that).I'm going to try to reply to each one of you personally, and I know the majority of comments will be me saying thank you.Because I really truly mean it. Thank you all for being here. Thank you for listening.---[Reflection](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/lh9a9/this_too_shall_pass/) [info]  [info] 1318936166
Demeter_of_New [info] I may not have taken ADHD medication when I was in school, but looking back I really wish I had. I have been diagnosed and am currently taking medication for Adult ADD.For the longest time I had no idea I had ADD. I had terrible grades, terrible outlook on life, terrible relationship with my parents. We went to a psychologist and I was diagnosed with depression and they put me on a prozac off-brand. I took that for a short while and I felt happier. But my grades hardly moved. I'm not dumb, in fact, I'm knowledge hungry. I am always on the internet looking for cool bits of information, trying to learn new things. I dabbled in languages, and programming, and other things.  I felt happier but barely passed high school and got a job in IT. I work at a help desk and I pass off anything that takes more than a half an hour to the next level of technicians. This is nice, I don't have to concentrate for too long. But as time passed, I was getting more experienced and I was keeping problems that I would have normally passed on. But this wasn't an issue at first. I handled it, but as time passed, it was just harder and harder for me to concentrate on the work I was doing. Even the problems that take just a few minutes would take me over an hour to complete, just because I would get distracted and not remember what I was doing before, its bad.It's hard to explain it, because I've been told before, "Just concentrate! It's not that hard!" but ADD is like you are watching a movie. And out of the corner of your eye, you notice the wall outlet the lamp is plugged into next to the TV. It's just an outlet. But you can plug in ANYTHING with the approprate plug and BAM! it has power. You know, I read somewhere that the first form of the outlet socket was made before the turn on the 20th century! Can you imagine going back in time and talking to Edison and saying, "what you made, will forever.." and that just keeps going, 100 mph, until something else cathces my attention and the process repeats. And I CANNOT CONTROL THAT. I can't remember what people say either. Even if they tell me ten times and I am looking them in the eye. The moment something catches my attention, it's gone.But what's weird is I have the opposite ability for a few things. I can sit there and concentrate on learning a song on the guitar, or video games, or tasks that are similar. I need constant stimulation to stay focued. Reddit is amazing and there have been times that I've spent half a day on it without knowing. I went to another psychologist and they mentioned ADD. I sort of laughed, but I trusted him. So I was put on a low dosage of Adderal. It's been almost two months and I have gotten a promotion and a raise, I was asked by my boss to make a new position and take it over, and I moved in with my girlfriend. The medication makes it easy to not think about everything, all the time.Sure those aren't school grades, but god damnit if this was high school I am positive I would have not almost failed out. This medication has changed my life. It allows me to enjoy everything and not worry about remembering what someone said.  [info] None [info] 1373401485
takaperoinen-miete [info] Yeah, I worded that wrong. Of course someone who's played the cello since she was 6 years old can play a cello for a living. The matter is, the competition in creative jobs is fierce and absolutely brutal and I can't compete with everyone who has already dedicated their entire existence to it, as a 25-year-old starting now. I can put myself and my mindset separately, but how do I separate expectation from experience? How am I expected to keep repeating the same action and expecting a different result, with an absolute and full faith that this time it'll happen?I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 14. By the success rates that these psychiatric professionals have had this far, it's likely it's just a permanent fixture of who I am as a person. [info] None [info] 1566887165

Duncan_Disorderly_ [info] My wife says the spark has gone. Hi all! My wife and myself have been going through a very difficult period in our lives. I was diagnosed with depression October 2018. Mainly due to my extremely stressful job... I dealt with suicide a lot! I was prescribed an antidepressant and kept this hidden from her. I was embarrassed as I was a psychiatric professional and allowed my own mental state to slip. She only discovered the truth when I had to take time off work to go to counselling. Now... I am in a better place. I have changed jobs and now work in a less stressful environment. Over 2 months ago she told me she was not physically attracted to me anymore, so I began making changes. This entire time (possibly 4/5 months) went by without any physical contact initiated by her (hugging, kissing, sex, comforting and supporting). I began giving 100% of my focus to our relationship and she acknowledged how much of a positive change she seen. Then, 4 nights ago she told me that she feels no different. No physical attraction. We have two beautiful children and I don't want to leave. However, I have become angry with myself and her. I find my mood has seriously dipped again this week and I'm almost at square one again. I suggested counselling a number of months ago, however she declined, explaining that she felt things were improving naturally. I've left it to her to organise counselling this time, as I had an appointment booked and had to cancel last time. I cannot live in a marriage where my emotional/physical/sexual needs are not being addressed at all. I am sleeping on the sofa, and can't continue doing this either. I did walk out one night and ended sleeping in my car outside the hospital in which I work. I only came back as she pleaded with me.Can anyone suggest how we can get over this crisis in our relationship? I almost feel hatred towards her at the moment... which is the last thing I've ever wanted to feel for my wife of 12 years. Thanks. [info] None [info] 1563260647
Low_notes_z06 [info] I’m a 29 year old male living with depression. Every time I’ve considered suicide, it’s never come from a desire to die so much as a lack of desire to go on living the life I have. If there was a third door, an option to go to sleep and never wake up, I’d go for that. I do not take medication, nor will I as it doesn’t help me and I’d rather just get my dopamine from working out.The harsh truth is that no matter how bad it gets, I’m no use to anyone dead. My life is only valuable to me because I choose to assign it value. I’m not gonna say it’s because life is sacred because I’ll be honest, I’ve traveled the world and experienced more than most people ever do. At the end of it I’ve found universal truths and more harsh facts. We’re all gonna die, life is finite, life after death is a hoax and a marketing strategy for every brand of afterlife insurance out there, things don’t happen for a reason, and we’re not here for a reason. Metaphysical sentience (god(s)) is/are bullshit, and religion is only useful as a social phenomenon.I may live in hell-lite every day as someone who was permanently disabled and disfigured at the age of 27 but I can still contribute to society. Every day is painful. Sometimes each hour is painful. (By the way, I was diagnosed with depression long before I was disabled.) People ask me if there is a point and I just chuckle, there is no point, but we are alive. We get this one opportunity, for better or worse, to live. When the lights go out, they don’t come back up after an intermission for an Act II, there is no encore, there is no Sunday matinee.Tyrion Lannister said it best, death is so boring whereas life is so full of possibility. I hope one day I am lucky enough to have a family of my own and that I will impact the world positively. Is there meaning in life? Sure, but only because we choose to assign meaning to it. If you’re looking for cosmic given purpose, keep drinking the religious kool-aid and burying your head in the sand, that seems to be doing the world a load of favors. (Hard eye-roll)If it sounds like I’m harping on religion a lot, it’s because I am. I truly believe that we have an unprecedented number of depressed individuals because we are coming into an age where religion no longer makes sense, but older generations are clinging to it desperately. The dichotomy and struggle of it all lands on the shoulders of the younger generations while at the same time there has never been a more unfair distribution of wealth and resources in history. A lot of people are shitty, especially people in positions of power. The world is a dark place and if you’re just hoping to sit by idly and wish for a pleasant experience to be handed to you, you’re going to be bored and disappointed.How I get through? My dog depends on me and I am fortunate enough to have family and friends who support me even though they know I spend most of my time alone and in silence. Most days I struggle to fight back the swirling clouds of shadow at the periphery of my field of vision. (I literally can’t close my eyes for too long or my brain goes all Snow-White-in-the-forest on me.)I’ve still not ruled it (suicide) out, but again, death is so boring.TL:DR There is no fate but what we make. Also, there is no god, rip that bandaid off. Life only has as much value as you assign to it. [info] None [info] 1573966126
ccm596 [info] I have no fucking idea what I'm gonna do then lol. Because it doesnt matter how many positive changes I make in my life, or how much I know that things have improved, I still feel like I'm fucking garbage :/ I just wanna stop wishing I was someone else, and I dont know how. Its like nothing I do matters, my life is objectively 10x as good as it was a year ago, but I'm just as miserable, if not more.Hahaha I live in the US, in a state that didnt expand Medicaid. Which means that my last therapist appointment was a couple weeks before I turned 18. (Maybe 19?) Yes, I was diagnosed with depression in high school. But like I said, since I'm not rich, it doesnt really matter, I just get to figure it out myself because I dont have God knows how much money to spend on either therapy out of pocket, or insurance that would cover it. And it's so hard to talk about this, because people always think I'm "woe is me"ing for pity, but I'm not. I just want to feel better, like I'm a person who's worthy of love and not a fucking weirdo freak. I need help, and I cant seem to find it, and it's getting harder to stay convinced that it's even worth it to keep trying. I would do anything to just be happy by myself, and to figure out what I need to do be deserving of a girl's attention. In that order. It breaks my heart every day that I have no outlet for the love that I know I'm capable of showing, and hope that I'm worthy of receiving, but it's clear to me that's gonna be a looooooong fucking time from now, so I just want to learn to be happy without it, so I'm not entering a relationship for the wrong reasons.Sorry for the wall of text [info] None [info] 1542895854
MusicalMoon [info] My (21M) relationship with my girlfriend (20F) almost seems too perfect. Is that a bad sign? My gf and I have been together for a little over a year now. We've known each other for about 7 years as we were great friends in high school. During the time we were friends, I was in two other relationships (not at the same time, but nearly back-to-back). The first ended up ending pretty explosively after 3.5 years as I felt like as we grew up, we became much more different people than we were before. She didn't agree and proceeded to cast a smear campaign amongst my friends and deny that she did any of it. The next one was a doozy, it was just over a year in length and she was incredibly abusive. She would shame me for everything I did or said and basically forced me to show her attention every moment of every day, even when I was in class or working.Now, after over a year of being single, my current girlfriend and I began dating. Our friendship before was entirely platonic, I never saw any interest in her and I also don't feel like she had any interest in me. But, once we both started college, something clicked and we've been together for nearly a year and a half. It's been a near perfect experience, we've never had a true fight or argument even once, and we always see eye-to-eye on everything. Even when we disagree we always have a very civil conversation about it.My past experiences tell me that this just isn't possible. Is that true? Is there something wrong here? I am diagnosed with depression and often feel like things are going too well and there must be a catch. Is that what I'm experiencing? Thinking about this lately has me panicking.Thank you in advance for your responses.Tl;dr - I'm in a relationship that seems almost too perfect. Am I crazy? Or is this what they're supposed to feel like? [info] None [info] 1561960933
spinachicken [info] As of now I believe it was thinking of my family, friends, and anyone who would fine me. I didn't want to end up scarring them for life when they found my body or for my close ones to worry about me until they get a call from the police saying my body was found and needed to be confirmed. I've thought about it numerous times and 3 times I was literally at deaths door waiting to knock. But,  every time thinking about my close ones manages to be enough to catch me. I've told my mother, which was the hardest thing to do in my life, and managed to build enough courage to tell a doctor. I have been diagnosed with depression and have scheduled an appointment with a therapist. I know that killing myself is not the right answer, yet, in the back of my mind I'm afraid. Afraid that my mind will somehow end up tricking me to do it. I don't know how but I'm afraid that somehow ill end up like my old high school friend who pretended to be happy and hung himself in our senior year. [info] None [info] 1510512988

dogfightdog [info] Baseball rn. Most people play sports bc it’s fun but I play because I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16 and throughout that time, baseball was the only thing that I would get excited for bc on the field I can lose myself in the game for a bit. And I want to be great at the game. And to be great I have to hold myself to a high standard, I have to hold myself accountable so I don’t slip off my path. I have to stay focused to do that, so everything I do is to help with that. Time plays a major role. When I’m doing the things I need to do to improve as a player or student, that’s time of the day that is spent on a mission so I know I’m working TOWARDS something instead of standing still.

thegothickitty33 [info] Does anyone have an obsession with sorting I'm gonna start off here saying I dont think I have OCD or anything like that. I've been diagnosed with depression and ADD. Maybe it's part of my ADD. No clue. I just like to sort and organize things. Specifically multi colored candy (skittles, M&amp;Ms, Runts etc). I sort them by color and eat them buy color. I also sort my magic the gathering cards.  I have a system for those. (White, blue, black, red, green, land, other) I also have an urge to organize other people stuff. Specifically setting the time on coffee pots and microwaves and making all cans of beer and soda face the same way. It's not obsessive or anything. Just kinda a thing I do I guess.
