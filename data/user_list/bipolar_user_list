FlyPolar [info] 31M for 35F. Have been dating LO for around 2 months now. About a week ago she bumped into her last ex and it brought back all sorts of bad mental issues, as a result she's asked for space while she sorts through them. I was fine for maybe a day?? Then the obsessive thoughts switching from elated ecstasy to gut wrenching anxiety started and haven't let up since. In February after a lifetime of mental unrest I was diagnosed with bipolar. Since being on medication my mental state has cleared up so much (with a lot of work as well as the meds). I've had some minor limerence episodes since then but this is a big one rearing up. I'm not stupid or in the depths of uncontrolled mental illness this time though! I found an issue with myself and got to researching what I can do about it.At about 3pm today I came to the realisation that the negative side of things was adult separation anxiety, then after a few searches I found a post about it in this sub."Limerence? What the hell is that". Proceed to me scouring the Wiki entry. It reads like a script to every relationship I had or wanted for all of my life, right back to the first girl I had a crush on.Despite my mood chart for the day being as low as it can get I'm so happy to have been able to put a name to the face of one of my biggest issues. I felt like I could've cried with happiness at one point.Can anyone recommend any good resources for managing the condition?
viral_snyde [info] I mean. I just dont have an attachment to being alive is the best way to put it. I dont care that I'm alive but I get so envious of death around me. I was suicidal for a long time and dealt with childhood abuse up until the age of 22. Things are better now and I'm fine. I ho to therapy, take my medication. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but my medication has it under control for the most part.I'm just not too keen on being alive. I just got informed my brother has a high possibility of being COVID positive and aside from the concern of the money involved, I'm actually quite excited. I mean, what if I get sick? Hopefully no one else does. Hopefully it can just be me and I can die from it.I just don't think I should be alive. It just feels wrong.
mattsulli [info] I had a fiancée before I married my wife. During an alcohol withdrawal stint at a hospital I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I never sought treatment and let my behavior get worse and worse until she finally left me. I beat myself up over and over again, cutting, lashing out, drinking, spending days crying and other days going out trying to get myself killed on the streets of Baltimore. When I spent a couple of years dealing with this and getting a little better, I met my now wife. I was honest with her about my disorder but lied pretty heavily about my past. When I eventually got on some insurance plan I started seeking treatment. I became more honest with my wife about my past because I began to understand that as long as I got better I could unload the truth and she would understand. She has. Past that, getting on meds and understanding the nature of my old behaviors has allowed me to come to terms with losing a woman whom I loved dearly. I don’t know why I’m typing all of this out. I’m just saying that this will pass like ever other terrible thing that’s happened to you and you will find someone who loves and supports you for who you are. Stay strong.
rule1n2n3 [info] Somewhat highjacking this thread:I had the opposite experience recently, I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 and plagued with mostly depression.I had edible a couple days ago, had too much (always with edibles, they are ticking timebombs) and felt like shit for the next day til now.Is there a thing as too much? Does it actually give you the opposite effect?
itsbudgie [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder and a few other things and in all cases my psychiatrist used my past medical history and other information from other psychiatrists to come up with a diagnosis. If I was you write down what you think your symptoms are and also write down questions you want to ask your doctor. Good luck for the future my friend hope things workout really well for you
anarashka [info] I was prescribed amitriptyline early on in my diagnosis, along with several other medications. It worked great! Except for a previously unknown problem.  Some time after about 3 weeks, I began waking up in places I don't remember falling asleep. When I woke up with half of my bottle of pain relievers scattered on the counter, I stopped taking it.Years later, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Amitriptyline and I don't get along. It causes fugue states.
unkemptsnugglepepper [info] I put myself in a hospital because of suicidal ideation.  I kinda suspected it, but I didn't really accept it until I was looking at a pamphlet that had the symptoms while hanging out in the ER. I knew I had depression since around 6th grade, I was diagnosed with bipolar II when I was 21.     I suggest going to your primary care doctor and explain the symptoms.  They'll recommend you to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and medication.  Possibly a therapist too.  I also suggest cutting out substance use, as it can interact with the medication, especially alcohol.
HB1C [info] That struck me too. I used to think meds weren’t necessary until I was diagnosed with bipolar-boy was I wrong! After 3 years of going on and off them and having destructive manic episodes, it turns out I do need them if I’d like to live a productive life.Just like any other chronic condition (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, insert your disease of choice). There is no shame in needing a medication, and mental health (including sobriety!) is just as important as physical health, if not more.And major NTA-I hope your husband can get back on the path to recovery ASAP.
shibany [info] That's what I thought at first when I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, but I don't think that every time I feel good it's an "episode" and that I need to cool my jets...since starting tracking my moods and activities a month ago I'm beginnj g to see that sometimes I feel good BECAUSE I did stuff, not the other way around, y'know? Also, when I'm hypomanic I feel agitation beneath the euphoria, like I haven't done enough or I don't feel in control. Anyway, noticing those differences is helping me enjoy...life more. Instead of looking over my shoulder for the demon every time I'm starting to enjoy it.
sadcthulu [info] Yes! But I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder.
missholls910 [info] It’s so true! I’m a millennial and there are so many people that I grew up with that claimed they had some sort of mental illness that they over came when really it was like they had a hard day once. On the flip side, my boomer mother.... when I told her I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I had to explain to her that I was not “going all crazy like Charlie Sheen”. And when I told her it was genetic, her response was “well it certainly didn’t come from me”. After the conversation she then proceeded to spend $20,000 for a weekend trip to the Kentucky derby.....
justalurkerkthxbai [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and given medication. It made all the difference in the world.
capricorn_bus [info] I am SO GLAD that you posted this. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last fall, I described (what I didn't know was) hypomania as getting a star in Mario Kart while driving on Rainbow Road, except the power-up (and the road) never stopped--like you can't brake or exit. Neither of them (my therapist or psychiatrist) understood the reference (lol) but it was one of the only ways I knew how to describe it.
ByePolarCoordinates [info] I’m sorry you are going through this. It’s not an easy journey. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder several years into my marriage. I had been with my partner for about ten years at that point when things started to manifest as severe, recurrent depressions. Depression excels at feeding those afflicted terrible, soul-crushing lies about their environment and self-worth. When I was in this state and was approached by my husband for physical intimacy, it was terrifying. I cared for my husband, but I was incapable of feeling any love for myself. The whole idea of sharing myself with someone felt threatening and foreign. Over time, frustrations and resentments grew, and I felt so pressured any time the subject came up. I needed better communication and I would have hugely benefited from strengthening emotional intimacy during this precarious time without any expectation of sex. I needed validation and we needed open honesty. I needed to feel safe. But over time his resentment grew because his needs were not being met. Because I was constantly being pressured, any time he became affectionate this would often trigger me and make me fear it would lead to sex. I hated this feeling - it felt like almost a loss of trust on my end. I was afraid to be touched, and physical touch has always been one of my top love languages. It did not help my sense of alienation or my depression. During an episode, my husband talked me into a night where I would submit and let him seduce me. I wanted to feel good and please him despite all the lies my mind was feeding me. It ended up being emotionally overwhelming and I spent a couple of hours crying in the bathroom afterwards. He had nothing to say to me and seemed irritated which made things worse. Some of his behavior was certainly selfish. But I know for the most part he felt personally rejected or perhaps inadequate with each disappointing exchange, and I wish I had had the capacity to communicate that I still wanted and needed him. Depression doesn’t just hurt its sufferers. It affects us all. It’s not an easy road to travel. Is your partner in treatment? This makes a big difference. I would prioritize emotional intimacy right now. Physical intimacy may follow naturally once she feels safe and supported. My husband and I eventually sought counseling while I was in treatment but it was probably too late to repair our relationship. Once I properly stabilized, my husband later admitted he didn’t think he knew how to properly emotionally support me and that he needed to work on that. We separated and our divorce was finalized last year. I’m stable, happy, and healthy and have enjoyed much better physical intimacy with men that communicate and emote. :)
ProxiC3 [info] I take Vyvanse (90 mg), Latuda and Lithium.  I used to take Dexedrine and Vyvanse but they recently switched it to a higher dose of Vyvanse.I was diagnosed with bipolar first.  My psychologist was the first to see the ADHD, so then I got an independent assessment done with a psychiatrist who specializes in comorbid disorders.  He agreed with the ADHD.
gentle_but_strong [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder last fall. Before that, I would experience these highs and lows that I didn’t understand. I would be really depressed for months, and then hyperactive/on top of the world for others. My grades were either stellar or subpar. I was either the sweetest most upbeat girl around, or the most depressing and moody elephant in the room. It ruined friendships, how I handled conflict, how much I could grow as a person. Now, I am medicated. Now that the fog has lifted so to speak, I’m able to look back on all the horrible things I did and how horribly I treated my partner (he’s a saint and has literally helped me through this diagnosis more than anything), embarrassing moments, money wasted, etc. I am now doing much better, my relationship is in excellent shape, and I’m able to critically think and react in an acceptable way. This was the worst experience with mental health. If you think something’s wrong, please get treatment, because you are hurting people whether you realize it or not.
fullfacejunkie [info] My sister has BPD and she is so genuinely caring even though she may go on and on about certain topics and ruminate and get overly excited. But she cares so much about others even over herself.When I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I asked my doctor if it was possible that it was actually BPD. She said, "no, you wanna know why? Because I like you." No, people with BPD aren't all monsters or unlikable and I bet she's misdiagnosed people just because they weren't class-A monsters. 
Stilllovemyring [info] Do you know the bipolar subreddits?  join!I am diagnosed with bipolar 1. For me it’s medication or death during an episode. I struggled for years to come to terms with having to take my meds but ultimately they make my life much more worth living. Thats just my personal experience. It can be such a struggle and you’re tough for getting this far.
wooptyd00 [info] You're downvoting all my posts and asserting my non-schizo diagnosis was not properly done. You sound like a passive aggressive troll trying to convince me I'm schizo... This wasn't the only time I was diagnosed with bipolar btw. My personal psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar years before that hospital did.
starter_kit [info] After a psychotic episode put me in the hospital 9 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I'm still learning how to cope.Two years ago my Dx was changed to Schizoaffective disorder-bipolar type.During the first six years of life after my initial diagnosis I took my meds and lived a relatively stable, mostly fulfilling and very productive life.  I also supplemented my medicine with copious amounts of alcohol.  With time the meds and booze were working so well that my doctor changed my status to "in remission".  This turned out to be a bad move as I quickly became relaxed with treatment.  Psychotic behavior returned and I ended up in the hospital for a second and third time.Coming to terms with the fact that I have a chronic life long condition is daunting.  I don't always think about it but at least once or twice a day I feel terrorized by my illness.Medication is a must.  Therapy needs to be considered and tried.  Group support has been invaluable to me.  Other things I find that are helpful for managing my affliction are journaling, mood tracking, hiking and playing my music at top volume.I've been changed by my illness.  I am far more lonely but also far more resilient.  I am far more anxious but have a greater sense of gratitude.  My meds dull my experiences but I have filled in some gaps in my intellect.Good luck on your your journey.  Consider  and   There is quallity support in the world if you are committed to wellness.
lavloves [info] There are people out there that NEVER realize that they’re an asshole, or manipulative, or just a hard headed person. Either they never realize it or they’ve got their head stuck too far up their ass that they will absolutely not admit to it, or even attempt to see it. This is a VERY goof thing that you’ve noticed. I never really thought about how bad I was in highschool/middle school, until I got on my old iPad ( it synced to my old phone and all of these texts from way back were on there. ) from how I treated my friends, from how I treated the guys I dated, Once I saw those texts, I felt so disgusted with myself. In one convo this poor guy I had dated was pouring his heart out to me, telling me that I broke his heart and had cheated on him, and I was cussing him out in return and calling him all sorts of names. I felt so bad I was in tears, I actually sent him a message telling him that I’m so sorry and I cannot believe I used to be like that, and you know what he said? “Wow! This is something I never expected to hear!”. I must have been pretty damn bad. He was very sweet about it though and told me he forgave me a long time ago. I believe I apologized to a few other people as well, and there’s still some I wish I could apologize to, but I’m no longer able to get in touch with them. I didn’t have a very good home life, my parents divorced. Lots of fighting between me and my mom, whom I didn’t live with, me and my dad always fought and argued, I mean yelling in each other’s faces fighting, verbally abusive, he had a girlfriend who was terrible to me, I just wasn’t very happy and I guess I let myself take it out on those who were around me. I was on antidepressants from a really young age, I think 13? I never really thought my home life was that bad, until I started to think back on it a little bit and I realized how broken it actually was, and how it broke me. Just because there were other households a lot worse than mine, doesn’t mean it wasn’t terrible. Leaving my childhood home, and moving out was probably the best thing to happen to me in terms for my mental health. I also smoked a lot of weed, which I think also made me reflect on myself and life a lot, I’m not saying you need to do this I’m just saying I think it definitely switched something in my brain lmao. Maybe I’m just permastoned and permanently “chilled out”.I have a way better relationship with both of my parents now, I have had stable friends for years who I love to death, I’m engaged to a great man who brings out the good in me, I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2, which I’m not saying is an excuse to be mean, but it could have been a factor in all of my past assholeishness. I actually think that I still feel so guilty of how I used to be to people that I try to overcompensate when it comes to helping people out, or giving advice. I just want people to know that I’m there for them and that I’ll listen. Because that’s probably what old me needed the most, was somebody to listen and understand. You have a lot of time to reflect and think on this, think of some of the worst things you’ve done or said to people, think of how much that hurt said person, think of how they must have felt.. and put yourself in their shoes. Really think on your life right now, at a glance you may think everything is fine and nothing seems bad, because you may be living comfortably, not struggling with money, parents might still be together, but that doesn’t mean things aren’t going haywire and you’re maybe just oblivious to it. I’m not saying this is what’s happening. If you really want to change, you will. You’re feeling guilt, and noticing your habits, that’s GOOD. Just try to understand yourself more, it takes time but eventually you’ll see how your brain works and you’ll be able to figure out why you say or do what, or why you react a certain way to things..  the rest will come easier afterwards. Good luck man.
Mellamellamella [info] I am bipolar and unmedicated. It's going pretty terribly if I'm being honest. I was supposed to have a psych consult on the 19th so I could start medication but it was cancelled. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in November and was put on a waitlist for the medication consult. I finally get called, and then this global pandemic happens and they said I'll get a call next month, meaning I'm probably not getting in until May. I just feel like I'm getting worse but there is actually nothing I can do because I won't be able to get a prescription to stabilize my mood for a while. So each night I just go to sleep crossing my fingers hoping I don't wake up feeling worse.
bettygreatwhite [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II 6 years into my marriage. I was first diagnosed with really bad post-partum and then regular depression that just wouldn't respond to medication.  It sucked, but not knowing what was wrong with me was worse. Thankfully, my husband who had been my friend for years and then my partner for 8, has stuck through it and is an integral part of my support system. We're just figuring it out as we go. Basically, this is a long way of saying that I get what you've gone/are going through. 
viral_snyde [info] I mean. I just dont have an attachment to being alive is the best way to put it. I dont care that I'm alive but I get so envious of death around me.

Hopefully no one else does. Hopefully it can just be me and I can die from it.I just don't think I should be alive. It just feels wrong.
sony_alarm_clock [info] I'm so sorry this is happening. I was diagnosed with bipolar three years ago and I know it can be hard for people to live with me sometimes, you're really strong for sticking with it. I don't know if this will help at all, but once I got a diagnosis and a good psychiatrist and therapist, I've been able to live a fairly stable life for a good while. There's hope that things will get better.&#x200B;I'm sorry to hear about your father, that's heartbreaking. Have you considered seeing a therapist? One might be able to help you sort out some emotions and figure out ways to cope and communicate. I'm here if you want to talk, hang in there 
idreamofcake [info] I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder from my early teens to my late thirties, when I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. And getting proper treatment changed my life. So it's definitely worth looking into.I can't diagnose you over the internet, but you should definitely see a psychiatrist for a diagnosis. Your agoraphobia is more than just social anxiety if you can't leave the house. It sounds like the SSRI'S aren't helping you, and even if you don't have bipolar, working with a psychiatrist to try different classes of medications would be helpful. I'm hoping the best for you in your mental health journey.
AmNotLost [info] I tell them by date 3 or so. Though sometimes I'll start it as "you know how some people have epilepsy and their brain goes all haywire in their motor cortex sometimes? Well I kinda get something similar, but instead it's in my amygdala, so my emotions will not match my current experience. And sometimes it isn't like a quick thing, sometimes it can last for a while until my brain can heal a little. So if I get a sudden mood shift and I don't seem like myself, go ahead and ask if I'm ok, but please never ever assume it's that you've done or said something wrong. I'm usually aware it's happening and ASAP try to find a calming spot to de-stimulate for a while. But I know I'm not always in the moment able to vocalize exactly why I left the room, or whatever, right when I'm doing it."Though if they seem to have any experience with mental health or the medical profession, I usually just say "hey, just kinda FYI, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 28. I've been hospitalized once, but now that I have meds that work most no one would ever notice."gentle_but_strong [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder last fall.

If you think something’s wrong, please get treatment, because you are hurting people whether you realize it or not.shadowscale1031 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 while in college. It was definitely challenging, as the chaos of college and the chaos of bipolar don’t often go well together. That said, I still graduated and have done well since, so here are some things that have helped me, although many I didn’t learn until after graduation.-Get established with a mental heath provider early, especially if you’re on medication. It can take awhile, and you don’t want to navigate that system while in crisis. Campus therapists aren’t always great with managing illnesses like bipolar, but they can help with managing stress and the transition to college life.-Take your medication consistently. There were times when I would go off mood stabilizers during hypomania to get a “manic boost” during a particularly busy time. Don’t do that. The ugly side of hypomania doesn’t take long to come out.-Get enough sleep. Way easier said than done, but I’ve found that my emotional stability is nonexistent when I don’t sleep. This is one I only figured out once I graduated and actually had a regular sleep schedule.-Find what motivates you and make sure it’s somewhere you’re reminded often. I’m a goal-oriented person, so thinking about how what I’m doing (or not doing) will affect those goals helps me stay focused. In college, I changed my laptop background to whatever motivator I needed at the time (gentle support, kick in the ass, funny and relatable, my pets). Phone backgrounds as well. -Find a support system, aka make friends. Join clubs that interest you. It’ll help you feel more invested in staying. Networking with professionals in my field through campus events also helped with motivation, because it helped excite me about what I could do once I had my degree.-Learn your limits. Manic me likes to sign me up for way more than non-manic me can handle. If that happens, don’t be afraid to step back from lower priority things. I once had to resign from an extracurricular I cared a lot about due to academic overload, and I still remember my advisor saying “You’re here to get a degree, not to be Vice President of this club”. -Learn how to cope with stress. You mention alcohol, and at one point I did develop a problem because I was using it as a coping mechanism for stress. Once I realized I couldn’t keep drinking like I was and still meet my goals (see point above), I changed and learned other ways to manage stress. But I had to hit that breaking point to finally start learning healthy coping mechanisms. If you can, try to find those before you end up too deep in something harmful.-Be kind to yourself. Learning to live with bipolar is mostly trial and error as you figure out triggers, treatments, and coping mechanisms that work for you. There will be a lot of failures and mistakes, but the faster you can get back up and move forward with what you’ve learned, the better off you’ll be.I hope this helps. Good luck!
_killjoy99 [info] I prefer female therapists and psychiatrists because I've had bad experiences with male doctors. My first psychiatrist was male when I was 14-17 and he just chalked up all my symtoms (including self hard, attempts at my own life,  eating disorders and depression so bad I couldn't leave my bed for over 6 months) as my "hormones balancing" and that "puberty is difficult on females because their whole biological function changes in order to prepare for having children" which apparently included me being so depressed I needed hospitalization. He also refused to connect me with help after I turned 18 because "my hormones won't be raging then" and I was left without help until I found it on my own. Since I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2, generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, and EDNOS and am working towards being better. But also fuck dr. Stein for saying girls just get depressed as teens because of "raging hormones"
ontopofyourmom [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 29. It has ruined my life. I do what I can to make things better, but this is a serious and chronic illness that I will have until the day I die.I suspect that the other poster is in an analogous situation.You ask what we have learned? We've learned a lot - but nothing we can learn will make us get better or reduce our symptoms. Diseases affect plants' ability to grow. The same thing is true for human beings.Our growth might be going up a flight of stairs in a 100-story building that we used to work at the top of. It's a step in the right direction, but it's not going to solve your problems - especially when you have to stop at every floor for more bullshit.Please acknowledge this and cut out the toxic positivity.
loony1uvgood [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 but I feel all of this. I now wonder if there's comorbidity. Is that possible or it was wrong diagnosis. Especially awareness of self destructive behavior.
lsmels [info] Hi I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2 and GAD. I take seroquel XR and took it all through my pregnancy and currently while BFing. I was on 200mg but dropped it down to 50mg. I'm also prescribed klonopin as needed but I'm much more leery to take this if I know I'll be feeding soon and I only took it 2 or 3 times during pregnancy. My psych is super conscientious about meds and pregnancy and made me nervous about benzos while breastfeeding. My psych, OB and baby's pediatrician all know about the seroquel and didn't have an issue with it, and I didn't notice any withdrawal symptoms in him after birth. I also used to take lamictal and my psych didn't have any issue with that but did tell me to start taking a folic acid supplement along with my prenatal due to he chance of neural tube defects.
bipolarpug [info] Can I ask what bipolar type you are? Are you on any other medication? How often do you smoke? I've been diagnosed with bipolar II, but I've long struggled with anxiety depression and ADD. Smoking always gives me perspective on my mental health that makes me realize everything will be alright, like you describe. But other times it gives me really bad anxiety and panic attacks, I always question whether it is safe for me or not as there is such conflicting anecdotal evidence everywhere..
all__lies__and__jest [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression first. An antidepressant sent me into hypomania. That’s how I was diagnosed with bipolar.
glorywesst [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar2 when I was 40ish. Before that I simply got treatment for my depression. I’m 59 now and thinking that I have ADHD and maybe even some form of autism.I plan to get tested for ADHD to see if this is true. The more I’ve been reading on Reddit and seeing myself, it’s getting very scary. Also it answer so many questions about issues I’ve had for years. I am totally terrified of stimulants though as a treatment plan. Stimulants make me rage, and I have been in a hypo manic phase now for several months and it’s killing me. Maybe even mixed episodes, I’m not sure, the crying is totally out of control. Rages are something else. They scare me and those around me.If I wasn’t a person of faith, I don’t know what would happen. But because I am a person of faith, I know all this crap in my brain is not reality and I’m able to hang on until it passes. Also, I’m old enough to have seen the phases come and go. So I do know that things change, and can change for the better when getting treatment. I have appointments this week and next to follow up on all of this.I hope you will continue with your treatment and be able to tough it out. Better things wait for you on the other side.Edited to say: Your symptoms sound terribly similar to mine. Although I don’t have a diagnosis of ADHD I am going to try and find out if I have it.
speculatingserpent [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder, GAD, and ADHD.
abc3612 [info] I get why you are asking this and although I was diagnosed with bipolar after having kids so I may have decided differently had I known prior, my kids are the reason I keep going every single day. They have saved me from myself more times than I can count. I do worry about one of them becoming bipolar but I also feel like it makes me mindful of their mental health and I’m ready to step in and help them should they ever need it. That is something I wish my parents had done.
alisa_emily [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar2 about 9 years ago, and I only just started EMDR to address underlying trauma last month. Getting a diagnosis is scary, but now you can start to get better. It will be really hard, but you can find treatment that works for you.
theskittlestubesock [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 I was on Effexor. It made me really manic. Then once I was diagnosed they added lithium and it helped but I still got mania quite often. It really helped with depression though.
Sneezehiccupfart [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder in 2010. I met my future husband 9 months later. I think in the beginning what I did was make personal goals and was determined not to date until I felt better about myself and put in effort into meaningful friendships. Well one of those friendships blossomed into a marriage. I told him about my diagnosis about 1mo in and gave him an out bur he never took it. I would say love is absolutely possible, but I would focus on meaningful relationships first. Once you build yourself up it will inevitably happen. You dont have to spill everything on a first date. Challenge yourself to go a few months without dating and see where things lead.
plmtigr [info] Just replying to let you know that reading this warmed my heart, because I identify with it so much. I discovered polyamory (now relationship anarchy) before I was diagnosed with bipolar. My partner who I was originally monogamous also has agency and chooses to remain monogamous. Space is such an essential component in my life, I can never imagine being the way that I am and living with someone else without eventually lashing out and/or being triggered into a depressive episode. I need space to learn things about myself without any external influences.
UpsAndDownsNeverEnd [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in the late winter a little over 4 years ago. It all started when I was roughly 18. I remember my high school girlfriend crying because she just couldn't seem to make me happy. That was the beginning of years of emotional hell. Bipolar 2 is focused around depression, and my episodes would last months at a time. Relatively long compared to how most cycle. But what got me in was a 1 month manic episode. Toward the end after a month of mistakes I was with this girl coming down off of mdma. She gave me a xanax and it ripped me out of the manic episode. Over the course of a couple hours I went from the happiest person in the world to staring down suicidal thoughts again. Few days later, was scrambling to get help cause I wasn't going to survive another year without help. I've been going regularly since, cause I know if I go without medication I probably will take my own life. Medication isn't perfect, still get depressed. But nothing like it used to be. 
thatgirlanya [info] Definitely look into bipolar. Adhd and bipolar are often diagnosed together. I was diagnosed with bipolar first and then adhd. Once I got the right mood stabilizer, it literally changed my life. I didn’t realize the kind of behavior I was exhibiting until I was stable. I’m able to take stimulants and mood stabilizers and I don’t have any problems with them inducing mania. I can see how if you aren’t stabilized, stimulants could easily cause mania. Hope you find some answers!
kcl086 [info] For me it was impulsivity. I had a psychiatrist tell me I just needed to talk to my therapist about it after talking to me for 15 minutes. I had a back up appointment with an APRN a week later. After taking a 90 minute history, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
lollypopsandcupcakes [info] I feel that if I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder or any other mental illness my Nmom would have the same reaction. I hope that over time there is a possibility that he comes to accept it and gets help
twandar [info] I completely understand. I got a tattoo of a psychic vision I had to remind me of my psychic abilities and the spiritual realm. A month later I was diagnosed with bipolar and realized I'm not psychic. I'm actually psychotic and now I have a tattoo to remind me of that every day. It taunted me for a long time until I decided to add to it to represent my bipolar hallucinations. I've entitled it "psychic vs psychotic--the thin line between perception and reality." It's also just a low quality tattoo. So it also stands for imperfection and having to live with our mistakes. So it's now very meaningful to me.
Desirai [info] well, the timeline for me kind of went like this: I had the sudden realization that god/jesus was just like santa, that kids grow out of it. I proudly declared that I didn't believe anymore, because I felt like I was the first person in my class to figure it out. yeah, it didn't work that way. I received immediate backlash, bullying, I became "the antichrist" ... I didn't have internet at this point so I did not know what "atheist" was. I became bullied so bad I became suicidal and depressed. And when I got internet for the first time in 2001, my family blamed the computer for making me suicidal. they took it away to punish me. but it didn't stop the bullying at school, it didn't stop me from hating myself. at some point in that mess, the pledge went out the door too. I felt like if I was defiant enough, someone would finally hear me.later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and myriad of other anxiety disorders and I thank my classmates for contributing to it.
victorioushermit [info] I’ve told part of my close family and now they treat me oddly. They still care about me. They just treat me like I’m fragile. But they’re also supportive. I haven’t told others in my family because I know they wouldn’t react well. For instance my mother in law, knowing I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, has told my spouse to leave me if I ever experience psychosis. So she’s not on my list of people to tell. And similarly my sister tends to use any information she has against me, so I’m not telling her. It’s ok to not tell people, or to only tell certain people. You should do what you need to do to feel safe and comfortable. There isn’t a right or wrong here except what’s right for you.
snailfrymccloud17 [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1. Definitely an extrovert. I have a great psych doc who referred me to a neurologist who solidified the diagnosis. It was very helpful. I also work in case management for severe and persistent mental illness, which gives me a lot of insight into my clients
YearZeroHS [info] Works for both. I was diagnosed with bipolar, the Lamictal helps with my depression and anxiety.
insidetheborderline [info] At 16, I was diagnosed with bipolar I. I think my symptoms started as a kid, really. There were times when I would stay up all night rearranging my room, drawing, singing, dancing, all sorts of other things I would do when I had massive amounts of energy and urges to just *do all the things.* However, I realized I had a problem bigger than "just" depression (which started around 11-12) when I would go from being suicidal to on top of the world over and over again.
awkward_swan [info] Depression and anxiety can be so easily missed sometimes! When my anxiety became bad, I thought I just had a heart problem that was being blown off by doctors (it's just stress! also I'm a woman and I was 17 at the time, I knew they would say anxiety and not heart problem so that made my anxiety/"heart problem" worse). Then my second semester of college I just slept all the time and had no motivation to study or go to class. No sadness or anything like that, just an unwillingness to do things and a need for 12 hours of sleep. I ultimately wised up and saw a counselor on campus, and she told me that was a depressive episode. I did not figure it out myself, wtf. She also told me that the "heart condition" that started at 17 was likely panic attacks. Again, no idea those were panic attacks, or how frequently those are confused for heart attacks.So then I saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed zoloft, an SSRI. I had a lot of hesitations, but at that point I needed help and therapy was doing great but it wasn't enough. When the zoloft kicked in, I thought I was feeling better. However, a lot of things were really off. I was only sleeping 3-4 hours at a time, and whenever I felt like it not just at night. I was cleaning obsessively, like hand-washing all my dishes 3 times in a row. For about a week, I thought the only thing humans needed to eat were bananas, like the chimps who are so closely related to us (I obviously know chimps don't only eat bananas and that humans have different nutritional needs than other primates....). This lasted like a month, and there are other things that happened that I don't want to type. Point is that, once again, something was going on with my mental health and I couldn't recognize that at all, even months after this happened. I finally told a new psychiatrist about it over a year later, and that's when I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder. That doctor was actually suspicious that I had it but telling him about that crazy month sealed it in for him.For those who don't know, it was a manic episode that made me not sleep, clean excessively, etc. that was caused by the zoloft. People with bipolar disorders can easily experience them on SSRI's or SNRI's, especially when taken on their own, which is unfortunate because those are the first meds they prescribe for depression, and for me it gave me my first manic episode.Where the hell would my life be now if I never sought help for this? Even with treatment, things are difficult, but I could have so easily just not have gotten help. I know quite a few people with bipolar disorder that don't get regular treatment, and they're in and out of hospitals and frequent drug users and stuff and continue in this cycle (I love all of them and support them, I just notice the patterns). At the same time, others I didn't even know had bipolar disorder until they told me what meds they were on and they're the same as mine. So when people tell me I "don't seem bipolar", it's not that they're denying I have this illness, it's that the treatment is working.If things are off, just get help! And be honest! Seriously. The professionals know more than you do. Anything that's off, just tell them. Mental health professionals are there to help. Even if they mess up, their intention is always to help you. Do not put it off. It's been a little over 10 years since this started and I will be at my psych appointment this time tomorrow because treatment and regular check-ins are super important!
ken2014 [info] I mean I can go a few days but then I become completely manic. I've been diagnosed with bipolar but there's question that my manic states have just been from not sleeping. It's awful! I hope you get some sleep soon
jingjang1 [info] Same as then, but i am about to ask for another fresh diagnosis. I am diagnosed with bipolar type 2, but i am just now starting to grasp that i had a psychotic episode about a year ago. Which would make it type 1 and perhaps treated differently.
stripedfire [info] Thank you for taking the time to do this! It's great that you're reaching out and educating others, especially when I'm sure you're very busy. I've got a few questions for you. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and typically have manic states that last less than 8 hours. Long manias are VERY rare for me. I thought for a minute I might actually have BPD but confirmed I don't. How common is this situation for those with bipolar? Is there anything else that might be going on to cause it?Also on a separate note, I want my career to be researching and solving chemical imbalances so I can do what I can to find cures (or better solutions) for bipolar, depression, Parkinsons, and such. What job role comes to mind when you hear that? 
famousdanish [info] I relate to your sister's experience: becoming nocturnal, suicidal, not taking care of my body.Depression just sucks out the fight, the motivation. Anhedonia is one term that describes these symptoms.For me, when I'm depressed, someone trying to force me to do something would make me recoil more. So, I can only say, don't try to change her. Maybe you could softly suggest seeing a therapist or starting medicine, if she has not tried these paths.Another idea: suggest going for a walk? And when you walk just try to be there for her, doesn't even matter if you twi don't talk or discuss her depression. Just be a support, be there.Also, time heals. For me, I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so my depressive episodes have always lifted, just months or even a year later. Even if your sister isn't bipolar, I had a therapist who said "depression always lifts". Depression is episodic, even if it's chronic.For probably better, tested ways of help, I'd recommend looking into family support books for depression. I see [this book](https://www.amazon.com/When-Someone-You-Know-Depression-ebook/dp/B07DFP3FYY/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=dealing+with+depressed+family+member&qid=1588285047&sr=8-2) looks interesting.
pabloblessedcobar [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 close to a year ago now. She is aware of this though, I told her fairly early on in the relationship. Because it's quite a severe and at times impairing condition it doesn't really seem fair to not give a heads up about it to a significant other.
LaneyyCakes [info] Hey guys, so I've been dating my boyfriend now for 8 months. He's 22 and I'm 19. We met in college and had the time of our lives together. We're absolutely head over heels for each other and are talking about getting married. The problem is, he graduated last spring and moved to Indiana for grad school while I'm still taking classes in Delaware. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in the spring of last year and shortly after, tried to commit suicide. Since then I've been living at home with my parents and taking part time classes at the University. I absolutely hate living at home and I feel like it's making me feel so much worse about myself. Me and my boyfriend decided to give it a trial run and I went to visit for a week in August. I had the time of my life and he hadnt seen me that happy since we lived together in Delaware. While I was there I decided to stay an extra three days. I called my mom and she proceeded to tell me that I was ruining her summer and that she's disappointed in me. Fast forward to now, me and my boyfriend have decided on moving in together on the 26 of December. I have no doubts this is the right move but the only thing that worries me is telling me parents. Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I'm absolutely horrified to bring this up. 
Kaniela420 [info] I've never been officially diagnosed with 1 or 2, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar 3 times by different Dr's and therapists. I can tell you though that I most definitely am more inclined to believe I am bipolar 1, as I experience auditory hallucinations at times, and some pretty ghastly psychosis experiences. But, I've never been hospitalized for it, and apparently a lot of folks read that in a description and believe that to be a pre-requisite for a diagnosis of bipolar 1.I think I'm just better at suppressing my actual thoughts and feelings when I know I have an audience that has the authority to lock me up against my wishes. Probably my misspent youth doing illegal shit and evading cops.  My depressive phases, quite the contrary to what most people describe with 1 and 2, are actually relatively short. I'd say on average maybe 1 to 2 weeks, although I have had a depressive episode last upwards of a year once or twice. My Mania, on the other hand, is frequent and has a mighty large reserve tank when the gas runs low. My longest manic episode I would say lasted more than a year. As I don't have much of a frame of reference for the depressive side, (besides loss of interest in hobbies/things I've enjoyed, staying in bed and staying in my sweats and not bathing for a week at a time, isolating myself from everyone I know and becoming quiet and distant), I'll give you a rundown of what mania/hypomania looks like, for me.It starts out; everything is fucking AWESOME! I have so much energy and I feel so good, I really need to get this house clean! Oh wow I finished the house in no time! You know what, I should really clean out my closet and get rid of a bunch of shit I don't wear.... You know what? I'm having such a great day, and it's so beautiful out, I should have a Corona! Wow this beer tastes good, I think I'll have 1 or 2 more. Hmm.... I have a pretty nice buzz going, but I really feel like having a shot. I'm gonna go for a drive to the next town over that has the only liquor store in the valley open on Sundays and bump some gangsta rap. Man it sucks being in such a celebratory mood and not having anyone to hang out with, I'm gonna start blowing up Facebook with funny commentary and trying to hit up all my long lost friends on chat! Oh my God I have such a great idea on how to effectively make our partnership with our global convergys reps more cohesive! And while I'm at it, I'm going to put a training together on how to use our engineering coverage maps, I guess that means I'll have to learn how to ACTUALLY be what I always claim to be on my resumes, "proficient" in PowerPoint! Fuck it, I'll figure it out, I'll just wing it! Oh shit only 2 hours before my husband gets home and he doesn't like it when I drink, I wonder if I have time to pop in to the bar around the corner and have a couple crown and cokes and make it back here before he gets home... I just want to socialize a little bit! Next morning, after blacking out and getting maaaaybe 3 hours of sleep. "Oh damn. I think I might still be a little drunk. How did I even make it to bed last night? Why is my husband sleeping on the couch? No time to deal with that dfamay, gotta get ready to go get dis bread!" *Spends a COPIOUS amount of time fixing hair and makeup and getting those wings JUST RIGHT. Takes forever picking out a necklace and boots to accessorize perfectly* "well shit. I'm 10 minutes late as usual. Where are my damn keys!?" *Gets to work, spends entire morning meeting interrupting everyone and trying to make sure I command the most attention and have a funny comment or anecdote for every single topic that is mentioned.* *Starts on PowerPoint for that great idea I had last night. "Oh you need me to help you work your follow-ups? Sure! Bring em on! Gosh our servicing partners have a lot of questions, but I absolutely can NOT leave any of them unanswered. But the more I answer them the more they private message me and only come to me with their questions... Oh well, this should help get me some recognition so I have some visibility for that promotion I always say I don't want..." Before long I am over extended and HIGHLY annoyed and snappy and bitchy with ANYONE that tries to transfer me a call, as if it's their fault I'm busy...Aaaah home after a long day, time to pick a fight with my husband and be annoyed by my son's existence. I need some alone time. I'm gonna go see if there's any leftover fun drugs I can crush and snort. God my life is so MUNDANE and eventless. You know what would make me feel better? Some retail therapy. I'm gonna buy a bunch of clothes online and then because I can't wait I'm gonna go to a local store and buy a cute new outfit! None of my clothes fit me anymore because I've already dropped a fuckton of weight because I'm manic, plus I just cleaned out my closet today, I've earned it! This goes on, and on, and ON, for days or weeks, my fuse gets shorter and shorter and I fucking RAGE and go mad hoss at the slightest inconvenience. Then, thanks to good ol lack of sleep and photo editing projects, I start hearing shit. "What is that sound? Why does it sound like 2 morning radio DJ's talking? I don't have the radio on... Why is it so muffled like I can't ever make out what they're actually saying??" Then, the visual fuckery comes into play. -ESPECIALLY- if I am home alone, which I fucking HATE being home alone as I am convinced that the bad man has been laying in wait, waiting for the opportunity for me to be alone so he can rape/murder me. Throw that in with the eye fuckery and the muffled voices of 2 dudes in another room... We've got ourselves a party! I once carried a 9mm throughout the house all night and all morning long, convinced that there were people in the house that were going to get me. I saw someone's glasses reflecting in the moonlight watching me from the park across the street... I even called the cops and made them patrol my house. Twice. My house is fucking tiny. With paper thin walls. I can't believe they didn't haul my ass off. The best one was my most recent psychosis though, where I became convinced that my hairline was receding and that it was caused by scalp ringworm I must have gotten from my son or our dog. I walked around the house, spraying the walls with bleach water, I thought the cobwebs were mold or some sort of fungus that wanted to collect my hair. The spiders in the shower were watching me in eager wait to collect my hair, I saw them eating it, or making a web with it, I wasn't sure which. The flies were working with them, it was a covert op where they would dive bomb me, snatch my hair and give it to the spiders, who would then in turn give it to the mold monsters. I wore a beanie inside at all times, to try to protect my hair. It went on for several days, and didn't stop until my husband came and collected me out of the front yard, where I was sitting, picking ringworm pebbles out of a beanie I had just pulled out of the dryer, refusing to go inside because I didn't want to lose any more of my hair... He had to walk me around and make me point out the things I was seeing, so that he could explain them away for me. THAT. was a real muthafucka of a psychosis. Worst one yet, though thus far I've only had about 4 major events since I was diagnosed. As I get older, my symptoms get worse, even with medication. My rage gets more severe, my fuse shorter, the flight of rapid fire ideas, becoming early overwhelmed, crippling fear of calling places for bills, Dr's appts, basically any grown up obligation. And the presence of those auditory hallucinations definitely grows more prevalent. And so, yeah.... That about sums it up... Sound anything like your thing? Lol
KatelynnH222 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after having cycles of hypomania, where I was motivated and spent money for a few months, then depression where I literally sat at home pretty much the whole time for a few months. And then a period of time where I would be okay I guess. The "behavioral issues" pretty much come from when I'm not on meds sometimes I do things without thinking about other people. Not that i hurt others but apparently everything I do affects someone else. Example- me and my sister shared a car, I moved out and took the car. I pawned the car title to pay rent and my family got mad because I "stole" my sister's car, so when I got a job a couple months later the money went in her account and she kept some of the money because apparently I "owed her". Tbh maybe I'm just an asshole but the diagnosis happened after that
ATXNerd01 [info] Hey there, my kids are my #1 motivation for getting stable and staying stable. It's really useful to have a good understanding of your triggers. My kids also sometimes trigger me (too much touching, usually). Their routine also helps me stay stable, so it's a balancing act overall. I understand what you mean when you say you can't let your kid down. I worry about that a lot. I know that I can't be perfect, but I hope that I can be a good model for what you do when you struggle with mental health: You find meds that work, you tell your doctor the truth, you ask for help when you need it, and you give yourself compassion when you're struggling. Considering my kids' genetics, that's a lesson that they're going to need. I don't know if you've stumbled upon this information yet, or not, but the hormonal changes of your period can really, really affect your bipolar mood episodes. If I'm off-balance emotionally before I get my period, there's a really good chance that I'm going to have a mixed episode that crests right around when my period starts. If I'm pretty stable, then a period just gives me a small wobble of mood instability. This has been going on since I was a young teenager, even before I fully realized that I suffer from depression, and decades before I was diagnosed with bipolar. It sounds like you get similar symptoms. I was relieved to find out that it's not just me, that I could predict how long until the shitty episode was over, and that it's not completely out of my control. 
stars_are_silent [info] I don't talk to my mom about it.  That's my solution.  Anytime I've ever brought up depression,  she recommends that I think happy thoughts on my commute, or take longer walks with my dog.  She also thinks medication is probably causing any problems that I have ("sometimes the side effects of all those medications are worse than what they are supposed to fix"). The last time it came up she suggested I might have a food sensitivity.  So, in the last 10 years, we've probably talked about my "problems" less than 10 times.  She doesn't even know I was diagnosed with bipolar.  Anyways, all that to say - I love my mom.  She means well, but she is not helpful and she is not part of my support system as far as bipolar, etc.  I have friends that I can talk to about it and I have a therapist.  I look to my mom for support about lots of other things, so it's not like she isn't there for me.  For me, it's not worth damaging our relationship with hurt feelings and resentment over this.  Take your meds and pursue your treatment on your own.  Don't let them discourage you.  You sound like you know what you need.  Trust yourself.  Good luck!
funsizedcase [info] I have bipolar 2. I know they are a bit different, but for what it is worth, I was being treated with SSRIs for depression and anxiety. Once I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, I was switched to Trintellix. It’s a much better antidepressant fit for me. I am also on a mood stabilizer called Lamictal. This medication helped so much!! It was like night and day. I appreciate your post and pls know that you and your wife are not alone in this battle. It’s hard and totally unfair, but I am so grateful for ppl out there like you, and many others, who love deeply and help. I wish you and your wife the best. Take care, friend.
cmcbryant1 [info] I don’t know if this is a safe space for me to post. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 3 years ago. I finally have a stable job but I have a lot of difficulties with it. I have made sure not to involve anyone in my life until now. I know this may not be the same situation but I thought maybe some brief thoughts could help. When my moods swing low [depression] I am completely lost. I don’t want to eat or do the things I love. Yes I get lonely and want my new significant other to be with me when I am like this. However, we have set up boundaries for these circumstances. I do not aspect him to be always by my side when this happens. Sometimes I actually just need to be alone and get afraid to hurt his feelings by telling him so. These periods honestly become a blur when you look back. You are going over and beyond for him as far as I can tell. Sometimes it will be best for you to be doing your own thing while he has these episodes. Unfortunately you can not do anything to pull him out of it. The person he was has currently changed and now you will have to figure each other out again. This DOES NOT mean you should have to give up your life for him. I recommend going to therapy or the doctors with him to get on the same page though. I promise things will start to level out for ya’ll. It is a learning curve for you both. He will need to get adjusted to his new life as will you.  You have to remember that you must be mentally strong now too though. You must still take care of your own mental health!!
Asdewq123456 [info] One of the best moments of my life was when I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at 28. I finally knew what was wrong with me. Continued in therapy and drug therapy. Kept me alive through numerous suicide attempts and hospitalizations.I am happy for you.  It takes a lot to admit you have a problem. Never give up
pink-carnations [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and I find that weed usually calms me down. That being said there are a lot of things that can trigger manic episodes so it is possible. It doesn’t sound like you were smoking that much though, so I’d place my bet on some other extenuating circumstance.
RadicalFemale [info] Hey there! I’m 36 F and just started treatment for adhd. I was like you, super smart with a high iq that sailed through school, until high school. Being restricted to a desk was awful and I didn’t do homework or know how to study. I was also very compliant and eager to please until adolescence.I was diagnosed with bipolar and have been treated for it since I was 24. I’ve brought up my executive functioning problems to several of my doctors over the years. If I was so smart how could I have no common sense and be so stupid??Well, I had my teen daughter tested for adhd as she had symptoms. She was diagnosed. I was able to go to my psychiatrist and by explaining my symptoms, what area of life they affected (all of them. If I don’t see a paper bill it doesn’t get paid.) and with the dx for my child in light of how heritable adhd is he diagnosed it. We started with Wellbutrin because since I’m bipolar I don’t want to see off a manic episode with stimulants.There are so many of us women that fell through this crack. I’m glad we’re getting up.
Eechimine [info] I only just started it yesterday and my experience was positive and negative. I am diagnosed with bipolar II, ADHD and GAD. He put me on it because I was having quite a bit of paranoia and constant irrational fear because I just got diagnosed with PTSD as well. He also chose it opposed to other antidepressants because I’ve tried so many of them and they didn’t work.  He also believed that it would be good for me because my depression has mostly been anhedonia related and he thinks this will help that. He warned me that hypomania is a risk from it as well but that is why the lamictal is there too.
divajess [info] I know exactly what you're talking about.  I was terrified to stop taking it.  A few years later, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started taking other medications.Long story short, I stopped taking it because I saw it fueled manic episodes (being a stimulant and all).  I have a combination of mood stabilizers and anti-depressants that helps a lot with anxiety and the mood swings, but my eating is still disordered.  I can feel myself gaining weight and it's terrifying.I'm going to talk to my therapist more about it today.  I don't have an answer, I just wanted to let you know that you're not the only way.EDIT: I wanted to add that I recommend you come clean with the doc.  I lied to my PNP for a long time, and it ended up masking other issues.  Perhaps you need a different med, and they can't help you unless they know.  That's for the cloudy judgement :)
Superficial_Charm [info] The psychiatrist who I saw recently suggested that I may have had childhood bipolar disorder, and I think that he may be on to something.  He also suggested that the condition can be triggered by a mother's post-partum depression, of which my mother had a severe case.  I am diagnosed with bipolar II currently, as well as ADHD, OCD, GAD, and PTSD.I definitely had a hyperthymic personality as a child; extremely talkative and bubbly.  Every so often I would feel blissful, like everything was right with the world, even though I lived in a neglectful and abusive household.  I would get bursts of inspiration for novellas I would write, and just feel 'in the zone'.  Other times, it seemsed that everything was hopeless.  I remember sitting in the bathtub in 1996 and feeling a deep sense of despair and hopelessness pass through me.It wasn't until age 14 that I plunged into a long period of anhedonic, severe depression; and not until 16 that I first felt a true spark of hypomania.  But I always felt different than the other kids.  I noticed that I would feel things more deeply; my mother would often tell me to stop being so 'dramatic'.  It hurt, because she only called me that when I would try to express my emotions openly.I'm 32 years old now, and have been no-contact with my mother for over a year.  Without her toxicity, my general level of well-being has improved, and I've been able to take a critical look at my past.
VanStock1992 [info] Legit how i felt the day I was diagnosed with bipolar on top of my ADHD but someone told me something harsh that I’m going to tell you. They are CONCERNED (different than disappointed but can look the same). Also, they will have WAY more reasons to be concerned if you are hospitalized for unmedicated bipolar disorder than if you handle your health and get on the right meds before it’s an issue.
whywantyoubuddy [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar, as well as my girlfriend. Things are not easy given our mental illness, but we work through it all. I'm really sorry to hear about what kind of journey you and your wife have been going through. How did things go after the doctor said she doesn't have bipolar? Like, did you two just go "awesome! cured!" or was there a a discussion about what to do next? Has the pain and indiscretions been happening SINCE 5 years ago? Was she on something like a mood stabilizer? We are both on Lamictal and it has been absolutely mind blowing. We are able to focus our moods and thoughts more clearly and continue to work on our relationship. Have you tried couples counseling? We also did that and it created a better mode for communication.
novahex [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar and I have shadow men whispering behind me when falling asleep at times.  Sometimes they say actual words, sometimes it's nonsense or breathing. The worst part is the intense feeling of danger and that someone is standing right behind me. When I'm having a really bad mental health day sometimes I'll hear and feel a hand rushing across the bed towards me and it's always scary as shit. Ive spent a lot of nights crying because I'm too scared to sleep and my boyfriend has had to calm me down. Hallucinations are a bitch. 
Cafe-Con-Leche [info] GO THE FUCK TO THERAPY.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 not long ago after 9 years of serious mental health struggles.  I would've gone sooner as soon as I saw the signs and gotten on medication.  Probably wouldve solved a lot
Dano216 [info] You should defiantly get a second opinion. Those are serious diagnoses.**Edit: OP had changed the post to include some of his/her history so I wanted to share my story because there are elements that are similar. Hopefully he/she can find some comfort in it and not feel so alone.**TL;DR: hang in there. Things will get better. It’s a good thing they are not rushing to a diagnoses because finding the right course of treatment and/or medication is paramount. Anyone in your shoes would have a difficult time dealing with this and you have my deepest sympathy for the ordeal you are going through and I wish you nothing but the best.When I was about five years old I told my mom, “I hate myself and want to die.” This was the first sign of trouble and the beginning of nearly 20 years of confusion, wrong or contradictory diagnoses, and depression and anxiety.As I grew older and had severe depression, anxiety, behavioral, and attention problems, my parents did everything they could to get to the bottom of it. We got second opinion after second opinion and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, ADHD, dysthymia, major depressive disorder, and ODD. In short, they were handing out diagnoses like Halloween candy.I had major adjustment issues in middle, junior, and high school. I was constantly bored in class, and to pass the time i drew. This got me in trouble constantly and I was given detentions. I drew in detention, and this led to in-school suspension and it just escalated from there. I was also a very sensitive kid and was the target of a bullies. Things just got worse and I felt progressively more lonely and alienated.I was given a battery of IQ tests. The ones administered by the school resulted in scores that put me in the average to below average range. The crazy thing is that I took multiple tests by different doctors - outside of school - and they all resulted in scores in the superior to gifted range. The school system wanted nothing to do with me, and my parents had to hire a lawyer to try and get some sort of accommodation in the hopes that I could just get through school. In the end, based on my diagnosis of ADHD, I was given a IEP and put in classes for students with disabilities. This just made things worst for my own self-esteem and for the constant bullying.I was put on a series of medication including Ritalin, Prozac, and Lithium for a mood stabilizer. I had a horrible reaction to these. They made things worse, not better, especially the lithium which thankfully was short lived, but I blacked out that point in my life. To this day I have no memory of what happened. The other drugs combined with my depression led me to gain a ton of weight. When I graduated I was over 300lbs. This further affected my self-esteem problems and the bullies had new material to work with.I managed to get through high school, albeit psychologically and spiritually damaged, along with my family who suffered through this with me. I tried college and immediately flunked out.I stopped taking meds and coasted through life in my early to mid 20's. I managed to lose all of the weight I put on through diet and exercise, though I still felt like a "fat kid" and had terrible self-esteem. This led to a lot of poor choices - nothing illegal or immoral per se, but its a time of my life I was not proud of.I finally tried college again in my mid 20s. I double majored in psychology and film production. I found there were a lot of other psych majors that like me where really there to figure out what the fuck they were and what was wrong with them. The crazy thing was that I really thrived in college and after my second year, got straight A's throughout.This didn't solve all of my problems. Now in my late 30's, I still carry a ton of baggage from the past, but I am working with a therapist to let go of it and focus on the positive things.My therapist and psychiatrist helped me realize that I was a highly sensitive and gifted kid that just got lost in the system due to my ADD and challenges caused by asynchronous development - the latter being somewhat common with gifted kids. Overcoming this crap has been an ongoing struggle but I met an awesome woman, fell in love, and got married. Things aren't perfect, and I still deal with loneliness, alienation, and self-esteem issues.The moral of the story is that psychological testing, evaluation, and diagnosis is FAR from perfect. Many mental illnesses are diagnosed by exclusion - meaning that they try to rule everything out first. This is clearly imprecise and imperfect, but even after 100 years of research and insight, the brain is still a mystery. Being highly sensitive made my problems that much more unbearable and traumatizing, but I think in a way there are positive things that I can pull out of it. People have suffered through FAR worse - but I'm reminded by the fact that human suffering is relative.Things will get better for you. Just hang in there. Hopefully you have a good support system at home. Hopefully you find what you are looking for in this subreddit that will give you the courage and strength to bear down and endure the challenges ahead. Good luck my friend.
celticraven2084 [info] I agree. The area I live has a mental care facility. Nothing big just an office building with some therapists in it. But mental illness and drug addiction is a serious problem in my town. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and chronic depression. I have ro be very cautious about who I tell about it in town otherwise I get labeled as crazy and dangerous.  Worse still I get the old "old straighten up and walk it off" or "cheer up" like it's that easy.
melissarose007 [info] It doesn't get "better" so much as EASIER. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for 16 yrs. Panic disorder for 1 year (directly related to physical health issues I have recently been managing). Don't be afraid to speak to your mental health professional if you are not happy with your meds. Over time you will learn your triggers, and coping mechanisms that work to manage them. You will find medication that works to make up for what cannot be controlled by these coping mechanisms. You will become more familiar with the feeling of the symptoms of your mental health issues. You will create a good support system and You will learn to speak up and get support from those whom you trust.  You will learn there are good days and not so great ones. You will learn to use your mental health to better yourself and help others. It takes time, practice, and lots of "fresh starts". I don't believe anyone ever master's it all, but I also believe that is what makes us awesome.  I'm sorry you are struggling. It is so hard, I know. But there is hope. My life is not perfect. There are still not awesome days, but my life is good.  Yours is too. Don't focus on the destination, but on the journey. I'm sure you will find the tools you need to succeed.
AislingPeartree [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar too. I highly recommend a therapist you feel you can connect with, as well as Tapping (Emotional Freedom Technique). There are lots of free videos and resources online. I’m a mental health coach, I’m here and happy to help!
Weissach [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I have my master's and have been working in that field for roughly 4 years now. Historically I did the 2 years at one place thing (since undergrad), but it was mostly because better opportunities presented themselves. I have been working for the government for a little over 2 years but in different positions (recent change). I've gotten lucky and have had really understanding/supportive coworkers and supervisors, so the BP hasn't really been an issue (i.e. never fired for disciplined). I do find myself getting bored, though. Regardless, don't let you BP deter you from doing something you love. I've had good luck with being open about my illness at work, which has made the bad times much easier to deal with since my supervisors knew it wasn't "me". If you made it through a master's program, then you can handle a job =] Also, talk to your therapist (if you don't have one, I highly recommend seeking one).
ishmoo21 [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar for 15 years and just started smoking weed 2 years ago when it became legal. I've smoked almost everyday and it hasn't affected my mental states although I find myself smoking more when I'm depressed
SadBrainHappyBrain [info] Your experience is very similar to mine. Anti depressants never worked. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by an ARNP who cited “soft signs” of bipolar disorder like post-partum depression and atypical depression (where you sleep MORE and GAIN weight rather than sleep LESS and LOSE weight).In retrospect, I suspect some bouts of hypomania I didn’t recognize at the time During my most obvious hypomanic episode (AFTER my diagnosis) I started out getting very little sleep and then no sleep over a period of 5 days. Music felt too slow, I had not a care in the world. I contacted my ex and talked for hours outside WHILE ON THE CLOCK AT WORK. I literally thought I was too great of an employee for my bosses to care. Toward the 4th and 5th day I was laughing inappropriately and felt self conscious being in public because I felt like everyone could tell something was wrong with me.
shadowscale1031 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 while in college. It was definitely challenging, as the chaos of college and the chaos of bipolar don’t often go well together. That said, I still graduated and have done well since, so here are some things that have helped me, although many I didn’t learn until after graduation.-Get established with a mental heath provider early, especially if you’re on medication. It can take awhile, and you don’t want to navigate that system while in crisis. Campus therapists aren’t always great with managing illnesses like bipolar, but they can help with managing stress and the transition to college life.-Take your medication consistently. There were times when I would go off mood stabilizers during hypomania to get a “manic boost” during a particularly busy time. Don’t do that. The ugly side of hypomania doesn’t take long to come out.-Get enough sleep. Way easier said than done, but I’ve found that my emotional stability is nonexistent when I don’t sleep. This is one I only figured out once I graduated and actually had a regular sleep schedule.-Find what motivates you and make sure it’s somewhere you’re reminded often. I’m a goal-oriented person, so thinking about how what I’m doing (or not doing) will affect those goals helps me stay focused. In college, I changed my laptop background to whatever motivator I needed at the time (gentle support, kick in the ass, funny and relatable, my pets). Phone backgrounds as well. -Find a support system, aka make friends. Join clubs that interest you. It’ll help you feel more invested in staying. Networking with professionals in my field through campus events also helped with motivation, because it helped excite me about what I could do once I had my degree.-Learn your limits. Manic me likes to sign me up for way more than non-manic me can handle. If that happens, don’t be afraid to step back from lower priority things. I once had to resign from an extracurricular I cared a lot about due to academic overload, and I still remember my advisor saying “You’re here to get a degree, not to be Vice President of this club”. -Learn how to cope with stress. You mention alcohol, and at one point I did develop a problem because I was using it as a coping mechanism for stress. Once I realized I couldn’t keep drinking like I was and still meet my goals (see point above), I changed and learned other ways to manage stress. But I had to hit that breaking point to finally start learning healthy coping mechanisms. If you can, try to find those before you end up too deep in something harmful.-Be kind to yourself. Learning to live with bipolar is mostly trial and error as you figure out triggers, treatments, and coping mechanisms that work for you. There will be a lot of failures and mistakes, but the faster you can get back up and move forward with what you’ve learned, the better off you’ll be.I hope this helps. Good luck!
keepcalmdude [info] Going to get help, and finding out what’s actually wrong with me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and at first it was shocking to hear. But knowing what my condition is, taking medication and learning ways to keep myself moving forward has helped quite a bit so far
poopd0llaaa [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety, depression. I hate this part of me but it is still me and I’m learning to accept it through therapy, meds, and my own journey. My boyfriend is the most accepting, although I will say I imagine it can be a burden on him. We had a scare the other day, I was feeling really low and thought I needed the hospital and he had never seen me like that. I felt like a monster. He just wanted to see if I was okay. I do wonder if I push him too hard, even though I’m working on myself. I wonder if I’ll push him away.
seqtora [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder senior year of high school, and dealt with all throughout college. Trying to make friends at the same time was just a level or two above my pay grade. By the third year, I finally met someone I could hold a conversation with, but by then I'd already gotten used to pretty much being on my own.I don't really know if there's a point to saying all this. Just, even if there are a lot of things that suck about not having anyone, the inner strength you build and the things you discover about yourself can be worth it in its own right.
annielovesbacon [info] It was less formal but I sort of integrated Daylio. After I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she suggested I find a mood tracker. I poked around and settled on Daylio and used it regularly without sharing in therapy or anything. Every so often though, I would say “look how crazy my mood has been this month” and show her a chart from the app or tell her that I put together a behavio pattern because of the app. So it didn’t become a regular part of therapy or anything but it was occasionally a useful tool!
