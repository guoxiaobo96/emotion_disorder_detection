bp2buddy [info] Please don't apologize for sharing your thoughts. It was very poignant and something that I truly needed to hear. I don't know, maybe I respond well to metaphors. I don't like the thought that adulthood comes with dealing with these types of situations that don't easily have a happy ending. And I don't mean easy as in everything falls into your lap precisely the way you want it to with zero effort put forth, I mean in the way that working hard and trying your best actually gives you what you want instead of hitting a wall after you gave everything to achieve your goals... It's painful to think of life that way. You're not reaching in assuming that I'm doing this, in part, to prove to myself that I am better than my family. Especially my mom. I believe everyone when you say that my caring, compassion, and the things that I've done so far is proof enough that I am better than them and her but if the end result is the same -- if he ends up back on the streets, homeless in the snow, disconnected from reality -- am I really any better? Intent vs impact matters to me. But I think I might be thinking too simply about that. All the same, it still feels like an emotional hump I have to scrapple my way over.I just don't want to fail. I can't fail him like everyone else has. I have a hard time getting C's in college courses so to fail at something this important -- I would never be able to look at myself the same way again. But I know that there is a very real chance that I will have to get over that. I recognize that fact because I have been seriously listening to you all and deep inside my rational mind I know that my emotions/hangups/baggage is the true source of my inner turmoil. I took some heavy blows, mentally, a few years ago and soon after that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I could not be any less mentally equipped to handle this mental weight, as you put it. I don't understand why I am so irrationally upset at not being strong enough to shoulder this massive weight. I wouldn't beat myself up for not being able to lift a bus off of a bunch of children. But I would do everything in my power to find someone or something that could do what I cannot. I think that's what I'm doing here (which is a change in my course because previously, I was going to shoulder even more of this burden and find him all the resources he needed by myself and not get him a case worker. Poor judgement on my part) but even that much has been hard.Thank you for talking to me and sharing your thoughts. It's such an abstract concept to think that you've seriously impacted the life of a strange you've never even met before but I hope really good things come to you for the time you've taken to help me through such an impossible situation. Bad things happen to people at every second of every day in this world but the things you've said today helped one person feel a good deal better about her life than she did before...

infj1029 [info] Finally hit my second (and perhaps final goal weight)! 150 to120 lbs :) Thanks, everyone! &lt;3 *progress pictures [how I looked at my heaviest, at different years 2017 and 2015](https://imgur.com/a/OiF4S)[recent picture of me, but me trying really hard to look cute lol](https://imgur.com/a/DJ3yw)Measurements: **waist**: 29 in**bust**: 35**under bust**: 31**butt**: 35I am a rectangle shape girl naturally, thus very little waist definition and little curves. But hey, I still have some boobs and I think I look cute despite not having an hour shape figure ;)The last few pounds feels like it took the longest, but I'm finally at **120 lbs**. :) My gym was doing body fat compositions today, and I found out mine was **22%**. My first goal weight was 125 but once I hit that, I was like "what the heck, let's keep going." Right now, I like the way my body looks but I might want to lose a few more pounds and tighten up my body. It's just something I'm still deciding on. :)It's been quite the long journey for me. When I was younger, I ate whatever I wanted and didn't gain weight. Thus, I ate horribly. Finally, when I turned 18, all those bad food choices got to me. I saw my prom pictures and finally saw how big I got and how unattractive I was. I didn't eat healthier but I went to the gym and did a bit of cardio. It did nothing to help me lose weight or look better. Eventually, I stopped and got even bigger. Then college stressed started to add up and I was diagnosed with bipolar. Food was clutch for me and I ate until I felt better. I also finally had a butt and boobs and I thought my curves canceled out my fat. It was like this for all four years of college and during my senior year, I was my heaviest, at 150ish. I was so in denial about my weight, that honestly, I don't know my exact heaviest. I just remember it being in the 150s. I was so embarrassed and hated the way I looked. I didn't even take senior pictures. A friend did take pictures of me at graduation, but I never posted those photos. They're the ones you see above. I just felt so ugly, inside and out. Graduation was supposed to be a special day and I wanted to take pictures too feel good, but I robbed myself of that because of my insecurities. Around June, my boyfriend made a comment above my weight (he had good intentions, he's just bad with words and understanding this isn't something a girl wants to hear -___-) and it made me realize that I am overweight and need to something about it. I'm not sure how, but I found this sub and I learned about calorie tracking. I tracked every day and started working out 3-4x a week.  Although I work out a bit, I work in an office job and probably spend 23 hours of my day sedentary lol. Eventually, all of this became really fun for me. I love finding new recipes and find lower calorie alternatives. I learned workouts that I enjoy and do those. (For example, I hateeeee cardio so I only do it once per week) I learned a lot about self-love and loving my body through this process. I was also really sick in the past and realized how much my choices affected my health. Thus, I did this all for me and to better myself. I am really happy now. My relationship is with food has changed, and I see it as a fuel source instead of a therapist. My journey is still not over, and I'm still trying to improve. :) ----TL;DR: Lost 30 lbs. :) [info] 5'1.5 SW 150 CW 120 [info] 1511210288 [info] test
Donutsareagirlsbff [info] When I decided I needed to see a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with bipolar and she helped me see that the abusive situation in my childhood was worse than I'd ever allowed myself to believe due to guilt and shame. I took a break from my mum for six months, went through a grieving process, got my strength and told her some things I needed to say. Long story short she was sexually abused as a child and it created a chain reaction of terrible relationships. I always knew she loved me but she put me in some very dangerous situations and neglect. She took it very well, cried a lot and apologised. I love her more for the way she handled it as well.I'm still in the process of completely being in my AD. I need to talk to my father who I haven't for six or seven years but I'm much happier and more stable now. I'm also ready after a year of being with my psych to stop seeing her and manage my medication with a GP. It's been a difficult journey but easier than the ten years of turmoil I was in before I saw someone. There's still things I need to work on in myself but I feel like a different me, a better more solid me.  [info] None [info] 1520634002 [info] test

laikadeschain [info] Your comment reminded me of the time I asked my mom if it was ok to cry for no reason. I had to be 9 or 10. I’m nearly 40 now and hadn’t thought of that in years. Makes me wonder how old I really was when things started going weird for me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 13 years ago, but I knew I wasn’t right for a long time before that. I just didn’t think it was mental illness. Anyway, I’m very happy things are going better for your son. You’re a good mom. He felt safe coming to you and you are helping him get help for his problems. The world needs more moms like you.

TheNinacorn [info] I wanted to get my PhD in psychology and open a detox and rehab facility by the time I turned 30.I turned 30 two weeks ago and I haven't finished my associate's degree. You're not bad for "being a mess" or being less successful than your friends. You're not a failure. You are a person and life happens. Don't try and measure your success to others, it will only bring you down. You still have time to get your life where you want it to be. It may be a little harder for you, but don't assume everyone has their shit together (because honestly I know grown ass men with great degrees drinking their lives away and not really caring.)As for feeling you're in a slump, all I can say to that is personally I have found if you really work towards managing your mental health it becomes easier. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 25 and I had a very (very) hard time accepting it. It will never go away but if I put the stigma of mental illness to the side I've realized its easier to focus on getting better.You aren't alone.

You mention ADHD shares a lot of symptoms with other disorders, which, guess what, a __psychiatrist can make those misdiagnoses too and can easily get you the wrong kind of care too__ I think for quite a few medical issues, yeah, you shouldn't self diagnose because you shouldn't self diagnose, say cancer or something, but self diagnosing mental issues is completely valid.* Not everyone has access to mental health professionals ESPECIALLY poor people and people without insurance and marginalized communities. Some psychiatrists have wait times months out and that doesn't help either*  YOU know yourself better than anyone and you can read posts and say "this is my life constantly" where again, your psych may end up misdiagnosing you* ADHD diagnosis are extremely poor in girls and this often leads to a misdiagnosis for something else* Can I mention being poor and low access to care again?* Even if a psych makes a wrong diagnosis it's important to realize that not everyone can get a second opinion, and it can be years later until they find out something like "oh, turns out, I don't have X, I have Y"Anecdotally, I was diagnosed with bipolar. I knew I didn't have it and refused to take the medicine, and years later, I asked my psych while I was being re-evaluated, and she was like, "yeah, you don't have the mania associated with it, I don't know what she was thinking". Point is, your mental health professional is flawed, they are human, they can/will make mistakes in your care and misdiagnosing is extremely comming, and self diagnosing can be very helpful and can offer up support. Self medicating is a whole 'nother issue tho and I don't recommend that. [info] None [info] 1560608073 [info] test

minkabun [info] I do not have Asperper's so I will not pretend to fully comprehend your struggles but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder ten years ago and the best advice I got regarding work was to fill out an ADA form (Americans with Disabilities Act). It can feel degrading at first but many employers—at least the good ones—are empathetic and willing to work with you to find a balance for managing work life. I had a manic episode within a month of starting a new job. My employer graciously told me to take off as much time as I needed to recuperate and ensured that my position would be there waiting for me when I was ready. If you go in being completely open with your employer, you may find that they are able to help accommodate your needs. Many are willing to work with you to find the best possible ways to be effective and help you determine your strengths and the best way to apply them.  [info] None [info] 1490793372 [info] test

anjagladidontxist [info] Decline in language For the past year and a half or so (maybe longer, this is how long I’ve observed) my grasp over language has been in a steady decline. Normally, this wouldn’t be too much of a problem but I plan on becoming a professor of English and this could be disastrous if it’s allowed to continue. My grammar is the one that’s declined the most. Earlier, I used to be very sure of what was right and what isn’t and now I just draw a blank. It makes me unexplainably frustrated and angry because writing and language is what defines me as a person. It’s not just language; I haven’t been able to study and the number of times I’ve broke down crying because I couldn’t understand what was going on with me is innumerable. I used to be a straight A student and now? I literally took a W on winter term and then didn’t go back for fall. Essentially, I haven’t been in college for a year. I don’t think it’s too surprising that this timeline coincides with my diagnosis, decline of mental health and then slow healing. In 2016 I was diagnosed with bipolar II and I’ve had several breakdowns since then. I’ve been hospitalized numerous times and it’s only since this summer has it gotten even the slightest bit better. Does anyone have any tips? I can’t live like this. It makes me feel so inadequate (I had to literally look up “inadequate” because I forgot what the word for not feeling up to par was.

Goddess_Hel [info] No, but *hypomania* can be way less severe and lasts for about a week. As someone who's diagnosed with both BPD and bipolar 2, I know the two can coexist... I'm not saying he's definitely Bipolar 2, but it does sound a lot like my own symptoms, aside from being a dick. I've been way less obviously hypomanic than say, someone with bipolar 1 with full blown mania. But I am irritable, and can say things I regret in the heat of the moment. I can become hypomanic when I'm head over heels "in love" with someone, or passionately obsessed with something.I can see reasonable doubt for the diagnosis, but I've been in therapy for almost my whole life off and on, and I was diagnosed with bipolar at 25 years.It can happen.

quesojacksoncat [info] I used to work as a behavioral counsellor for a residential treatment home for developmentally and physically disabled adults.  We took the ones who had been kicked out of other homes because their behaviors were too violent, extreme and disturbing for those homes. I quickly learned that as the staff we were expected to risk our lives and wellbeing for these clients with zero back up from management in regards to our safety &amp; well-being.Here's a few examples:&amp;#x200B;My main client, a 28 year old woman with violent tendencies towards herself and others (she's put people in the hospital and has nearly lost several limbs and a breast because her self-harm is so severe... she's used an uncooked piece of rice on her skin hard enough to open a vein and don't even get me started with what she can do with a plastic button.. She managed slit her throat quite deep with a broken button once). Anyhow, I worked with this woman in her small apartment along with one other staff member around for support if needed. I'm a 120lb female and while I was confident in my ability to restrain her if needed, she could easily get the upper hand if I was caught off guard and do some serious damage. It wouldn't be the first time. This client developed an obsession with scarring my face and wrote me notes that she wanted to pour boiling kettle water on me while I made her tea sometimes.  She expressed a desire to push me into the oven while I was cooking for her and also said she would grab the wheel while I was driving the company vehicle and make us crash off a bridge.   I no longer felt comfortable cooking foods like pasta or making her tea in the tiny apartment after we had a few close calls and she almost burned me with boiling water.  I brought this to the clinician who makes up her program and he told me I had to continue cooking there (there was an upstairs kitchen for other clients I proposed using) because if I cooked elsewhere it would destroy my clients sense of normalcy.&amp;#x200B;I began asking my client to sit in the very back of the van when I had to drive her places because I feared she would grab the wheel or attack me while I drove (she always sat in the passenger seat before she started up with these threats) and she retaliated by punching the mirror off my personal vehicle which was parked in the same driveway.  Again the company refused to compensate me for the damage to my car and seemed unconcerned by the danger I was in.  Eventually, my mental health got to a point where I was anxious constantly.  I transferred to a different place within the company, hoping that since it was a "Day Program" with a lot of clients and staff doing activities together I would have more support.  This was not the case.  Now, I was expected to take up to 5 clients in a van into the community, all of which had the tendency to run away and become violent in the van or at the outing location.  At the main office, one of the clients beat a staff member with a fire extinguisher and she suffered permanent damage because there wasn't enough staff to keep her safe or stop the attack once it started.&amp;#x200B;At this time, I started to realize I was going to get badly hurt or have someone hurt under my care, both of which would effectively end my career. Addressing my safety concerns  with management only led me to retaliation from my supervisors and being slightly ridiculed.  This entire time, I had a psychiatrist who was truly amazing and even better, his son worked at the same company as me and was experiencing similar issues.  I couldn't believe it, as we live in a capital city and the odds of that are just insane. My psych offered to put me on temporary disability due to my deteriorating mental state but I refused because I believe disability should be a last resort and I wasn't at that point.  During this year and  a half is when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I had some extremely dark times, for sure exacerbated by my work environment.  I had to be on a variety of medications to make it through the days and  I accepted this may be the case for the remainder of my life. One day, a coworker of mine was severely beaten with a rake and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance.  That day I sent in a brief email to my manager stating I was resigning, effective immediately, and would be happy to provide  a doctor's note if they had any questions.  They didn't.&amp;#x200B;After that, I did a few interviews while my boyfriend supported us (not ideal, but we made it).  Within two weeks, I was hired for two jobs in one day.   One was as a waitress for a restaurant and the other was as a health support worker for a health care company.  I waitressed until my job at the health care company began and then began doing that full-time.  That career had it's issues but it supported me for the next 8 months until I found my current job. I now work in an office and the change in my mental state is absolutely incredible.  The lack of stress, financial stability and routine schedule has changed my life.  I've been off all my psychiatric medications for a few months and I've never felt so clear headed.  I  felt so hopeless before.  I look forward to most days at work now.&amp;#x200B;Sorry for the novel, if anyone can relate to switching fields and positive effects on their well-being I'd love to hear.&amp;#x200B;EDIT: spelling/sentence structure [info] None [info] 1560606611 [info] test

Sporie [info] When I first was diagnosed, I thought of this. I have obsessive compulsive disorder. I was diagnosed with bipolar II......and when I told some of my friends, they'd say, "So you're bipolar?".. I thought "Does this illness define who I am more than having OCD?". They'd never said "So you're OCD?". I thought about the differences between the two. OCD feels more like a glitch in my mind, however I thought about my bipolar diagnosis. It feels as though it's coloured more of my perception of reality than OCD did. I'd prefer to say "I have bipolar disorder", though... but I'm really not sure why exactly.. It's definately a part of my life. I'm not sure if I'd take it back though, it's made me who I am. [info] hypomanic hugger [info] 1353474390 [info] test
PM_me_punanis [info] This is basically me except I have no affinity to certain noises, textures and smells. I thought I was just an angsty teenager. Or it was just a phase. Or just stress from school. At age 27, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I thought I was just depressed from the stress of medical school. But no. I graduated, moved to another country for a fresh start, got married, now a housewife that supposedly should have zero stress... And I still feel the highs and lows. I get anxious and can feel my heart rate going up in social situations. It is crazy and it's been getting worse. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have wasted the best years of my life in nursing school and medical school, aggravating my symptoms even further with so much physical and emotional stress. (We had 36 hour shifts for 2 yrs, no holidays, exams all the time, plus the fact that I see so much suffering every day, with the very real feeling that you have zero capacity to help someone because you aren't god.) Working in that field would kill me. Also, if I had known how much the medications would ruin my brain, I probably wouldn't have taken them. Yes, I stopped trying to kill myself after the 3rd time with the help of meds, but my entire life, I was the "smart one" and now my memory is shit.What am I if I wasn't the smart one? It's been a struggle but I shifted my focus on being the best wife. If my purpose in life is to support my husband, then that is what I am doing. I will always do my best in whatever I do, within the bounds of reason and within my limited capacity. I still feel so useless, from being so productive, I just spend my days doing housewife things.. But I'm proud to say I have made a bit of progress. [info] None [info] 1534593428 [info] test
blackeyes1 [info] bad breath I remember smelling bad breath from somewhere it was just in the air but it was really starting to bother me. I even checked my own breath and I knew it wasn't me it was something else and it one of life's most annoying things to smell bad breath and embarrassing to have it. Talking to people or people talking to you with bad breath can be a very awkward situation. I could keep on smelling it though and I tried using air freshener and I even started to have mints and use more mouth wash on myself, just in case if it was me. It started to become really distracting and I always have been that sort of person to really zone in to small things like bad breath and dandruff and I don't know why but I have always been like that. I fell asleep on the couch one day and it was one of those power sleeps and you know where you find it difficult to wake up but you try your hardest but your eyes seem to keep shutting down. I remember trying to open my tired eyes and it kept on closing and when I peeked through my slow opening eye lids, I saw a ragged. sad and rough looking man opening his mouth and breathing on me and his breath was just terrible that it literally knocked me out. I experienced an out of body experience and I was floating in the air and then I went back into my body. I awoke straight away and what I had noticed was that I had some straw under my couch and I started to bend it little by little until I had a zig zag straw and straightened it and re did it. It was the weirdest reaction to a weird dream I had though to myself at the time, thinking it was a dream. I knew it wasn't my breath and I could smell it you know still in my memory and I could still feel the disgusting texture of the bad breath. I came home from work one late night and my wife was a sleep and my child was also a sleep and I found many zig zag straws  on the front room table. I knew it was me that had done this but I didn't have clear memory of it and I un-zig zagged the straws and kept on doing it. It helped with dealing with the bad breath and my morning started to become extremely hard to handle. I would awake half a sleep while seeing many ragged, rough looking, people in my room all breathing on me and all with terrible bad breath. It caused me such agony and my brain was in pain and my body was shaking and shivering. I would desperately go the bathroom sweating as if I had sprinted in a hot country and wash myself. It became so bad I peoples breath even if it wasn't bad breath I just hated being breathed upon. I would always find straws on the floor or settees and I knew i had left it there but the memory of the act. I started to find comfort in zig zagging straws and I even started to chew them as it helped with the stress. When I started playing with straws that I left on the floor it started to bring back memories of those people causing me pain with their bad breath. Then I started zig zagging another straw which I had done before and just left somewhere and it gave me a flash back of when again of me being a victim to their bad breath. I was forgetting when I was being attacked and these straws started to become my way out and dealing with it, but it made me forget some of the attacks that had happened to me in the past. I started to become delusional and I was diagnosed with bipolar and my wife was started to become irritated with my behavior.   Then the worst still had to come when my young son just a toddler, found one of my straws on the floor which had been zig zagged by me and he started to chew it. i found my toddler on the floor shaking and looking petrified. I chewed the same straw and It took me back to when I was being attacked by those disgusting looking people all breathing on me and causing immense misery and then my son appeared as he chewed that straw which had a connection to that moment. I saw my son smelling their horrendous bad breath and even though it was causing me physical/mental and spiritual dis balance, my son who is just a toddler started screaming and wailing in immense pain. My wife who by now becoming extremely worried and the both of us rushed our toddler to the hospital. He was fine later on the day and thank god he started to show healthy signs of health in all parts. I didn't tell anyone but I started to think about what was happening to me and the straws. I guess the straws were an accident a reaction I mean if it wasn't the straws it would have been something else. I don't know why I was the victim but I guess no victim knows why they are picked, its just simple luck and chance. My wife wanted to see her parents and she was taking our son with her and being alone in the house really didn't feel too good later on and I went out to the bars. I had a few drinks but I wasn't too drunk and I stayed at a bar just watching television and watching others becoming drunk. As I got home I saw my front door broken and I knew someone had broken into my house. As I went inside I saw a man on the floor and he was wearing what all house burglars wear and I saw a straw in his hand and I took it off him. It showed that he broke in and then he saw a straw on the floor not 1 but many and he found it strange and he touched one and it took him an event in my past where those things where breathing their breath on me and then I saw him appear. I called the ambulance and police and later on just like my toddler he was fine. I have had to adapt to alot things and I have not figured out a way out but I have decided to keep lots of straws in a secret cupboard and I keep a separate bin so that I can throw the straws in their. I sometimes sleep somewhere else but these things are part of my life now. Its like a disease I guess you have got to find a way to live with it and I study yoga and other meditative mind strengthening techniques. I have tried having bad breath myself to see if that helps but it did nothing except making other people awkward around me. [info] None [info] 1463735617 [info] test

BabyGirlR [info] (23/F) 3-4 severe mystery headaches a day. INFO: 23, Female, 235LB, 5'4. Caucasian. Diagnosed bipolar disorder I, PTSD, only allergy is nickle, suspected gluten-sensitivity. TMJ. PCOS.Medications: Lithium 300mg, Latuda 40mg, Lamictal 200mg, Gabapentin 600Mg all at night and Ativan .5MG as needed. Heavy ibuprofen usage.  Melatonin before bed.Other; Nexplanon birth control implant. I drink roughly 250-600MG of caffeine a day in the form of energy drinks.I started getting headaches back in late September and taking ibuprofen to help get rid of the pain. It would always work. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD so I am on a *lot* of medication to help manage those symptoms.  The headaches started at once or twice a week and progressively got worse. The last two months have been terrible as they've not only shifted from happening every day to multiple times a day. One a scale from 1-10, they average about a 4 but grow quickly if I do not take something for them. They almost always come back in a few hours and have become more resistant to ibuprofen. They are entirely resistant to Tylenol.  Sometimes I have to take 1600 (800, wait an hour. 800 again) to make them go away and that doesn't always work.  They mostly happen while I am up and moving around at work or in public.I drink a lot of water. I have a healthy diet. I am unable to exercise right now as activity seems to trigger them or make them worse. Sunlight and bright lights tend to trigger them. Yesterday I drove against the sun and ended up sobbing in my car because a 3.5 headaches turned into an 8. I couldn't drive and I was VERY nauseous.   Stress triggers them. Eating anything like bread or pasta, or even eating the meat off a sandwich triggers them. Caffeine helps but only for a little while. I have tried hot packs and cold packs, both have mixed results but cold seems more successful. I have tried antibiotics, sinus rinses, and decongestant medication with very little change. I HAVE gone to my doctor about this and she was completely baffled by the headaches and told me to just keep taking ibuprofen and watch what I ate. She must've asked me 50 questions and told me she wasn't sure what was triggering them but because of my medication, she couldn't give me anything. I asked if it was safe for me to take ibuprofen at this rate and she said it was fine as long as I ate when I took them. I'm taking 4 200mg tablets a time at least three-five times a day. She tested me for allergies and nothing came up food wise, but she said gluten might trigger them. I agree with that statement since I've tested eating pasta and some bread and gotten a NASTY headache every time. She doesn't think it's a brain tumor or anything like that.   She ran a lot of blood tests (like, 25 vials worth of blood) and didn't find anything that was off aside from having low estrogen and confirmed I'm healthy. The headaches almost always come with nausea. They feel like they're mostly in my upper forehead and the top of my head. I have a lot of problems sleeping as well. I wake up a minimum of three times a night and have been doing that *every* night for months. I practice healthy sleeping habits and even take melatonin to help me sleep but I still wake up. I'm at a loss of what to do, I even got new glasses thinking that the headaches might be triggered by that.  I had Nexplanon put in early February and while they definitely got worse after that, I was still having them before that.  I'm not sure what to do but living like this is inhumane and makes it impossible for me to function. Any advice is appreciated. Where do I go from here? [info] None [info] 1583507649 [info] test
AlchemicalEnthusiast [info] I called the nonemergency line to ask for a reputable therapist that i could save up for because my friends said i was displaying symptoms of mania.Even though i said i would submit myself, they tracked my phone, forced me to the ER, sedated me when i was was crying from fear for two days because they wouldn't let me go home. Medical bills are expensive.Then they drove me two hours away in handcuffs after i said i would comply with everything, had me involuntarily committed to a mental ward even though I did everything i was asked, meaning i would need a doctors note to leave instead of being able to check myself out after 72 hours.I was malnourished and didn't eat a vegetable for two days because they messed up my order. I had diarrhea for the 6 days i was there and a week afterwards.I was treated with disrespect. I asked for a lawyer every step of the way, saying I am an America Citizen and i would like to exercise my right to a lawyer because i am afraid i am not being treated right. The police said since i wasn't under arrest, i couldn't hire one.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, as a man. My father does not have bpd and i have not displayed any symptoms. The doctor says its because: i spoke to quickly and i had a "manic" episode during a time when the day and night are of equal lengths, so now i have to deal with that nightmare.Call someone. Don't call the nonemergency line.I wasn't allowed to go outside and they chose my diet, then wondered why I had a vitamin D deficiency. I don't know what i did wrong. I begged them to help me understand. They just told me im crazy.Every one of my actions has logic and reasoning. I try to practice mindfulness and i have gotten very good at it.I would like help finding a lawyer with a cheap or no consultation fee. I am very poor and now i have debt even though i tried my hardest at community college to avoid it.My father has seven children and i am the only one who doesn't treat him like a bank.

Wee_Albet [info] TL;DR: Yes, I have mental health problems and one night I was suicidal and we spoke via WhatsApp for 6 hours until I fell asleep. Details on what happened that night:We will do that too. He goes to stay with his mum at the weekend, so we will talk through messaging during the day. But we will also talk through serious things through messaging too.I have mental health problems and before the diagnosis I had was questioned (Sept last year), I had a very bad depressive episode towards the end of July, which lasted throughout August and into February of this year. Very confusing.Anyway, on August 5th last year, I was feeling very low and had decided to take my own life that night, which was a Saturday, so he was at his mums an hours drive away. I had tried calling him and my family and no one had picked up.He had fallen asleep and had woken up at 11:30pm and saw the missed calls. I was sat there, about to carry out the act (no further info will be given on this, so no methods or mention to what I would have done). He didn't know if I would be awake or not and didn't want to wake me of I had fallen asleep, I'd been awake for nearly 4 solid days with no sleep at this point and he hoped I was sleeping.He sent me a message apologising for missing the calls and asked if everything was OK. I couldn't think of anything to say and any way of lying was lost to me at this point, so I simply replied back saying "no" and he tried calling me. I felt completely ashamed about what I was going to do and what I would be leaving him to come home to. I couldn't bear to talk to him on the phone. So I kept rejecting the calls and I was eventually able to get a message over saying I'd talk on WhatsApp.We then went through absolutely everything that had gone one over past few months (which we now know was hypomania, I was diagnosed with bipolar). We spoke about what I was going to be doing and about why I was doing it (an even longer story than this, sorry for this story). For about 6 hours we both sat up and spoke about everything. Not just about how I felt, but also him too.So, yes, we do reach out through messages too, and by doing that, it saved my life.I hope everything is OK on your end. I'm sorry this reply was so long.

Fatassmatilda [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 10 years ago and I was diagnosed with borderline 4 years ago. I think I was always both at the same time but they finally realized the borderline part too. So living with both idk I figured out bipolar i can see when I'm becoming manic when I'm becoming depressed but o god the mood switches with borderline are fucking terrible they can change at any moment so I am rapidly cycling through moods on top of whatever bipolar is doing to me. I don't have any friends n my family all want me dead. And on top of this I also have PTSD and a panic disorder. Idk I got hit with the crazy stick hard. One interesting thing though that made me respond to ur post is that everyone always tells me " ooo no u can be both bipolar and borderline it's one or the other " but my doctor's diagnosed me so fuck those people they r not doctor's idk have u ever had someone say that to you?

LusciousPubes [info] I'm just meaning that researchers haven't gone out of their way to be sexist. It was a product of the times.It's also my right to deal with the fact I have an iud that caused 3 months of hell. I got it for me, not anyone else, even though I was in a long-term relationship at the time. It may be a little different in my country as we have a public health system and so finances aren't really an issue. I've also never had a doctor take bc lightly - I was given information on all the options. When I was diagnosed with bipolar they were extremely careful about which bc I had - basically nothing hormonal. So they were extremely open about potential side-effects. I personally would feel a bit weird relying on someone else for bc, so either way I would have gotten it. It's my body so I see it as my responsibility. Not everyone feels like that, so male bc will be an amazing thing.Just had a thought - it's probably tied into the taboo of periods etc. and pms symptoms are potentially why it's side-effects have been played down. Amongst everything else. The reason I keep saying to read -wasn't meant to be patronising sorry - is partly because it's a bit of an echo chamber in this sub imo.

sayheythrowawayy [info] How to discuss med changes? Foggy/tired I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2 in my teens. I was medicated for a little bit, my mother didn't like it and pulled me off. I started my meds journey 3 years ago and I haven't quite ever find a 100% kosher combination, to me anyway. I'm definitely in a better place than I was 4 months ago, 4 months ago I was planning my suicide and happened to start therapy the very next day, coincidentally. For the last 4 months I was put on 750 mg of depakote, 20 mg of latuda, 10 mg of buspirone 2 times a day (I usually forget one dose), and 25 mg of hydroxyzine every 6 hours as needed (I usually forget these and they make me very dizzy and my legs wobbly and I feel like they don't do a damn thing).I cannot take the foggy, words being jumbled, difficulty waking up/tired while driving, inability to focus, incredible weight gain anymore.How do I explain this to my doctor? Would it be odd if I asked for something to help with the foggy/inability to focus portion? It is like there is a huge disconnect between portions of my brain and definitely my mouth. I know they don't make a pill for weight gain but despite my best efforts... the weight just keeps coming.Help please. [info] None [info] 1575468002 [info] test
thogervo [info] Constant inner monologue? Hey folks,I've been diagnosed with bipolar II, and when I feel I'm in a hypomanic episode I sometimes feel as if I have an inner monologue that cannot be stopped. It feels similar to the typical 'quick thoughts' of mania, but it's usually in my own inner narrative or augmented with little tidbits of songs that have been stuck in my head.It can get unbelievably distracting, and it seems to be more likely to happen if I sleep poorly the night before... Or (and this is odd) if I've been intensively reading books that have many characters. For example, I recently finished A Song of Ice And Fire and throughout the books, after reading for extended periods of time, I would (involuntarily)  invent new dialogues for the characters or keep a running dialogue going, in my head, of what certain characters had said with typical responses by other characters.Anyone have any similar experiences?

meow_mixxer [info] I am a closet borderliner.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15, after a suicide attempt. Sometime in the next couple years, I remember it was changed to borderline personality disorder, then back to bipolar with the next psychiatrist. Fast forward though years of self harm and failed relationships and electric emotions to age 27. (Those years were also filled with college and children and art and other Really Good Things.) I earned a degree in psychology and landed a job in a group home for adults living with mental illness. I don't think I have the correct words to express how much I love my job and my residents. I love being at work equally as much as being home with my children. They are like family. They depend on me and a few other colleagues.... For everything.At any rate, I get a front row seat to the current state of psychiatric care and mental illness in this geographical area. Half promising, half disheartening. I work with some residents who have a BPD diagnosis. Where some of my colleagues see manipulation and evil (yes, I've heard that word used) I see a person wading through their past trauma to get through the day. I see a person aching for love and simultaneously ferociously guarding their heart against hurt. The stigma sticks out like a sore ugly thumb. I see how my colleagues frown disapprovingly at the BPD diagnosis on intake paperwork. I see it.I could go on; I won't.I'm still diagnosed with bipolar disorder, unspecified type. I've never felt that bipolar quite fit me. It's like wearing one shoe that's too big and one that's too small. The only time it really resonated with me was during a brief period after my divorce, when I was abusing alcohol and pills on the daily. Drinking my brains out then taking enough stimulants to keep me up so I could drink more and just sleep the next day or the day after. Of course my moods were wild.Then one day I was browsing the DSM and it hit me; they were right all those years ago, I'm borderline. It all makes sense. All the pieces fit. The more I read, the more thoroughly I'm convinced.However.I don't know if I even feel comfortable talking to my psychiatrist about this. I'm afraid, number one, that she will think it's preposterous that an 18 year diagnosis is incorrect. I'm also afraid she'll look at me differently, treat me differently, trust me less. Is this silly? Maybe. Now, I have spent 18 years becoming comfortable with the bipolar diagnosis and rejecting the shame I felt. I can finally look any doctor or colleague or family member in the eye and mention my bipolar diagnosis without flinching. It feels like starting over.I'm 99% sure that BPD is the correct diagnosis for me. It may be just a couple words and a few numbers in my medical records, but it's so much more than that to me.I just wanted to get this off my chest.Thanks for reading.

babyforks [info] We just seem like good friends now. He asks about my day, how I felt when I was diagnosed with bipolar, how’d the break up go. No one else asked me how my diagnosis has affected me before. I think he may just want to travel because he wants to see more. It’s only been a few days since we’ve reconnected, but they have been nice. I don’t think we could do long distance though. That would be selfish. He also has one semester left of college and I have three. We’re both design majors so it feels so good to have common ground with someone. When we dated in high school we went to different high schools and neither of us drove. We never really had a chance. We were both immature.

A lot of the time she'll turn things back on her and say shit like "you never think about my feelings" and "you never worry about me". I can't really control my emotions, which my mum should know especially since my happiness fluctuates a lot and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. A lot of things I say are in the heat of the moment and I always apologise afterwards if I say something hurtful, which I usually don't because I'm pretty scared of her ngl. The thing is, she never apologises for saying hurtful things to me but I always apologise for doing things wrong. She's said stuff like "you're an embarrassment to this family" and "I'm going to send you somewhere else, I can't deal with this anymore" and yet she never thinks about how her words affect me. The meanest thing I've said to her is "I hate you", which I did end up apologising about. Every time we argue and she shouts at me, I shout back and stand up for myself, to which she responds with "don't you dare raise your voice at me" most of the time. Am I an asshole for shouting at her? I understand that she does a lot for me (feeds me, makes sure I have clean water everyday, etc) but I really just can't control my anger and I'm not just going to stand there and let her shout and swear at me.

skeletonsmama [info] When does Hypomania become Mania? Can anyone help me ID if the line has been crossed? So, have been experiencing what I put down as a hypomanic episode for nearing a month. I am diagnosed with bipolar  II and within memory can only really identify hypo episodes - but my memory prior to 2019 is pretty fucked and I went through a lot of SSRIs and stuff prior to diagnosis.I have also - seperately because of bipolar II and the psychiatrists reasoning - been diagnosed with pyschosis that exists independent from my mood and recently started on anti-psychotics. The reason I'm asking this is the Hypomania hadn't really slowed. I chewed through 4 2mg diazapam - usually 2 of those knock me out but within an hour these had stopped having any effect. I'm going from idea to idea to idea, I want to spend a lot of money I don't have (and already have done), I'm loosing all impulse control and having a hard, if not impossible time physically leaving the house by myself. I'm going to talk to a doctor about all this, I have an appointment Thursday, just any resources online are super unclear as where the line is between mania and Hypomania and if someone's experienced both and could help me distinguish? And I ask because this is worse than I have experienced before. So I am unsure if it's just Hypomania like I haven't experience before or could be mania and thus indicative of other things.

kicsikucsi [info] Dear dad, I know that I wasn't always the most ideal daughter, and maybe I didn't make you proud enough. At 21 years old, looking back, I remember thinking my life would be a lot different. I remember turning 13 and thinking that, however arbitrary the difference between 12 and 13 was, my "teens" would be absolutely great, and that by now, I would have lots of friends, money, a career I loved, or I'd be in college.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD and GAD with severe agoraphobia right before you passed away three months ago. All of it has been very hard on me. My biggest fear is that you died thinking I was a disappointment somehow, or that I did not make you proud enough. I guess I have some updates for you.&amp;#x200B;I remember you wondering why I didn't ever go out or do anything outside of the house. You'd encourage me to get out whenever I could. To live life to the fullest like you did.It's nothing *big*, I just wanted to let you know that for the first time in my life, I walked outside all by myself for five days in a row and got my own food and interacted with people. All on my own. I wanted to tell you about that.You died during the transitional period of seeing me grow as a woman, and I have a lot I wish I could share with you. I still take my medications and go to therapy, which you seemed to be happy with. You said you noticed a big change in me and that I seemed to be doing better.I've been thinking about going back to school next year. I've been looking for jobs after being unemployed for six or seven months. I know you like my current boyfriend a lot; you expressed being finally happy and relieved to know that I found someone that actually treats me well.So I wanted to say that things are going pretty well between us, and in a month and a half it'll be one year of us being together. I spent two weeks at his apartment and just got home yesterday. He was the one that encouraged me to go out and do things by myself for once, but you were the one that inspired me. More recently, I've heavily considered moving in with him within the next year, but I'm not so sure yet. When I told you that I thought about this before, you were very supportive of it and happy for me, but mom is very lonely without you. No matter how much she reassures me that it's okay if I choose to "*go on my own way*", I feel very guilty at the thought of leaving her alone. I miss you lots, and at times, painfully so. I wish you'd give me more advice. I'm not sure what to do, or where to begin sometimes. I still don't always like myself, but I feel confident knowing that you are my dad. I hope everything is great wherever you are, and that this message finds you well. &amp;#x200B;Love, your daughter&amp;#x200B;P.S. The Packers won over the Bears again. I remembered you told me to never bet against them during their rivalry matches, and I guess that you were right. [info] None [info] 1568533619 [info] test
SincerelySasquatch [info] Yeah, man. And all psych meds should cease production and everyone should just smoke pot. When I was a teenager I was a typical moody teenager and my parents didn't want to deal with me so they send me to the psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and now that I grew up I am pretty much fine except occasional moodiness, (that's bipolar, right?) I don't take meds, I don't want that poison in my body, I just inhale all the chemicals from combustion of marijuana and it helps because I am high all the time so I don't know what's going on and I am not sad anymore! So fuck big pharma and those poisons they give us, all those schizophrenics and bipolar people should just smoke pot like me! [info] None [info] 1512451898 [info] test
mackemerald [info] [Spoilers] "I've felt worse" and how that applies to real life So, I know a lot of people liked Lapis' line, "I've felt worse," and I wanted to talk on that just a little. Of course, it's funny and of course a lot of us feel it was a big mood. But I wanted to say that, this is one way I've essentially survived life. So, to be frank, my baby sibling died when I was a kid. Then as a teenager, I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I've been through other shit, too, but the point is - I've felt worse. And you've probably felt worse.Not only is that powerful for those of us who know it but if you have any kind of pain and trauma in your life, I'm here to tell you this line will get you through. It doesn't diminish your current pain but it reminds you of your own strength. You've felt worse so you know you can stand up to a fucking (metaphorical) diamond. I love that she said that. Lapis is strong. I'm strong. You're strong. So, I just wanted to point that out so that next time you feel absolutely terrible or you go through something awful, you'll remember. Let yourself feel your feelings but remember that you'll survive. You've got this. Inspiring post commenced. [info] peri is best gem [info] 1530928746 [info] test
NoahPM [info] How well does a 3.65 transfer out of a CC? This is a hypothetical goal gpa, not what I have.  Seems feasible for me though and I'd shoot for even higher.  My highschool SAT was 1860 (not sure if that matters), and I plan to take as many of the 200-400 classes as possible.  Like give me examples of different caliber universities I could get into or would have a shot at.Also, if I were to transfer as a baseball player, does a 3.65 basically get you in anywhere as a recruited athlete?  I remember when I was in highschool my baseball coach told me if I got my GPA up to a 3.4 he could get me into Yale (he's sent 4 kids there, and over 10 kids to Ivy League schools).Also I have an adversity story if that helps.  I was diagnosed with bipolar my freshman year of university and spent 2 weeks in a mental hospital.  That was 2 years ago and I'm basically starting over at a community college now because I want to go to a better school and I didn't finish many units.

_AquaFractalyne_ [info] LSD has been studied in highly controlled clinical settings with professional psychiatric researchers. Doing LSD at your house is completely different (I'm speaking from experience). Psychedelics are not going to help you cure yourself, and it took me years to realize that self-medicating was only making things worse for me. 7 years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I never saw that coming!

letitfckingsnow [info] Misdiagnosis with other mental illnesses? Has anyone been diagnosed with other mental illnesses and had to deal with the question of comorbidity, or whether it’s all due to PMDD? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 3 years ago. I’m obviously not asking for diagnostic advice because it would take forever to type out (and you’re not doctors), but essentially I’m looking back and my symptoms started right after I went on birth control — and though I didn’t track them exactly, I know a lot of my “episodes” would occur about a month apart. When I’ve been off that birth control, I still have PMDD symptoms, but it was like the pill exacerbated it. I’ve also been diagnosed with PMDD but never by someone who thought to discriminate between them, if that makes sense. I know now that I don’t react well to hormones (at least the wrong ones), but I’m doubting that I even have bipolar, as the meds and therapy really never helped me. I definitely experienced some bipolar-like symptoms but I don’t know if I have it independently of PMDD, if that makes sense. Has anyone dealt with something similar? What were your experiences?

sweetally4 [info] I’m with you on this. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago and it’s been wreaking havoc on my life for so long.

I’ve been sick for so long I have no idea what life is like to be stable and functional. It’s so messed up. I want to be able to go back to work deep down inside, but right now the thought of being better is just so scary.

wilbanks951 [info] I really do appreciated all of your words of encouragement! I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 for almost a year. I'm typing this on the mobile app so I might not remember everything you said and reply to it, but I am seeing a therapist as well. She's not much help, all she's really done is talk about herself and then ask me how things are going. I'm basically paying her $100+ an hour to talk to her about things I could talk to my friends about. She isn't really helping me get to the root of my problems. There was my first therapist, I've had three, who I might end up switching back to. She was the best but I just couldn't afford it at the time.  As far as being bipolar though I don't blame myself. I know this is a disease, I didn't choose to go through life like this (obviously.) But I do blame myself for my actions, even though I feel like I can't control them.  I recently starting talking to someone, they told me they really liked me and that they would help me through this. I believed this person, and now I'm afraid, after a depressive episode last night, that they're gone. This was someone I really liked. And I screwed it up.  I think the thing that pushes people away is the constant whining. At least that's how they may see it. I'm sorry I get depressed, sad, tired, lonely, or don't want to go out like a normal person. But I'm not normal. I'm... this. This thing that I hate. This thing that hides behind a mask. I've built such a large cement wall around myself that nobody will ever be able to break in. Yeah there might be a few cracks, but I refuse to ever let anyone see the real me. Why? Because to them I'm insane. They don't understand. And it hurts to feel like the only one, especially with friends or in a relationship that someone even cares to understand the pain I go through on a daily basis. The sickness in my head.  I guess I'll wrap this up here, I wanted to mention one more thing about what you said about your job. I've been at mine, nothing big just retail, but I'm in the process of a promotion. I'm working full time (30+ hours) as well as going to school full time (12 credit hours).  I'm proud of myself for that, but at the same time I wish I could do more.  I don't think I'll ever be satisfied with myself or my happiness.  Again thank you for sharing everything you have with me so far. It's meant a lot and I'm really glad you understand.

EventideOwl [info] Coming to terms with being emotionally abused... Still processing everything So, I learned a bit recently, thanks to my amazing and supportive boyfriend, that I seem to have quite the number of qualities of a person who has been emotionally abused (possibly as a child?)This is an article he pointed me to that helped open my eyes:  http://www.thinkinghumanity.com/2017/07/25-common-behaviors-of-someone-who-has-experienced-childhood-emotional-abuse.htmlFrom the list of that article alone, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7 (this especially has been eye opening), #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15 (sort of), #16 (had big issues with this especially in the past), #17 (battled this always, but it is slowly getting better), #18 (although my only addictions have been kinda to food in a way, and also to the internet/gaming in the past), #19, #21 (I have taken a pair of scissors to mutilate my thumb nails when I was much younger and have done that twice in my life, and I also developed Trichotillomania (an impulsive hair pulling disorder), #22? (I am not so sure about this one, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the past), #23 (I have been told by a therapist when I was a child that I tend to disassociate and I still go through it today, daily, at some point or the other), and I guess #25 too since I kinda was used to living with very little or being more of a minimalist for so many years.   So, basically just about everything on the list aside from one or two things, I go through in my life and it has especially become strongly held in my personality in my adult life (I am 35 now.) I am thinking the emotional abuse has come from my dad, but it is really hard to think on when he did so when I was a child.  I do know that the last time I was attempting to stay at my parents' house that he was being very emotionally abusive from what I am trying to recognize now.  Some examples of things that happened just last year around my dad:  When I was sitting at the dinner table especially was when the sessions of abuse would happen.  I remember just last year how he would pick on the way I was using my fork and knife to eat my food (even though I like to think I have decent manners?) or if I was eating way too fast.   Another time my mom was asking me if I wanted an old trunk that I used to have when I was 12 years old (a year I went to a military school) and I told her, politely, no thank you and said that it gives me bad memories of the time in military school.  My dad then said something along the lines of 'Well that also gave us bad memories too of having to pay for you to go to this school."  Another time, he was talking about one of my second cousins (who has very severe down syndrome) and saying how my second cousin deserves to be on disability income so much more than I do (I have been on disability income since the early 2000's, for mental health and emotional reasons obviously, but my dad seems to think I don't need it.)   Then there was a time where he literally was trying to help me either clean or fix something with my car and he turned to me and said something along the lines of "I do not ever feel sorry for you." (he was talking about how I am on disability income, his biggest gripe with me and what has ultimately made me forced to be estranged from him and the rest of my family.)I'm still processing everything.  Especially trying to figure out what exactly my dad did while I was growing up to do this.  Although he did and does still have a monstrous yelling voice and I literally have grown to be afraid of any male that yells now.  It automatically makes me curl up into a ball and just want to hide.   And I know this might not be a big deal to some, especially since it was more accepted in the 80's and prior, but he has used a belt to spank me when I was a kid before.  He was also very strict, but the whole situation is hard because I feel like I also might of done this to myself..?   I was sexually molested when I was either 9 or 10 years old (my memory is kinda foggy on which age I was) by a 15 year old boy that was babysitting me, twice, and since that happened, I began to isolate myself and shut my dad fully out of my life seemingly (even though he never sexually abused me.)  This was also the event that changed me as a person and I developed so many mental health and emotional issues afterward.I could go on... But I was wondering if I could have some feedback?  I don't know. [info] None [info] 1514156393 [info] test

Ramen8ion [info] Tired of seeking help and meeting dead ends I’m really angry basically. I feel so lost and stuck in the system, just to make it clear, I live in the UK. I was diagnosed with bipolar for almost 10 years now (first mood disorder NOS cuz I was a minor, then bipolar at 18). I’ve been hospitalised many times as are most people with bipolar and my last admission was jan 2016 after almost 6 months of being hypomanic and unaware, it turned into a horrible mixed episode where I was wandering the streets confused and unaware. That’s when I had insurance through my uni scholarship and went into a private psychiatrist hospital. I don’t have insurance anymore, I started reducing my meds because they affected my health so badly and my mood started going all over the place, spent the past months at home never leaving and feeling extremely suicidal, I have planned detailed plans so many times. I have barely any support from anyone and feel lonely in this struggle.I finally got the courage to speak to the NHS GP so I could access help and see what I could do about this. I had an appointment with a mental health nurse after waiting months and explained what’s been going on. The nurse kept trying to downplay everything ‘so just a little depressed? You haven’t actually killed your self?’In the end i just get a letter in the post saying he spoke to a psychiatrist and this was his recommendation:1) stay off meds and ‘apply therapeutic methods you learnt in the past’2) if u feel worse take a low dose of anti depressants.What the actual fuck. ANTI DEPRESSANTS triggered my first manic episode. You are not meant to take them alone. I’m completely unmedicated and have been of high risk for so long. Without any access to healthcare as a person with a serious diagnosis, and this is  the only medical advice I’m receiving.It makes me feel what’s the point. Like I keep hitting brick walls. As if it’s not bad enough to deal with this condition sometimes. It’s like they want you dead to get rid of you sometimes. The anger in me is not even normal right now, I’m just so so angry and I have every right to be. What do I even do. [info] None [info] 1559700511 [info] test
__sortof [info] Am I disabled? Hi /r/BipolarReddit, long time no see. I've been pretty well, so I haven't been coming around much.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 10 years ago. I wasn't all that compliant with my treatment until about 5 years ago, when I overcame my marijuana addiction and started getting my life under control. I was rediagnosed bipolar I from bipolar II, I revamped all my meds, started in on weekly group therapy then graduated to weekly individual therapy. I'd been working at Starbucks the whole time, but last September I started back in school, and things have been great. I haven't had a major episode in over a year. Sometimes I still get very sad and a little suicidal, and there's some intrusive thoughts here and there with some paranoia/psychotic delusions, but I have a 4.0 GPA!The thing is though, to pay for my weekly therapy and my medication, I need to maintain 20 hours a week at Starbucks to  be health benefits eligible. I've been juggling school with work since September, and clearly I am capable of doing that. But I'm starting to plan for September, and as part of my program I have to do a placement of 10 hours a week while still maintaining a full time course load, and reddit, I just don't know that this is a good idea. Since September I've been tired all the time, and I have no doubt the psychosis-lite comes on when I am stressed from having 3 papers due in the course of a week while still having to work 20 hours a week while having to go to class while having to go to therapy while having to maintain a social life while having to get exercise while having to cook right so I don't get ill etc etc etc. It seems to me a recipe for relapse. And TBH I'm secretly convinced that I've just been in an extended hypomanic state since September.I have a couple of friends who've been telling me for years that I should just apply for disability. I am in Ontario, Canada, where I can apply for a bursary for students with permanent disabilities which can pay for services including therapy. Then I could ease off on my hours at Starbucks and still maintain my treatment.But honestly, I don't feel "disabled." I'm working 20 hours a week and maintaining a 4.0 GPA on a full course load. This, it seems to me, is more than fully able people do. I don't think anyone would consider me disabled either, despite my long track record of being in treatment.I was just hoping to hear some discussion around the word "disabled," its relationship to bipolar disorder, what it means to be given that title by governing agencies, how you feel about the word, the relationship between disability and capability, and whatever else you have to say about the topic!Also, I just wanted to say while I'm here that this community gave me so much support when I really needed it, and I am glad it's still an awesome community full of amazing people.

bioviolin [info] Hoping for Happiness The past year has been really difficult for me. I moved twice, started university, and basically created a new life for myself. I was under immense stress and my mental health declined until I was diagnosed with bipolar in May. I've spent the last few months doing damage control for all of the things I screwed up before I got my diagnosis and started getting treatment. Because of all of that, I became even more depressed and my outlook on life became intensely pessimistic. I could only see a future of damage control for all of my mistakes and neglected to see all of the good things that came out of this difficult year. I moved to a new place and became a student at my dream university. I survived the year with okay grades and a summer research position. During this difficult time, my friends and family supported me more than they ever have before. I started treatment and have an amazing doctor and therapist. I'm starting to see improvements since I started taking medication. I've spent the past few months doing damage control, but I'm much better equipped now with coping skills and life skills to support myself in the future. I have so much hope now.

birdcafe [info] I’m so ashamed of the things I did while hypomanic TW: Sexual harassment, brief mention of assaultMy first hypomanic episode happened when I was 16 (I’m 22 now) It was 5 months after my mom died by suicide. Obviously that was very traumatic and definitely influenced my spiral downward.Here’s what happened: I was on a high school choir retreat. I did some very inappropriate things to other girls. I have no idea why. I thought it was playful and funny at the time. I slapped a girl on her butt and another girl I kissed during truth or dare when she didn’t want it. I was up all night playing candy crush and that pissed people off too.I got kicked out of choir 3 weeks later. And I spiraled into horrible, horrible depressed, worst I’ve ever experienced. Almost tried to overdose on Tylenol until I read online it is a horrible way to die. So I told my dad and he took me to a psych ward. I went to the ward again 3 months later (still depressed).My dad had to go through so much bc of this. He had to watch his daughter be suspended from school and kicked out of the choir she loved because she literally sexually harassedpeople. I don’t know how he wasn’t disgusted with me.At the second hospitalization, I was diagnosed with bipolar II. Suddenly my actions made sense. But it didn’t make the shame go away.In the current climate of #MeToo, there is no tolerance for sexual harassment. I support that. I have been a victim of assault twice in college. Which only makes me feel more horrible that I victimized these girls, one of whom disclosed she was sexually abused as a child. I made them feel so uncomfortable and unsafe.I can only discuss this in the context of being bipolar. No one else understands. How you can do these things when manic/hypomanic that you would never do when stable. How you cannot possibly defend yourself. I still feel like a monster because of it sometimes. It damaged my self-image and it has taken years to try and repair it.Anyway, I hope someone can relate. :-/ At least I didn’t spend $6k on video games &amp; paying for characters/weapons like my friend’s brother during a manic ep.

Overclockinggirl [info] I am so sorry you’re going through this and it probably breaks your heart that you cannot physically get to her because of your disability. My mother was disabled and I know it would’ve broken her heart if she couldn’t get to me to help me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 2 years ago and it is a tough battle but I am doing ok now. I will say that hospitalizations were 100% necessary about 4-5 times in my life. I tried committing suicide twice and failed, obviously. Then voluntarily committed myself after that because I realized I couldn’t go on living that way. Unfortunately, even after being hospitalized twice during that severe, 2 year long depressive episode, it didn’t get me to a euthymic mental state. Now that I am on the correct medication (mood stabilizer and LOW dose of an SSRI), I feel better than ever. I can say first hand that alcohol does not mix with bipolar disorder. I am struggling with that reality now but I’m working on it. I would say your best bet would be to call 911 or perhaps, if she is more stable today, the non-emergency number for the location she lives. I’m sure you can google it and find their number. Explain the situation and see if they can help. You could also try contacting NAMI (National Alliance of Mental Illness). Also, don’t beat yourself up and try to take care of yourself. It can be very draining trying to help someone with mental illness. I have lost many wonderful friends and even immediate family members because they weren’t able to balance their own lives and try to support me and help me. Deep down, I am a very happy, loving, calm, friendly person. However, when I am either manic or depressed, I’m a totally different person. It can scare people away and make them feel uncomfortable. If you have any other questions, feel free to direct message me. I hope this helped. [info] None [info] 1574551417 [info] test
TheRoyalGodfrey [info] yeah the way kanye talks about mental health isn't really accurate or healthy. Like I remember in his interview with Charlamagne, Charlamagne asked him if he sees a therapist and he said "the world is my therapist."And the ye cover is perpetuating the misleading stereotype around bipolar disorder that you just constantly switch between manic and depressive but usually cycles last for 3-6 months. Ultra-rapid (cycles lasting days) and ultradian (cycles within a day) are very very rare.It's also unclear whether Kanye actually has bipolar disorder. At the White House, he said "I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and NFL. He looked at my brain. I wasn't actually bipolar, I had sleep deprivation" but now he's back to saying he has it. Which (I don't wan to armchair diagnose but) he probably does. [Mariah Carey has bipolar disorder](https://people.com/music/mariah-carey-bipolar-disorder-diagnosis-exclusive/) and she's talked about how he wanted to believe it was just sleep deprivation for a while.It feels like Kanye is trying to use his mental illness to guilty people while not even treating it properly and spreading harmful misconceptions about BPD. A lot of the stuff he's been saying about not listening to other people and being "free" sounds like feeding into a manic episode. Like the song "Freee" and saying "bipolar is my superpower" sound like embracing the mania which seems ill advised.Also that Gucci/Quavo song doesn't destigmatize BPD at all [info] None [info] 1544908543 [info] test
ENGALND [info] I want to decrease my dose of quetiapine (seroquel). Semi success story. I'm diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and Asperger's and have been taking quetiapine for roughly 8 years, maybe ten. I am unsure of my bipolar diagnosis and a previous psychiatrist suggested it may be BPD but she left shortly after (she was a good one). Anyway that's for a different thread one day. I started off on 600mg the reduced to 450 and noticed an immediate change in my eating habits, or lack of. I was no longer waking up at X-am and eating all the chocolate or sweet snacks I could find! My weight dropped from 17 and a bit stone to 14 in nine months, though I did have a decent hour+ walk most days and at a pace to make me sweat. After several weeks I then decreased again to 300mg which I have been on for around 4 months. Now I was due an appointment with my psychiatrist and psychologist that was cancelled due to covid, and one of the things I was going to discuss was decreasing the dose further with the intention of coming off them **at some point in the future.** I have 300mg tablets and a set of accurate milligramme scales - if I were to weigh a 300mg tablet, crush it and take the equivalent of 200mg (I know most of the pill is binder) is this safe to do? I'm assuming that the spread of quetiapine in these pills are equal throughout. I'd go down from 300 to 150 but the drop before from 450 to 300 was horrible in terms of side effects. I have a dozen 10mg diazepam in case of restless nights or irritability during the day.What are people's experiences with decreasing the dose and by how much did you do it? Thanks!Small edit: I have noticed no increase in irritability, no decrease in mood or suicidal thoughts apart from the first 10 to 14 days after lowering the dose. After that I'm fine, if anything I feel better on a lower dose. More motivation, I can keep to a regular sleeping pattern (still face some difficulty) and I'm preparing meals from scratch with fresh veg instead of microwave meals.
