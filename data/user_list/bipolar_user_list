drd_ssb [info] How do I know I was diagnosed correctly? Over the past 4 years, I have been searching for answers. I have been hospitalized 4 times because of extreme lows. At first, doctors thought I was just severely depressed and would give me SSRIs... that would put me in a manic state and I would go off the walls for months until I hit a low and I end up back at the hospital.. finally I was diagnosed with bipolar 2... after being med compliant for about a year, I started to be self aware and mindful. My girlfriend at the time hated when I was medicated so over the course of 6 months, I worked with my psychologist to get off meds and live a life of a rollercoaster... (because at least my emotions were there) I’ve had problems with drug addiction because of my bipolar.... or at least that’s what they tell me... what if I’m just a drug addict? I’ve been able to stay clean for years at a time, and then something pulls me back. I don’t feel physically addicted to drugs, I’ve done every drug and never had the physical addiction like people do to heroin or meth.. I’ve just always enjoyed it...How do I know or my doctors know if I’m actually bipolar or if drugs affect me to have these mood swings? I’m just ranting.. I wonder if anyone else has problems with drugs and think it’s because of manic/depressive state or it’s just because the addiction to drugs... [info] None [info] 1509935664
tearsinrain66 [info] I had a similar experience. Twice. Once when I was 32 and again at 50 ! This last time I was diagnosed with paranoid personality disorder when I was at my worst. The first time I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Weed makes me crazy. Smoking too much (like round the clock) really pushes me over the edge.  You will get better. Stay on the meds. Stay away from weed. It’s just not a thing that you can do. You will be ok. Just. Stay strong.  [info] None [info] 1518476029
Jjacobjames [info] Officer in the Coast Guard Hi there,I was in the United States Army as an enlisted infantryman for 9 months when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was then given a medical discharge.Since then, I have gotten my medication sorted and will be taking medication for the rest of my life. I have also been enrolled in college and am two semesters away from graduating. I really appreciated my time in service and really regret not having been capable of finishing my initial contract. I saw that trump recently made it possible for those with bipolar disorder to serve and with that in mind I was looking at possible opportunities. I believe at the time of my discharge Bi\-polar was a bar from service\-however I am very stable with medication. I was wondering if this new policy changes things.Does anyone have any insight into this? [info] None [info] 1527619170
PrettyTalk4 [info] Should I (23f) tell my somewhat toxic family about my mental disorder?  I  live hundreds of miles away from my family. Sadly i didn't have the  best childhood and there were many bad things that happened. This and a  bit of genetic vulnerability made me bipolar. I really struggled with  university and have not finised my undergraduate yet even though  everyone else has graduated. I am on meds now and feel like a whole new  human. There are bad days though. Luckily i work my ass off and am  financially independent.&amp;#x200B;So i want  to visit my family soon and i feel like i want to get it out of my  system. I guess part of me wants to tell them how hard its been and that  I'm not too stupid for uni.&amp;#x200B;But i  think it might be stupid to tell them. My brother (19) does not really  respond when i tell him anything really personal. We are close though.  My father (55) would have a hard time understanding it. But I'm sure  they would be supportive and offer help.&amp;#x200B;I'm most  scared of my mothers (50) reaction. I once told her i was considering  to get therapy because of problems with uni. She cried and asked me if  she had been a bad mother because her mother had made her mentally ill.  She then proceeded to send me articles on adhd while telling me that i  could never have problems focussing. I didn't go to therapy because of  that. One other time i wanted to get therapy and she told me that she  was going to quit her own therapy so that i could get help (huh??). She  bends whatever people tell her and in rage she uses it against you. I  think she would use the bipolar in order to talk badly behind my back  (,''oh, prettytalk4s probably really depressed rn! Please pitty me. By  the way she is such a bad person''). She really mishandled me in  depressive phases before. also she has been violent with me as a child.&amp;#x200B;I told a  friend of mine about not knowing what to tell my family and she  suggested that i just don't tell them my diagnosis. Idk if that would do  anything. What do you guys think?&amp;#x200B;TLDR: I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and want to tell my family but am scared because my mother can be very toxic.

bp2buddy [info] Please don't apologize for sharing your thoughts. It was very poignant and something that I truly needed to hear. I don't know, maybe I respond well to metaphors. I don't like the thought that adulthood comes with dealing with these types of situations that don't easily have a happy ending. And I don't mean easy as in everything falls into your lap precisely the way you want it to with zero effort put forth, I mean in the way that working hard and trying your best actually gives you what you want instead of hitting a wall after you gave everything to achieve your goals... It's painful to think of life that way. You're not reaching in assuming that I'm doing this, in part, to prove to myself that I am better than my family. Especially my mom. I believe everyone when you say that my caring, compassion, and the things that I've done so far is proof enough that I am better than them and her but if the end result is the same -- if he ends up back on the streets, homeless in the snow, disconnected from reality -- am I really any better? Intent vs impact matters to me. But I think I might be thinking too simply about that. All the same, it still feels like an emotional hump I have to scrapple my way over.I just don't want to fail. I can't fail him like everyone else has. I have a hard time getting C's in college courses so to fail at something this important -- I would never be able to look at myself the same way again. But I know that there is a very real chance that I will have to get over that. I recognize that fact because I have been seriously listening to you all and deep inside my rational mind I know that my emotions/hangups/baggage is the true source of my inner turmoil. I took some heavy blows, mentally, a few years ago and soon after that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I could not be any less mentally equipped to handle this mental weight, as you put it. I don't understand why I am so irrationally upset at not being strong enough to shoulder this massive weight. I wouldn't beat myself up for not being able to lift a bus off of a bunch of children. But I would do everything in my power to find someone or something that could do what I cannot. I think that's what I'm doing here (which is a change in my course because previously, I was going to shoulder even more of this burden and find him all the resources he needed by myself and not get him a case worker. Poor judgement on my part) but even that much has been hard.Thank you for talking to me and sharing your thoughts. It's such an abstract concept to think that you've seriously impacted the life of a strange you've never even met before but I hope really good things come to you for the time you've taken to help me through such an impossible situation. Bad things happen to people at every second of every day in this world but the things you've said today helped one person feel a good deal better about her life than she did before...

Sami_Zayniac [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about 1.5 years ago during one of the worst periods of my life. I rejected the diagnosis and the idea that I needed that kind of medicine.

ACaulfield910 [info] My family found out I take lithium. Their reaction makes me regret not killing myself when I had the chance They don't care. They don't give a shit. They just want to believe what they believe and be right. I always put the thought of them in my mind, as a reminder of the hurt I'd evoke if I were to do it. And when I finally decided to seek help, when I finally decided to get myself diagnosed, I was met with negativety. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder, taking 300 mg of lithium twice a day. My friends had nothing to say, and encouraged me and saluted me on going (they've seen it all over the years). My mom found my lithium and questioned me, then told me dad. My sister, a med student, goes like "no, you're not bipolar. You can't he diagnosed with bipolar that fast." And my dad hops on the wagon. They yell at me for taking lithium, they don't think I'm depressed, they think I'm fine and have been misdiagnosed. And that's all because I've locked myself away from them ever since I was a teenager. I hid my emotions, I hid everything, I became stoic. Because their reactions have always been like that: they believe what they want to believe, not what's true. And when I tell them I'm depressed, when I finally open up to them, they refuse to believe. At least now I could kill myself without having to worry about them. They never really gave too many shits about me, just about themselves and their beliefs and social status. [info] None [info] 1501857017

electricdog [info] Advice I'm so sick of wanting sex so much. I was diagnosed with bipolar a long time ago. My partner has next to no sex drive. I feel like it's ripping our relationship apart. I always wake up wanting sex. She doesn't ever feel like doing it in the morning. After a while, I stopped bothering her in the morning, and just go and deal with it by myself. I want it before bed. Another time that she's never in the mood. Always too tired. So I stay up and take care of it, otherwise I can't sleep. I feel unloved because she never wants to have sex with me. I feel rejected every time I want sex, almost automatically, because all I can remember is all the times she pushed me away, or told me that she wasn't In the mood(after I told her she needs to verbalize instead of just pushing me away) it's happened so many times. I don't want to feel like this anymore. Sometimes, just waking up and imagining the rejection can totally fuck my mood for the day. I feel unattractive. I feel unloved. It's hard to make sense of someone else's sex drive when you're is the polar opposite. I went so far as to tell her when we first got together, that this was something that I needed, and that I was totally serious. She said it wasn't a problem. I've told her about my kinks, but she's never so much as tried to incorporate anything. Now, I'm considering asking my psychiatrist for drugs to make these urges go away. I don't want to be begging for it all the time. It makes me feel dirty, and not in a good way. I don't know what to do. I don't even want to have sex anymore, but I need it. It makes me feel like she's unwilling, and I'm forcing it. How do you deal with it? What can I do to help myself? Is medication the answer? Have you ever tried it? Did it work? I've tried antidepressants, but they only ever give me anorgasmia. Nothing has ever made the desire to away. Please give me your advice. [info] None [info] 1495483698
shillyshally [info] I was always more awake at night than during the day but now that I don't work my sleeping has become utterly without structure. Anyway, the reason I asked about meds is because I was diagnosed with bipolar II long before it became 'popular' and thus was kind of a guinea pig for numerous drug treatments. Some of those drugs had very bizarre side effects. This is pure speculation but I wonder if the melatonin is putting you into a neverland between sleep and wakefulness so that you did the drawing when you were somewhat asleep. Such things do happen.

Paczkl [info] [Serious] I'm one year away from graduating and strugling with lots of things I never actually learned First time posting here, first time browsing this sub also.I'm finishing my fifth year of med school and only have one more yaar to go.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder five years ago, I was at my second year of school at the time and due to many depressive episodes plus an exchange program I'm two years late om my graduation, which is not a problem.The problem is that because I've struggled with mental health issues since day one of my graduation (actually since my childhood),so I never got to put the effort needed on my education as I've always has to balance passing classes while not getting into another depressive episode.Hypomanic episodes did not helped either, as school became the lest priority on my list even though I used to engage in many extracurricular activities.I also have ADHD, which never helped learning anything.That being said, I'm one year away from graduating and have major gaps on my knowledge in every single field of study. I lack lots of basic information, like physiology and therefore phisiopathology of diseases, basic anatomy, etc, etc.Posponding my graduation one more year is out of question as I can't really use any extended time anymore.I'm looking for advice on sources and strategies to fill those gaps and catch up with everything I've missed (or at least most of if).What do you guys think I should focus on? Do you suggest any strategies? Is there an order of systems or subjects that would help me learning and retaining information better or easier?I feel that I have a lot to do and no time left.

Zerimas [info] I was worried about the thighs being too small. In the last 4 months I went from wearing N&amp;F Weird Guys in size 30 (which actually measures 32" and they were stretch) to needing a 36" waist.

Maybe the goal of filling out the thighs will give me something to shoot for?I am probably overly self-conscious. I have never struggled with my weight.

OKC_Zeke1792 [info] The journey to 90 pounds of weight loss (long post) My situation was unique. I competed  in NPC men’s physique. I was placing well at tHR shows I did and was getting ready to make a push for nationals and beyond. Then I was hit across the face with something Inever saw coming. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and a mild form of psychosis. I had the symptoms for years, yet I thought everyone went through hearing voices or extreme highs and lows in personality. I thought I was “normal” After my last show in 2014, I didn’t place well. I was really feeling the symptoms of my illnesses and prep wasn’t what it should have been. I couldn’t cope well with the loss, so I turned to alcohol and hard drugs as an escape. In a span of 2 years, 2015-2017, i ballooned to 280 pounds. 100 pounds over my stage weight of 180 pounds. 2018 I decided enough was enough. I lost everything in 2018. My girlfriend, friends, and everything I thought I needed. A look in the mirror was like staring at a body that couldn’t sink. I was haunted by my own reflection. Instead of taking blame, I blamed everyone else. Then I hit a new low. I came to see I was the problem. April of 2018, i decided to change. I researched tracking macros and optimal splits designed around weaknesses. It was embarrassing going back to the very gym where I was in my best shape at one point and feeling like I didn’t belong. I fought through this. I subscribed to a site called hypertrophycoach in May of 2018. Everyday I would watch videos and eventually formulated my own split. I’ve been running a split now that targets my weak points with high frequency and my stronger parts with high intensity. IT IS TO NOTE THAT I STARTED TRACKING MORE INTENTIONALLY WHEN I HIT 230 POUNDS. Day 1: Delts, tricepDay 2: hams, quads Day 3: back, bicepDay 4: chest, rear deltDay 5: hams, biceps, triceps Day 6:  chest, back, deltWith the help of Joe Bennett, aka hypertrophycoach, I was able to make a split geared towards me weaknesses. PPL would often leave me tired or I’d forget to hit something. For cardio, I stuck with traditional bro style 2x day 4x week. Phase 1: 30 am 30 pm Phase 2; 45 am 35 pmPhase 3: 45 am 45 pm Phase 4: 1 hour am 45 pm Next time, I am going to count steps instead. Maybe do cardio 2-3x week single day? We will see. Nutrition was more streamline following a macro plan instead of a food plan. Although I ended up eating some of the same things each day, I enjoyed the freedom and the creativity that I could implement. I started with 240p 225c 65fChanged to 240p 205c 60f Then to 240p 185c 55f Lastly 230-240p 165c 50fThe result of sobriety, being medicated properly, and self care got me here https://i.imgur.com/KDc4bAH.jpgFor reference I am 5’11. I went from 280-190. My next plan is to hit 205 with single to low double digit body fat by September. I plan on competing again in 2020. For now, I want to enjoy my new frame and enjoy the happiness  I am experiencing. Being manic and hearing voices for so long makes you grateful for a clear mind. Thank you for reading my story.

Helen_Damnation [info] I am concerned my former employer is slandering me and keeping me from being hired. What can I do? First, let me provide you with background:I live in CT. I am 36 and have 2 BS degrees in Chemistry and Biology. I have been steadily employed since I was 16 in legitimate tax-paying jobs. In the past 12 years I have had two employers prior to the one I am speaking of and have an excellent record with great references and fantastic yearly reviews.I began working for a company (I'll call it PE for the rest of the post) in Jan 2011 through a temp to hire position. I was intimately familiar with the machine they were developing a new prototype for. I was salary but I worked ten hour days for a month before they (and I) realized they needed someone with software programming experience which was not in the job description I was hired for and what they admitted they didn't think ahead for. It was all on good terms and they even hired me for a permanent position in the manufacturing area where I would be beta testing the machine after the software glitches were worked out.Now, move forward two months. I became very sick and needed hospitalization for almost two weeks before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was allowed short term disability at my doctor's insistence until I was stabilized on medications that would allow me to work effectively, and PE agreed (they knew I was sick but didn't know anything about my diagnosis). Six weeks went by and I really wanted to return to work. My doctor signed off on it and PE required all medical records in order to allow me to return. I had the Dr fill out the forms and signed off to have my records sent.Two weeks went by and despite my calling PE's HR department I still received no reply. I finally reached them and they said they never received the documentation. My Dr insisted they were sent but I went through the process of getting all of them together again and had them sent. Another week, same response from PE. No documents.This time I went through the process again but hand delivered them to the PE building. I receive a letter in the mail that if they aren't received in two days they will have to terminate my employment with them. I called them again and after a few days was told that they still had no records. I was unable to get the documents together within the next two days and was "let go" for failure to provide documentation.I had to fight for unemployment benefits and the state sided with me, thank god. I have been unemployed since Nov 2011. Despite my excellent work history before PE, my many professional references, and my two degrees I still haven't been able to find work - even jobs grossly below my pay scale. I am concerned that PE may be slandering me to people calling for reference info and, worse, that they may have let me go due to my being bipolar. I don't know what to do!Sorry for the long post. I am desperate and I really hope someone here can point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance! [info] None [info] 1349638544

I think about how smart and incredible you are, and how much you made me laugh and smile and how wholly accepted I was by you in our time together. I think about who you might be now and I hope you are doing something you love and surrounded by great people. And I think about everything I did - and was - that ruined us.I was stubborn. I was jealous, unfair, moody, unpredictable, manipulative, and in ways out of touch with reality. I lashed out about things that didn't matter. I drank far too much. I set so many unreasonable ultimatums. And then, in my mind, I made all of these things your fault and left you.Since I last saw you, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I have been in therapy and taking medication, and it's like a fog that clouded my memory and perception of how we began and ended has been lifted.Part of me wants to throw myself at your feet and apologize for everything that I said and did that hurt you and ask to be in your life again. Another part of me knows that I can't ever, ever hurt you again, and that even mentioning memories of our past could do that to you.But know that if I could do all of it again, I would choose you, and I would fight for you.To sum up everything here, I found a quote from our favorite movie fitting:"I'm sorry about everything.

I got the diagnosis from a couple of people who should not have made it, they always put me on prozac and welbutrin.

Well, it's crazy but it's amazing, completely turned my emotions around, and for my entire life I never had a way to self-sooth until I started taking the drug. It's not all that common, but I recommend you talk to your psychiatrist about it as an option. At this time I only take adderall and lamotrigine, and just an FYI, it's far more likely that you're bipolar type II, so make sure you read up on it, so you know that your doctor knows what he's talking about.

Ferivich [info] I think gun laws are mostly fine.I think that people should need to have mental testing done, and addictions testing if they'd like to own a gun. If you're not mentally stable, or you're abusing a substance it might just be best for everyone involved if you don't own one.I know that I enjoy shooting, and I enjoy hunting but when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder II I sold my weapons off to friends/family and gave in my license.

SmellNoEvil [info] I had a pretty wild time last year - went through a phase of having multiple super-intense (like, omg I think I’m having a stroke) orgasms during sex. My partner and I kept a count one time and I had 40 intense orgasms in the space of 1.5 hours, before we stopped counting. Earlier this year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It turns out that I was hypersexual last year and my libido and sexual responsiveness were off the charts. My orgasm rate and intensity is much lower now that I’m not manic. Interesting fact, though - we discovered that I could cum just from having a certain spot on my back pressed, with no other stimulation required.  [info] None [info] 1538911965
drifter465 [info] I can't do this anymore. This is insanity. Here I am sitting in my room doing another outline of the same story I've been working on for the last eight years. I probably do 5 a day before I end up falling asleep from exhaustion.5 x 365 x 8 = 14,600.And none of them are something I consider good enough yet to finish.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia earlier this year and so I very well might be insane. All I can do all day are outlines, different ones each time.You know that old saying about insanity? Doing something over and over again and expecting a different result.I need help and I don't know how to get over this. [info] None [info] 1545525316
Creamofcelery [info] Is anyone else bothered by the job limitations that our mental health status brings? For the longest time, I thought I wanted to join the Reserves or National Guard (yeah yeah totalBootlicker) and then I was diagnosed with bipolar 2.We are banned from serving in the military. Not only that, but I regularly get asked if I have a mental disability when applying to norma civilian jobs.If we’re medicated, we should be considered on a case by case basis. There shouldn’t be a blanket ban on anyone who isn’t neurotypical. I feel like the stigma is the problem more so than the actualIllness. [info] None [info] 1588085650
fdc7719 [info] If it’s alright to ask, what meds have you tried? I know based on other comments that there have been many, but I’d still like to ask. I was diagnosed with bipolar II several years ago and had tried so many meds leading up to that point. Lamictal as a mood stabilizer was life changing for me. I know everyone responds differently to different meds, but I still wanted to ask about your list in case there’s anything missing that either of us haven’t tried. It seems like the most effective antidepressants for me have pretty bad sexual side effects which always leaves me taking certain ones only when things get really bad. Exercise helped immensely until my health declined a year ago. [info] None [info] 1561329040

infj1029 [info] Finally hit my second (and perhaps final goal weight)! 150 to120 lbs :) Thanks, everyone! &lt;3 *progress pictures [how I looked at my heaviest, at different years 2017 and 2015](https://imgur.com/a/OiF4S)[recent picture of me, but me trying really hard to look cute lol](https://imgur.com/a/DJ3yw)Measurements: **waist**: 29 in**bust**: 35**under bust**: 31**butt**: 35I am a rectangle shape girl naturally, thus very little waist definition and little curves. But hey, I still have some boobs and I think I look cute despite not having an hour shape figure ;)The last few pounds feels like it took the longest, but I'm finally at **120 lbs**. :) My gym was doing body fat compositions today, and I found out mine was **22%**. My first goal weight was 125 but once I hit that, I was like "what the heck, let's keep going." Right now, I like the way my body looks but I might want to lose a few more pounds and tighten up my body. It's just something I'm still deciding on. :)It's been quite the long journey for me. When I was younger, I ate whatever I wanted and didn't gain weight. Thus, I ate horribly. Finally, when I turned 18, all those bad food choices got to me. I saw my prom pictures and finally saw how big I got and how unattractive I was. I didn't eat healthier but I went to the gym and did a bit of cardio. It did nothing to help me lose weight or look better. Eventually, I stopped and got even bigger. Then college stressed started to add up and I was diagnosed with bipolar. Food was clutch for me and I ate until I felt better. I also finally had a butt and boobs and I thought my curves canceled out my fat. It was like this for all four years of college and during my senior year, I was my heaviest, at 150ish. I was so in denial about my weight, that honestly, I don't know my exact heaviest. I just remember it being in the 150s. I was so embarrassed and hated the way I looked. I didn't even take senior pictures. A friend did take pictures of me at graduation, but I never posted those photos. They're the ones you see above. I just felt so ugly, inside and out. Graduation was supposed to be a special day and I wanted to take pictures too feel good, but I robbed myself of that because of my insecurities. Around June, my boyfriend made a comment above my weight (he had good intentions, he's just bad with words and understanding this isn't something a girl wants to hear -___-) and it made me realize that I am overweight and need to something about it. I'm not sure how, but I found this sub and I learned about calorie tracking. I tracked every day and started working out 3-4x a week.  Although I work out a bit, I work in an office job and probably spend 23 hours of my day sedentary lol. Eventually, all of this became really fun for me. I love finding new recipes and find lower calorie alternatives. I learned workouts that I enjoy and do those. (For example, I hateeeee cardio so I only do it once per week) I learned a lot about self-love and loving my body through this process. I was also really sick in the past and realized how much my choices affected my health. Thus, I did this all for me and to better myself. I am really happy now. My relationship is with food has changed, and I see it as a fuel source instead of a therapist. My journey is still not over, and I'm still trying to improve. :) ----TL;DR: Lost 30 lbs. :) [info] 5'1.5 SW 150 CW 120 [info] 1511210288
Silly_Sloth_Owl [info] Oh god. This is so real for me.Especially since I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I worry it may mean I am about to have an episode or something. Even when I am stable, though, I am still worried that something is wrong.Not having a reason to be worried seems to worry me.

Emshelles [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar post partum, but it really reared it’s head during my pregnancy. There were so many times I did things they confused me, I got very paranoid of the world and irritable. It caused a lot of strife between my husband and me. Then after delivery I had PPD at 1 month, 8 months, 13 months, and 19 months when I weaned her was the worse. It led to me losing my job. That’s when I got diagnosed and out on Lexapro and Latuda. I’m terrified that to get pregnant again I would go through all that but some medications are safe during pregnancy and I trust my psychiatrist to guide me. It can be done as long as you have a plan, a loving patient partner, and a great psychiatrist. [info] None [info] 1573792835

kslidz [info] that someone that is a christmas fanatic is a good example of how ocd presents itself. people are stupid man until I was in my late teens I thought bipolar was multiple personality disorder, then I thought schizophrenia was multiple personality disorder. And this wasn't because I thought this on my own this was something that lots of flippant usage of these terms implicated.  I really didn't learn a lot until I was diagnosed with bipolar. And now when people find out lots of them will act differently or treat me in ways that doesn't even make sense. There is a ton of misinformation and although many people know better, tons don't. It's the same reason I stopped making racist jokes. I never believed any of the stuff I was joking about I just thought it was an absurd concept. But I learned that lots of people think it's funny because they believe it to be true and telling the jokes reinforces their preconceived notions of what it means to be a particular race. Now I'm not saying it's on the same scale, mind you, just that it is the same guiding principal. [info] None [info] 1555685098
aquatictherapy [info] I remember finally asking for help and joking with my therapist, “Just as long as I don’t have bipolar or schizophrenia.” Guess what? I was diagnosed with bipolar rapid cycling with manic episodes mimicking paranoid schizophrenia. Sucked big time because I always thought of those two like the “big” mental disorders. No way did I want to be “crazy” like those people.The thing holding her back might be her own prejudices and fear. She has a mom and aunts with this so she might be projecting their experiences into her own life. She might be afraid of getting the official diagnosis. She might assume that life as she knows it is over. In a way it is. I have a recognized disability. One that’s hidden. One that I listen to people use all the time as an adjective. Could you imagine hearing someone say, “OMG! I feel so diabetic today! I ate two pieces of cake!”? I’ve had more than one person say, “OMG! I’m so bipolar! I can’t decide what dress to wear!” It hurts because they’re using something I struggle with every stinking day to describe a problem so trivial that it’s embarrassing. As if not knowing what to wear is tantamount to a major mental illness.I’ll be honest; medication sucks balls. I’ve never found a medication that didn’t have shitty side effects. I’m tired and groggy every morning. At any point in the day I feel like taking a nap. I’m so freaking hungry all the time, especially at night while taking medication. But the alternative is feeling like I want to peel off my skin because my nerve endings are electrifying and I’m hearing and seeing shit that isn’t there. So I suck it up and take the damn medication knowing that so many people think I’m addicted to it. I’m not and would love to chuck the lot of them into the toilet and flush that shit goodbye. I’ve been through ten med changes in fifteen years. Ten. And finally have found the right dosage. But guess what? In a year or six months that “right dosage” could change and become not effective or the FDA might approve another medication my psychiatrist wants to try and were back at square one.And take the way we’re portrayed in the media. The bipolar ones are always on a psychotic break. They’re the homeless man down the street taking to himself. I’m a thirty something woman with a full time job, two beautiful daughters, and two degrees. But when people hear that they either think that I’m A) faking the mental illness because no way would someone like me be able to accomplish anything or B) take everything I do and turn it into a huge deal and praise the shit out of it because of all I’ve “overcome.” So yeah, she might be looking at all these things and thinking (rightly so) that it sucks. And she might not want to go through it all. But I truly believe everyone has that breaking point where they say, “I’m not feeling right and I am sick of it.” If her therapy didn’t work the first few times, she needs to switch therapists. If her medication doesn’t work the first few times, she needs to change it. Sucks but there you have it. As a husband all you can do is support her through it all as best you can.BUT, if she’s thinking about hurting herself or someone else, you MUST call emergency services immediately. Period. No questions asked. She’s your wife and you need to protect her even if it’s from herself.Tl;dr: bipolar sucks. She might be afraid or prejudice about it. If she’s a danger to herself or others, call 9-1-1 or whatever emergency services are in your area. [info] None [info] 1510470862

hamsaurus [info] I've known my SO for the entire 10 years I've been diagnosed with bipolar.   He has seen me at my absolute worst times, and my best times.  When I say absolute worst, I mean absolute worst.  I've said and done things that I very much regret and will always feel very guilty for.  On the other hand though, he's always encouraged me to be open about my feelings, and he's helped me work through a lot of really hard times, and I know that it's okay because every time I have a good day he just looks so happy.  Happy and proud.  I never get sick of hearing him say that I'm doing well and that he can tell how hard I'm working.I sort of went off topic with that, but as much as I know he feels sad or upset when dealing with my issues, I also feel sad or upset when dealing with his.

minimommy2 [info] I'm drowning and I don't know what to do. I don't even know where to start. I can barely breathe. I keep trying to fix things and everything keeps getting worse to the point where I really don't particularly even care about being alive any more...but I have two little ones that need me. I just don't know what to do at this point and I'm tired of crying all day every day and the panic attacks.I'm 26, I'm a single parent. Currently I own a retail boutique and am finishing my degree in biology. I wanted to be a pediatrician originally but that's currently out of the running both financially, emotionally, time-wise, and just about everything else. I just took half of my finals for this semester (the rest on Thursday) and then I have one semester left (graduation would be in May). I am paying for this final year of college with student loans (with the possibility that my parents will reimburse me when I get my diploma). The problem is, that through bad business and personal decisions made while I was extremely manic (before I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder this year), I have acquired about $48,000 in debt. I managed to pay down about $5000 of that (purely credit card debt) over the summer - leaving me with $43,000. That number is so astronomically huge I don't even know where to start. My credit is bad, approximately 520, even though I've paid off all majority of the medical bills that were listed on it in 2015 - they're all marked as settled for less than full amount. I have one credit card now, with a $1500 limit, that is utilized and completely paid off by the due date, but it's only 2 months old. All other credit cards have been paid off. My student loans are deferred but currently total $5500. Derogatory marks on my credit are listed as age of accounts, number of accounts, accounts settled for less than full balance, and a lien that has been paid off (ex-husband intentionally didn't pay the taxes on the house so I would be liable as well - deed was in both of our names but mortgage was in his name only, and we had moved 6 hours away so I wasn't notified of the lien until it showed up on my credit. It's been released and I've attempted to submit the release to have it taken off, but it's still there.)  Breakdown:$32,000 to a contractor - have already paid him $20,000 of the original $52,000, have been served with papers demanding payment of the remainder.$8,000 - Title Loan taken out at the insistence of the contractor to "tide him over" until I could get a loan for the full amount I owed him, which hasn't happened due to my credit score. $3,000 - Medical bills from an abuse incident in April, the hospital forgave all of my abuser's medical bills but said I made too much for mine to be forgiven, even though he was formally charged and tried and is supposed to pay them...he hasn't. One just showed up on my credit this morning...plummeting my score 51 points.All of this wouldn't be so bad if I had any positive income coming in..but currently I'm barely breaking even with the bills as it is with the income from working at the store. I haven't paid November's rent yet, and now December's is due today. ($1000 each month). This is after I downsized our housing into the cheapest available space in our area, traded in my car for one without payments, canceled the babysitter and bring my youngest to work, and took my oldest out of private school. The store was originally making ~$20,000 a month before expenses (net profit ~$6k), my then-fiance was making ~$40k a year, and I had child support ($850/month) and royalties ($300/month). Now the store is making ~$3-4k a month, no secondary income, child support has been cut to $650/month, and royalties (oil/gas) have gone down to about $130/month. I'm desperately looking for a second job that's flexible enough for me to still be able to pick up my oldest from school as she's not old enough to be home alone and to either keep my youngest with me or pay someone to watch her. It just seems like an all around impossible situation to climb out of, and I don't know what to do. I've tried making plans and discussing them with my parents and structuring repayment plans, etc...but all of that hinges on them agreeing to be cosignors - which they refuse to do. They've been telling me to just file bankruptcy and get it over with, but I also don't want to lose everything I've built up...as little as it is. I just don't know what to do or where to turn.

KittyFace11 [info] I am 55.  I have been in several abusive relations, and in one, my new fiancé decided that my careful wrapping of Christmas presents competed with the way he wrapped the presents and,  without warning, started to beat me with his fist, until I passed out, and he left me for dead.  Abusers are all the same; they instigate an argument and no matter what you do, it escalates sharply.  You are blamed for everything, and nothing about you is acceptable.  They deliberately make you feel like shit, because they need that power to feel any identity.  *But anything an abuser tells you that you are, is not at all about you, but about themselves.*For 30 years I have had various friends with bipolar disorders:  any creative field seems to attract unique personality types.  I have met people in hospital settings with bipolar.  One of my best friends has both bipolar and borderline.  And recently I was diagnosed with bipolar—before that I had fluctuating moods but I dealt with them w/o medication, and also saw a psychiatrist.  (Extraordinary stresses pushed my body chemistry into, what I think of as, brain shock, and now I take medication to rebalance it .)My point is, out of all these people, I have never met an abusive person,  they care too much about others.  We’ve joked around that you’re bipolar because you are overstimulated, feel too much, and the empathy kills you, lol!An abusive person couldn’t give a shit.  Either your focus is on them, or you’re nothing.  You are meaningless.  I don’t think most abusive people know that true love does NOT mean true power.So, I strongly disagree that all people with BP are abusive.  I do agree that, in some mania, selfishness can be a predominant symptom, because you are just pretty much incapable of thinking clearly—you are swept away by a hurricane made up of a thousand tornadoes.Your ex, op, is an abuser.  An abuser can wear such a great mask!  So, whether he has BP or not is rather irrelevant BECAUSE *he is an asshole!*.   This is  not your fault:  darkness wears the best disguise,  You are well out of it. [info] None [info] 1543905198

knullemora666 [info] My advice to you: Get off all social media for at least 6 months minimum.I deleted Facebook 5 months ago and couldn't be happier. There are subliminal messages in all of social media. I have kept my Reddit and Instagram, but that is it. Way back in 2004 I was diagnosed with bipolar, back when the trend literally boomed. Take it with a grain of salt. I am not bipolar, I feel like they do this to just about everyone.You are young, hormonal, and won't stop changing until your old and grey.Don't let that diagnosis define you. Let you define you. Eat a balance diet, it will help balance the chemicals in your body. Start meditating for 20-30 mins in the morning. It might not make sense or 'work' at first, but give yourself time and you will find the go to zone to help you clear your mind. Use guided meditation on YouTube if needed. Do a sport or exercise that you enjoy. This will release endorphins and give your body a habit of providing endorphins to you on a regular basis. Give yourself time to heal. All that attention seeking you did in high school, not saying your experience wasn't real just you did it to get your family to notice you, affected how you look and are looked at in the world. Raise your vibration, if something makes you unhappy, angry, depressed then chances are it isn't good for you. Think positively, I know it isn't easy, but I promise you can do it. For example, I don't have a car right now, it broke down in Aug and I had to sell it. I have 5 kids, 3 being toddlers. Things might seem bleak, but that is far from the truth. We walk all the time, which has made us happy with the exercise and fresh air. We are more united as a family. We have discovered many things around our neighborhood. The best part is that I know this isn't forever. This is just a phase we had to go through.We always go through phases, changes, cycle and that is ok. It is so that we can grow. We are only human and don't have all the answers. The more you go through, the more you learn. Work on you, focus on you, give yourself time to be who you are destined to be, love yourself, and know that no matter what you will get through this. Also, hair grows back. I shaved my head bald last Sept because I was going through so much I let it get to me. I won't do it again, but now I have beautiful virgin hair. It is super soft and vibrant. I've died my hair since 1998 and don't remember my hair feeling so good.If there is a craft or hobby you like, do it. That way you always have joy close by. I wish you the best.

saladisawasteoftime [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was a teenager. I’ve been medicated for ten years and I’ve always ALWAYS taken my meds. It is so important to keep taking them even if you’re feeling better. I made the most movements towards regaining myself in the last five years when I was seeing a therapist as well. One of the things she taught me was to be kind to myself. The illness is never going to go away but it will get easier to deal with. So when it hits me hard for a week or so I remember to be kind to myself and remind myself that it’s ok that certain things can’t get done. When I’m sick I can’t do it all but I can do what’s important.  [info] None [info] 1540652164

BubbleTeaRex [info] I was just talking to my bestie about this. I have been diagnosed with PTSD. She told me she had PTSD for a week after she broke her arm in Hawaii. In her mind, she is just better and stronger than other people with PTSD, and their inability to “get over it” is directly caused by their own shortcomings. I explained that what she experienced likely was post traumatic stress. But it was not a disorder. She can relate to some of the symptoms someone with PTSD might also relate to, but something that goes away on its own and does not greatly impact your ability to function normally is, by definition, not a disorder. We have been friends for over 15 years and I’ve NEVER talked about mental illness at all. I knew she wouldn’t react well to it. I was diagnosed with bipolar a couple of days ago after refusing / avoiding any kind of treatment since I was first evaluated for bipolar at age 12. I was worried she would find out and make assumptions, and I wanted to explain my experience before that happened. She told me that bipolar is caused by what you put in your body and that I shouldn’t be seeking treatment. Instead, she told me to use herbs and essential oils because those are just as effective. She’s currently in school to become a paramedic and doesn’t even believe in science based medicine... I’m worried our friendship is doomed.

I had been hearing vague voices for 6 months, but thought there was a very quiet broken radio in my house/car/office (and eventually became positive there were people living in my house) and didn't realise I was hallucinating until I started hearing them right next to my ear.&amp;#x200B;The scariest night was when I went to shower and hallucinated that my entire body was covered with spiders. I ran to my room, where I then saw a strange, dark and very tall figure (picture one of the Queen's guards, but all black) in the corner of the room leaning over the bed and 2 voices just behind me scream-growled "It's coming!". I was diagnosed with bipolar 5 months later, although no future hallucinations were quite so bad.  I understand it was a hallucination, and can rationalise it all now, but I still get shivers at the memory and can still picture/hear it in my head clearly. [info] None [info] 1559235024
summerleannc [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 12, but the meds never really worked. every year the hallucinations, auditory and visual, have gotten worse.

EnvyEarthworm [info] Holy.shit. SO BAD. So I have an autoimmune disease. The early symptoms were hypersomnia, and then severe insomnia, and pain. I would also turn blue. When I was a young teenager, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was treated with zoloft, and started becoming suicidal. So they switched the meds, and I became worse. The doctor referred me to a psychiatrist and she said BPD. I ended up taking DOZENS of different drugs with no improvement. At 18, when I could legally make my own medical choices, I stopped all treatment. Funny enough, I got better. I was still in pain, and severely tired, so I went back to the doc. He saw the medical chart and said "You're fat and depressed, and that's why you're in pain." It wasn't until I moved, changed my name, and refused to show anyone my past medical chart that I was finally taken seriously. Really though, plenty of doctors used to see my chart and think that I was a drug seeker, that I just needed more mood stabilizers, or that I was (and I quote) a hypochondriac. Doctors say the most fucked up shit when they think you're crazy. The wrong diagnosis delayed a real diagnosis for years. [info] None [info] 1571244030

LewdDudeThrowaway [info] Sometimes they care,but reaching out can be difficult.I was diagnosed with bipolar-1 when I was 8 y/o, and struggled hard socially until I turned 17(i’m 22 now). I had one friend in elementary school and he was the only person who’d talk to me. I had family my age,but I was often ostracized.I didnt understand that people need space,I just felt lonely and wanted to be around people. So, I bugged my family and my friend to hang out constantly....long story short,my only friend and relatives my age ceased contact with me because I bugged them too much.As a kid,that fucking destroyed me. I never wanted that to happen again. My solution? If I only talk to people who talk to me first,then I **know** they actually want to be around me.Now,I have a best friend who i’ve known for about 5 years. This man redefined what friendship means to me.I had never initiated contact until he talked to me about it 2-3 years into our friendship. He asked me why,and I told him the reasons for my behavior.He told me that I should never worry about bugging him,or talking too much,or losing him because I try to hang out all the time.He ended with “I’m not going anywhere unless you get rid of me.” and it finally clicked. I cried,not gonna lie. It was the first time someone told me they were bothered that I *didnt* talk to them.Ever since then I’ve tried my best to initiate contact at least as often as he does. Just saying “good morning” or “how was work?” and stuff like that. It scares me,but I trust him more than I fear the feelings associated with my past.If you have somebody who you are genuinely close to,I recommend you do what my friend did for me. It may not have “trauma” behind it like mine did,but they may have a roadblock and need your help to get past that. [info] None [info] 1531206256
facialdilemma [info] is medication necessary? i'm diagnosed with bipolar II and i'm supposed to be taking 800 mg lithium every night. i sent a form to my GP asking for a new prescription sheet a while ago so i can pick up more from the pharmacy but apparently since i updated my address they told me i need to find a new GP closer to my apartment. so i haven't been taking the lithium for a few weeks as i haven't gotten a new prescription. but i really don't feel a difference at all compared to when i have been taking the medication. maybe i'm a bit biased bc i dont really believe medication does so much. but i just don't think it's necessary i have an appointment with my psychiatrist in the beginning of march and i think i'll ask her what she thinks. but i'm almost positive i'm gonna get a shocked reaction like "what?? you're not taking your medication?????" idk i'm just wondering if anyone else isn't taking the medication they're supposed to and feels fine or if it's a terrible idea to avoid taking it. thanks in advance :) [info] None [info] 1580913605

shiro321 [info] That I was insane, a murder, tortured animals/small kids/elderly, attempted suicide, a molester/rapist, a sadist and pretty much everything else you can think of about mental illness.I was  a shy kid who never had a lot of friends and always stayed to my self, I have Adhd, bipolar disorder, central auditory disorder and mild schizophrenia and have been on meds and getting treatment for it since I was 7 years old. I was the kid that had to stop by the nurses office twice a day for unknown reason(to take my meds). So this had already labeled me as a "weird kid."Near the end of my last year in middle school I spent two weeks in a mental hospital where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When I returned to school no one knew where I had been. I just told everyone that I was sick and had to stay in the hospital but one teacher decided that the official explanation from the principle was not good enough and was going to fail me for missing the two weeks and forced me to explain where I was and why in front of the whole class. This was two weeks before the year ended and kids being kids no one would speak to me, sit near me or even make eye contact with me for the rest of the year, they avoided me like I had the plague. Over those two weeks and over the course of the summer the rumors started to spread and when highschool started it was every where. The rumors followed me all through highschool and I was always treated like an outcast for it, I had a very hard time making any friends and I was bullied and ridiculed for it. This led to me becoming even more depressed and having to spend more time in the mental hospital my senior year. The school finally caved and gave me a home tutor to finish my senior year from home.

Donutsareagirlsbff [info] When I decided I needed to see a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with bipolar and she helped me see that the abusive situation in my childhood was worse than I'd ever allowed myself to believe due to guilt and shame. I took a break from my mum for six months, went through a grieving process, got my strength and told her some things I needed to say. Long story short she was sexually abused as a child and it created a chain reaction of terrible relationships. I always knew she loved me but she put me in some very dangerous situations and neglect. She took it very well, cried a lot and apologised. I love her more for the way she handled it as well.I'm still in the process of completely being in my AD. I need to talk to my father who I haven't for six or seven years but I'm much happier and more stable now. I'm also ready after a year of being with my psych to stop seeing her and manage my medication with a GP. It's been a difficult journey but easier than the ten years of turmoil I was in before I saw someone. There's still things I need to work on in myself but I feel like a different me, a better more solid me.  [info] None [info] 1520634002
DennisChrDk [info] Anyone with experience taking quetiapin(seroquel)? My moody is plummeting after an increase in dosis. Short backstory: I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2, round 3 weeks ago. I had been hypomanic for 1-2 months prior to this which then turned into a mixed state. I won’t start the actual treatment until early august, due to the summer holidays. When I was diagnosed I started 50mg quetiapin every night, to improve my sleep and balance out my mood. Thursday I was told to increase the doses to 100mg, but over the weekend my mood went from neutral/good, to very depressed and my mood changes are becoming more extreme. The weekend has been hell, with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts (nothing I'm going to act on!). Today started out fine, but I can feel that its getting worse already.Is this normal or could this be a side effect of the medication (this is mentioned in the leadflet).  If so is this something that I should talk with my psychiatrist about or will it even out over the next days? Still very in this, so I’m still getting used to all of this.

madosooki [info] Vestibular migraines, getting more and more frequent every month. A long read but please help me. Sorry if this is jumbled.I was diagnosed with vestibular migraines. For those who aren't familiar, here's essentially what happens, in my experience:Thirty minutes prior, I get what I guess is an aura. I have this intense feeling of dread. I start to get double vision, and my vision rolls up from what I'm looking at, even I'm focusing really hard. I've had moments over the years where suddenly my vision will jerk back and forth for a second or two, but it never bothered me until I got the diagnosis. Whenever it happens, though, everyone tells me that my eyes aren't actually moving. I get this rocking feeling in my neck, the way that you feel when you're on a rollercoaster, but again, my neck isn't moving at all. I always thought that it was a muscle spasm or something but I'm not sure.I get extremely disoriented. Everything looks and feels fuzzy. My spatial awareness is shot. I start slurring and stumbling really badly, and it's hard for me to understand what people are saying or what's going on around me. At this point, I can barely ask for help.Then I get vertigo. I can only explain it by saying it feels like the worst pain I've ever experienced without any real physical pain. It's so bad that I start vomiting for hours until I dry heave. I've ripped my nails up a few times trying to ground myself, whether I'm at the toilet scratching at the floor and walls or fallen down onto the ground. If I'm able to get somewhere I can lay down on my side it's not as bad, but even barely moving any part of my body is not an option, and god forbid I move my head. It's so bad I tried rolling from one side to another for thirty minutes and woke up with the taste of vomit in my mouth. If I can't catch it before it starts, I dry-heave and scream until I pass out.Here's what I've tried:* Gotten a diagnosis, though the ENT I've gone to says it might be Meniere's disease, though I don't get tinnitus or hearing loss.* Drugs: Klonopin and Meclizine. They definitely help but they don't completely shut down the episode. I still feel disoriented for about forty five minutes but at least I'm not spinning.* An antiemetic that goes under my tongue. I've only used them once since I got the medications above, but I still hold onto them.* Lamictal, although I've taken it every day since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My doctors won't amp up my dose. I never miss a dose and I don't want to go off of it.* Wearing an eyepatch as soon as I get double vision. After a few minutes I can push it up and see if the double vision has stopped. It's a great conversation piece if I want to hit the bars but it also looks fucking stupid.* Smoking pot. This doesn't seem to help. I want so badly for the state I live in to legalize medical marijuana like those lip balms or drops on your tongue, but that won't happen any time soon.* Getting my daiths repierced. I got them a year before the migraines started and they fell out a few months ago. What's frustrating is that I'm having another mild episode and I just got them redone yesterday.* Sleeping before an episode kicks in. I wake up feeling awful but whatever works.* Weirdly, I am not extremely light or sound sensitive.Here's where I am honest:* My diet completely sucks. When they started happening more frequently, I got lost tons of weight because I felt I would just end up puking it all up. I started to see my bones through my skin and now it's become a huge psychological issue for me.* I don't actively exercise but I move around a lot at my job. I don't want to be a gym rat but I don't know if light exercise work. I am willing to try this.* I smoke cigarettes. I haven't smoked for very long but I'm heavily considering quitting.* I smoke weed fairly regularly, mostly when it's around or I'm at a party.* I drink sometimes but not often.* I think stress might be a trigger, but I have no idea how to alleviate stress in light of this.I feel so fucking trapped. I can't live like this. I have lost two jobs and a very important relationship because of this. I'm going to run out of medication soon, and I can't afford the copay. I can't figure out any specific trigger. I want a regular life. I'm 21 and I just want a regular life. I want to get a job and go to school and have a better shot at some sort of stability. People cannot see this happening to me until it goes full-force. It hurts so bad. Please, someone help me, or at least tell me they understand. Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone else had this experience? Is it going to get better? Please please please someone help me. [info] None [info] 1496092303

Trans_Trotskyist1917 [info] [TW: brief CSA discussion] I think my parents are conspiring against me??? Sorry mods if this isn't the right sub for this, I'm new to Reddit. Also please don't assume this is a joke because I'm actually really serious even though it sounds crazy. Also, this is going to be really long so I've bolded the important parts. Thanks in advance if anyone reads it.I'm 21 and my parents are in their early 60s. I live with my parents for financial reasons. My problem is that **I think my parents might be part of some kind of conspiracy** and I don't know what to do.The reason I think this is as follows: **I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 18**, but when I look back on my life and my childhood, I realize that **I showed symptoms of the disorder way before then**. I began to feel depressed and anxious as early as elementary school, and then in high school I began showing symptoms of mania and delusional thinking. As an example of my delusional thinking, when I was 14 I became convinced that it was my destiny to die in a jihadist holy war even though my family is not religious at all. I was open about this with my parents and was so passionate about it that I sometimes even got involved in physical fights with my father when he disagreed with me. (I am in no way saying that I think all Muslims are delusional-- I do NOT think that, so please don't hate.)Here's the real problem-- **my parents are both mental health professionals** (dad has a PhD in Psychology and runs his own private counseling practice, mom has a Master's of Social Work and practices in a mental health clinic). So, it stands to reason that since they have over 12 years of training and 50 years of experience between them in identifying and treating mental health issues, they should have been able to recognize the obvious mental health issues I was experiencing since early childhood? But **they didn't seem to recognize any of my symptoms**. They never took me to a doctor or a therapist of any kind, and after I was finally diagnosed they adamantly denied that I was bipolar.**I think they know more than they're letting on.** Another reason I think this is because my younger sister (age 19) was sexually abused by our babysitter when we were very young, and although she displayed obvious symptoms of sexual abuse throughout our childhood, my parents never acknowledged it in any way. This is in spite of the fact that as part of their mental health training, they would have received training on how to identify signs of sexual abuse in children. Also, my older brother (age 30) has autism and is prone to violent rages, which my parents also deny. They frequently say things like, "that's not how I remember it," or "you're making that up." My question is, **why would they deny my experiences if they weren't covering something up?** I can't help but assume the worst, e.g. maybe they are on the run from the law, or I'm not their real son, or something like that.**tl;dr my parents' behavior towards me is inconsistent with their extensive training/experience in a relevant field, I suspect a conspiracy of some kind. What should I do? How do I find out what they know?** [info] None [info] 1538522767
Haybaybay2792 [info] Tl;dr at the end, my personal experience here.I was diagnosed with bipolar at 18 and after 7 years of a working diagnosis of BPD, my amazing pdoc gave me the comorid dx of both. Her primary reason was that she has seen me through both types of episodes, stable from bipolar with meds so then she could she the short live volitialy, identity issues, and relationship struggles. Then after an embarrassingly long time of DBT skills training, when I stablized from that and had a situational/medical manic episode i recongized early but used so many skills and called her right away to get through to my emergency appointment, she gave me the comorid diagnosis.Tl;dr it takes years of a relationship with a pdoc and working to get better and trying things out to get a proper dx of either or both [info] None [info] 1564241207

Ktrenal [info] No problem. Happy to help. :)The sneaky thing about the hypomanic phases is that sometimes it just seems like "not depressed". The milder forms of bipolar are so much harder to diagnose than the ones with full manic episodes, with the hallucinations and delusions. Hypomania can also just be irritability, instead of the typical euphoria, too. So it's sneaky!For me there were two very distinct signs that I wasn't "just" depressed: my tendency to start writing a novel a couple times a year, which I'd work on intensely for a couple of weeks, and then abandon when the hypomanic episode ended, and the way I reacted to antidepressants. The fact that I'd tried so many different antidepressants, all of which either made me more depressed or made me manic, was definitely under consideration when I was diagnosed with bipolar.Totally agreed with f.lux is the best thing ever!

miss-septimus [info] I don't mean to sound as if I'm excusing my behavior entirely, but I was diagnosed with bipolar II and OCD. One of the symptoms which make it difficult for me not to try and buy anything for skin care is hypomania (and also, the hoarding with my OCD). One of the minor things which occurs is impulsive buying (and consequently, hoarding) skin care products. For instance, this week, I bought a Mamonde toner, the Mizon watery cream jumbo jar, CosRX patches, and a sonic brush. Two weeks ago, I bought Niacinamide from The Ordinary and the CosRX Gentle Salicylic Wash. What helps me, apart from therapy and medication, of course, is to constantly ask myself why I do this. I noticed that I only use 70% of what I buy. The rest just makes me feel 'safe.' I also write down every monetary transaction that I make, and remind myself that I've been making progress since being diagnosed six years ago. [info] 26 | Oily/Acne-prone | NC30 [info] 1523130208
yesihaveshatmyself [info] Hey OP. First off, I have so much respect for you. You’re fighting for your partnership while balancing that with your own self care and that’s hard and amazing and important.I was diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD a decade ago. I’ve been a real mess throughout my adult life, and to be honest I still am. And almost as bad as, maybe worse than, my own struggle is seeing the toll it takes on my husband. He’s been dealing with my shit for going on 9 years now and I don’t know how he does it. For all the times I’ve nearly called it quits on my own life, I’m in awe of his ability to not call it quits on the life we share together.I don’t know what kind of person your partner is, but I know from personal experience that when my husband takes time for himself, sets boundaries, airs his grievances, and keeps me in the loop with how my illness affects him I am grateful and humbled. It’s hard to deal with how your sickness effects those you love, but a million times harder when you know that it’s *not* being dealt with at all. Over the years, my husband has taken steps to take better care of himself, and that in turn has had a wonderful effect on our marriage.I’m rooting for you two so hard. I know how much of a struggle it is. But take my advice as a person on the other end: do not set yourself on fire to keep your partner warm. It will burn the both of you. Don’t fall into a caretaker role, it’s hard to dig yourself out of that and it will only hurt both of you. Make your own space and make your needs known. Mental illness is an explanation for behavior but it is never an excuse. He must be accountable just as you must be supportive. I wish you both the very best of luck. [info] None [info] 1538781444

I was prescribed lamictal and have been taking 200mg every day since.     Fast forward now, I’m 26, I’m engaged, have a career I love, and everything feels relatively stable. I’ve been debating for over a year now that everything has settled and I’m in a routine, whether or not my diagnosis was correct. I started seeing a new psychiatrist and shared my concerns with him - that I’m a completely different person now than I was when I was diagnosed as a teenager. I don’t remember what I’m like without that medicine and that kinda scares me. After much discussion, we decided to taper off of the medication.  He gave me a schedule but told me to make it flexible and to listen to my body and how it’s reacting. I was to reduce my dosage by 50mg every 1-2 weeks.   I started tapering down to 150mg on Tuesday 5/7. On Thursday 5/17 I felt ready to taper down to 100mg. And that’s where I’m at now. I feel like I’m moving really slow on tapering but since I’m not sure what I’m like without the medicine, that’s what I feel comfortable doing. I’ve noticed increasingly in the past few days that I just have zero patience. I’m really on edge and feel fed up all the time with the people around me. I just feel so confused about this whole process.    All that being said (sorry for rambling) what was your experience like tapering off? [info] None [info] 1526882848
Fridaythe13thCh [info] I’m in sort of a similar situation. My parents never accepted anything that was out of the norm with me, I was diagnosed with bipolar at 15 but I was showing signs since 12. My parents ignored the fee psychologists that said I was depressed and what not. Then when I was 15 I knew I was gay but hid it bc of how my parents acted with me being bipolar. At 18 I get a girlfriend and we are dating for almost 4 months (at the time) so I tell my parents (bc I met her parents and I felt that she should meet mine), At first they seemed supportive, but as time went on homophobic jokes didn’t stop and I got outed to several homophobic family members who I wasn’t going to tell. It sucks to have this negativity and lack of support, but if you are able to move out do so. Find your own family full of supportive friends and you will be happier. [info] None [info] 1557839900

Lanuria [info] The Jedi have emotions. To think they don't is silly. They are human(oid) and, imo, they feel so much love that it's ridiculous. Maybe it's not a romantic or sexual love, but being able to put yourself in the middle of a fight to save people who may not even believe you exist is an act of love. To resist a tempting power so you don't hurt anyone is an act of love. Personal story time! I'm diagnosed with bipolar, so strong emotions have ruled my life for a long time. They have ruined relationships with friends and family. They have lead me dangerously close to suicide. They ruled me, they controlled me. It was so freeing to finally get on medications and not have my manics and depressive control how I thought. Sure, maniacs are kinda fun, but they are dangerous in the long run. It was liberating to finally be in control of what controlled me. I am able to hold down a great job, to have a great relationship with my husband, to find peace in my life. I still have manic or depressive episodes, it's normal. But I've learned they don't define me. I'm better than them. That's how I see the Jedi way of life. I can take my manics and do something good with them, like sewing, but I can also tell myself 'no, I don't need to buy a new sewing machine, no, I need to sleep, I'm not going to stay up forever.' The Jedi are like that. Manics aren't really an example of the dark side, but maybe they are a good example of what a force sensitive could go through. So much power, you can do so much, but if you let it control you instead of working with it, you can end up hurting yourself and others.  [info]  [info] 1476979819

g_netic [info] I'm late to the party, but..My mother had me diagnosed with ADD when I was 3 and I was put on ritalin from then on. Then in grade 7 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and began taking all kinds of drugs. I always felt very sad and suicidal, on auto pilot all the time. In grade 10, I figured if I had never, ever felt good on pills then maybe they were the problem. Long story short, my mother agreed to let me go off all of my meds except for ritalin. It was like an enormous cloud drifted away from above me. I never felt intense feelings like that ever again. I eventually went off of my ritalin as well and ended up excelling in college and now university.

Kimberlite_1223 [info] I can relate so much to your story. I was diagnosed with bipolar and from day 1 I did not have any of my family members’ support. When I was 18, I attempted to commit suicide and I was sent to the ER - then the mental ward. While I was at the ER, my mother called me and told me to get out of the hospital because the family couldn’t afford it. She was yelling at me angrily, completely ignored the fact that her daughter fell mentally ill and attempted to commit suicide. Both my parents refused to believe that I was struggling and I was completely on my own. Similar to you, I always really wish that I had their support, but I never received the kind of love I desire. Indeed it was our parents who are responsible for not raising us with the appropriate care and support, but it is our own responsibility to take care of our own emotions. I suggest to seek help from psychotherapy, as I am trying to do right now. Stay distance from your parents because sometimes distance will help. All the best! [info] None [info] 1561743672

carnivorous-Vagina [info] This isn't an attack on anyone and I I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I am speaking from experience. One of the biggest things you can do is stop feeling sorry for yourself. I know that sounds harsh or simplistic but that's a huge step and usually step number one. Because you're not going to get anything solved you're not going to get out of bed you're not going to do anything if you keep thinking the card is stacked against you and you're constantly feeling but that other people should feel sorry for you as well. Whenever I start getting angry and upset and hurt and not want to do anything a lot of the time it's because I feel like what's the point the world is against me so on and so on and a lot of it is sympathy for myself so I have to start thinking differently than that and it helps out majorly. Once I feel like everything's not pointless and I do stand a chance I'm changing how I feel then lots of change starts to happen and it makes life a lot easier. [info] None [info] 1542659993

You're not bad for "being a mess" or being less successful than your friends. You're not a failure. You are a person and life happens. Don't try and measure your success to others, it will only bring you down. You still have time to get your life where you want it to be. It may be a little harder for you, but don't assume everyone has their shit together (because honestly I know grown ass men with great degrees drinking their lives away and not really caring.)As for feeling you're in a slump, all I can say to that is personally I have found if you really work towards managing your mental health it becomes easier. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 25 and I had a very (very) hard time accepting it. It will never go away but if I put the stigma of mental illness to the side I've realized its easier to focus on getting better.You aren't alone.

guilty_by_design [info] &gt;That just means weight loss is hard, but not uncontrollable.This is 100% true. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on medication that made it *very* easy to put on weight fast, as well as cruelly increasing my hunger at the same time. In a matter of months, I went from 180lb to 225lb.For a while I felt sorry for myself. Even the doctor seemed to think that permenent weight gain was inevitable. "What's more important? Controlling your mental illness or being slim?". I gave up. I was disgusted by what I saw in the mirror, but I felt powerless to change it.Then, on a month-long visit back to England to see my mum, she scolded me for giving up so easily and getting fat and lazy. She went shopping with me to help me buy healthy but filling foods, encouraged me to walk 3 miles with her almost every day, and made me cups of fruit tea to control the hunger pangs when I felt like snacking. When the month was over, I had dropped from 225lb to 213lb. I felt incredible.When I got back to the States, I continued. I joined a gym, signed up for a free Weight Watchers membership courtesy of my insurance provider, and went shopping just like I did with my mum. I made it down to 205lb so far, shaking 20lb off my pre-mum-visit weight and almost half way back to my pre-weight-gain start point.It's hard. I've plateaued a few times, and even gained back a couple of pounds when I've let myself slip (e.g. after I had gallbladder surgery recently and couldn't exercise for a while in combination with being able to enjoy any food I wanted without gastric distress!), but when I see it, I remember my mum's firm but loving scolding and I get back on the wagon.I've had the same fight with drink. As an alcoholic - a coping mechanism for the bipolar - it's *incredibly* hard for me to quit drinking. I managed to go dry for 18 months, then fucked it all up in one night by drinking a half bottle of absinthe in one sitting. Is it not my fault? Is it 'out of my control' because I have an addiction?Of course not. The fact that something is *difficult* doesn't mean that it's *impossible*. Being fat isn't more okay for me because it's hard for me to lose weight. It's still a problem that has to be addressed. And having people say "It's okay that you're fat" doesn't help at all. It made me complacent before. It made me give up. And probably contributed majorly to the gallbladder issue I later had. Next time it could be worse. Don't enable fat people. Support and encourage them if they want it, leave them alone if they don't. But enabling them just helps them to keep hurting themselves. [info] 20lb [info] 1464294214

You have given me a lot to work with, can you suggest a good read?To expand on my issue ...I've had various situations, really complex situations, which I have handled really well in past, on my own, but for some reason I have a negative bias programmed in me.  I'm more likely to believe the inner critic. If I make some progress it doesn't last,  so my personality keeps changing to extremes,  from easy going extrovert who can go as far manipulating complex situations in his favor to this ball of fear who is mortally afraid of people and confrontation.  Because of this drastic change in personalities in past I was diagnosed with bipolar,  but it is definitely cptsd.  With me it's a very delicate balance which works when everything is balanced,  but the inner critic is constantly trying to gain power,  if only somehow I could be more charitable towards myself.  Though it's very hard,  as I had an extremely strict upbringing,  complete with physical,  emotional and sexual abuse ... It's very hard to beat that inner programming to gain control in tough situations.

hlkolaya [info] haha- well I'll tell you some of my own experiences. if you're not a believer in the supernatural, read to the end before downvoting. I could hear and see ghosts from the time I was a child. Because of this I left Christianity when I was 12 and became Pagan. I often heard people speaking to me at night or when I was alone- I could hear footsteps. Once, at a friend's, I woke up in the middle of the night to see a little girl sitting at the end of my bed. The next night I heard someone walking outside of my friend's bedroom door in the middle of the night- I couldn't sleep and waited for them to fade. My friend confirmed there was a little girl ghost in her house.When I was a little older and in my first apartment I began having dreams of falling into darkness and not being able to wake up. Dreams of a strange, shadowy man who would grab me and pull me into some black pit. Once a white hand grabbed my ankle while I was laying in bed and a few days later, while reading, I felt something in the room.. so i put my book down and right in front of me was a man- dripping wet, bloated, and pale. I ran out of there as quickly as I could! All of these incidences involved the same entity. These are only a few of the things that I experienced in my Pagan days- that doesn't count ceremonies, rituals, spells, psychic visions, past lives, etc. When I was 22 I was diagnosed with bipolar. Turns out they were all just hallucinations and medication took care of it. TL;DR I became pagan because I could hear and see ghosts. Turns out I was just hallucinating because I was bipolar. Meds=no more "ghosts". The supernatural can be explained with science. [info] None [info] 1284076078
wheredidwecomefrom [info] I did niacin tablets for a little while. There wasn't a huge difference. I wasn't depressed anymore, but I wasn't normal if that makes sense. I get hot really easily, so the niacin flush just didn't make it worth it Now I just stay away from highly processed foods when I can. Almost borderline raw vegan.

You mention ADHD shares a lot of symptoms with other disorders, which, guess what, a __psychiatrist can make those misdiagnoses too and can easily get you the wrong kind of care too__ I think for quite a few medical issues, yeah, you shouldn't self diagnose because you shouldn't self diagnose, say cancer or something, but self diagnosing mental issues is completely valid.* Not everyone has access to mental health professionals ESPECIALLY poor people and people without insurance and marginalized communities. Some psychiatrists have wait times months out and that doesn't help either*  YOU know yourself better than anyone and you can read posts and say "this is my life constantly" where again, your psych may end up misdiagnosing you* ADHD diagnosis are extremely poor in girls and this often leads to a misdiagnosis for something else* Can I mention being poor and low access to care again?* Even if a psych makes a wrong diagnosis it's important to realize that not everyone can get a second opinion, and it can be years later until they find out something like "oh, turns out, I don't have X, I have Y"Anecdotally, I was diagnosed with bipolar. I knew I didn't have it and refused to take the medicine, and years later, I asked my psych while I was being re-evaluated, and she was like, "yeah, you don't have the mania associated with it, I don't know what she was thinking". Point is, your mental health professional is flawed, they are human, they can/will make mistakes in your care and misdiagnosing is extremely comming, and self diagnosing can be very helpful and can offer up support. Self medicating is a whole 'nother issue tho and I don't recommend that. [info] None [info] 1560608073
abswank [info] Thanks~  Canceling the wedding was the hardest thing I've ever done.  I knew something was 'off' when we were dress searching and I just couldn't/wouldn't get excited.  (And it wasn't just my contrary nature kicking in.  I wanted to be excited, I just couldn't.)  I had to have multiple people tell me it was okay to cancel the wedding, that it didn't matter how much time and money we'd put in or how many people we'd disappoint, I had to do what was right for me.  So first I delayed it a year and then I cancelled it and used the money we'd put towards reservations to pay for a deposit on a new place.  I don't think I've ever been my best friend - it's always been easier to care about other people more than myself.  Probably how I got in to a situation like this, lol.  A lot of this was made more difficult because I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last year.  (Which of course was used against me later.  See his comment about mood swings.  Never used words like that until after the diagnosis.)  For the first time I ever I feel like I have something to talk about in therapy without being asked.  Trying to think of all of this as a blessing in disguise.  I just don't know how I'll get over the knowledge that 6 years of 'true love' was a lie.  Like, how do you even begin to trust again after something like that?  We had so many mutual friends.  He was the roommate of my best friend and her now husband.  Never knowing which parts were genuine and which parts were his illness is probably what will always get me.  Thanks for taking the time to read/listen.  It really means a lot.

gigee4711 [info] I'm Mad I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for 16 years. I did not actively seek treatment until about 8 months ago. This has mostly consisted of therapy. But then around June I started taking Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I felt stable for the first time in my life and it was great until I started having cognitive side effects from the lamictal. I stopped the lamictal and was thrown into mania now I'm in a mixed state and irritated all the time. I can't stand myself. I was started on Trokendi XR which is not helping. I'm mad I have this disorder. I lived so long thinking I was in control then I got a taste of "normal" and realize how hard everything is as a result of the disorder and how much I am not in control. Technically it's a disability and it just pisses me off. I know other people have it worse and I need to suck it up because this is how life is.

married_to_a_reddito [info] I am depressed. Can anyone help? So I am clinically depressed. I am diagnosed with bipolar II, PTSD, GAD, and OCD symptoms. I'm under the care of a secular therapist and a psychiatrist and am on medications for bipolar disorder. Basically, bipolar is difficult to treat. You treat it with mood stabilizers, not so much antidepressants. Some people can take them, but I can't. They make my condition worse, as they do for many individuals. All this means I've hit a wall. I'm stable now, but I'm depressed. My doctor says there is nothing left medically they can do. My therapist is no longer helping me (I'm still seeing her, it's just not helping. I've been seeing her for a few years). Basically, I feel like the only one who can help me is Heavenly Father. Does anyone know any way that I can seek spiritual healing? I'm open to anything (as long as it is Christian based). I think the only way I can truly be healed at this point is by the spirit. [info] Christian [info] 1469669156

LadySullivan [info] The therapist might have been independent or working with others in a practice, can’t remember, but it wasn’t in a school. Therapists had a hard time with me because I exhibited behaviors of someone abused, but never was. One of my psychs kind of hinted that maybe I was hiding something (which admittedly I did some times) but I didn’t have a dark past at all. I was diagnosed with bipolar so with the right meds to even out my mood, some aging, and a series of good decisions, I was able to overcome it. No therapist has ever helped me, but there was at least one that meant well, and it was nice to talk to someone who understood my condition. The only thing that really helped was medicine that made me think clearly enough to make better decisions for my life and it just snowballed into better circumstances. In general I would recommend therapy over medicine, but that wasn’t the best fit for me at the time. Come to think of it, the support group I attended for a while helped me a lot more. Being around others that could empathize as well as being support for them in return was a much more positive experience for me.  [info] None [info] 1542408364

inkedandnerdy [info] Okay. So I'm going to tell a little bit of my story here to answer this. I was first diagnosed four years ago. I have been diagnosed with bipolar, BPD, GAD, and PTSD. All after severe trauma. I went to see a therapist for the first time when I decided I wanted to end an abusive relationship I was in and did not know how to and I needed strength and I knew it had messed me up. My first therapist told me one of the times I got raped didn't count because I was drunk. I walked out and then went back two weeks later. I fought. I found a therapist that worked for me. I got on an anti-depressant. My brain only wants to kill itself when I am lost in my trauma or I decide I'm worthless (also rooted in trauma.) Yes, I think my healthy brain never wants to kill itself. If suicide was natural and healthy-thinking, I don't see how the human race could be where it is today. Every mammal is built for survival. We fight to survive. That's life. And it's hard and it sucks. But I truly believe whatever you have going on, it gets better if you're willing to give it a chance and fight for yourself.

jesssek [info] I’ve been wanting to stop taking my meds I was diagnosed with bipolar ii this October and added Latuda (a mood stabilizer) to the meds I take. Honestly, the meds have been working great. I feel more stable than I have in years. But I’m also getting antsy, almost bored, with the normality I’m experiencing, which makes me want to stop taking them. I KNOW logically that if I stop taking them, I will start to feel bad, but there’s this self-destructive, risk-desiring voice in the back of my head that says stop taking them so you can feel something other than “normal” again. Has anyone else ever experienced this? How do you combat the part of you that wants to do something risky and stupid for the sake of feeling out of control or more alive?

Lashi_000 [info] Am I delusional? Earlier this year I was diagnosed with bipolar two after a huge meltdown that led me to be hospitalized and had to dropout of school. Ever since that major episode I feel like my brain has just been rotting away.I've been starting to believe that my mom sits outside of my room listening to everything I say so she could gather every bit information about me for some third party. I think that these numbers that keep appearing (556, 314, 115) are some sort of cipher that some other worldly being is trying to warn me about something, and I've every time I see these numbers I search around for anything of significance around me to see what the numbers are trying to tell me. There are a few others that I rather not get into, but, my main question is, if, at some points like now, I'm capable of recognizing they aren't real then am I not delusional?The thing that makes this hard for me to answer this is that in the moment that these things come up, such as my mom being home or seeing the numbers, I fully and entirely believe that they are true. I really just want to know the answer before I talk to my therapist about it only to feel like an idiot if this was just some normal thing for human beings, but ,for me, I am immensely concerned and scared for my mental state in the future.

socratesthefoolish [info] Thanks MedievalPenguin! I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well. I never attempted to suicide, but I was hospitalized roughly 3 years ago.After being hospitalized, I received treatment, and after some time, I was able to discontinue use of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. My doctor is always really pleased to see me, because the outlook for people with our disease typically is very poor.It helps though, that I converted after my hospitalization. Whenever I get any weird thoughts, I can immediately ignore them, and recognize their source, because God, who is Truth, Goodness, and Love itself, wouldn't present me with the possibility of completely insane things being true. So, I've been asymptomatic for the past three years (disregarding the occasional insane thought once every month or so, which, all thanks be to God, I'm able to put to rest within a millisecond or so).I still take medication for ADHD, but for some reason I doubt that that would be as concerning as bipolar disorder.Have hope! I'm not sure if you get completely insane thoughts like I do, but, if you can begin to recognize their character, ask God to give you the grace to have a sincere and total revulsion for them. Eventually, they will become less and less frequent as time goes on.For me, it's all a matter of not giving into the insane thoughts. Without my faith, I couldn't give a principled reason to do that. But, taking for granted the truth of the Gospels, Sacred Tradition, the Magisterium of the Church, and the insights of the Doctors of the Church, the insane thoughts are pretty much akin to a fly that I will have to shoo away occasionally.Edit 1:For anyone else reading that has problems with irrational thoughts, taking these steps have been a tremendous help:1. Go about your day.2. If presented with a strange thought, immediately recall to your mind first, that God exists, and that his existence can be proved by reason, following from cause to effect, second, that because God is Goodness itself, and the Good does not deceive, that God created the world, and yourself, in an orderly, reasonable way and third, that the past, and your memories of the past are reliable, and thus, because this strange thought would contradict one or more of the preceding, it must be immediately disregarded, deeply resented, and recognized as the wicked fruits of a wicked creature.3. Thank God that He has given you this opportunity to grow in the spiritual life, and more completely depend on Him, and His promises for your well-being.4. Say an Our Father, Hail Mary, or Prayer to St. Michael (this is my standard rebuke).5. Immediately put it in the past, and go about your day. When it happens again, go back to step 2.Edit 2: It is of the UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO NEVER DOUBT ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN NUMBER 2. IF YOU SINCERELY BEGIN TO DOUBT THEM, YOU ARE DONE, TOAST, I HOPE YOU ENJOY HOSPITAL FOOD, THEY ARE DOGMAS FOR YOU [info] None [info] 1434496819
WellOkayyThenn [info] It's weird knowing when I'm in my hypomania state. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last week. Today I realised I was being hypomanic. But it's not like I can just stop it. It gave me this weird feeling of being trapped in my mind. I didn't actually feel that happy, but I kept acting all excited and I was talking all fast and being all social. Being able to say "im in the middle of some hypomania" really freaks me out. I don't know how to explain it to anyone, and my therapist always looks at me like I'm crazy when I try to describe it, but hypomania makes me feel like I'm trapped inside my mind.

I hope I'm not doing this wrong.I have experienced a lot of what you talk about going through, starting at age 15. Around age 20, after 5 years of disorienting mental agony, I was diagnosed with bipolar type I. You may be just fine, these things happen to many of us, even people who are overall mentally healthy, but if you are truly concerned about your mental well-being it wouldn't hurt to have someone look under the hood.Point is, mental health is no joke and you should speak to a professional. My parents couldn't afford it either, but the university I attended offered free consultations and therapy sessions with licensed practitioners through the university health services department.

ChaosTheRedMonkey [info] It's a trend that applies to many mental conditions and I am always a bit surprised that apparently people have a hard time reconciling the trend with Autism. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder pretty early (around 4th grade so like..8 years old?). The doc who diagnosed it was a bit stumped on how to treat me because it usually wasn't diagnosed that early, and suggested I get evaluated later in life to be certain about the diagnosis. 20 years later it still fits.Anyway, I remember when we first started talking about history of mental illness in the family my dad said something like this: "Well none that I know of, unless being an alcoholic counts. But its hard to be sure. My folks and their generation tend to be tight lipped about that kind of thing, and would rarely get checked out. So at most we might have stories of "Weird Uncle Billy who was always a bit odd" or something."So yeah, definitely an awareness and openness shift has impact stuff like this.

IwamineShuu [info] "There's nothing wrong with you, you're normal." Growing up, I knew I was inherently different from everyone around me. I didn't have the words to express it, it was something I felt naturally and without needing to analyze. I just simply knew I was different.I struggled. I struggled with other children poking me, throwing scratchy things at me until I cried and they'd laugh at for crying at 'just a joke.' I had no words to describe what was happening. I tried my best to make friends and I was met time after time with hostility and cruelty from my peers for simply existing and being different.Fat and worst of all, there was something beyond the fat that was wrong with me. Combined with my at-home lifestyle of being mocked by my parents and siblings for my peculiarities, to being poked and prodded until I had a meltdown and screamed and slammed myself into walls while no one did anything to stop. I was a spoiled brat, my diagnosis was "devil child."A few weeks ago I was diagnosed with ADHD and autism. Last week I was diagnosed with bipolar type ii. It feels strange. Many people find strength in being 'normal', but normalness has always been used as a weapon against me. To deny the fact that the vacuum made me unable to breathe, to deny the fact that eating hamburger made me literally throw up due to the texture. Being normal meant I was making it up and I was a bad kid.I wasn't a bad kid. I wasn't normal. And instead of being sad, I feel victorious. I was right, I was right all along and every adult who betrayed me and did nothing was wrong. In a way, I win. I'm getting the help and assistance I need, I'm validated. And fuck does it feel good.

I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and am listed as being disabled since 2005 by my doctors and Social Security, so I get a check from SSI monthly for about $750.00. (Edited to say "AMA" and fix a couple typos.)I consider Reddit to be my main support group (and feel that I have many friends here, acknowleged or not) and wanted to say hi since I'm not entirely sure how long I will be in the psych ward.I'm not going to reveal my real name here, but it's pretty obvious if you Google me under my stage name, "Jack Merlot". I don't make hardly any money doing that at all, obviously, but I do accept karma.As [Jack Merlot](http://www.jackmerlot.com), I'm a big sentimental Xen panda who cries at the sight of Owl City videos, narwhals in space with monocles and tophats, and beautifully articulated pun threads that run from maudlin to sarcastic to weary, then back to basics Muppet snippets that resound like old friends.But then, there's my dark side, obviously, from staring *deep* into a Mixolydian/Dorian abyss for several centuries, and I've got the pictures in my attic to prove it, for all you Internet Tough Guys. (Don't even think about it. I've got black-world-ops DarkOverlordXenu finger traps that only Swiss precision watches rival in terms of finely-grained accuracy. They power my stuff, they monitor my stuff, and they backup the backups you thought you had made of the stuff you backed up after you got rooted after you supposedly rooted my rootless Openˆß˙SˆDˆ distributed hypercube cluster.So go ahead. Make my day, punk. ;-)So, I write, I write fiction, non-fiction, cypherpunk space opera with soundtracks and all, whatever you want to call it this week. Sometimes my doctors get my plotlines and daily occurrences confused, transposed, transliterated, or transcribed. That's ok, though; sometimes I do, as well.         *****              *****                *****So, in short, *that's* what I do, and I do it well. But I didn't come here to brag, just to sigh, and to sign off for a while.I live in the Diamond Age as described by Stephenson, and show devotion and virtue like a Vickie, but with the passion and sheer wonderment of a street urchin. Grace Hopper wrote the code for my brainstem-bot, and I got to be the first android given the opportunity to help debug my own BIOS. (We rewrote it from scratch, nine times, in trinary (or *ternary* if you prefer.) This was at Hope College in Holland Michigan, so you can ask them for verification if you don't believe me. However, be careful asking too many questions. We rewrote our codices and by-laws several times after the project, and before I was satisfied with it, I had been beaten to a pulp at least four times by my own teammates, who are convinced that I am a zealot of RMS or ESR caliber.         *****              *****                *****I attribute a lot of my misfortunes in life to having a chip on my shoulder and a bit of an attitude, coupled with a smidgin of a persecution complex. I don't know if any of you are Neal Gaiman fans, but I'm a Jack. Go read *The Graveyard Book* and get back to me about what that means, smart guy.I'm also a huge Basement Jaxx fan, so I'm actually triple-jacked, plus I'm usually jacked up on biker coffee &amp; cigarettes. So I can be a bit jumpy. Approach as you would approach one of the guys in Los Lobos if he had just found another friend's body under a bridge in East L.A. I'm tired of the "Wær on Yæ Olde Apothecary", enough so that I'm working with multiple organizations on multiple fronts to dismantle it entirely.I'm a (non-card-carrying, I left my wallet in El Segundo...) member of the following orgs:* Libertarian Party* Minnesotan Libertarian Party* Green Party* MN Green Party* ACLU* Doctors Without Borders* Amnesty International* James Joyce Foundation for Peace* MN Free Music Society* Swedish Pirate Party* American Numismatic Association* National Rifle Association* Independent Party (just like Ventura, 'cept I'm not a Navy SEAL)I'm also broke as fuck and was checked in "voluntarily." That means that I can stay until they let me leave. I'll explain more later, but basically, I'm at the mercy of the state and don't know what to do.Check out my [website](http://www.jackmerlot.com) for an archive of my recordings, writings, tweets, quotes, and even Reddit-style easter eggs.**I AM ESPECIALLY SCARED RIGHT NOW THAT THEY WILL COMMIT ME FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS INTO PROGRAMS I DO NOT WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN. THE NEUROLEPTIC DRUGS I CAN DEAL WITH BUT I DO NOT WISH TO WASTE ANY MORE OF MY LIFE ON INEFFECTIVE "TREATMENT" PROGRAMS OR "STRUCTURED DAILY REINTEGRATION PROGRAMMES" THAT ARE TEDIOUS, CONDESCENDING, AND TRITE.**But I also have a girlfriend and a cat, and I want to do the right thing for them. But what is the right thing? Even with my girlfriend's support, I keep being sent straight back to the psych ward.         *****              *****                *****I don't want to be a big douchebag and ditch the gf, cat, and just jump ship one way or another, but I'm torn. And as a Jack, it's not like I don't have options. ° I can truly, truly be a giant douchebag to someone, given some motivation. Ask around. °As a Jack, I feel a special kinship to Jack Nicholson, and especially enjoyed **One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest**. (The book is even better than the movie.)Anyway, anything could happen at this stage and I really wanted to check in to America's [weird-ass pagan-style holiday slightly-disguised-as-a-potlatch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potlatch) before disappearing into a swirling quantum entanglement.Any advice before I power up my TARDIS and immerse myself in some poly-dimensional taste-testing?Thanks in advance,(and stay classy, Reddit.)- Jack Merlota.k.a. dragonfly__blueorangered__me4email__addyP.S.

GayStold [info] When I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The phrase “it clicked” is so cliche but there couldn’t be a more perfect term for what happened in my head. It was like every single episode and symptom over the past 5-6 years just all of a sudden made so much sense. It was the biggest relief of my life to be able to see all of my perceived wrongdoings as symptoms of awful episodes [info] None [info] 1543270275
Bigpoppapenguin123 [info] Has anyone went back on an old medication and find it working again? Hello all. I used to be on Effexor XR 4 years ago. 37.5mg alone helped me out of a depressive slump big time! After being on 75mg for months, it stopped working. I was also flipping back and forth between the immediate release and the xr. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder 2 or NOS, and I’m currently on abilify. I was thinking about trying a low dose Effexor again along with my abilify to see if I see some kind of relief once again. I’ve been on a medication carousel since, trying things like Prozac, Zoloft, pristiq, Wellbutrin and viibryd which sent me to hell! Has anybody ever been able to go back on a previous medication and find that it helps again? Any experience, good or bad would be appreciated! [info] None [info] 1579797962
Unfortunate_Dildo [info] Had a Breakdown and Just Left Alright. I'm 22, and I'm diagnosed with bipolar. A lot of stressful shit has been going on and i just got back from Kentucky to Florida. I woke up this morning, heard thunder, and immediately had a breakdown because I left something outside. After I went to go get it, I couldn't stop crying. I have no idea what's wrong with me, but I did similar stuff like this when I wasn't medicated-- But I'm medicated right now. My wife has Narcolepsy and fell asleep while trying to calm me down. Before I knew it I found myself at Walmart. I had went from my house and drove to Walmart with my wife's car. I texted her to let her know where I was, but I haven't received anything from her or anyone. So I guess I'm shit up a creek, but I need to figure out what I am supposed to do about this. I don't even know if this is bipolar at this point or what it even is. My pdoc appointment is months away. [info] None [info] 1497557613
sailingthesasseas [info] Bipolar disorder + ADHD... sometimes I can't even tell which one to blame So, since I was about 12, (I'm 27 now) I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADD. (now ADHD-PI, per DSM-V)Nowadays, I'm not really noticing the Bipolar symptoms nearly as much as I am the ADHD symptoms, and I can't remember the last time I had a real episode of anything, just wandering about in the euthymia(sp?) spectrum. Has anyone had something like this before? Maybe the symptoms are just being subsumed into my ADHD, maybe the ADHD is just getting worse. It's improbable that the bipolar disorder would just... fade away, right? My does of Li is at least half of what it would therapeutically be, although I don't know if I'd want to risk not having it. But has anyone experienced something similar?NB: Yes, I am in the process of scheduling an appointment with my shrink, but I want to know what other peoples' experiences are.

jess-mills_ [info] Ok so before I was diagnosed with bipolar, I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Prozac. During the intake all she asked me was how I felt on a scale of 1-10. I also have dermatillomania, which is a type of ocd. She literally said prozac would solve all of my problems if I went on the max dose. She prescribed me 20mg and bumped it to 40mg the next week. She also said I didn't need to see a therapist and I should call in a month to check in. About 4 weeks later when the side effects kicked in, I started my sophomore year of college. Long story short the prozac activated my bipolar, and I went through a manic phase without realizing it and a depressive phase. Long story short I ended up in the hospital because I drank way too much and hit my head on a table and had to get 4 staples in my head. It kinda funny - I told the nurse that my gown could be a prom dress lolol. I was very suicidal in the hospital and the psychiatrist at the hospital said I was possibly bipolar. So I went back to my psychiatrist and explained everything that happened at school (I had dropped out at this point). She was like oh ok well the meds won't work on ocd unless you are on 80mg...so she literally prescribed me 80mg and I was like wtf I basically went insane on 40mg...so I told her I didn't feel comfortable with 80mg and the psychiatrist at the hospital thought the prozac was activating the bipolar. She literally said "oh you probably just talked to a social worker at the hospital. They don't know what they are talking about, but if you are feeling bipolar we can try a different medication" So then she proceeds to scroll through her phone (she wasn't even on a computer or taking notes for any of it) and after a few minutes she was like hmm maybe this one. So she prescribed me seroquel and she was like "oh this is an antipsychotic but it doesn't mean you are psychotic. Take it tonight and call me in the morning if you feel hungover" I explained I had taken the 40mg of prozac that morning and she was like oh that's fine. So basically I was like um shes crazy and never picked up the prescription and never went back to her... [info] None [info] 1556354464
coffeeandjesus1986 [info] My ex boyfriend-emphasis on ex. Almost 14 years ago he was drunk one night and I told him I wouldn’t go out with him that night he was drunk and I wasn’t going to be the designated driver. Plus I was sick of his abuse when he was drinking. He had raped me twice previously, tripped me down a flight of stairs because I wasn’t paying enough attention to him I hit my head on concrete knocked me unconscious but I stayed I thought it was my fault.It escalated. That night he took my no as an insult. He punched me in the nose, busted my lip and gave me two black eyes. He then proceeded to choke me and then I fell to the ground. He then using his steel toed boots (famous brand begins with a “T”) to kick me in the ribs and delicate areas. I started screaming help and then in the far corner of my eye I saw my best guy friend as it faded to black. Best guy friend I found out slugged him in the face and drug him away from me. I don’t remember this but I told him take me home just don’t tell anyone. I awoke in the backseat of my car in absolute agony watching the street lights go by I was under the blanket I kept in my car. Best guy friend was taking me home. I blacked out again woke up in my bed with him staying with me. The next day he called my girlfriend (not lover just best friend) so they arranged a meeting telling me to leave him. I will never forget looking in my bathroom mirror my face was bloody and black and blue. I had a bruise from my armpit to hip and my ribs hurt. I never saw him again I never pressed charges I tried to move on with my life.I entered therapy 5 years ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and complex ptsd from the abuse. I still have nightmares and I still flinch sometimes when I’m touched. I have a beginning of a uterine prolapse from the abuse. I’m married to an amazing husband who has never hurt me pushed me to get help and has been by my side through it all. Domestic violence is horrible I’m just glad I’m alive.

lfkstlpnw [info] Seeing a new psychologist Thursday I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last year and had twice-weekly sessions with a psychologist for almost a year. I learned a lot and healed a lot with his help. A few month ago I decided to take a break from him because I was feeling like we weren’t doing anything in the sessions but small talk, and I was feeling in a good place.I’ve been struggling much more lately and decided it’s time to go back to therapy. For many reasons, I am not wanting to continue with the same guy who helped diagnose me, so I am seeing a new psychologist this Thursday. I’m annoyed that I’ll have to start from scratch with her (if I even like her), but I know that’s just what comes with my decision. But I’m looking forward to it and trying to be optimistic!

Seouldier12 [info] I need to get out of my PhD program as quickly as possible. I am starting my fifth and final year as a PhD student in engineering. I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder about 9 months and am fairly certain that I cannot complete what remains for me to be able to graduate. Things have gotten to the point where every single email from my advisor or another labmate sends me into a panic attack. I don't know that it's really worth going into all the detail to explain why exactly, just that he keeps giving me more and more to do in less and less time with almost no feedback other than vague things like "this needs work".Again, I feel very strongly that I cannot continue. I have mentioned this to him several times, and the changes he enacts to keep my workload at a reasonable level only last days to at most three weeks, and then it's back to the intense stress and expectations.I have been anticipating graduating in December, but honestly I don't think I can make it through January, let alone another 10-11 months. I intend to speak with a department graduate advisor to determine if and how quickly I can leave with a Master's, but I'm not sure if that's possible or if I could even last out this whole upcoming semester. What advice can you give me for negotiating with him and the department to be able to leave as quickly and beneficially as possible? [info] None [info] 1514835761
-Master-Builder- [info] I wouldn't say it's negatively effected my life.I was diagnosed with bipolar type II when I in the USN, but I have been self-medicating with marijuana since I was about 14. After joining the military, I obviously stopped smoking marijuana. I didn't realize at the time that it was the only thing keeping my mood stable. During my time in the military, due to a combination of stress and lack of medication, I had the biggest psychotic episode of my life. This is what led to my hospitalization and diagnoses of bipolar type II.Now I'm vaporizing marijuana on a daily basis, and it helped me quit my cigarette addiction of 10 years. I haven't had a major episode in years, and I can fall asleep every night (insomnia comes hand in hand with bipolar). Needless to say, the only thing about marijuana that negatively effects my life is the laws that govern it. [info] None [info] 1442523729
ben_ji1974 [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar for years. Been in treatment off and on for years. I spent nearly 3 years out of work and doped up while fighting for disability only to get shut down.During this period in my life I am unmedicated and relatively stable though there have been cost. I don't have the energy to fight a broken system and I know one day time will run out. All I can do is muddle through with one foot in front of the other and try to avoid doing too much stupid crap.For me to try to live a long life the only way I can see that happening is socially isolating myself. While I can muddle through just about any job, I have had so many that at one time my G.A.F. was a 38. I don't like it. I dont have the highs as much anymore but a slow steady low keeps me going just enough to function without crashing. I try to manage everything with routine and trying not abuse alcohol or drugs. I am very fortunate to have my current wife, she truly is my best friend and a far more wonderful person than I could have hoped to have in my life. I feel very fortunate.Both of my parents died in their 50's. Mom was from her physical health and my biological father from his mental illness. In my opinion if I live to be 60 I will consider my life a success. [info] None [info] 1400011335
bassguitarking [info] When I was younger (age7-12) I would do things like this all the time. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 and put on antipsychotics and it went away :(. Now that my disorder is controlled I use this kind of thing to my advantage. I'm a biochemistry student and in Organic Chemistry I can easily visualize complex 3D structures and interact with them as if I'm working a computer program. I also have lucid/vivid dreams almost every night. None of the features are as pronounced or intrusive as yours I'm sure (my disorder's psychosis is intermittent), but I'm glad I am well treated and my brain works differently.

garbagetrain [info] The mixing up words thing is really weird and I still haven’t completely figured it out, but I think it mostly happens during psychotic episodes. It happens other times too, but much more subtly.I was diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD at the same time when I was 22 and started taking Lamictal. Then I started taking Adderall about two months later. The insomnia should go away after you get used to taking it regularly. When I’m not taking it regularly I have to make sure that I take it early enough in the day that it won’t keep me up. One bad night of sleep is enough to trigger mania for me so sleep is extremely important for me.I also felt that my brain was “frozen” and this continued for over a year after starting medication. For me, we think it is psychosis. One of my doctors thinks I have schizoaffective, instead of Bipolar 1 w/psychosis which is my official diagnosis.I have also noticed that certain foods make my brain scrambled. Like I have to be really careful what I eat before I go to work or do anything important because I literally cannot function sometimes because of it.Don’t end it. I have been soooo close so many times and the manic episode that got me diagnosed was the worst thing that I have ever experienced in my life, but medication really helped. I still want to die sometimes but it’s nowhere near as bad as it used to be. My life improved so much since getting on medication. I’m like a completely different person now.Stick it out until you can get medication :\) [info] None [info] 1524964066
charlieq46 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in 2010 by a psychiatrist, it was treated by depakote which ruined an entire year of college for me. Depression was diagnosed by a general practitioner in early 2013 and then "rediagnosed" in early 2015 by a psychiatric nurse practitioner.Pituitary growth was diagnosed by MRI in Nov. 2014 by an endocrinologist. Subsequent cortisol tests (one mouth swab, one pill-then-blood-test) showed no raised cortisol levels deducing (I think) that it is not hormone secreting. [info] This user has not yet been verified.

kitty07s [info] &gt;  fat after being on antipsychotics for a few years.That is one of the mysteries to me, because that is what happened to me as well. I was gaining and losing weight normally ranging between 125-150 since high school due to hormonal changes, appetite changes, eating and activity then I was diagnosed with bipolar. I was 145 lb and due to manic espisode and incredible energy I worked out like crazy and lost again to 123-125 lb, then I was diagnosed and I was put on antispychotics. I gained 10 lb immediately in one week just in the hospital. Then I gained exponentially to 160 lb in 2 months! I was definitely not eating an extra 2000 cal over my TDEE which is the amount needed to gain this much in 2 months. I stopped gaining immediately after I could come off the antipsychotics but without meds it was hard to lose the extra weight. I gave up and over 5 years after I gained an additional 20 lb since I stopped caring anymore and gave up on weight loss. I am now able to lose since I am not on meds anymore. I am almost losing the extra 20 lb I gained post medication (so I am totally accountable for that) and hopefully I could lose 30 lb of the medication induced fat as well. People do have varying metabolisms but unless they have certain medical conditions, the variations is not that high. But being teenagers the growth hormones and other hormones can make you be thinner or heavier than normal because they are all wacked up and your body still changing. People's natural weight based on their diet and activity usually settles after teenage years.  For me I think my natural activity level and diet  set me around 135-145 lb in adult life. Other than that men and women who have thinner body structure are more prone to move and are more naturally active and less hungry, add the height and gender and you get even more burn, so they move around a lot more and burn a lot of calories and they don't realize it, so even if they eat crap food, they are are still not eating over their TDEEs so they don't gain. Sudden life changes that decreases those activity levels, messes up their hormones or their eating will make them gain more weight.  [info] 20lbs lost [info] 1492975624

HighnessOfCats [info] First off: I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and bpd, and I want to share some insights that I've come to learn about myself and the expectations I have of my partners. I also have a little bit of a different perspective on this than others might have because I'm studying psychology in university. This might not work perfectly with what you and your SO are going through, but hopefully, it'll give you some help. Medications/therapy is important. As much as you love your partner and want to help him, you cannot do anything unless he's helping himself. It's extremely important for him to realize the strain and stress that he puts on you if he is not even trying to help himself. The on and off again cycle of medication is a really big warning sign that he believes that after a while that he's "cured" or "fine" once he starts feeling better, which is not the case. Bipolar is a lifelong mental illness that requires medication the majority of the time, and the only exception is when discussing with a psychiatrist. Hypersexuality is a thing, but people can control it. This is a sad point to make known, but if he truly did not want to cheat on you, he would not have. If you are completely monogamous this should be a warning sign to you because even in a hypersexual state people are able to direct it towards someone or something. The manias can make it difficult to rationally think about doing so, but it's still possible. But this leads back to proper medication and therapy. For this particular case, it's therapy and how to work through bouts of irrationality and hypersexuality. Next, blaming it on his mental illness is never a good sign. Mental illness a reason for difficulty within one's life, but it, and never should be, considered *the* reason someone does or doesn't do something.  There are exceptions to this, but him using it as a manipulation tactic is wrong. If he cannot see that, you have a problemI understand that you want to be a supportive partner and, in all ways, it seems like you really have been but there is only so much you can do. My SO likes to say "There is only so much warmth you can provide a person before setting yourself on fire for them". From my perspective, you've done everything that you've can and it is now up to him to do the rest. If he is consistently resisting and doing the opposite, you might want to re-think your relationship. It's not fair to you.  [info] None [info] 1492446605
hypohallucination [info] I think I was on Yasmin in my early 20s and it was good for my skin. I can't remember why I stopped, though maybe the NHS wouldn't prescribe it later on. I tried microgynon and then the progesterone only pill the summer before I was diagnosed with bipolar, though they both gave me a constant headache, twitchy right eye and worse mood swings.I really wanted to try spironolactone though the NHS won't prescribe it off label and claim it's too dangerous. They wouldn't give me metformin either because I'm in the 'normal' weight range.I'll definitely think about asking for Yasmin again.

Kattw0manus [info] Welcome! Welcome to all who desire to get better and look for ideas and inspiration at how to cope and be safe in a world where we can be extremely insecure and suffer from issues with our emotions and stability. I will gladly share my progress and experiences with my struggles and be grateful for the others who do while always considering, progress first and not perfection.I am 45 and was diagnosed in 2008. I have experienced many ups and down with treatments. I have a huge toolbox of things to combat the negativity and self-harming patterns I have habituated, however I do go back and forth with episodes which hinder employment and functioning normally with others at times. Currently, when I get overly emotional, I isolate and spend time writing and working on learning and understanding the different feelings I am having. I am also spending a lot of time meditating to calm myself down which is helping slowly and for now as I practice awareness a lot. That has taken years to understand along with some Buddhist practices.I am not sure when I began to suffer, however I remember my mother explaining a story when I was 4 and someone trying to teach me checkers in which I flung the entire board and pieces across the room. My mother replicated a lot of the same abuse on me which her father did to her so I tend to lean on the side of the house that humans do naturally reflect each other. To note on that, I am convinced we can change and even if something is a genetic disposition, we can use tools to help us.Over the course of 17 years, I tried the following medications for stability, zoloft, valium, xanax, klonopen, lamictal, trazadone, wellbutrin, geodon, adderall, ritlan and if I have left any out, you get the picture. Initially I was diagnosed with bipolar so the medication was more catered in that avenue. I was so curious about my natural state that I insisted a psychiatrist at a rehab I attended take me off all medication to see really what was happening with me as I felt suicidal on pretty much everything I took. I am medication free these a days and utilize talk therapy once a week no matter what. Sometimes I make leaps and bounds and sometimes I don't want to be in my therapist office and have some emotional breakdown where I turn into a little kid crying while trying to communicate. I have been known to abandon therapist in the past for months at the time when I felt uncomfortable and it wasn't a good thing as I only sought help when I thought I needed it the most. I have decided, talk therapy will be in place until I am dead probably. It is my life-line. I have possibly more issues than if I took medication, however the feeling of altering my senses and the side-effects that come along with them aren't worth it to me. I deal with many different addictions which impulsivity plays into and one of them is prescription medication as well and can't control the impulsivity of abusing the meds first and I have tried to OD twice which I survived (Thank you God). I need to use skills from CBT and DBT to deal with life on it's terms.The difficult impulsivity items I work on creating different habits for are addiction, suicide attempts, negative attention seeking through anger, cutting, eating disorders, excessive spending, sexual compulsion and filtering my communication.&amp;#x200B;Happy Sharing!&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B; [info] None [info] 1537572377
jellyresult [info] It depends who you’re telling. In certain situations, like you’re an easily replaceable low level employee with an at will employment contract, probably not a good idea to tell them. There’s always a possibility that your boss may not be as understanding as you think, and try to find little things to fire you over, or make you quit. I worked front desk at a hotel once, and after a little while my manager and the group, who were super tight knit friends, wanted to know more about me. Eventually I spill the beans that I deal with mental illness (at the time I was diagnosed with bipolar, which ended up being an incorrect diagnosis). It seemed to go over fine, everyone seemed cool about it. Then the next week I’m in the ER at 3 am for severe and sudden cramps, and text my manager that I won’t be able to make it to my 7 am shift. She texts me at 7 am that I’m fired, “this isn’t going to work out”, etc, and to pick up my final paycheck with HR. And because I live in Florida, my employment contract was at-will, meaning they or I could terminate employment for any reason at any time. If I hadn’t told anyone about my mental illness, I would not have been fired for missing one single shift with evidence from the hospital that I was in the ER. A friend of mine recently was hospitalized for 72 hours in the psych unit. He mistakenly told his boss he was in the psych unit- instantly fired as soon as “psych unit” was spoken. But had he been, idk, in a car accident, he would not have gotten fired, as that’s exactly what happened to a coworker, and he kept his job. Moral of the story: you don’t need to tell anyone except your closest people, and especially don’t tell an employer, unless it is 100000% necessary, because many people will try to screw you over.

Moonbaby313 [info] Well I was diagnosed with bipolar after a break down. I pushed everyone out of my life and then mentally I just...snapped. When I reached out for help and I was diagnosed it kinda mind-screwed me. I went from this sense of superiority and feeling like I wasn't getting what I deserved to feeling like something was wrong with me. Now I guess Im scared to deal with people because I don't know which part is actually me. So it's easier to just keep my distance I guess. I am in therapy and I do have 2 people in my life who know my diagnosis. They are very supportive so I've learned not to take them for granted. because the self inflated ego was part of the mania, it's easier to identify and not get caught up in. In some ways I'm more relatable...but now I don't feel comfortable letting people get close to me. Such is life. [info] None [info] 1516921615
mistixs [info] Well...I entered the therapy when I was 16, a sophomore in HS...I went into the mental hospital first, WHICH WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE 0/10 DON'T RECOMMEND GOING TO SUMMIT OAKS IN NJ EVER. It was literally the closest to hell on Earth I've ever gotten. I'm not even kidding. But that's only the hospital I went to. There are many hospitals that are better than the one I went to. So I'm not bashing hospitals in general; I'm just bashing Summit Oaks. Anyway, after that, I went to a Partial Hospital Program, which was basically a "hospital" I went to, but only during normal school hours, from like 8am to 3pm. That *really* helped. That's where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and learned a lot of these coping skills, including the ice cubes one. They had different "classes" throughout the day, like anger management, group therapy, etc. I do recommend. I used to go into psychotic rages like you wouldn't believe, for really stupid reasons, but with the therapy, I learned how to control it &amp; channel my anger in healthy ways. (&amp; For further update, I then went to a therapeutic school to finish up high school, and just graduated last month. I'm doing so much better now. My mom said that sending me to the therapeutic school was a godsend. Now it's at the point that it's not that I need to control my rage, I actually don't feel any rage to begin with! Which is amazing, considering how it used to be a weekly thing) You can still go to Partial Hospital Programs even if you're not in school. Like, adults can go to them, too. But you probably don't want something that intensive, so I would recommend going to anger management therapy classes in general, whether in a group, or solo. Learning CBT &amp; DBT skills is also good. Even if you don't see an actual therapist, you can probably find PDFs online! :)  [info] None [info] 1438637789
peweje [info] Me being bipolar is an important thing to know, and sometimes it comes up in conversation, or they ask.They ask "is there anything I need to know about you before we continue" and I go "No, not really. I was diagnosed with bipolar at 14, but I manage it quite well"What's crazy is I usually say this and then they still fool around with me.Maybe I'm too serious with people? It's not just women though, it's people in general. I have a hard time making friends because I get annoyed quickly. I don't think it's so much what I'm saying, just how I'm saying it or the subjects I'm bringing up. I tend to talk about serious things with people, and sometimes that's not okay.

Chellybean411 [info] We were like peanut butter and jelly, Except we were Steven butter and Chelly. We met in school and instantly fell deep in love. We spent every day and night together in Brooklyn NY going to every show and making music of our own. After about 6 months I moved in with him and we lived happily together for a year or so in Williamsburg playing house and dreaming up our future. We had to move out of our love home and down deep into a dungeon like basement against my will. I didn't want to move there but because he was more financially responsible we ultimately did and had to adjust to having roommates and no windows or proper ventilation or day light reminders. This was the beginning of the end.... I lost myself down there. Forgot my identity and what it was about myself I loved. Also, I felt disconnected from him and disappointed in unfulfilled expectations. It didn't mean I didn't love him endlessly and want to spend the rest of my life with him though it was circumstantial. We be an dreaming of moving away from NYC we went to Seattle to visit my family and had the best trip ever. We were so happy and in love and I wish every day I could go back to that time. When we returned to Brooklyn he confessed to me that Seattle was a place he didn't see himself. I think it was at that moment I checked out. I began to have what I know now was my first ever manic episode. I began heavily drinking and going out with friends and made a horrible mistake one night while intoxicated  with a guy who knew me and my love but didn't care and pursued me anyways while I was very drunk. My love immediately knew something was wrong within the following days. He confronted me and I confessed to some degree about what had happened. He didn't want to know details and we dropped it. Eventually it would be the end us though. Now I am alone.I lost my home, best friend, family, band, friends and basically my whole life. On top of all of this I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder very recently and I thought that maybe if I told him it would change everything and he would forgive me. But he didn't and I cannot cope. NC has been very difficult for me I slip and send him sorry I love yous all the time. It's out of my control but I can't let it go I can't stop fighting for it. I know he still loves me and I love him endlessly. I know with every fiber of my being that we are meant to be together and I can't deal with this. Every train, song, sign, store, coffee, and cigarette reminds me of him. When will he realize that we are suppose to be together? He said maybe one day we could be friends. And I cannot deal with this loss. I want to be back in our home and our bed with our dog so badly. I put my notice in at work because I'm going to Seattle to clear my head and but some distance between us but I still cling to the hope and the future and vision we imagined. I love you Steven butter. Love, Broken-hearted Chelly. [info] None [info] 1481813292

brokenteef [info] BPD and bipolar? I originally thought I had BPD when I went to my psychologist because I was so unstable, over spending, promiscuous etc. Turns out it was mania and I was diagnosed with bipolar. I have asked my psych if I had a personality disorder a few more times (because it's something that really scares me) and he has said no each time.  However, I recently got out of hospital and finally got around to reading my discharge papers. First thing it says is "cluster b personality traits". That really upset me (because I REALLY don't want to have a personality disorder).    Does anyone have any insight into this? Is it normal for a doctor to not tell you about a diagnosis change? Does "cluster b personality TRAITS" mean it's a personality disorder or just that there are similar traits? Does this possibly mean I'm not bipolar but actually borderline?  My mind is really churning through worries right now. Any thoughts will be greatly helpful (and I know nobody can really give me any medical advice, I just need to sound this all out).

keepcalmandreadabook [info] I feel completely overwhelmed. I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder last week and started medication that makes me sleep a lot, and will continue to do so, for at least a few weeks time. I'm taking my last semester at a community college, five courses, most of them programming languages that I have to learn (almost as difficult as learning an actual language), and am very behind in several of my courses. I am back home with my parents, but only have until this semester ends to live with them. This is my last chance to buckle down and get serious about school, and yet I still find myself wasting time with other activities.I decided to smoke pot again in the middle of the semester, and it's been 15 days since I last toked, but just those two weeks of toking really set me back. I didn't care about jack shit while I was high, and I failed several exams and got behind on many assignments. Before that I was actually pretty ahead in all of my courses. **I have to turn this around though, my future depends on it, but I have no idea how to do that.** I feel so overwhelmed, I have a lab assignment due tomorrow that I haven't even started that when I attempt to sit down and do, I feel completely lost in.

Happy, sad or in between. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at age 14. Now 28 years old and I honestly still don’t know the difference between 1 and 2.

dandeliondid [info] Don't take it from me, really, but you might have borderline personality disorder. It can be mistaken for bipolar sometimes, since the symptoms are somewhat similar. To be honest, I was diagnosed with bipolar II (this means that the manic episodes are not as "up") when I was in my teens, but later on the diagnosis was changed to borderline.I'm pretty sure that doctors can't tell your parents what's going on unless you're planning on hurting yourself or someone else. It may take a while to find a therapist you like (i've gone through a bunch), and to develop a relationship with one that do you like. Often when dealing with emotional or mental health stuff, there's a lot of trial and error with treatments and doctors. It takes time, but if you are really worried about yourself it's worth putting the effort in. I'm glad your girlfriend is concerned for you. Even if your relationship isn't "average" or whatever, the person you're with should always have your best interests at heart. I'm sure even your parents are just worried because they want to see you well and happy. [info] None [info] 1417195166

alejandrofrankenheim [info] That's absolutely true. I was diagnosed with bipolar I a while ago, and still hide it from everyone except my close friends. Work has no idea. It's embarrassing to me, and I don't want anyone to judge me for it. I'm on meds, go to the doc regularly, all that stuff... and it really helps me function, something which I thought I could do before, but I wound up in a severe manic episode jumpstarted by drinking a shitload and very nearly fucked up my entire life. I'd always suspected there was something wrong with me, but that episode cemented it, and the doctor immediately recognized it for what it was.People judge others for their problems, sometimes on purpose or sometimes subconsciously. That's why it tends to be hidden. But, worse than that, are people who glamorize it. I've met people who think after I tell them that there's something about it that makes me a tortured genius. I'm not. I'm the guy who wakes up at two in the morning and decide to abandon my life and go live in the forest, driving for hours to get there, and then losing all interest.

It can feel degrading at first but many employers—at least the good ones—are empathetic and willing to work with you to find a balance for managing work life. I had a manic episode within a month of starting a new job. My employer graciously told me to take off as much time as I needed to recuperate and ensured that my position would be there waiting for me when I was ready.

eatpoetry [info] Dude I met at church camp in 2010. We had an immediate connection, made out in the dark on the last night, got told by a camp counselor to "leave room for Jesus!" while playing tonsil hockey the morning we were all leaving. I fell in love with him over the course of about 4 days, something about him said "he's the one." He told me he felt the same way. Problem was I went to college the following fall and became severely depressed. Depression led to full blown psychotic break. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but it was actually something more like PTSD. During that time I sent him a lot of strange, psychotic Facebook messages. He ended up blocking me. To say I was embarrassed when I got my right mind back was an understatement. Dying every day from shame is more accurate. At some point years later I sent him a message from someone else's Facebook account apologizing, and he unblocked me. At this point, I am in a serious relationship with someone I plan on marrying and I believe he is either married or in a similarly serious relationship (I think he's still with this one chick that he's been with for a really long time.) I have no interest in him anymore romantically. But I just wonder sometimes what he thinks of all that shit. If I could say something to him all I would say is "Damn, I'm so fucking sorry" even though I didn't really do anything to him. It was just weird because we had such an incredible connection and it fucking disappeared. [info] None [info] 1541830201

AyeMyHippie [info] I cant Trust Doctors anymore I saw my first psychologist when I was 14. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 17. The same doctor that diagnosed me started me on meds around the same time. Between the ages of 17-24, I was always on medication, with it changing over time. I can’t even remember all of the different meds I’ve been put on and taken off of. The entire time I felt like shit. Neautral, nothing in life matters, no happiness, no sadness, utter shit. One day, I decided I was done feeling like that. I’d rather be miserable than 100% apathetic. So I told my doctor I would like help getting off of my medication because I knew it was dangerous to just stop. He handed me a prescription and said “I can’t force you to take anything.” So, I didn’t take anything. I went through withdrawals. I threw up until there was nothing left, ate almost nothing, and spent a week in bed, wishing I would just die. It was the most miserable time of my life. Then, I started smoking weed. It helped me more than any of the meds ever did, and I could still feel emotions. It was like a rescue inhaler for extreme mood swings! That’s all I’ve used ever since. Fast forward to this year. I started a new job, and it started making me feel depressed again. I recognized that it was getting out of control and made an appointment with a therapist. The first thing she asked about was medication, and I told her what I said in this post. I also informed her that medication was absolutely off the table. I would not be going back to that. I was here for therapy and that was it. She seemed okay with that, and we started working on my issues. Then, last week, medication came up again. She wants me to consider going back on meds. I don’t want to do that. I’ve completely lost trust in my therapist, because it feels like she genuinely doesn’t care what I want, and like every other therapist I’ve ever been to, just wants to get me on medication. She says I was probably over medicated, and I’m inclined to believe that, but there’s always something in my mind telling me she’s just trying to push pills on me, like the other ones did. Is it possible to have productive therapy with that level of distrust? Is there any reason I SHOULD trust her? Do therapists that don’t rely on medication even exist? Idk, I’m just feeling a little lost right now. I don’t want to go back to medicated me. That was terrible. But I also don’t want to end up doing something stupid because I’m going through an episode.

thecrowening [info] This stuff makes me so fcking angry. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago and since then have been on and off different meds trying to figure out what works. I'm not trying to invalidate her experience: side effects can be frustrating and make you feel out of control. However, I do get a little testy when she gets melodramatic about 10-15 lbs from Lexapro when I'm trying to cope with weight gain, hair loss, skin rashes, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and the emotional roller coaster of thinking I've finally found what works only to have a mood shift the next day. It's so triggering for me to watch her have an existential crisis over 15 lbs. You're absolutely right: some people don't have a choice about the weight gain. She's really privileged to be able to have that be her biggest concern about a medication. [info] None [info] 1563979766
hufflepoofs [info] When I went to seek therapy as a teenager, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder because of the meltdowns that come with autism. My psychologist never bothered to ask me any questions about my sensory issues that I told her about, especially involving food, and just instantly prescribed me anti-psychotics which made my Asperger's even worse honestly. I haven't been formally diagnosed but I have all of the characteristics to a T and any advice I read on combating issues involved with Asperger's has helped me out immensely. Plus the people who are close to me tell me they are 100% certain I have Asperger's.

OctoberOctoberaus [info] First time posting here It seems that the main group of bipolar is just filled with memes and such. So I thought I would post here instead.A little backstory of me: I was diagnosed with bipolar syndrome in mid-2015 I believe. Which took awhile for psychiatrists to figure out what it was. One said depersonalization, the other said psychosis. It was only later that the one psychiatrist and my family doctor to figure out what it was really was, bipolar.Now that I got out the way. I have many questions to ask. 1. Is it easy for someone with this mental illness to fall out of interest very quickly, like a hobby, or doing something on daily basis? 2. For someone that is on the basic meds, like lithium, how do you manage your weight? Because I do know a medication like lithium causes weight gain, but  it stabilizes your mood better than any medication out there. Mind you I also take a 3 week injection called 'fluexonal' (if I spelt that correctly). And finally 3. I know mine would be diffent from yours but, do you recall your actions when you were in a manic state like an episode? I sure hell don't remember mine at all.So lately, I've been trying to get my life back into gear after my fuck up's and recovering from episodes. I'm trying to kick alcohol out of my life, I've quit weed. I've been walking more to lose the weight. Recently taken a super part time job on the weekends to make some decent money. And also, been attending AA meetings. But it seems like I'm not doing enough? I dunno.Thanks for time to read on my late night thoughts. [info] None [info] 1558505559
firecrackergirl [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and did not have this reaction to any of the drugs they put me on. Now, I'm already pretty convinced that I'm not bipolar and this is just another nail in the coffin of a failed diagnosis, but it would help if you knew specifically which drugs cause this sort of reaction?I was on Ativan, Zyprexa and Zoloft. I'm not any longer because fuck Big Pharma and I don't need drugs. [info] None [info] 1321389554

confusionhysterical [info] I had a nervous breakdown in the beginning of what would have been my senior year. My mother, noticing that I was on a downward spiral of drug addiction and general craziness encouraged me to withdraw and move home. Years later, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which explains so much of my behavior. I wish I had taken her second piece of advice and sought mental health help earlier, but c'est la vie...Life since then has been a series of ups and downs, but I don't think I would change anything for the world for if things had been different I wouldn't have ended up in Charlotte where I met the love of my life. Since leaving school I've worked several different jobs ranging from boring office work to retail to animal care but currently I'm working as a stripper, which I absolutely love.The only thing that really gets to me is still paying my student loans and having nothing to show for it.

helplesscougarbait [info] Bipolar 2 memoirs? Hey all. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 last summer. It’s been shitty trying to figure my stuff out and it leaves me kinda hopeless sometimes. I’ve lately been struggling with the long term effects of this illness and wondering if my shit will ever get okay. I’ve found a fantastic therapist who recommended I read books by others who have been through the same things. I got ‘An Unquiet Mind’ today and have been appreciating it but wonder if anyone can recommend something that speaks more to bipolar type 2? [info] None [info] 1535436344
RTJ333 [info] Ask your therapist to recommend a presentation or programs for parents and family members of people with mental illnesses / mood disorders. Ask them to recommend it to your parents.  I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was in my early 20s my father at first didn’t think it was real, he thought I was just making it up trying to get my way, etc. It took him going to a meeting of some sort (I didn’t attend, it was only for family of people like us) and hearing about other parents and families share stories of similar things they were facing for him to realize mental illness is a real. I know it completely changed things for my parents. Luckily for me they became extremely supportive in helping me get help afterward. [info] None [info] 1551551661

trashytreebaby [info] Firstly there was the presence of both depressive episodes with manic episodes.Then when I started seeing a psychiatrist it came up that I have many of the other traits - risk taking behaviours, agitation, impulsiveness, reckless behaviour (ie: reckless spending) restlessness, self harm, delusional thoughts, problems with concentration, frenzied thoughts, all of which were far worse when I'm manic. I also experiance psychosis when manic so I was diagnosed with bipolar 1.There's a lot of good resources online, but at the end of the day seeing a doctor is your best bet. That way you can get on medication and get therapy, and trust me if you have bipolar disorder getting treatment will turn your life around. Finding a good psychiatrist and psychologist is essential. Finding meds that work can be a struggle but when you find the right ones you'll be shocked at how much better you feel. I didn't get diagnosed til I was 20 and I feel like when I got on medication I actually got to start living my life properly without my life being ruled by mental illness. I do have other issues that I'm working on but I feel so much more stable and like dealing with those other issues is possible.Treatment for mental illness is never easy but 110% worth it in the long run.

miyaav [info] I was a good, smart kid during my school days. I often worked alone on a group assignments because after some reminders, nobody responded. Getting into  university I was still somehow that textbook smart-type of person, but slowly I took an easy way out to only take the smallest responsibility in a group assignments. Perhaps it was actually just a part of something bigger, not sure. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a couple of suicide trials in my second year of uni.I still like studying, learning a lot of things, but I don't have a job, I do things but I just don't know, maybe I am a coward,. Sometimes bad bad bad thoughts passed inside my head. I wished I could have the totally opposite experience, being the naughty, lazy, useless kid in my early years and worked hard after that. Instead of being a good kid during childhood and was ruined by my broken self in the final four year of what society saw as the most important aspect of education. Because the stories are always about smart, succesful, rich people reminisced how they used to be a fool, etc in their early years, not useless adult reminisced their successful childhood.

MadTheologian [info] Hi!Before we approach the contraception question, the bigger question must be asked: What is the true Church?  My Lutheran background informed me that I can identify Church by two tenets: whether Christ is preached via the Word, and whether the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper are administered.  If a congregation preaches Christ as described in the Bible-- the Son of God, our Savior, if the congregation can say that their teaching comes from the passing down from generation to generation and not merely pulled out of thin air, if the congregation offers the Sacraments, that is a good indicator that you belong there.  And you know, you belong to the true Church because you are baptised in the name of the Triune God.  The fact you care about belonging to Christ means that you \*do\* belong to Him.  My late husband and I opted for sterilization prior to marriage for medical and genetic reasons.  It was not an easy decision.  I thought we were selfish until events later in life unfolded.  I was diagnosed with bipolar I (which means I must take medicine that will affect fetal development) and my husband later suffered from dementia.  It was not an act of selfishness that we decided but it was instead an act of prudence.  Consider: your wife has a disease that requires her to take medicine.  You know her more than some guy who only has an encyclical in his hand.  Prudence is when you realise your wife would not be OK in various ways if she got pregnant.  I say that you are NOT selfish.  Ultimately, we all make decisions out of our limited finite minds.  God gave you reason to make sure you and your wife's wellbeing are intact.  We all will make error, but be comforted as we do live under the shadow of the Cross.  I hope this helps.Yours,Carol   [info] Smalcald Anglican (ACNA) [info] 1534600824
the_taraist [info] I thought about using a throwaway, but what the hell?I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder 6 years before I started law school, but I was sick much longer prior to that.  I'm not sure what affect it has had on my performance, because I don't really know what law school is like without bipolar.  I've been relatively stable.  I'm a mediocre student, but I have a job I love, and I think the future looks pretty good.  My latest setback are panic attacks, which I have not experienced before this semester.  I think it is a combination of working 20 hours a week, plus full time classes- just the first time I've done that.I'm going to join everyone in saying that you're not alone.  The stigma is pretty bad, and depending on your state, you might have to disclose.  I disclosed bipolar on my application for character and fitness.  I had my interview a couple weeks ago, and the thing that really let me swim through was 1. I have not gotten in any legal troubles, and 2. I've never been hospitalized.  And how does a "crazy" person, like myself, pull that off?  Compliance with my treatment plan, and general good health habits like everyone has described here.  (Although I'm quite lax with certain things because I'd prefer not to stress over little details.)  Exercise is huge for me, though.So, I guess what I'm saying is its better to get help and disclose, than not get help for fear of disclosing. I realize you didn't mention that, but it was horrifying to me at first.  I talked to my ethics professor, though, who was a huge help.  We had some people give a presentation on mental health at school, and they said something like 10% of people have a mental illness or substance abuse problem when they start law school, and by 3L that number jumps to 40%.  People might not be talking - but they are in it.edit:typo [info] Esq. [info] 1384414147
chilly-wonka [info] Husband doesn't understand/agree with my diagnosis. Hypersexuality really complicates things. Advice for talking with him? **TLDR:** My husband doesn't think I have hypomanias, even though he comments on my symptoms and a lot of people around me see it. Also, it's hard to discuss past episodes that would help clarify it for him, because he's involved in most of the behaviors I regret, and I don't want him to feel guilty or attacked.  //After I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, it took me a while to tell my husband - he didn't really understand mental health issues for years and found the whole topic kind of weird. When I did tell him, he was surprised and said he didn't really see it. That was so weird for me to hear, because it was a lightning bolt moment for me that explained so much stuff from my past. I told my best friend from childhood, and she immediately said, "Oh, yup. Totally makes sense. Explains a lot." I told my sister, and she thought it was weird at first, but as we talked about it, she kept realizing more and more ways it matched up with my behavior. My husband is trying to be supportive, he wants to accept it. But it's hard for him when he doesn't feel like it's true, and it's hard for me to trust/communicate with him because that makes me insecure. My most recent hypomania seems SO clear-cut to me in retrospect. Lots of behavior that was different from normal - lots of energy, big projects, little sleep, talking fast, short-tempered, etc. I'm usually pretty lethargic, I avoid getting things done, I sleep a lot, I'm calm and laid-back, etc. Most of all, I was hypersexual. We had sex so many times that he said, "I'm so sorry honey, but you've worn me out sexually. I need a break for a few days!!" (Didn't think that was even possible)But (and here's where it gets complicated), I also slept with a couple other guys - with his knowledge and permission. He's a kinky bastard in general (which I love). For most of his wild ideas, I like them in fantasy, but would never do in reality. Until I'm hypo and then it seems like THE GREATEST IDEA EVER. I always feel shitty afterwards. Since getting diagnosed, I was 100% set on not repeating those behaviors, and felt like I could do that. Before this episode, it had been a few years since our last escapades, and we had talked about my regrets, and I explained that I wasn't interested in doing that kind of stuff anymore. He accepted that very graciously.Then this episode. A random guy started hitting on me and immediately I wanted to have sex with other men - one of his fantasies we'd talked about before (too much of a rabbit trail to explain here). I sexted with this guy for days, made plans to meet up for sex, and then he canceled on me. Pissed off and pent up, I went on craigslist, texted a couple guys, and jumped for the first one who responded. Hopped in the car and went to go fuck him, about half an hour after the idea popped into my head. This is so strange to write about even now, it doesn't sound or feel like me. I'm not an impulsive person at all. Again I'm pretty lethargic, and I think things through methodically and analytically before doing anything. And stable-me has no interest in fucking other men. But I did it multiple times because I kept wanting more, more, more. After the first guy, my husband wasn't even feeling it anymore, but I *needed more.* I feel gross thinking about it all.Anyway, how did my husband not see it? My boss, sister, and psychiatrist all noticed immediately (not on the sex stuff obviously, just my general mood/speech/behavior). My husband commented on or reacted to all of those behaviors - "Can't believe you're bouncing out of bed so early again!" "I can't understand you, could you talk slower?" - etc. etc., and of course he knew about the sex. He noticed all this, but still didn't get it. It's confusing. In past episodes, I've done other sexual things I regret very much, but he was involved or aware of all of them, and he liked it. To be clear, I don't judge him or hold him guilty in the slightest. I made those choices of my own volition and it isn't his fault. But I feel like talking about these experiences, and explaining them in the context of bipolar, would make it sound like I AM blaming him. *He* was of sound mind when they happened - so saying I did them because I was hypo, and that I regret them and would never do them otherwise... I just think it would make him feel like it's his fault. In one hypo episode, we decided to get pregnant right after getting married. In another, I asked him for a separation. All of these things are so tied up in our mutual lives, that I can't comment on my behavior without commenting on his, too. I just don't know how to talk about these things without him feeling judged or criticized. [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1474426962

AbrasiveArmadillo [info] Struggling with my Diagnosis I'm having a really hard time accepting my diagnosis. I know I've had some kind of mental illness probably close my whole life but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about two months ago. I fluctuate between thinking there is nothing wrong with me and thinking that I'm the cause of every problem I have ever had. I know that is the all or nothing thinking associated with bipolar disorder but sometimes I just don't believe it. I think I am driving my boyfriend crazy because I tell him I don't have anything wrong with me and he just glares at me.

gr8dane95 [info] All Might from My Hero Academia.(Sorry for the long post and formatting, I'm on mobile)(And kinda drunk)When I first started watching the show I saw him and was like "ugh, just another perfect, overpowered character to satisfy the weaboos". But when I saw what he really was, I fell in love with the show. The exact moment I saw him in his "skeleton" form, I realized that he's exactly what I strive to be.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14. It was rough, and it still is, but I'm doing my best to work with it. There are days where I feel weak and unable to do anything at all, and there are also days where I feel like a goddamn superhero. That's honestly just the duality of being bipolar, and I came to accept that after a long time of living through it. There will be ups and downs, probably ones that are more extreme than the average person, but hey... That's just the hand I've been dealt. Then I watched MHA. In the first episode or two it introduces All Might as this unbeatable monster of a hero (in the best way). Villians can't beat him, superheroes can't top him, and everyone around adores him. LAMEEEEEE. Sounded like a knock off Superman to me honestly.But then I saw his "skeleton" form..I had never related to a character more. He was so weak. So frail. So broken. He wasn't always that symbol of peace everyone thought he was. Hell, the majority of the time he was weak and unable to do anything at all, but regardless of the odds, he still fought with strength and a smile so that others were encouraged to stand alongside him.I'd like to think that's the kind of person I am.My illness does hold me back. I'm fully aware of that. I can never be a happy, fulfilling adult. But I'll be damned if I don't give 110% and use that 110% to inspire people to fight even harder. That's what All Might did. Kinda.

khaosnmt [info] I'm a bit late to this one, but I've been trying to figure out how I want to tell this story. Wall of text incoming.I went to apply for summer and fall classes last week, and both my advisor and the associate Dean of students told me that I should give up on getting my degree because I'm obviously not trying hard enough. I have had the last two years of hell dealing with family and personal health problems, and that apparently means nothing to them.They told me that I am too far in debt (the only point they made that I agree with, by the way. $100k is a lot), and that I am too far behind and lack the focus and dedication to ever finish my degree. They have all the doctor's paperwork and notes to show that I wasn't skipping out on classes, so that's not the problem. To me, the problem is that they only want my money and their certifications, and me failing and dropping classes is screwing up their certification numbers.I plan on transferring to an online school soon. That way I can do shit on MY TIME and deal with everything else.Background below:I am adopted. My parents adopted me late in their lives. I was 6 weeks old (so I'm told). My mother is currently 74; my father is 70. I am 23.Both of them have COPD and my father's is end stage. I am a full time college student trying to get a bachelor's in information technology at a probably the most known school in my state. As such, it's a difficult school to attend.Lately, both parents have been having health issues. Both have the beginning stages of dementia (although my mother won't admit it). I have been back and forth countless times in the last two years making sure they are taken care of. It's a 3 hour drive one way. I am my father's only child, and one of four for my mom (her youngest, in fact). My brothers never call, but one of them lives 30 minutes from her and visits for lunch occasionally. Mom still works full time because it's the only way she can pay her bills.I live paycheck to paycheck. I go to school full time, and I work full time. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and type 2 diabetes last year. (Thank you biological parents and genetics...)Two years ago when this all started, I talked to my instructors about missing classes because Mom ended up in the hospital. I ended up dropping out that semester to take care of her. Last semester, I had hell because of all of the tweaking and testing the doctors had to do to get me stable on my medications. I failed a class and passed the others. One was a passing grade, but not enough for my degree requirements. I missed about a month of classes this semester because Dad ended up in the hospital and then a nursing home for physical therapy and rehabilitation. Being his power of attorney, I had to be there to deal with the paperwork and money. If you actually read all of that, thank you. I needed to get this out. [info] None [info] 1461446185
BaliHaiCR [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2. I take lamotrigine for mood stabilization, which has served me well since diagnosis and I have no plans to stop taking it.

I still enjoy drinking and a little toke on occasion, but my general life experience and world outlook are greatly improved since discovering kratom over a year ago. Now I'm in full control of my alcohol and cannabis use. Very grateful for this plant. May I ask what antipsychotic you take? For a brief period I took quetiapine, which did not react well with kratom.&amp;#x200B;Interesting article, and maybe we'll soon discover more and greater benefits for people with serious mental disorders.

H3LL0FRI3ND_exe_file [info] When someone is better than you at something I’m not diagnosed with NPD, but I think you can have some nice inputs on what I’m about to tell you. I’m quite the athletic type. I played soccer/football for many years and I was the best player. I constantly dominated on the field and my father, my teammates and my teammates’ parents always complimented me and basically I was a star in the community. Everybody knew who I was and what I was capable of. However, I eventually started to hate football and I wanted to quit, but everybody kept pushing me to keep going, even though I didn’t want to. My mental health started to decline and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I quit playing football and started focusing on school. I have good grades, but I don’t get straight A’s. Working hard has been difficult because of my diagnosis and also because I started having flashbacks of an incident. My grandmother sexually abused me and I believe it has scarred me. It changed me into a different person. Anyway, I’ll get to what I really wanted to talk about. Whenever someone does something better than me, I become angry. Not at myself, but at them, because they are living proof that I’m not the best at that particular thing. I often have this feeling that I can do better than everyone else and that I deserve praise and special treatment because of it. So when someone I consider lesser than me do betterthan me at something, then I get angry and think «how dare they do better than me when I did a pretty good job»? I have to be the best, but they prove that I’m not. I hate that. I also get angry at my teachers if they give a grade I’m not satisfied with. Can you relate? [info] None [info] 1548974894

ChalenesEvilTwin [info] What really fucks with me is that it makes me question my own disability. I am diagnosed with bipolar, on disability and constantly struggling to reengage with society. But am I really sick, or am I just one of "those" people? Am I just blowing my own issues out of proportion or do I legitimately need and/or deserve (to the extent that anyone deserves anything, which is arguable...) the help that I'm getting? Am I jumping on the trendy bandwagon? I really don't want to believe that about myself, but I'm sure no one else does either.I think people with actual gender dysphoria must feel the same way.

Because of my kids, my dog, my wife, my husband etc. But sometimes there is no answer. They are unable to find a reason to live, and they think there must be one, at least one thing to keep going for, and yet they still find nothing. Sometimes this is a slow realization, but often it can be sudden, but equally as devastating in either case. Sorry if this doesn't answer your questions. [info] None [info] 1382177536
yourfrootloopdingus [info] How sneakers have changed my life and helped me deal with mental illness I was always the fat girl growing up. I was bullied my whole life for what I looked like. I never felt I was truly able to be myself and was always hiding behind ugly clothes and a fake smile. When I was older I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and with help got on the right medication and therapy. Once I finally felt "myself" enough to be confident in who I was I found kicks. I don't have the luxury of wearing all the clothes I like because of my size, but with shoes I can pick up from what everyone else can. Through sneakers I found I could express myself and not have to compromise based on what is available to me. It seems silly but at the end of the day I'm just happy I can buy the same shoes that a size 0 can. Of course sneakers don't cure the underlying issues that contribute to my weight or bipolar disorder but they remind me that I'm worthy of feeling confident in my skin. [info] None [info] 1528257377
jncummins86 [info] Although I appreciate the sentiment, I can say with all honesty I have no alternatives than to keep taking what I’m on. I have been diagnosed with bipolar since 2009. This year is the first time I’ve ever tried lithium and this is the first time in my entire life that I am feeling “normal” emotional range. Unfortunately, given all I went through these past two years and the consequences of trying pregnancy safe alternatives after the no meds at all attempt, I am certain I will attempt suicide if I get that low again. On the flip, I am almost certain I will lose my marriage with the next extreme mania. Lithium can do a lot of harm during pregnancy. But I’m told by both my psych APRN and my OBGYN that through monitoring more regularly and closely and maintaining my health otherwise it is possible to deliver a happy healthy baby with no side effects from it. TBH, I’m amazed at how calm I have been posting this and responding... each passing day I realize more how much it’s important for me to stay on my meds the way they are.I hope you are able to find what works for you. It’s almost as unhealthy TTC while mentally unstable as it is to be on meds that MAY have effects... the struggle to know what’s best for you is real. Much love to you. [info] None [info] 1573431262

DeepDee [info] I know that life. I was diagnosed with bipolar after I stopped drinking. I think the main thing to keep in mind is that happiness is the wrong goal. Life is about waking up every morning and working hard. Doing what need to be done and living a virtuous life.The main things that keep me from being down are nature, art (music), and philosophy. They're all impartial and can help you stay balance, especially emotionally. Life can be hard, but drinking only makes it harder. [info] None [info] 1532162091
oh-hi-doggy [info] Disgruntled ex is accusing me of child abuse and untreated bipolar disorder Wisconsin, USAMy ex "Dad" and I were together for 4.5 years consisting of many ups and downs.  Our relationship ended in August 2015.  Together we have a child "Son" who is 4 years old. Dad lives and works in a different state but only three hours away.  Dad lives with his brother in a shared 1 bedroom apartment in a big city.  Dad sleeps on the couch.  I just completed school and live in a two bedroom apartment in a small community.  I have our son most of the time, with Dad taking him every other weekend and lately almost every holiday (so I can work).  Son has his own bedroom and goes to a daycare on a daily basis.I was diagnosed with bipolar type II 1 year before I met Dad.  I'd been hospitalized and treated.  I haven't seen a psychiatrist since Jan 2011 and no longer see counseling or take medications.  I have not needed to seek treatment for my mental health since 2011.I started a relationship with "Boyfriend" in early November.  Boyfriend is starting to play a large part in my life and spends a lot of nights sleeping over.  Boyfriend doesn't show too much affection to me in front of son.  Boyfriend has never met Dad before.Son has regularly been seeing Dad and talking to him on the phone 3 - 4 x per week.  Sometimes I talk to Dad and he gets upset about our failed relationship and calls me names.  He turns around and says he still loves me and wants me to give him another chance.  Son told Dad about Boyfriend on Wednesday Jan 6 on the phone, saying how Boyfriend and Son have recently watched Star Wars together.  Dad demanded to speak to me and immediately began questioning.  I told Dad Boyfriend's name and basic information.  Dad called me a "Selfish disgusting bitch" and "You're confusing him!"  I've tried calling Dad back to explain the situation, that I'd like for all of us including boyfriend to be able to sit down together and discuss how we should go about this.  Dad won't contact me and hasn't tried to contact me or our son since.This morning a sheriff arrived at my door with paperwork from Dad's lawyer accusing me of child abuse "bruises to thighs and buttocks" and unstable mental state "untreated, diagnosed bipolar type II and suicidal ideations."  Dad never contacted CPS or the cops in regard to any bruises.  Son did have bruises on his legs due to a fall from rough-housing days before he saw Dad. Dad wants son 100%.I want to continue joint custody with Dad.  Our Son deserve his Dad in his life.  I just graduated from nursing school.  I have 0 debt and I do not want to start acquiring it through lawyer fees.  I can't have allegations of child abuse on my record especially with the degree I have and jobs I'm seeking.Should I attempt to settle this outside of court?  Should I now aim to have our child 100% now that he's making these false allegations?Edit: Dad and I were never married even though the tag says divorce.Edit 2: parents have offered to help me pay for a lawyer.  Court date set early feb will update. [info] None [info] 1452534171
scuman [info] Sticky Fingers Dylan Frost apologies for unacceptable behaviour, has bipolar schizophrenia from their facebook:  "In recent times my behaviour for a large part has been unacceptable – I’m writing here and now with a heavy heart admitting this, and wish I had faced my issues earlier.I am realising now a lot of people around me have been hurt by my behaviour and for that I am incredibly sorry. I have not sought to target individuals or groups. All people around me have been affected by my behaviour during these episodes.I have been dealing with alcohol addiction and mental health issues. Last year I was diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenia and have struggled to deal with that. This is not an excuse, but it hopefully means I can get better.To try and work through this I am seeking help and will be attending rehabilitation and therapy in the coming weeks. I am truly sorry to the people that have been affected by my behaviour. Many thanks to my friends and family for helping me through this.

Incantationess [info] Banned from your house? Well so is my son. *trigger warning about suicide*Hey neighbors, there's been some crazy stuff happening to me and I wanted some advice. Here's some background. A few weeks ago I tried to kill myself. I took 4 bottles of Xanax and a bottle of muscle relaxers in hopes that I'd be taken painlessly from this world. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and borderline personality disorder and couldn't afford my meds so I tried to end it all. I have an 18mo son who wasn't involved in the situation at all. I am honestly surprised I wasn't killed driving and running all red lights. I feel awful that I even put people in a situation where they could possibly get hurt. I talked to 5 different medical personnel and took myself into a psyche ward. I was immediately released as they didn't see anything wrong with me. (4 bottles deep y'all, I blacked out). My husband tried restraining me and I beat him. So I got a domestic battery in the 3rd degree charged. This was a 3 day suicidal rampage. On the last day I wrote a little suicide note and took all of my pills. I threw some up and fell to the floor. my MIL found me in my puke pile, called for ambulance, and it's been crazy since. She banned me from her house. I've been picking up the pieces like going to court, counseling, etc. I spent 6 days in a psyche ward. I sent my 18mo to a different state with my family so my husband and I can work some stuff out. I feel empty. Nobody is taking this seriously. This wasn't a "cry for help". This was a real life suicide attempt and nobody is trying to help me. I'm being chastised everywhere I look. I'm damned if I do. I'm damned if I don't. There is no upside for me. My MIL hates me and won't lift the ban off of me going to her house. So I decided that if I'm banned from going to her house, then so is my son. Simple as that. But my husband doesn't agree and neither does my MIL of course. What do I do? I can't even take care of myself right now. I don't need all of this added drama.*edit*- I live with my husband and son. MIL lives about a street away so she was able to make it to our house pretty quick. [info] None [info] 1576778933
BreakingMyInsides [info] Hi, I'm not much older than you (21 year old, master's level graduate), but I was diagnosed with bipolar II around the same age. Been involuntarily committed about a year ago, came out, graduated with honors, went onto a graduate program, graduated again with honors. Had a very serious manic phase where I was having a bout of paranoia (i.e., when the apocalypse comes, dinosaur heads will be the new currency, so I went about collecting them), and a few "less serious" manic phases in which I got four tattoos in less than 3 months.

Kedestria [info] I've been with my fiance for 2 1/2 years, and known each other for 4 1/2. I'm diagnosed with bipolar, and we suspect that he may have it as well. Relationships can most definitely be hard with mental illness, but just like relationships without mental or physical problems, it's something both sides have to be willing to work with. There will always be issues in relationships. I'm currently unmedicated and I get pretty wild on both spectrums, but he's stuck with me through all of it. The nights of breakdowns and self-harm where all I can do is cry and the days of irritability and invincibility and flying off the walls. We've seen each other at our worst and we know we can keep doing what we've been doing. I love my man deeply and wouldn't change him for the world, and I know he feels the same way about me. So while it can take awhile to find someone who will stay with you and love you for who you are, it's not impossible and it's definitely worth the search.

Jew_With_a_Knife [info] Seconding the mental issues! I'm admittedly a really picky eater (although nowhere near as bad as OP's bf), and after YEARS of struggling with that (and a plethora of other issues) I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My psychiatrist told me that picky eating and issues with food textures can often be related to disorders such as bipolar and borderline.That being said, with encouragement from my therapist and psychiatrist it is something I'm actively working on. But even before I got help I would have NEVER limited my partner to my shitty diet. That was my burden and mine alone, I've always known that it's an irrational behavior. Wanting to control your partner's diet like that hints at more than just food issues.Honestly OP, you should stand up for yourself! Eat whatever the fuck you want, and tell him that he needs serious psychiatric help for his control and food issues. [info] None [info] 1443211275

cmark88 [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar II and ADHD, so I know a little bit about what you're going through. People that haven't experienced how these medications make people feel can lack empathy. When I was on medication, I feel like I lost all drive to be empathetic, when normally I am extremely so. The lack of empathy made it so I didn't care at all that I was failing out of college my second semester and wasting my parents' money, when normally that would have caused me a great deal of stress and guilt and shame.Since that time, I've been able to complete college and a graduate degree thanks be to God. I haven't been on lamictal for 8+ years now, and off of adderol for 4+ years. Instead of continuing down a path of trying to medicate everything, my urge would be to seek help from a qualified professional counselor. One that won't jump to medication as the first option. Be honest with yourself though, you need help. You need prayer. You need wise counsel. You need friends/pastors/family that understand and empathize with you, but who also won't allow you to make excuses for poor behavior.Edit: also, I urge you brother to remember that our Holy Spirit is a Spirit of self-control. It will be tempting to be compulsive while you are manic. You will feel the urge surging through you like a train engine to be compulsive and explosive in some way. Pray. Resist. Call on trusted friends to pray with you. [info] Christian. Evangelical. Reformed. [info] 1475523655
anjagladidontxist [info] Decline in language For the past year and a half or so (maybe longer, this is how long I’ve observed) my grasp over language has been in a steady decline. Normally, this wouldn’t be too much of a problem but I plan on becoming a professor of English and this could be disastrous if it’s allowed to continue. My grammar is the one that’s declined the most. Earlier, I used to be very sure of what was right and what isn’t and now I just draw a blank. It makes me unexplainably frustrated and angry because writing and language is what defines me as a person. It’s not just language; I haven’t been able to study and the number of times I’ve broke down crying because I couldn’t understand what was going on with me is innumerable. I used to be a straight A student and now? I literally took a W on winter term and then didn’t go back for fall. Essentially, I haven’t been in college for a year. I don’t think it’s too surprising that this timeline coincides with my diagnosis, decline of mental health and then slow healing. In 2016 I was diagnosed with bipolar II and I’ve had several breakdowns since then. I’ve been hospitalized numerous times and it’s only since this summer has it gotten even the slightest bit better. Does anyone have any tips? I can’t live like this. It makes me feel so inadequate (I had to literally look up “inadequate” because I forgot what the word for not feeling up to par was.

russlo [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder II. I'm medicated all the time. It's not been an easy life to get me to this point, but I try to be grateful for what I have. I've met a lot of people, and probably not "the most ungrateful person I know", but definitely deserving of mention, is a little son of a bitch 13 year old brother of an ex-girlfriend, named Mikey. Mikey got every single thing he ever wanted via tantrums, threats, and destruction of property and relationships. I'm not kidding. For instance, I would casually chat with him about video games, and he had every console I had ever wanted and some I didn't. His nephew, my ex's boy Vinnie, was just starting to play video games. I gave Vinnie my Gameboy (can't remember what version, I never played it that much, but I had a couple of the Pokemon games for it, and some other pretty sweet stuff that Vinnie enjoyed playing) and he started playing video games too. Happy, great kid. However, Vinnie also idolized his uncle, and would take many, many of his bad attitudes and behaviors and copy them and they would come out at the absolute worst times. He once threatened to stab us both (his mom and I) one morning. That wakes you up fast.At around this point, I had been dating her for a period of about 6+ months, and she was just starting to work me into her family life as she didn't know how I would react or fit. I had met her diabetic, do-nothing, abusive father, whom she had taken into her home for about a month in the beginning of the relationship in an attempt to help him out. I met her neurotic, sweet, yet ultimately incredibly distrusting mother, as well as both of her mother's boyfriends that she had during the time period when I was dating this ex. I met Mikey one night when it was us, Vinnie, Mikey's spoiled-ass friend who we'll call Josh, and mother's boyfriend #2 (who got her name tattooed on his arm - classy!). This sets the stage.I'm standing in the kitchen, literally asking the mom if I could help with anything, and Mikey starts whining about something, and I just had enough just from seeing and hearing him that evening. I turned and looked at him and told him off, something to the effect of "Seriously kid, when I was younger, I would've gotten a beating for saying half the stuff you do." So Mikey looks at me and says "What are you sayin', you want to beat me up?" And playing and stuff like he's punching me... then he starts actually punching me... so I start deflecting that. Then his friend Josh comes up behind me and tries to trip me. I kept my feet, and pushed this kid to the floor hard enough that he didn't mess with me for a while - he was basically laying there stunned on the linoleum. Mikey sees this and tries to run past the dining room table, but I grab him in a bear hug, lift him up to shoulder height, and start swinging him around like a god damned rag doll back into the kitchen. Then I put him on my shoulder, and just jumped up and down a few times with his chest hitting off mine and his stomach getting banged by my shoulder, again, just treating him like a rag doll. Then I took him off my shoulder, held him by his scrawny legs, and pretended several times like I was going to drop him right on his face onto the kitchen floor.Mind you, his entire family watched this and laughed their asses off, from start to finish. Which all tells you something about Mikey, his family, and the incredible bullet dodging that occurred that night on both her part and mine.So then, I did drop him, but only from about calf height, and he crumpled into the fake tiles. I turned around and went back to his friend Josh, and literally just FAT BOY'ed his ass - I laid right on top of him. I was tired and I don't normally lift a 13 year old football player up and down a few times then smash him (softly) into a floor. It was the most dominating thing I could think to do to him without physically exerting myself too much in case there was a round 2 with Mikey. So I laid there on Josh and asked him if he wanted anymore. I said if he wanted anymore, I was right there. He could just take a swing (all his limbs were pinned by my massive bulk). I saw shortly after getting up that Mikey had crawled behind the couch and was weeping like a little girl. We all laughed at him and his friend the rest of the evening, and dinner continued as if nothing had happened besides the occasional glances from Mikey and his friend at me. Very well mannered that night.Thus, I bullied the bullies. His mom used to threaten them when they were misbehaving that she was going to have me come over and kick their asses again. I heard that worked for a while, even after the ex and I broke up. **TL/DR:** I lived the dream, and got to "beat up" the most spoiled little shithead I knew at the time, *with* his family's approval.

theendofthisroad123 [info] Hello fellow bipolar personI hope you are doing well, I know full well how difficult it is to live with bipolar. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 late 2015 and I've been trying to recover ever since.Personally I wouldn't write off going to the government psychologist. A couple of months ago I was going to clinical psychology regularly at RIPAS after my manic episode till she basically said that I was okay. It helped me a bit with coming down from mania. I saw her roughly once a month for about ten months. It didn't feel like it was enough initially, but after a while as I got progressively better i didn't feel like I needed to see her that much.  Personally I take medication to control my bipolar and for me it has helped immensely in controlling my moods, I wouldn't be able to live my life fully without it. I see a psychiatrist at RIPAS on regular basis for my bipolar which helps me a lot.  [info] None [info] 1485952829
Meowjin [info] I want to leave Canada in a year to move to Australia. I need to save at least 1k a month but I can't stop spending money and I need tips on how to not spend! I'm terrible at these type of posts but essentially my current income take home is $2800 a month which will get increased in 3 months to ~ $3200 after I complete 8 weeks of skills training (where I will collect EI).I really hate it where I live.  I'll be turning 28 this month and I can't stand another day being idle and not seeing whats out there.   Originally my intention was to finish my ticket here (will be a 3rd year after this term), then travel, but I'm worried that by the time I get my ticket I'll be 30 and I'll lose my opportunity and my youth to see the world.I wont have any debt.  (I just filed 3 years of taxes, and the return I'm getting will wipe my Canada Student Loan debt clean).  I don't have any expenses (I own my home), my cellphone bill is 40 a month and my vehicle is no more than 200 a month and I can get by on eatting chicken breast, rice and protein vitamin mix and easily eat for 40 dollars a week.    My problem is I go out alot because I hate staying at home and I'll eat alot, then stop at starbucks and get a giant ice coffee, see some clothing/shoes that I think look awesome and buy them on a whim, or i'll snack, or i'll splurge at the bar, or go on some dates with some girls, which causes me to be dead broke.To hear my coworkers today say how glad they would be to be in my situation (most pay mortgages and obviously make more) and yet they manage to still save money and have a nice lifestyle just goes to show you how bad I am with money.  My impulse control sucks (I am diagnosed with bipolar/ADHD) and I know there is something I can do to tell myself to save money.There should be no reason that I shouldn't be able to save at least 1k a month if not MORE.  I just don't know how to train myself to not spend money on such useless shit that adds nothign to my life (except maybe to my waist line).   I know that I need at least 12 grand for Australia, should give me enough to be unemployed and get settled there and have a sizeable emergency fund if I have to leave Canada.  Even if my plan fizzles out by the end of the year I can have a large savings fund to get somewhere. Please help reddit! [info] None [info] 1420710913

Affectionate_Leading [info] Yes, absolutely. Not that all happenings of mental illnesses are caused by demons, but I'm sure some are. Also, I'm not religious myself, but angels, demons, psychics, Intuition, Twin Flames, the Divine, are all Spiritual things, which is way different because they all contribute to the Truth which is unwritten, but witnessed. With religion, it seems the paradigm is often that it's written, but rarely witnessed, if ever. Anyway, the demon, or demons, that I'm dealing with, keep causing me to feel sad. I was diagnosed with bipolar, I think 5 years ago, maybe 6, and at this point it's not even a problem anymore. I know the demonic influence is what's causing my sadness at this juncture of my life. The only thing I don't know exactly is why it was put on me in the first place. [info] Claircognizance [info] 1522686970
jamie_jamie_jamie [info] TL;DR- A horrible hallucination and a dead guy under a train.Most terrifying would be one of my hallucinations. I was diagnosed with bipolar type II and a symptom is hallucinations. I was living out of home with my boyfriend, we were laying in bed and I was trying to sleep but the streetlights were bright and we had shitty blinds. Our bed is parallel to the wardrobe which had mirrors for the doors and at the end of our bed was the TV. I was facing the wardrobe with my head on his chest, and I kid you not, there was a pale woman behind me just sitting there staring at the TV in the reflection. She was in a white torn up nightgown kind of thing with long stringy, oily black hair, and her skin looked like she was covered in bruises. I turned around to look behind me and I couldn't see her but when I turned to look at the mirror again I saw her again. It scared the fuck out of me. My boyfriend who has hallucinations as well helped me get through the fear. Now I know that it's all in my head and can't hurt me, but having my first one was horrible.The other thing was that I mum and I saw cop cars hanging around the train station near our place, so being the sticky beaks that we were, we drove down to have a look, as we were driving past I looked under the train because curiosity, and for about 10 metres there were human remains. Turns out the guy was walking on the tracks with headphones in and didn't hear the freight train that killed him. [info] None [info] 1482921327
RogueVenus [info] I'm really tired, but, I'm going to try to tell this story in a way that makes sense :)I used to hate being single. HATE IT. From the time I had my first boyfriend, I wanted male companionship. So... I partied. I drank too much, and ended up in relationships with men who drank too much, and all we did was drink and fight. Fast forward - I'm 26, slowly killing myself. Eventually it got to be too much. I ended up in rehab, where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.**Now, I am in no way implying that your emotional situation is so severe, but this is the part of the story that I want you to pay attention to:**I realized, while in therapy, that no one could make me feel better but myself. AND - This is important, too - I couldn't give myself everything I needed if I was looking after someone else. So I took some time off.For 3 years, it was just me. At first, the lonliness hurt so bad I thought I was going to die. It hurt to sleep alone, it hurt to wake up alone. So... I started to distract myself. I went to the movies, but since I was going by myself, I had to choose for myself. I watched TV and chose my own shows. I read books, and no one was looking over my shoulder, judging my choices. Slowly, I started devloping tastes and interests that I never knew I had.Then, one day, I realized... I wasn't loney any more. My own company was enough. And that was when I decided that it would be OK to try and share myself again. 2 weeks ago, I went on my first date in 3 years. And it was fun!! I didn't stress out over whether or not he'd call, because I already knew that I was OK on my own if he didn't. I WANTED to see him, but I didn't NEED him. What a cool concept.Now, I'm not saying that you need to be chaste for 3 years. But, in my experience, learning to be comfortable in your own skin is SO FREEING. Understanding yourself makes you easier for other people to understand you. Developing your own taste makes you more intersting. Sorry for the wall of text... Again, I'm really tired and super reflective right now... But... That's my two cents :) You need to settle into a good relationship with yourself before you let anyone else in.

maxie760 [info] Can Molly or ecstasy trigger bipolar disorder? TL;DR: Took molly and triggered 2 mania episodes. Do I really have bipolar disorder?So I tried molly for the first time about a year ago and it was amazing I’ll admit. However, it caused me to go into a manic episode which ended up putting me in the psych hospital for 3 days. Afterwards, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given mood stabilizers to help with the symptoms and prevent another manic episode. However, my smart ass didn’t believe the doctor and thought it was a one time thing. Fast forward a month later and I had another manic episode which put me in the psych hospital again but only for a day. Does anyone else know of people who had a similar experience? Someone who never exhibited any symptoms of bipolar disorder until they tried a drug like ecstasy or molly?I’m very curious because I have been on a small dose of lamictal (mood stabilizer 100mg) for over a year now and have not had a depressive or manic episode since I began taking it. My new psychiatrist thinks it’s odd because people usually need way higher doses of mood stabilizers to feel normal and prevent manic and depressive episodes. [info] None [info] 1537859251
struggles3cuddles [info] Bipolar 1 Here’s the deal. Bipolar 1 rapid cycling has destroyed my life. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 rapid cycling, but when I switch to Stanford they diagnosed me with 2 rapid cycling. They did it because I had never been hospitalized. The only reason I have not been hospitalized is because my dad refused to. He had people beg him to hospitalize me, but instead he took me under his wing and hospitalized me under his care in a way. He thought it not conducive to my healing and in the end he took care of me.(he’s trained and it ruined my family) THE PART THAT IRKES ME Is that because of this they won’t diagnose me as 1. I struggled and my whole life was destroyed and this was more than hypo. I feel super invalidated and pissed off. Once again, people don’t believe you unless you’ve been checked in.  Sorry I’m just really irked. [info] BP1 Rapid Cycling [info] 1578351898
sayhitothehobo [info] I am 25 years old.  For 4 years I was diagnosed with bipolar.  I suggested other things like ADHD, but to no avail.  The problem is both bipolar and ADHD have a lot of overlapping symptoms.  The bigger problem is if you are bipolar and you take stims, you can cause or worsen mania episodes and make medications less effective in the future.  Unless the doctor is treating you poorly or inadequately, I would say wait it out for a bit.  Good psychs are really really hard to find.  But mediocre psychs will stop listening to you if you "become a troublemaker".  The docs I met were all qualified, but honestly most docs just don't give a shit if they think they are right.  I admit they knew more than me, and so I tried their way first.  Eventually I noticed that the drugs they gave me either did absolutely nothing or made me feel worse.  After that initial try it becomes YOUR choice.  Try more mood stabilizers/anti-depressants or try something completely different.  Sadly, trying something different almost always requires a new doctor.  Remember, after everything is said and done the doctor is working for you, not you for him/her.  If you don't like what they are saying, get a new doctor.  After 5 doctors I finally found a doctor who did not just agree with me, he actively tested me and talked with relatives and friends before he actually diagnosed me with ADHD (2 months later).  No other doctor ever tried to talk with my family or tried testing me.  It's sad, but my record said I was resistant to doctors and that I was manipulative.  Once people see that it becomes hard for anyone to listen.So I guess in summary try to be a little open with other diagnoses.  If you think you doctor is qualified, listen to and follow his advice.  If you think something is wrong, tell him.  If he disagrees it becomes your choice to stay on his path or change docs.  It is best not to fight with him.  Lastly, try to find a doc that has the time to see you and who actively tries to empathize and understand your situation.  These docs are very rare and if you find one, I would seriously consider staying with them instead of leaving.PS:  Mental health diagnoses are very commonly misdiagnosed.  If doctors make that mistake then I would imagine it would be easy for us to make it too.  It could be that you are neither bipolar nor ADHD.  You could be both.  You could have no illness at all or you might have a more serious one that you haven't even suspected yet.  It is very tough and sometimes speculative.  Some, like ADHD, are commonly comorbid with other mental illnesses.  And basically all of them have a lot of related symptoms.  It's tough and research is very important.  If you wanted to pick up some beginner books about ADHD you should try "Driven to Distraction" by Hallowell or "Taking charge of adult ADHD" by Barkley.  They both say pretty much the same thing though I liked the one by Barkley more.  Some people don't like Barkley because of where he gets his research money from.  He seemed legit to me and probably has researched Adult ADHD more than another other person alive.   [info] None [info] 1405305307

EasyPineapples [info] Just confused and scared I don’t know if this is the right sub, I lurk a lot here and it’s great to have a community that shares the same problems as me. I’m going through a manic period right now, and I think I just experienced my very first visual hallucination? I was diagnosed with bipolar about a year ago and am currently taking medication. Tonight after gym, it was raining super hard and I was looking out my window pretty intensely, not sure why, no reason I guess. But I swear I saw a man, walking down the street, and he was huge and was carrying some sort of weapon, like a sharp bat? My neighborhood is private and I rarely see people outside ever. It looked like he was coming right toward my house so I freaked the fuck out. I looked away, looked back, he’s gone. I look back, he’s there again. Look away, look back, he’s gone, and he’s been gone since. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared. That was my very first time seeing anything, I do experience slight auditory hallucinations but I’ve NEVER seen anything. I know logically it wasn’t real, but what the fuck? I’m super terrified and I don’t wanna leave my house. I guess I’m in need of support. :( [info] None [info] 1550132296

BornOn8thOfJuly [info] We're not nice. We're mean. &gt;:)I have very limited experience, so I am hoping someone else who knows more will post. I can only tell you my experience. I immigrated to the United States to do a Ph.D. I was diagnosed with bipolar II back home. I have the insurance plan that employees of the university has (as a ph.d student you are paid a living wage and teach, and it came with insurance). They did not ask for any pre-existing conditions when I enrolled. And so, I had a pre-existing condition and was not denied insurance. I can't say if that is the norm with employee health insurance plans. This was just my experience. Granted, this was also with Kaiser Permanente who are, from what I understand, probably one of the most compassionate insurance providers. [info] None [info] 1496065063
TheTimeTombs [info] 4gs with Bipolar Disorder Hello r/shrooms, just wanted to share a story of mine that I feel might save those with similar conditions some sanity.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 18, but my episodes are few and far between now. This will be important later.Dose: 4gs Me and three others decided to trip at their house.I was overwhelmed with joy to say the least. I remember laying back on the couch as we had a montage of blissful landscapes displaying on the tv screen, and calming music to accompany it. I closed my eyes with my head back and the visuals began flooding in. I was looking up into a vaulted ceiling with a carved mosaic spiral leading to the top. Within each of these ‘pieces of the mosaic’ I saw a different me. Every variable of my life shown to me, whether it be friends, religion, career, etc. In all of them I was happy, and I swear to you when I say this, but I felt such an immense love within me that I hadn’t any doubt that I’d be happy for the rest of my existence. No matter what I’d be doing, I’d be content from here on out. Then like the switch of a light I was shown a very dark side of my mind. I was shown all the horrible, morbid, monstrous acts I could chose to do. All the pieces of the mosaic disappeared and the horrid images of myself executing these acts were flashing before me at a rapid pace. All the while I was smiling, and I couldn’t understand why. I knew that these things were unspeakable, but for some reason I was smiling. Why was I smiling? Why shouldn’t I smile? Well Aren’t these things the very acts humanity has so despised that he created the death penalty for? Where has my moral compass gone? What is morality? Where does my personal morality lay? I couldn’t come up with an answer, and I felt sickly. I got up from the chair to keep my mind off these disgusting images, but they followed me. I was opening cabinets and staring at the floor hoping to god it would pass and I could regain control of my sanity again, but I felt like I had forever destroyed any sense of right and wrong from my being. I eventually lay down and urged myself to sleep so that I could wake from this maniacal nightmare. I woke up the next day with control again, but I was utterly shaken and ashamed I had ever thought of such unspeakable things. To this day I believe what I encountered was what Carl Jung refers to as the ‘shadow’. A slumbering beast that sits within all of us in the darkest recesses of our repressed minds. I have not tripped since. Thanks for reading. [info] None [info] 1567363630
antisocialmedic [info] I had mental problems from pretty early. Started self harming in, like, first grade. Lots of anger issues, too. At 14 I got diagnosed with PTSD but I got that treated, so I thought it was all over, even though the self loathing and anger and self harm continued. Didn't realize until I got fired from a job at the age of 23 (for mental instability following the birth of my child) and had a mental breakdown and hospitalized (for the fifth time in my life) that I actually had something more going on than that. For me, PTSD was an easier diagnosis to stomach because it was the fault of some external source. And while it was awful, it was *their* fault and not something inherently flawed with me. Later I was diagnosed with bipolar and OCD and PTSD became BPD (and then went back to C-PTSD after a year of treatment) and suddenly it seemed that I was just a really flawed, fucked up person. Suddenly I had people telling me I should have aborted my babies because I was so fucked up and defective. Not sure where I'm going with this. I've been drinking so perhaps nowhere good. In any case, each diagnosis came from real doctors. So I'm not just picking them out of a hat. If I was picking my own mental status, I would go with perfectly healthy and sound of mind- which I really am these days, usually. But that's with a lot of work and medication. It's like if I went around telling everyone I have some kind of horrible chronic illness for funsies and cool points. Like "Hey, I have  chrons disease, isn't that *cool*!?"

Satellites- [info] With my experience, there was a whole host of other issues going on with the friendship, including her being fairly abusive towards me, making racist remarks about one of our mutual friend's partners, calling me fat and simultaneously telling other people about my issues (I have been diagnosed with bipolar and an eating disorder) etc etc. The friendship wasn't salvageable, I knew it, I had tried to talk to her numerous times about our dynamic and how her behaviour was affecting me, whilst giving her the chance to talk about any issues she had. Her exact response was "I've never had a friend be so honest with me... and I don't like it", she would shut down or tell me it would change and then it wouldn't change.At the end of the day, it's up to you to decide if you want or don't want the friendship anymore. I was downvoted for relating my experience, likely because I chose to give up the friendship when so many here seem to think that because a friendship is long, you should work for it. I believe that it's not about the length of the friendship but the quality. If you are not getting any happiness from continuing this friendship, then why would you? You don't owe this girl anything, despite what people might say, and if she is so blind that she can't see that her actions might be hurtful or dismissive, then why would you want to continue the friendship anyway? There's nothing wrong with ending a friendship you don't think is working for you, no matter how long it lasted. As I get older, I realise more and more that I am not interested in working extremely hard to keep a friendship going against all odds, and that if I have to have the same conversations with my friends about boundaries and the way they talk about and to me, then it's not worth having them around. I wish that my friendship with my friend hadn't ended the way it did because I loved her. But she changed, a lot, and we just weren't compatible anymore. For months, I suffered, worrying about what I should do and how I should approach it whilst she continued to say awful things about me behind my back. I miss the way she was, but she hasn't got any better and I made the right decision for my own peace of mind. [info] None [info] 1388456006
RollerDoll [info] I too am bipolar II and am on lamictal as a monotherapy.  I'm thinking about adding an antidepressant to the mix because the lamictal makes the episodes less frequent, but about every other month I dive for three or four days and am absolutely convinced that the only way to cure the pain is to kill myself.  That's followed by three or four days where I practice piano and guitar for hours and hours a day.  Urgh.But I digress.  I'm glad you've decided to go back on the prozac.  Before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was taking celexa and was having sexual side effects, so I quit taking it one day.  A couple of weeks later, I was in a psych ward.  Taking your meds is serious shit - if you're having unwanted side effects from the prozac, definitely definitely try something else - but you gotta wean yourself off slowly while the other drug takes effect.Good luck.

shamy52 [info] I've done reasonably well on Lexapro for years so I think I'm OK there.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 less than two weeks ago (although I'd had my suspicions for several months) and so far I'm loving Seroquel.  :D  I feel like I spent 20 years begging doctors to give me a pill to make me sleep (I took Ambien as a young woman and hallucinated but it worked, I fell asleep and woke up rested!)  Finally, Negrete the PA gave me Seroquel and I've slept like a baby since.  I'm hoping I can stay on these two long term.  :)I don't remember why I was so sad the day of the Magic MRI but it was probably situational, having to do with the clusterfuck that is living with MS.  I know it was after my divorce so probably I was sad about *that* heartbreak or maybe I was sad because of the rebound relationship I had after that or maybe it was a family situation... it's great that I can't remember what it was because that means the situation resolved.  :P [info] None [info] 1572552354
mercyphoenix [info] When I was around 8 or so, I always felt these random urges to cry. Nothing had to happen for the urge to come up. I remember bawling my eyes out one time at dinner for no reason, and my parents seemed super frustrated that I wasn’t able to tell them why. I believed they were my ‘baby instincts;’ my line of logic behind this was that sometimes babies just cry randomly, even when they’re not hungry or tired or in need of a diaper change, and since I was still young, maybe I didn’t grow out of them yet. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 14. [info] None [info] 1559017225
wehadarocket [info] I’m not in the psychiatric field, but I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t throw out a diagnosis if they weren’t positive they had that condition.

Smokesalottapottamus [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder many years ago, long before I awoke to what my nmom &amp; nbro are.  Several times over the years, my medication was working so well that I managed to convince myself that I was now (then) cured and I didn't need my meds any more.  I'd go off them for while until it became clear once again that I'm still mentally ill and require medication.  Maybe No Contact is like that.  The longer my family ignores the narcs, the stronger and better I feel, making me feel like I might even be able to handle a conversation with them.  But my experience with the bipolar meds lets me know that the only reason I feel so much better is that No Contact is working and I shouldn't ruin a good thing just because nmom conditioned me from birth to always love her and feel guilty for not loving her even more.  If No Contact is working for you, keep it up :) [info] None [info] 1510994090

reevision [info] New to Adderall...not feeling anything I was recently diagnosed with ADHD after finally seeing a therapist and getting a comprehensive psych eval. Backing up: I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD in 2007. Been taking Lamictal and Wellbutrin all these years and I’ve mostly been okay—no suicidal ideation and virtually no mania. But something was still so off. I haven’t drank in 1.5 years either. I was both surprised and not when I got the ADHD dx. Greeeaaaat. One more thing to add to the list. I was actually kind of incredulous, too. Nonetheless, I made an appointment with my pdoc thinking he’d tell me the dx was incorrect but lo and behold, he said “yup, let’s start treatment with meds.” I felt relieved. Why did I feel so defensive about it? It’s probably the drug aspect. He prescribed Adderall 10mg twice a day on week days and once on Saturday. It was spring break for me so I’ve only been taking it in the AM, but today was my first day back to work and I took one pill at 7am and one at 12pm. I feel nothing. And I’ve felt nothing since I’ve been taking just one pill a day since last Wednesday. When will this kick in? I’m used to the slow-to-start meds, but this isn’t one so I’m just confused. I’m sure this is as easy as “it takes time” and “talk to your doctor” but I just need people with experience to reassure me. Thank you. :) [info] None [info] 1553546870

CuttlestheCuttlefish [info] Anyone else had friends be non-supportive of BPD diagnosis? So I likely have BPD, according to my psychiatrist. He wants to look into me starting DBT. So I mentioned my likely diagnosis to a friend I know who has BPD herself, and she was perfectly supportive, and encouraging. She was glad I’m trying to get help. The others I told, who don’t have BPD? Not so much. Comments ranged from outright, “You can’t POSSIBLY have that” to “I know plenty of normal people like that, you’re fine” to criticizing DBT individual and group therapy, as being “absolutely ridiculous”.  Many called it an “unnecessary label”. One person even thought I meant bipolar disorder, and said I didn’t seem bipolar, which is absolutely hilarious, because I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 12 years old, and continue to take medication for it. I thought it was very strange that they weren’t aware of this! All in all, it felt like most people were the exact opposite of supportive. In fact, many were downright discouraging! Here, I’m trying to get better, and being told not to take steps to get better at all. I know I’m definitely not okay, and I didn’t think I hid my emotions so well...or maybe these friends are just seeing what they want to see?Has anyone else had friends react this way when coming out as BPD or even (such as in my case) likely BPD?

MAMA_OLIF [info] Not a man but when I was 14 years old in high school, 2012. I was different and I got a lot of shit for it but that’s not the focus of this story. To set the scene I was in woodshop class and I was the safety monitor. I was standing up supervising what people were doing as the teacher was talking (some people did dumb dangerous shit because, you know, 14 year olds). This one kid had put multiple things in the vice grip on his desk. So I glared at him. He apparently thought my annoyance was funny so he just kept doing it and he started stabbing scissors into the wood with a shit eating grin on his face. I said something along the lines of you better cut it out. He just kept smiling at me and kept acting like an idiot. I was livid and I walked over to him and I backhanded that disrespectful shit on the back of his head. It was dead silent in the classroom and once I realized what I had done I was horrified, until I looked up at the teacher and I saw that he was smiling. The kid I hit looked shocked and yelled, “DID YOU JUST SEE THAT????” My teacher just smiled wider and said “yeah” and he continued to teach the class. The kid was dead silent and behaved himself for the rest of the period. 4-5 years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder lol [info] None [info] 1562975830

AriaoftheStars17 [info] A long story about me not being good enough. Sorry for the length, I just need to be heard. We had a really good relationship for 4 years. I, a girl emotionally abused by a mother who had taught me that I was unpretty, unlikable and weird, sat down in a 9th grade geography class. Behind me were two boys. I was always very talkative - and annoying - and i was used to being brushed off or dismissed. But one of those two boys paid attention to me. When I talked, he would look straight at me, and listen. His name was Ryan.I liked Ryan a lot, but I knew he was out of my league. I'm annoying, I'm not remotely as pretty as other girls, my personality is abhorrent, and there was definitely something... wrong about me. But I wanted to be around him. So I'd bother him all the time. He sat behind me in grade 9 English class and I would always be turned around in my seat asking the most obnoxious questions. After all, the more ridiculous the questions, the more likely I was to get his attention, whether positive or negative. My "friend" at the time used to tell me off constantly. "Stop harrassing him, he doesn't want to talk to you. You're making yourself look like an idiot." (She ghosted me a few months later for cooler friends; I found out years later that she had a crush on Ryan and had actually hit on him while we were dating.) But sometimes my weird questions made him laugh. Mr. Quiet Guy would smile and it made me feel so amazing.The next year, we had English together again. I sat in front of him. I was still obnoxious and unattractive and horrible, but he had become kind of used to me by then. We were even friends.I went to even greater measures to get his attention. I acknowledge it was creepy as hell, but 15-year-old me thought it was a great idea to stalk him. I found out his birthday, and when i told him, he questioned me to figure out how I knew. "I have my ways..." (Facebook, duh.) I liked the attention. So I escalated. I found out his phone number, and he was even more freaked out (but not repulsed, for some reason), and grilled me a bit. I took it as a challenge, and found out where he lived. It became some kind of joke. A really weird joke that would probably put me in jail today, but, uh, yeah. Somehow, I think he was flattered by my interest or something. No girl had ever gone to the lengths that I had. No one had ever shown the interest that I did.He told me the first time he ever pictured me in a romantic way was in that grade 10 English class. We had to watch a really horrible modern version of Romeo&amp;Juliet (the Di Caprio version, ugh), and at one point I got bored with the movie and decided to take a nap. I turned around in my seat, grabbed his arm, and used it as my pillow. And as I napped, I guess he began to think about me.October of grade 11, I invited him to a Halloween party at my house. There was definitely something going on. We talked about movies, and I suggested that he come over to watch my favourite movie, and he said okay. That day, when he came over to watch Se7en with me, he held my hand. I was over the moon. A few weeks later, we went to his house to watch his favourite movie, and that's where I had my first kiss.It's been a rocky journey. I, insecure and broken, dumped him more than once because I was terrified of commitment and convinced that he was lying about wanting to be with me. It never lasted longer than a year, and then we'd be together again. For the first time, someone wanted to be around me. Someone cared about what I had to say, someone cared enough to get to know all of me, someone cared enough to stop me from suiciding because he didn't want to see me go. For the first time, someone wanted me.He gave me the confidence to believe in myself. I started to feel pretty. He inspired me to work hard in school as my rival, he motivated me to be something more than what my mother moulded me to be. For the first time in my life, I felt like maybe I was actually worth something.On October 10th, 2019, I started to experience bad side effects from a med my doc had put me on. You know how psych medications usually have a side effect of suicide? Yeah. It was a really scary day. I called Ryan, as I did whenever I had any kind of crisis (which was fairly often). Usually he was really calm and supportive; that day, he seemed distant, annoyed even. I asked him what was going on. "Do you realize you have a new crisis every week?" Um, I guess. "It's pretty stressful." I'm aware, I'm the one having them. He told me he was tired, he's been tired for months. I asked him if he wanted to break up with me. He hesitated for a long time. Too long. I said, "I don't want to be with someone who doesn't want me." "Yeah, I think we should go on a break." "Oh. Okay." And I, in the midst of a suicidal crisis, hung up the call.I went into shock and became numb. That's probably lucky, because considering the purpose of the call in the first place, things could have gotten really bad. Instead I tried to study for an exam scheduled for the next morning, 8am. I didn't focus very much.On Friday, I wanted to talk to him about what happened. He complained that he had an exam that night and didn't want to deal with stress before then. I understood and told him we would talk Saturday.Saturday came, I tried to call him. He told me he couldn't: He was "sick" and lost his voice. Oh. Fine, we'll talk by text. I asked him about the terms and conditions of our "break". How long? Would we still talk to each other, or stay away?"Yeah... I said break, but I really meant break up."After 4 years, he broke up with me by text.It came so out of the blue. All the time I would ask him if there was something in the relationship that we could change, if there was anything that bothered him, and he always said he was happy. We had plans to celebrate Thanksgiving that weekend. A few days before, he told me he loved me, and I thought I could believe it.I got really upset. I was still feeling the affects of that evil medication (fuck Abilify), and I began to feel suicidal again. I asked him why, he kept insisting he "wants to be alone" and "needs space". I asked him if there was another girl, he said no. The only thing he would tell me was that I was too "needy", too dependent. My bad for thinking he was someone I could depend on.I asked him if he'd be saying this if I wasn't broken. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder last year, and I've always dealt with highs and lows (especially lows). It's not easy for anyone, especially for me. So I asked, and he refused to answer. He kept saying it was an unfair question. He wouldn't say "no".By Wednesday of the next week, I decided I could not keep myself safe. I went to the hospital and was admitted to the psyc ward... sort of. They didn't have enough beds. I was 8th on the waiting list. I sat and waited for 20 hours with nothing to do. No phones, no books, nothing but the company of the others waiting. We slept in waiting room chairs. It was really bad. They taught me what to say to get out of there, so when I was reassessed in the morning, I told them I was fine. I feel better now. So they let me go.I wasn't fine. I was still depressed and suicidal, and I couldn't help but text him in anger and hurt and ask for his help, because I really wanted to die.On Monday, after a night talking me out of killing myself, he blocked me. On everything. When I found out that night, I was angry. I called him over and over from another phone. He didn't answer. The next day, I waited outside of his class to try and confront him, but he wasn't there.My dad and I went to his house. My dad went in to talk, and said he would text me when they gave me permission to come in. Sitting in the car was making me anxious, so I went outside so I could see the doorway. I stood in the pouring rain for at least 30 minutes. I was never allowed in. Apparently my dad never saw Ryan, but talked to his parents, who said that he has been stressed lately and that I needed to stop manipulating (?) him with threats of suicide. "He needs space," they said.Wednesday of that week was my first suicide attempt. Well, sort of. I gathered my supplies, got ready to go, but chickened out.October 29th, I was walking in my uni near the gyms, and I heard cling-clang sounds. It sounded like swords... and Ryan is on the fencing team. Sure enough, I peeked in, and there they were. I scanned the room, didn't see him, and was going to leave... but one of the people fencing caught my eye. No way, I thought, but he took off his mask and... it was him. I hadn't seen his face in about a month, and he was so fucking beautiful. He looked up at me, looked away, and did a double-take. So I waved. He kind of grimaced but didn't come over, so I sat down on a bench outside the gym and decided to wait. I would wait until his practice was finished, and I would finally confront him.He kept giving me the side-eye, pretending that he wasn't looking at me. Eventually, he walked to the back of the gym, towards his coach. Uh-oh. He started talking to his coach, who looked right at me. Uh-oh. His coach started walking in my direction. UH-OH."Are you here to see Ryan?""Yes.""Ah. The thing is, you being here is making Ryan nervous, and it's affecting his practice. As a coach, I have to step in and ask you to leave."I asked him if he knew the situation. He did. It turns out that the coach is very nice. He wasn't a fan of the ghosting situation either, and tried to comfort me. He seemed to understand. He promised he would talk to Ryan about it after practice. I left feeling hopeful.After practice, I heard back from Ryan. Sort of. He texted my dad, and told him that he was opening a case file with campus security.I was devastated. I couldn't believe that after 4 years, he would go to such extreme lengths just to avoid talking to me. He threw me out like trash. Suddenly, I was in 9th grade again. I was ugly, dumb, annoying, unlikable, and undeserving of affection. The boy who had built me up was now breaking me down. He didn't even care.Two days later, October 31st, 2019, was my second suicide attempt, sort of. I packed my supplies and was really serious about it. I had a plan to make sure I wouldn't be found alive. I went to school that morning as a decoy; if my last known location was at school, they would probably spend a good amount of time searching the grounds there before they expanded their search elsewhere, and hopefully by then, I would be gone. With no self-worth, no support, my grades slipping through my fingers, I felt no reason to stick around. I was ready.But my teacher wanted to talk to me after class. She asked me if I was okay. I cracked.She wouldn't let me leave. She made me call my Oma, walked me down to the parking lot, and made sure I got into the car. I spent the rest of the day under full supervision, without telling anyone my true plans for the day. So I survived.It is November 10th. I am trying to get back up, but I am struggling. I am trying so hard: I have three therapists, I've gone to all my teachers to get help with my grades, I've shown up to every work shift even though I feel like shit, I have attended most of my classes and written most of my exams. I even started personal training, even though I hate exercise, to try and get healthier. I am trying so, so hard. But it doesn't change anything. I am that same girl from 9th grade. I am worthless and undeserving of love. I am bipolar and broken, and "too stressful", and I would be better off dead. But here I am. I'm alive, and I'm trying.It has been exactly one month. I spent most of my free time crying. My plan for suicide has become very detailed and elaborate, and if I'm able to go through with it, I will not be found. But so far, I am alive.I'm sorry this was so long. I needed to be heard. I need someone to know I exist, and that I'm hurting, and that I'm trying so hard. Thank you. [info] None [info] 1573368446
cakecrisis [info] It could be that you are going through an episode currently or that you’re entering one. I’ve been there and it’s extremely scary. I was hostile and even attacked my own mother after she locked herself in her bathroom and I broke down the door. I was hallucinating and having delusions and having memory problems, and time lapses. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder and put on medication and my life is much better now. The thing you must remember is that you are still you, and you’re not alone. I’m not a doctor and I can’t give you medical advice but only advice from my personal experience. It’s a really terrifying thing and mental illness is really tricky. The most important thing is that you are safe, and your parents hopefully should see that. If you’re feeling like you can’t trust yourself or don’t feel safe around yourself or are slipping away from reality please please please, get help. I understand that money is a huge deal and a big issue for you and many people but you come first. It got so bad for me that I thought it the episode would last forever and if it did I’d have to kill myself. I’m so glad I reached out and got help. Remember, you come first, money has to come after. You are the priority and getting your mental health back in order is what’s most important.  [info] None [info] 1552246676

The laws are in place, and they work, however bad guys don't get their guns legally. They get them by stealing them, or buying them off the Mexican cartels. By the standards of the proposed mental health ban for gun buying, I technically fall under the category of mental health patient. I was diagnosed with bipolar at a young age. It does nothing to me but make me cry when I get upset. Yet, this would keep me from legally obtaining a firearm. I'm prior law enforcement and a us veteran.

Juneau_Fire [info] Bipolar and BPD dual diagnosis (TW) Hi all awesome people. Just wanted to get some stuff out and see if if anyone else had similar situations. I was diagnosed with bipolar II around six years ago, went through Psychs and GPs etc and ended up taking Lithium for a few years. Within the last year I found that lithium was 'greying' me out. I had no creativity and no interest in the stuff that was supposed to be fun. I am quite musical and also have synaesthesia so I found lithium really affected my music writing ability. Recently however I have had some difficulties and been referred back to a pdoc. He has asked all the same questions and given an added diagnosis of 'emotionally unstable BPD with impulsive type'. I'm not disputing the impulsive type, but I am nowhere near an emotional person. In fact, I have been told I am cold sometimes and don't react correctly in some situations. I am in a relationship with the most awesome and understanding guy ever, and he thinks I am generally emotionally stable. It's really thrown me off to be given a new added diagnosis. I just wanted to know if anyone else has had this issue. Thanks in advance. [info] None [info] 1423003181
Cashley42069 [info] I wouldn't know, I don't have it. Though one of my hospital discharges says I do have bipolar 2, but it's from the hospitalization after I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 so the bipolar 1 is the diagnosis that sticks because I already had a full manic episode in the past. The same discharge paper has my "Global Measure of Disability (WHODAS)" classified as severe.It sure would be nice if I had all the relevant information on 1 discharge summary instead of having 4 and having to pick around for details.

boberito [info] Yes, it's hard to diagnose someone so young when it comes to mood disorders, and some doctors don't do it. However, it's completely plausible for him to be showing signs of it as an adolescent. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at the age of 20, but there was a history of "behavior issues" beginning around the age of 6 for me (though nothing like this post describes). How a mental illness presents can absolutely change over time, especially during puberty!! I think you should follow the advice of other Redditors here and set up a psych evaluation (even if it's inpatient). Tell the doctors everything, especially family history of mood disorders such as bipolar and substance abuse issues. They might not give a formal diagnosis due to age, but it will help them when determining treatment options going forward. Best of luck. You guys are great parents.  [info] None [info] 1547770427
sflfaa [info] I thought I was a pirate. The title says it all. Whenever I was in a manic state (this was before I was diagnosed with bipolar), I was doing all sorts of odd things. I thought the entire city of Erie was throwing me a party. I thought I bought a BMW, and I was walking around the streets, asking people if they’ve seen my keys (for the car that existed but was not mine). You guys already know being in a manic state affects your cognition, or decision making if you will. But I took a shower in a random mans house, in his basement. Met him by walking on a street and asked if I could use his hose to take a shower. He then offered me a hot shower, I accepted it. I took a shower, put on a pretty dress, and left. Looking back at it now, I could have been killed. But glad it was him, and not some creep that would have hurt me. I was up for days, cops were called on me many times. Thinking I was on drugs. But I was completely sober. I started walking in the middle of the night, and if any of you are familiar with the Erie, PA area, you’ll know that there is a pirate ship on the pier. I tried to board the ship, with intentions to steal it. The employees escorted me out of the ship. And then I fell asleep on the pier, with my feet hanging over the ledge. I was woken up by cops. And they detained me until my parents could come and pick me up. I don’t remember some of the events in Erie. But if you’re interested in what I do remember, feel free to message me.

smoothazbutta [info] First and foremost you need to take care of yourself first. How are you coping with your bipolar disorder? Are you on medication? Are you seeing a Dr? Do you have someone you can confide in? Please make sure you are taking care of yourself first because no matter what job you take you will always bring yourself with. If you are not in the right state of mind all jobs will seem horrible.  You are so strong. One of my favorite quotes is "you wake up every morning to fight the same demons that left you so tired the night before, and that, my love, is bravery." The fact that you are still pushing through is so great. Your time spent in publishing was not a waste at all! I am sure you learned some very valuable things while working for a publishing company AND THEN doing freelance work! That's great! Take the things that you learned that you excelled in and bring those to any job you take. (example: I have great customer services skills. Now i worked in an office but I still carry those customer services skills with me to every job). If you really want to go back into publishing have you ever considered reaching out to old contacts and explaining your situation? I know it is extremely hard to talk about mental illness but maybe reaching out and saying "Hey, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 5 months ago. When I was not diagnosed I had a manic episode and did some things that were out of my character but I am now properly diagnosed and doing much better now. Would you consider allowing me to work on a project again?" (only say that if you and your Dr. truly think that you are better.) If your heart isn't set on going back to publishing try something new! Who cares if you don't end up doing the publishing gig anymore. You are the person who has to go in and work that job everyday so YOU might as well enjoy it. There is no expiration date on our goals. Morgan Freeman didn't get his breakout role until he was 52!  Colonel Sanders, was 62 when he started Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC)!

Claireheart [info] Ok, before this gets too crazy, a bipolar diagnosis doesn't mean he is incapable to be a father.Just like with anyone else, a bipolar person can be irresponsible and unreliable, but that DOES NOT MEAN THEY HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. Obviously, some things may be from bipolar, but bipolar doesn't magically erase someone's personality. If a person is a piece of crap human being who is irresponsible then after the bipolar diagnosis, the person will -still- be a piece of crap human being who is irresponsible.I was diagnosed with bipolar at 13 (early onset caused by trauma), and I have been with my husband nearly 15 years (married since 2009), have a successful career (until I had to stay at home for baby, will get back to it in 6 months to a year depending on baby), graduated college with a 3.8 GPA, etc... etc... just like everyone else....because I am not too different than anyone else. I still have my own personality, I just experience highs and lows. That is the only difference. A lot of people use bipolar as a crutch though, and they always justify their behavior with 'I can't help it, it is my bipolar'. So nothing gets better because they have a built-in excuse to never better themselves. Anyone can work to better themselves and suppress impulse, control energy, force themselves out of bed, etc... That being said, to answer your question, it depends on what kind of person he is. If he doesn't even see a problem with his actions, then he won't change. As a result, he is a danger to your kids as he can't just leave them like you said. As a result, you have to try to protect your children - but this doesn't have to be permanent - he just needs to see a problem and learn how to manage it (most people need professional help to do so).

I'm failing my classes, and my whole life is sort of falling apart because I can't focus on anything I do. This triggers mood swings and the cycle begins.Does anyone here ALSO have a BP diagnosis?

Jewcebox [info] Thank you for helping me keep going Long story short I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 shortly after my breakup with my now ex. I had snapped on her due to unregulated bipolar issues a few times, and she finally had enough. She did say she wanted to see where things stood once I was better, so I clung to that hope. Then instead of telling me her feelings changed, she let me cling to that hope until I had to pry an answer out of her. Since the initial breakup, and especially now that I know she led me on for over a month, I've been on here religiously, seeing motivation for people with all sorts of needs, and it's kept me above water.I've been working out and running for the better part of 12 years, since HS really, but the breakup took everything out of me. I didn't want to wake up, go to work, workout, etc. The only thing that kept me going was the motivation and support I've seen in this sub. I wanted to say thank you, this sub is amazing.

jrob1235789 [info] I think only 2 things should change in terms of requirements for future candidates. One is that they should be required to release their tax returns. The second one is that they should have to have a psychiatric or neuropsychological evaluation. And I'm saying that as someone who has a mental illness. Having a mental illness should not disqualify someone from being president, but being mentally unstable should. For example, from 2011-2012 I was mentally unstable before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and treated for it. Now I have been stable for over 4 years. I am a mental health professional, though not one who is legally allowed to diagnose people, but Donald Trump is clearly not mentally stable. That should disqualify you from being president.

hms_surprise [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 9 months ago and figured out that I had been suffering from minor paranoid delusions for the past 24 years. Side note: I am completely 'normal' now. It's kind of laughable how long I spent being just on the edge of psychotic. No one could ever tell.There were days when I would start climbing and completely derealize (if you've ever been high and had the feeling of waking up over and over again, derealization is like that except scarier). There were other times that I would be in the middle of a route—especially multipitch—and have a full panic attack. Sometimes the weight of the world would hit me while crimping or jamming or anything and my arms would completely lose their ability to grip. There were a lot of uncontrollable tremors and stuff.

barberos3 [info] 100% agree. One must be cautious with advices of that kind. In my situation I had undiagnosed ADHD for years and each time I felt socially anxious or simply overwhelmed by being in a group, incapable of completing a task because of attention deficit, it nourished my lack of self esteem and social isolation, ending in cycling depressive episodes. That's why I was diagnosed with bipolar first.My doctor wants me to think of this combination of ADHD and bipolar as "intellectual and emotional hyperactivity" rather than a handicap or an illness. He says once it's under control it may even be a super power. And I thought that was a very cool thing to say, it gave me hope and confidence.

I was diagnosed with bipolar at 22 after a breakdown due to a stressful work situation and i flew into a rage triggering lots of hostile emails and faxes (which were an in thing back then)I was put on all these bipolar meds lithium depakote and anti depressants.  I got fatter and angrier but not really better.  At one point i was almost 300 lbs.   i was up to 6 meds a day.   I finally got off all meds myself and had some rocky times before i leveled out in my personal life. Still any kind of stressful associations were tough — work, church , friendships.   a psychologist i met with for a long time finally diagnosed me with BPD in 2013.  Just so i wouldnt get hurt if i needed government benefits he didnt remove the bipolar DX.  Unfortunately - i got a bit borderline with him (LOL) and didnt continue treatment.  I have been through about 28 therapists over the years.Since 2016 - i have taken one med - Risperidone and i would say it helps to take the edge off but it is not a cureThe one thing i have done well is manage my own litte part time consulting business but when things get to stressful or i do work outside my normal routine — a borderline episode springs into beingAbout 6 weeks ago i started DBT therapy.  Its a slow process but the ball is rolling [info] None [info] 1572742365
meradorm [info] She's not a psychiatrist but a psychiatric nurse. Insurance just will not pay for the prescription unless it comes with a diagnosis code, presumably for ADHD. The nurse wants me to have this medicine, but I can't have it until I've been diagnosed with a condition that Medicaid believes that the medication can treat. I don't know if the facility I go to would let my nurse diagnosis me herself, or if she has to wait for the guy with the doctorate (my psychologist) to do it.The inventory is a weird one that matches you up to statistics to see how bad you have it compared to the bell curve. You need a key to use it and can't really make heads or tails of it otherwise. It's possible for anyone to see just by how many boxes I check and how often the symptoms I report affect me that I have an issue, but I don't know if to make a formal diagnosis at this facility they need to sit down and say that according to assessment I'm in 88th percentile of being shit at life. Or whatever. Again, I don't know what red tape they have to go through where I'm getting care at. (I know they have some very specific criteria at the facility about prescribing benzodiazapenes like Xanax, under what circumstances they can be prescribed, and for how long the shrinks can keep the patients on them, as only short-term prescriptions are allowed. I don't know what their criteria are for ADHD diagnosis and treatment or even if they have any at all.)Being a Medicaid patient my options are also limited and this is the best treatment I've gotten anywhere by far. I can't really leave. Essentially I just want to know if Medicaid will fill a scrip for Vyvanse if my psychiatric nurse tells them I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, or if they want the diagnosis to be specifically ADHD. Hoping someone who's been in the same situation might know.  [info] None [info] 1514530050

prufrockbabe666 [info] I'm a sex addict (10 months sober yesterday). Even most of the people in my 12 step group ( which is AA, because SAA/ SLAA/ SA in my town feels very unsafe) don't know. Even though my obsession about / compulsion toward sex got a lot better when I was diagnosed with bipolar and got on meds, as a woman it is horrible to try to tell people you're a sex addict because people either think you're trying to get attention or that it's hot. I'm really worried that my friends or family member will find pictures of me on the internet because I sent them to so many people when I was acting out. My other really big secret is that while I was manic and sleeping around with a lot of people (because mania / manic hypersexuality + compulsive sexuality is like the worst combination, ever), I was raped by a stranger, as I was hooking up with his girlfriend. The only people who know this are one of my sisters, one close cousin, my therapist and my current partner. And only my therapist and my partner knows the circumstances. Being bipolar is also a pretty big secret (Mom knows but I haven't told Dad and I told her not to tell him as well). Beyond my partner, my one sibling, my AA home meeting, and my therapist, only my graduate advisor, who struggles with her own chronic invisible illnesses knows.  [info] None [info] 1518442811

TheGMan323 [info] Be as understanding and forgiving as possible. If she snaps at you when she's angry, don't yell at her. Realize that she is not in control of her emotions most of the time and did not really mean to yell at you. If she is crying at some restaurant and making a scene, don't let your parents (or someone else) pester her to stop crying. Comfort her, but give her her space. Even if she's acting out in front of people and possibly aggravating you in the process, try to remain calm and treat the situations as delicately as possible. Don't ever make her feel like she's not normal--because she is normal. Also, **THIS IS A BIG ONE**: Do not go around telling every person you know that she is bipolar unless your sister specifically tells you it is okay to do that (or asks you to, for some reason). I love my mother, but when I was diagnosed with bipolar she had a tendency to tell almost anyone she talked to that I had bipolar disorder and this led to most people treating me like I was some specimen at a museum who shouldn't be touched or breathed on the wrong way. "Oh, hiiii. How are yooooou doing?" They were talking to me like I was mentally challenged or something. (Not to insult the mentally challgenged.) Make her feel like she's normal and just as cool as everyone else--because she is! Edit: And yes, being available for her to talk to you is important. I have a very, very loving family, but a lot of times when I talk to them about something that is very important to me, they quickly tune out of the conversation and just try to pretend like they're listening. There is nothing more hurtful than this. Either give her 100% of your attention or don't give her any. She will know the difference. Also, I just have to say it is very encouraging to see a post like this. Please let your sister know that the teen years are the worst emotionally (especially for bipolar people), but it gets better after that.  [info] None [info] 1324402041
babykittenbella [info] I’m an adult child. At age 32 I suffered an episode of mania. My mother comitted me to an insititution involuntarily, and I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I have been stable since, but am suffering severe consequences of the meds and social stigma around mental illness. It sounds like your son needs help very urgently. I did too at the time. However... Today I am scared of my mother and SO, because of the trauma of getting me help. There was paramedics and police involved, I was taken to a hospital in handcuffs, even though I never hurt anyone including myself. I have forgiven them, but will never ever forget. I think it might have been better if they had explained to me that I could go voluntarily, if not they had the power to rob me of my rights and would get it done without my consent. I might have gone on my own... Good luck! [info] None [info] 1554653681

kkstoimenov [info] Yes, absolutely. My brain fog is almost entirely gone. I find it much easier to focus on my goals and my "ideal self." I've also been meditating daily throughout, so that's helped.Downsides have been sleep, emotional regulation and relaxation. I only had my first dream 2 days ago. I've been finding it very difficult to manage my mood (I'm diagnosed with bipolar so this is a big part as well.) And the biggest one is, I can't relax without weed... sometimes I have to force myself to cook, or play video games, or just sit.  [info] None [info] 1499447160

I had an extremely high IQ, test grades, etc.  Weird thing is I had Epilepsy.I sucked at math though and still do, so anything related...nothing.I never went to college because every degree requires Algebra 1 &amp; 2 and I honestly don't know how to do it.  As an adult I've been diagnosed with bipolar and I work retail for minimum wage and make below the poverty level.  I've considered going to college again recently but the math is what always stops me.

pero_dero [info] Will try to keep it short:My american football coach had just started talking with the national team and colleges in the US for me to start playing for them. I tore a ligament in my groin during a match and the doctors found out I had an anomaly in my hip so I had to undergo a surgery, which meant no more football or MMA.The two sports were my way to vent all the negativity I had so I became heavily depressed. I started drinking heavily, even got to school drunk sometimes. Then drugs came into the picture and I eventually had a psychosis.Lateron I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, which I dealt with. Had a good period where I started in college, but shortly after I dropped out and went back to my drug abuse. I'm 22 now and the struggle is over, it was 3 1/2 dark years, and I remember little. I'm going to study sports science in the best university for sports science in my country. To be stable I had to stop doing drugs, never get more than tipsy when drinking, and **keep a routine** to stay active and get out of bed every morning.  [info] None [info] 1404235633
Shylamb [info] Was doing great, but feeling off now... I was diagnosed with bipolar in high school, got lots of therapy and was on medications for many many years. I finally weaned off the meds in grad school when I was trying to get pregnant with my son. I continued therapy and was doing great. I even got to a point where I stopped therapy. My son is now 5, and I have a 3 year old daughter as well. I'm usually pretty good at noticing an episode come on, and managing it well-I think I have a pretty mild form as I find that now I have better coping skills I am as functional as anyone else. However, recently I've been having surprise episodes of despair or mania-the mania is short lived and manageable, but my depressive episodes are getting harder and harder to manage. I feel like I'm not as good a mom as I could be or was before, and well, you probably know the drill. I'm emotional and I'm not being a good person to my husband or kids I feel. I've considered going back to therapy, but finding the time is hard. I do not want to go back on meds. I guess, in the end I'm just looking for a little support, and do you think it's possible I went into remission for a few years and it's just now coming back?Edit: sorry for any typos, I'm posting his from my iPad while I hid from my kids in the bathroom.

I’m a rapper who has the basic knowledge of producing. I mainly go for a dark, angry, light the world on fire kind of vibe for my music. I’m mainly looking to network with rappers who have the same vibe, producers, social media figures, and anyone interested in photo/video/graphic design. I already have connections with some bigger social media pages who agreed to promote me already (50k+ subs on some), a few photographers who are a small distance from me, and a few producers who might not have my sound but might fit the sound your looking for. My forte besides rapping is fashion, marketing, marketing psychology, and creating a realistic business plan. I’m willing to help anyone I fuck with.

analogthunder [info] I'm overwhelmed by the suffering I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2, but I'm pretty sure I have bpd, since my emotions have always been very extreme and magnified. In the past few years my life's been getting shittier and so much better at the same time. I got unexpectedly pregnant 2 years ago in a not very good situation and my son has given me the motivation and the strength and really, is making my life worth living. On the other hand my realionship with his father was emotionally abusive and has broken me completely, I broke up with him in August but we have a kid together so we're still constantly fighting. When my baby has to go with him (he's not a bad father, he could do much better, but he's not the worst) my heart shatters, I'm in complete agony, not so much for my son, I know he has a lot of fun with his father, but for me, for everything I miss. My baby lives with me and spends most of his time with me since I only have a few hours of work atm, but I'm trying to get more, and hopefully will soon, and I'm studying, so I feel that everytime I spend and will spend less time with him. So I'm in a constant sway between feeling so lucky and thankful that I get to be this little man's mom and feeling the worst pain because I can't give him the life I wanted for him and guilt that we can't be together.And really, comparing, my situation isn't THAT bad, but I'm in so much pain that life's barely worth living. I can just imagine what mom's are going through that have sick babies, or can't feed them or clothe them. I don't know, I'm just overwhelmed and extremely frustrated and disappointed in the human society. I am loosing all my hope for something better and my ability to see the good in people has always been my lifeboat, now I can only see complete, selfish assholes.Thanks if you read my rant, I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this but I just thought you guys would be the most understanding of how overwhelmed I feel right now.

MeyerLink [info] Where I am and where I've been. I keep posting in other people's threads with advice or consolation or whatever so I figured it was only fair that I introduced myself in this subreddit.  I am a guy if anybody is wondering.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with a psychotic component when I was about 7 by one of the few doctors that belived in childhood onset bipolar disorder at the time.  Now it's no longer a controversy.  Had my family not kept taking me to differet doctors and pushing until they found out what was wrong, I don't know where I'd be today.Did the mood stabilizer thing.  I responded well to lithium. I was on anti psychs for a good while.  A long time later in high-school I was diagnosed with adhd, but there was a chance that the meds would exacerbate my mood swings so I didn't do anything about it until recently.In college I went off my meds.  It was a disaster. I became even more withdraw than I had been in highschool.  I couldn't deal socially.  I wound up putting myself in some really bad situations.  Luckily, I am a good students so my grades were good.After college I decided to get back on my meds and to work on my problems.  I created a good circle of friends, all of whom I trust completely.  They have never let me down.  I started on a path that led to a career.Other than one awful year (my career nearly went in the trash, but it's all good now) I have been steadily doing better every year.  I have become more social.  I picked up some fun weird hobbies including roll playing games, hypnosis (super fun, actually), and martial arts.  I have had a few relationships.  I have ended them all because I haven't quite found what I am looking for.  Each one has been better than the last, and I have gotten over 9000 times better at dealing with the opposite sex.  I continue to push myself out of my comfort zone and it seems to have given me a better handle on myself because my mood swings are pretty mild these days when they come at all.  I also have a phenomenal psychiatrist and am on a good coctail of meds right now so I am sure that helps quite a bit too.  I feel pretty lucky that I have always had the support of my family, and that I now have the support of great friends.  I don't know where I'd be without them. [info] None [info] 1376414364
unwinding_cablecar [info] Hey! I have bipolar and I have been happily dating a girl for a few months :\) she is very understanding and helps me when things get rough. I was diagnosed about a year ago after multiple episodes and have worked through a DBT program and keep up to date with my meds; I've been stable since! A few dates in the past fizzled out once I told them I was a person with bipolar:/ I think it's key to keep managing your health and well\-being, first and foremost. I was married when my mental health issues started at the age of 25, and the person left me because I was diagnosed with bipolar. Probably for some it seems like something scary, maybe because they don't understand or have experience with someone with bipolar. My best advice would be to let people see who you are first, that you aren't really different than anyone else. You just have an illness that you are managing! Personally, I like to be upfront and honest as soon as possible, but everyone is different. For instance, I disclosed to an employer that I had bipolar and was fired a few weeks later... it is challenging, but know that there are people out there who support you and that you are still the same person! I'm still struggling with that, but things will and do get better with time! Wishing you the best :\)  [info] None [info] 1526482175

cupcakeninja2 [info] [Support] Meet my mother To get a little bit of an idea about my family read my post [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1uvvr6/long_story_but_need_to_vent/) in /r/parenting Follow up to that post:After I reported my mother to the authorities she decided to take revenge and filed a false report against me to CPS. I met with a caseworker and they determined that everything in my home is fine and my children are healthy and safe. So nothing came of it except wasting everyone's time and resources. I made a decision to try to fight my mother for guardianship of my disabled aunt. It seems the APS caseworker fell for their lies and fake smiles so that is the only other thing I can think to do to protect my aunt. After talking with my therapist about all of these issues I decided to see if there was any way I could force my mother to get a psychiatric evaluation. Well, the ONLY thing my mother cares about is money and her job. So I contacted her work and asked them if they could help me. In turn, they fired her. It was not my intention for her to get fired but the bitch in me is doing a happy dance because payback is a bitch. And now maybe she will hit rock bottom and try to get help for herself. Now, I do NOT want any form of contact with any of those people in my "family". I do not initiate any conversation, I live in another state and I just want them all permanently out of my life. I recognize that they are a bad influence in my life and the lives of my children. But every few days I get random texts from various members of my family.  They harrass me and accuse me and threaten me. And I just want them out of my life completely. I want to move on and just be happy with me little family. About a year ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I've had my ups and downs with meds and am currently not on any. I am waiting to get an appointment with my psychiatrist to get back on meds but it's not until the middle of May. So now I'm wondering if it was the right thing for me to do all those things. Maybe I took it a little to far. They are still my family, after all. Maybe I shouldn't try to fight for my aunt because maybe my mother will change after having the APS caseworker visit. They keep telling me that one day I'll need them and nobody will be there for me. But I know that I have my husband and his family, as well as my children who will stand by me through anything. Last night I looked up the definition of sociopath. I found [this]( http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder/basics/symptoms/CON-20027920) list of symptoms for antisocial personality disorder. It all fits my mother to a T. I can go on for days about my childhood and how my mother has been throughout my adult life. This just makes sense. But what worries me is that some of those symptoms/traits fit me as well. My fear is that I'll become just like her. Mental health conditions are often misdiagnosed and many are hereditary. And now all I can think about is my poor young boys having to grow up with a crazy mother just like I did. Now I question whether or not I may be a sociopath and I fear for my children and how they will grow up if this is true. Maybe if I push my "family", specifically my mother, far enough away.. maybe I can save myself from becoming her. I just want to go on with my life and forget they exist because they bring out the worst in me. But how can I do that if they continue to text and call me? And what do I do when my oldest son continues to ask to see/call his grandmother? [info] None [info] 1391613440
Goldenboy451 [info] So this is a bit of a weird, personal...thing; I'm not even sure I'd really call it a question, more of a 'thank you'.Round about the time I was starting my final year of uni, I was in a pretty bad way. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for a couple of years, and medication can only really do so much. A few years earlier, I'd spent months doing little more than reading &amp; listening to music, since it was just about the only thing that could get me out of my own head. I ended up reading Kieron Gillen &amp; Jamie McKelvie's 'Phonogram: The Singles Club', which turned out to be just what I needed. It was something I really ended up identifying with, and gave me a lot of cause for thought.So when Jamie posted a couple of your early tracks; ZVVL and Science/Visions on his Twitter towards the start of my final year, I had to check them out. Each one of your tracks made me feel something I hadn't felt about music in a long time: excited. Along with some other synth &amp; pop albums, your early demos and live sessions were a constant on my playlist; during the months I was feeling shitty and deeply suicidal, there was some relief in just putting on a great track that was quite unlike anything else, and you guys were a big part of that.So I guess that's a long-winded way of saying that you guys have played a pretty big part in my life the last 18 months or so; both times I've seen you live you were absolutely fantastic, and I really look forward to seeing where you go in the future.Iain, Martin &amp; Lauren - thank you, and thanks for taking the time to read the angst of an early-twenty-something.  [info] None [info] 1396470432

dasoomer [info] It's a long story, but I'll truncate it. I was on the tail end of a 10 day party. I started in Austin for the F1 race, flew to Albuquerque, and flew to Vegas. There was a lot of alcohol, cocaine, and MDMA to help fuel the way.I stayed up the entire night doing MDMA and started drinking at breakfast prior to boarding my flight. I continued to drink on the plane and was sufficiently trashed when I landed. A buddy picked me up and we went back to his place. Needless to say I was sufficiently exhausted and needed to grab a few hours of sleep prior to continuing. This was my first experience with sleep paralysis and it TERRIFIED me. It was the worst experience of my life. I wanted to scream but couldn't. I tried rolling off of the bed with no luck. Regardless of what I did, nothing brought me out of it. I have no idea how long it was, but I know once I came out of it I started googling what was wrong. I looked through all of the potential causes and stopped after I counted 6 items that could have caused it. Once back home, I really reflected on everything and decided I needed professional help. I was diagnosed with bipolar mania and immediately started making the changes I needed to avoid that situation. [info] None [info] 1442778984
Cheeseballfairy [info] Zenzedi (Dexadrine) has changed my life in the best way possible I have had ADHD my entire life. I was always the weird annoying kid that never stopped talking. When I was in middle school, I tried Adderall and Adderrall XR, but the side effects outweighed the benefits (which were miniscule).I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 17. This complicated things a little, as so many side effects overlap, and the treatment for ADHD and for mania is different. After a good combo of mood stabilizers was found, the ADHD symptoms were still very much present, but I was able to work with it and still function fairly well and succeed in college, with the exception of social problems.At the age of 19, I got a bad concussion resulting in post-concussion disorder. With this compounding the ADHD symptoms, my daily life was significantly impaired by forgetfullness, concentration problems, and complete lack of motivation. My relationships suffered. People were understanding, but I was hard to hold a conversation with. I tried Adderall, Adderrall XR, and ritalin. We settled on Adderall. I did not like it very much and only took it on days I felt it was necessary. It didn't really help, it just took the edge off a little. But the come down at night was awful. My doctor offered one last option: zenzedi.Zenzedi, also called dexadrine, contains only one of the ingredients in Adderrall. There a couple side effects, but I have not had any whatsoever, and I'm usually the person who gets all the side effects.This is the first time in my life that I have felt like a normal person. I never realized that this is what a person should feel like and this is how they should think.I wake up without an alarm and feel awake. I want to get up and get my day started. I have to-do lists that I check and follow. I'm aware of my shortcomings and create routines that help me cope with them. I do things before they are due. I can do math in my head. I clean and organize. I feel like my goals are attainable and I know what to do to attain them. And I do it. I shower and brush my hair and put on makeup. I know what comes next. All of those things I just said have never happened before in my entire life. It's as if I'm in a state of hypomania all the time, but without the bad parts. It feels like my brain went from a tornado scene to a library. I still ramble, I still get distracted, I'm still me. But now I know what to do with me. I promise I'm not trying to promote this drug. This is just my personal experience to let others know that if you think you are out of options, you might not be. However, it's relatively expensive, it's new, and you won't find any pharmacy that  doesn't have to order it. tl:dr zenzedi is a lesser known ADHD medication that has given me drastically better treatment with no side effects.

Elriuhilu [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I know what it's like to be actually depressed. I've been in situations where I thought about jumping off a building or something and I can tell you one thing, I never discussed it with anyone until after I decided not to do it. If I did kill myself, I would do it privately somewhere that people wouldn't watch or try and stop me. People who announce how depressed they are for pity points annoy the hell out of me because they're behaving like a life ruining illness is trendy. So, with that said, I agree with Chaim Witz there to a point, that people who make a great big show of killing themselves and make sure everyone knows about it are probably doing it for attention. That's not to say that they don't have issues, but they should talk to someone instead of preemptively traumatising their friends and family with something they might not even be committed to.

kday0 [info] I’m a registered practical nurse (Ontario Canada, 2 years for college diploma) and have been for 3 years. I decided to go back to school to pursue my degree in nursing to become an RN. In the middle of the first year, I noticed I was having many issues with mental health and looked for an explanation/medications. Towards the end of the first year I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, and continued to work. Starting second year has been a struggle for sure but I’ve been doing my best with routines and medications and have oriented myself to attaining this goal. It’s possible, and nursing is a rewarding career for sure.  [info] None [info] 1541909138

RCampbellSproul [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar type II as well. I for about a year or so I was diagnosed as major depressive, but about three months ago my psychiatrist noticed some patterns of hypomania and changed my diagnosis. I definitely know what you mean about not wanting to tell people about bipolar, and I agree about the stigma. I was willing to tell my friends or even acquaintances I was depressed, but I have a lot of fears about social consequences about telling people I'm bipolar. I've told a few of my closest friends who have all been very kind and supportive (which is of course a huge part of what makes them close friends) but outside of that I generally don't tell folks. I definitely struggle the most with the mood swings, particularly because when I'm hypomanic I can't sleep. At first it feels really good, but after a while of sleeping too little, things start to get pretty bad for me. I hope you get better, I know that this has been incredibly hard for me so I assume it is for others too.  [info] None [info] 1469840667

mauricioadb [info] Differing diagnosis I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and BPD by different psychologists and psychiatrists. I do have some hypomanic episodes that last a few day but my depressive episodes are more accentuated. I'm also incredibly angry and negative right after waking up which makes me think about some neurochemical imbalance. I started going to therapy due to a long history w drug abuse and after a few years of rehab I actually felt mental illnesses getting worse. Currently I'm at a pretty good place regarding my mental health and I'm no longer taking any meds (at one point in my life I was taking around 6 different pills a day). But I have this reoccurring thought about how (if I do have a mental illness) my illness could be affecting me or will affect me in the future. [info] None [info] 1564820490

Manassisthenew6pack [info] When I was 20 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after having a psychotic break and needing to be committed, after that I ended up dropping out of college and basically looking to drug use as the only novel thing I did that gave me an identity. I moved back to the small town I was originally going to college in, and began attending a technical school where I would binge on adderall the night before an exam and stay up for 12 hours straight to pass the exams. Because I liked adderall so much I made an appointment with a psychiatrist, who proceeded to give me mood stabilizers but wasn't convinced I needed adderall. In the process of getting adjusted to mood stabilizers instead of the anitpsychotics I had been taking (and stopped taking), things had to get worse before they could get better, and my moods got into new weird areas, to the point where I wasn't comfortable just drinking my feelings away because they would come roaring back when I was drunkest. In light of this, I went to the gym nearly every day, no routine just going as hard as possible for 2ish hours a day trying to exhaust myself. That was all about 8 months ago, I've just been working in fast food since that happened, and my use of everything has precipitiously fallen off to nill at this point, I'm even on a five week quitting smoking streak right now. Lifting just keeps me sane I guess. [info] 165x1 [info] 1418328453

amareevita [info] Not sure if this is quite what you're looking for, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I've been with my SO for two years, and I was diagnosed a few months before I started dating him. It was really rough at the start. I was still figuring it out and he didn't know any triggers... but to be fair, neither did I. Now, it's easier. I'm on medication for it and I am *strict* about taking them daily. I go to cognitive behavioral therapy once a week. We live together, so I know it's harder for him in that way. I try very hard to not show him the very worst moments, like the panic attacks, for example. I have them daily, but we're away from each other for most of the day, and see each other at night at home. He knows I have them, but he's never had one (I'm happy for him about that), so he won't exactly understand. It would stress him out greatly to see me in panic attack mode. He has before, because I wake up from sleep with them (when I can sleep, that is). He'll wake up right along with me and stay up with me for hours, talk to me, rub my back, and help me breathe. He is incredibly patient and understanding for being 21 (sounds bad, but I hope you understand what I mean).I don't want to lose him because of this. At the same time, I know it's incredibly difficult to be in a relationship with me. I try my hardest to be fair, but sometimes, some days, it just wins out. It's like dating two people at once, depressed me and then manic me. I am as open as I can be with him, but I don't lean every aspect of this diagnosis on him. Some days are better than others. It's incredibly difficult sometimes, but I really think how you approach it, attitude wise, is what matters. If you take your meds, go to therapy, and communicate, hopefully you can find someone who loves you despite your mental stability. Someone who doesn't see it as the thing that defines you, but rather something that is just another part of you.  [info] None [info] 1492746057
The_Durandal [info] I am also diagnosed schizophrenic, schizoaffective bipolar to be exact.  I was diagnosed with bipolar originally about 15 years ago, which changed about 8 years ago to my current diagnosis, and have been on a variety of antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxyiolitics, and lithium, for most of that time.  Currently I am not on any medication from a Psychiatrist.I use a custom stack myself;Lion's Mane for Nerve Growth Factor,Omega-3 for nerve repair and dopamine receptor health,Brahmi (a plant that is a bacopa monnieri source)  for GABA receptor health and sometimes for sedative effect if I feel overstimulated.I have been addicted to alcohol 4 times in the past year, since I went off of my antipsychotics and lithium I was prescribed.  That is why my stack is so heavily skewed to nervous system health, as alcohol withdrawal damages the nervous system badly. There are two other aspects in my recovery that are helping tremendously.  One is sleep.   I've focused heavily on my sleep hygiene; I stop doing anything intense at around 10:30, I drink a reishi + red tea tea around that time, then 2-3 cups of a calming lemon tea to prepare myself for bed around 12:15am.  That works for me and I've had a ton of problems with sleep in my life (I've had sleep paralysis around 50-70 times in the past year as well).The other is socializing.  Working with my psychiatrist, I was given referrals for social activities such as addiction services, mental health support meetings, etc.  These are helpful as schizophrenia lends itself to isolation and drug abuse is a common effect from that isolation.This is working fairly well for me now and my sleep is improving as well.  I am engaging a lot more in the community and that is encouraging, and encouraging me to attempt more engagements as well.That's my 2 (or 20) cents.  Good luck whatever you decide and whatever happens. [info] None [info] 1564922393

scubasam6 [info] Controlling irritability? Hey everyone, looking for some advice. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (amongst other diagnoses) 3  years ago but I still feel like I lack the skills to handle mood swings and episodes. Lately I’ve been hypomanic and especially irritable. The irritability is causing me to become irritated with people easily and I’ve been snapping at friends and loved ones. I’ve been kinda mean to people close to me and I feel so bad that I can’t control my temper. Does anyone have any tips to control the feeling or irritation? I find that every little inconvenience drives me crazy and i automatically react rather than responding.  Any tips are helpful!

han-duo [info] Could these symptoms be a result of long term lamictal and zoloft use? To preface, I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on April 7th. I visit her every three months for my medication management.I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder about five years ago. I am a 22 year old female. After trying numerous medications, we found an effective treatment with zoloft and lamictal, which I have been taking for about a year and a half, maybe two years.I started noticing some odd symptoms in October of 2017, but brushed them off as being unrelated. However, I am noticing that they have been getting worse pretty quickly within the past month or two. I'm starting to wonder if they could be a side effect of these medications due to long term use. Is this common? Or even possible?? I researched the symptoms (I apologize; I know this is generally frowned upon by medical professionals, but I couldn't help myself because I was becoming pretty concerned) and a lot of them seemed to match up. Here is a list of all of the symptoms I'm experiencing that I can recall at the moment.--often uncoordinated/dizzy --difficulty articulating my thoughts/processing information/completing tasks.  (for example, this whole post took me way too long to type. I couldn't think of the right words to use, no matter how simple they were. It's very frustrating as I was always considered a very bright girl. Additionally, I work in retail. A task that should take an hour on average takes me two and half to three hours.) --memory loss. I often forget what was said during conversations. (I forget questions asked/answers received, stories told, etc.) --involuntary twitching of my neck/head (my head jerks to the side violently and usually becomes very painful. If this progresses over a along period of time, it starts moving down my body, starting withmy back, next my arms, and then my legs. I sometimes lose the ability to walk due to the severity.) --hearing loss and rapid worsening of vision, both nearsightedness and long distance--incredibly vivid nightmares and dreams, sometimes lucid. I remember my dreams clearly every morning. I often confuse them with reality. --difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. --constant and severe pain throughout my entire body--Severe fatigue--irritability--gastritis, esophagitis, constipation--difficulty breathing/quickly exhausted --more frequent panic attacks I'm sorry for the length of this post, but I thought I should include plenty of background info as well as everything I experience that is very out of the ordinary. Do you think that this could be caused by my meds, or is it possible that it is something completely unrelated? If so, any ideas as to what it could be? Or should I not worry and continue to brush it off? Do you recommend I bring this up to my psychiatrist? She is very condescending and dismissive, so I'm kind of nervous to do so. Any help is appreciated! [info]  [info] 1521784988

drifter265 [info] flunked out of college twice now I have a hard time finishing things. I only made it to the end of my sophomore year of high school because I dropped out. At 18-19 I finally got my GED without having to study for it and in 2011 (at 20) I started community college. Two and a half years later and I got my AA with a 3.83 GPA. Come fall of 2013 I started at a big time university. Oh what a nightmare. I was 22 (almost 23) and I was only taking three classes at the time. I dropped out of two and scored a c- in the third. The next quarter I took three classes again and this time failed two and got a c- in another. I took a break after that and jumped around different fast food jobs until I wanted to go back to school in 2016 (I was 24). I went back to the same university and my first quarter was great and I got two A’s and a C. Then the next quarter I got a B and two D’s. I got expelled. I really suck. Now I’m 25 and looking to go back to the same university to get my degree still. They’ll let me back in if I petition or take four community college courses and earn a 3.3 GPA and I’ve already done the former. I can’t believe this is how my life is going.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the end of my last quarter where I got two D’s. I was put on a 72-hour psychiatric hold for suicide prevention and am now medicated with mood-stabilizers and anti-depressants. I don’t feel great but just normal and not a good normal. A normal that’s just normal. It’s being at the baseline all the time. Each day emotionally is the same for me. I don’t get happy and I don’t get sad anymore. I do get sad but only for a little bit; mostly I get frustrated and bored. I used this reason in my petition and hopefully they accept it and in six months I can go back to try again. I want these meds to work and have my disorder be the answer to why I failed and couldn’t repeat my success I had with community college. My GPA at university is now a 1.80 and if I just retake the classes I failed and did poor in by a letter grade, it would bring my GPA up to a 2.50. I don’t know where I’m going with this. Maybe I’m just stupid. I do remember being heavily depressed in college and skipping classes and not turning in assignments. I always tried to be the first one done in a test because I couldn’t focus for that long and just tried to answer the questions really quick. I told my psychiatrist that I might have ADD (this was after I dropped out for the second time) but she doesn’t think I have it but hopefully I’ll have convinced her by the time school comes around because I really think it would help.I feel lost. I was doing so well and now I’m not. I feel the only answer after this if I don’t get my degree is to kill myself because what’s the point of living anymore if you’re just going to be a failure for your whole life? I need some advice.

Big_Rig_Jig [info] Since I was a sophomore in highschool I've been 6' tall and never heavier than 150 pounds, usually floating around 140. I get made fun of, or told I need to eat more all the time. I'm extremely self conscious about it now. I don't like people seeing me with a shirt off cause I'm afraid of getting some negative shit coming my way.

quesojacksoncat [info] I used to work as a behavioral counsellor for a residential treatment home for developmentally and physically disabled adults.  We took the ones who had been kicked out of other homes because their behaviors were too violent, extreme and disturbing for those homes. I quickly learned that as the staff we were expected to risk our lives and wellbeing for these clients with zero back up from management in regards to our safety &amp; well-being.Here's a few examples:&amp;#x200B;My main client, a 28 year old woman with violent tendencies towards herself and others (she's put people in the hospital and has nearly lost several limbs and a breast because her self-harm is so severe... she's used an uncooked piece of rice on her skin hard enough to open a vein and don't even get me started with what she can do with a plastic button.. She managed slit her throat quite deep with a broken button once). Anyhow, I worked with this woman in her small apartment along with one other staff member around for support if needed. I'm a 120lb female and while I was confident in my ability to restrain her if needed, she could easily get the upper hand if I was caught off guard and do some serious damage. It wouldn't be the first time. This client developed an obsession with scarring my face and wrote me notes that she wanted to pour boiling kettle water on me while I made her tea sometimes.  She expressed a desire to push me into the oven while I was cooking for her and also said she would grab the wheel while I was driving the company vehicle and make us crash off a bridge.   I no longer felt comfortable cooking foods like pasta or making her tea in the tiny apartment after we had a few close calls and she almost burned me with boiling water.  I brought this to the clinician who makes up her program and he told me I had to continue cooking there (there was an upstairs kitchen for other clients I proposed using) because if I cooked elsewhere it would destroy my clients sense of normalcy.&amp;#x200B;I began asking my client to sit in the very back of the van when I had to drive her places because I feared she would grab the wheel or attack me while I drove (she always sat in the passenger seat before she started up with these threats) and she retaliated by punching the mirror off my personal vehicle which was parked in the same driveway.  Again the company refused to compensate me for the damage to my car and seemed unconcerned by the danger I was in.  Eventually, my mental health got to a point where I was anxious constantly.  I transferred to a different place within the company, hoping that since it was a "Day Program" with a lot of clients and staff doing activities together I would have more support.  This was not the case.  Now, I was expected to take up to 5 clients in a van into the community, all of which had the tendency to run away and become violent in the van or at the outing location.  At the main office, one of the clients beat a staff member with a fire extinguisher and she suffered permanent damage because there wasn't enough staff to keep her safe or stop the attack once it started.&amp;#x200B;At this time, I started to realize I was going to get badly hurt or have someone hurt under my care, both of which would effectively end my career. Addressing my safety concerns  with management only led me to retaliation from my supervisors and being slightly ridiculed.  This entire time, I had a psychiatrist who was truly amazing and even better, his son worked at the same company as me and was experiencing similar issues.  I couldn't believe it, as we live in a capital city and the odds of that are just insane. My psych offered to put me on temporary disability due to my deteriorating mental state but I refused because I believe disability should be a last resort and I wasn't at that point.  During this year and  a half is when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I had some extremely dark times, for sure exacerbated by my work environment.  I had to be on a variety of medications to make it through the days and  I accepted this may be the case for the remainder of my life. One day, a coworker of mine was severely beaten with a rake and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance.  That day I sent in a brief email to my manager stating I was resigning, effective immediately, and would be happy to provide  a doctor's note if they had any questions.  They didn't.&amp;#x200B;After that, I did a few interviews while my boyfriend supported us (not ideal, but we made it).  Within two weeks, I was hired for two jobs in one day.   One was as a waitress for a restaurant and the other was as a health support worker for a health care company.  I waitressed until my job at the health care company began and then began doing that full-time.  That career had it's issues but it supported me for the next 8 months until I found my current job. I now work in an office and the change in my mental state is absolutely incredible.  The lack of stress, financial stability and routine schedule has changed my life.  I've been off all my psychiatric medications for a few months and I've never felt so clear headed.  I  felt so hopeless before.  I look forward to most days at work now.&amp;#x200B;Sorry for the novel, if anyone can relate to switching fields and positive effects on their well-being I'd love to hear.&amp;#x200B;EDIT: spelling/sentence structure [info] None [info] 1560606611
edgar__allan__bro [info] Maybe a bad example, but I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder yet every group therapy session I've gone to and online support group I've been a part of... I can't relate to those who really seem to be heavily affected by their symptoms.At the least I think that there need to be more than a few classifications. Really though I think that these things need to stop being diagnosed as permanent conditions. In my case, I really only exhibit symptoms when under a ton of stress... And I feel like that just makes me a normal person. When you have the flu, it's common knowledge that you're temporarily ill. When you start flipping out because you're under immense levels of stress, you're labeled with a permanent disease and stigmatized by loved ones and medical professionals alike. I'm not fucking crazy. I just need to learn to cope with stress in more productive ways, just like some people with the flu might need more help recovering than others do because they don't cope well with physical illness.

slaughteredlamb1986 [info] Here in the UK I know people have been saying since long before I was a kid and still use it this way today. I had a manic day, or my job had been really manic. It's the correct usage of the word is the only use of the word I have ever heard before I was diagnosed with bipolar. Now if people where going around saying I had a full manic episode at work today , then I would question what the fuck they are talking about. But if they said I've just been so manic today been so busy rushing here and there. I wouldn't question it and nobody I know with bipolar or not would question it because it's a common usage of the word and had been for a very long time. I think your holding on to that word as special to your situation for some reason when it's actually a word that been in common usage to mean something non clinical for a long time and is still used that way. No if they said I'm so bipolar I'm my moods are just so up and down and they weren't diagnosed. Or they started saying I've been so hypomanic today then I would take offense to it because it's never been in common usage . But this thread sounds like a lot of people who have only heard that word in a clinical sense and are getting offended when it's used in one of its more common ways that it's been used for at least a couple of centuries [info] None [info] 1514678242

yellow_fleurs [info] Confused about/questioning diagnoses Not sure there's a point to this exactly, I know no one could give me medical advice or anything. I guess mostly interested in hearing other's experiences with this kind of thing. I am just trying to navigate the fact that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (unspecified) after a reaction to Lexapro last year. That was a horrible couple of months and I was told I had a mixed episode. It continued after stopping although it improved. With a lot of lifestyle changes I am doing much better now. I also have symptoms of OCD.My current therapist agrees with the symptoms of OCD, but disagrees that I have shown any signs of bipolar disorder. I definitely have mood symptoms with seasons and hormones (also diagnosed with PMDD), but not sure about hypomania. I really like my therapist and overall trust her. In a sense it doesn't matter too much as long as I continue to do well and improve, but I wonder if I might be ignoring a problem that I should be medicating or at least looking out for. I will say that I tried Lamictal after that mixed episode and was less depressed, but extremely agitated and irritable. It was symptoms maybe from the Lexapro still, but it improved when I stopped the Lamictal. I kind of wonder if I just have problems with meds for some reason. Also my friends, including my friend with bipolar, all say they don't see bipolar either. So yea, I guess I am just curious about other's experiences with anything similar.

I don't have any children myself (yet anyways) but I've come to believe that the real secret is NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING.  Upon reaching my 30s I kinda feel like the end scene in the movie The Big Short about the collapse of the housing market.   These two young men were standing in an empty cubeville building looking around when asked what they were hoping to find replied something like 'I dunno,  adults. ' to paraphrase it.   That's how feel now.   We're all just kinda trying to figure out the "right" way to do things and people act like they know what they're doing and act like an authority figure but the truth is they don't really know what to do either.  I think as far as parenting goesI would say just be a good example and expect to fuck up.  A lot.   My parents did,  their parents did,  my friends with kids do,  etc.   It sounds like your life is stable enough and you're already raising two great kids so maybe consider going for it and take the plunge, so to speak.  Just do me a favor and don't treat your biological child differently then your daughters.   I had to deal with that growing up and it was a nightmare.   I wish you all the luck in the world and a happy New Year.  [info] None [info] 1546278403

daltonminor [info] I was on those two (alone with quetiapine), but only a small dose of abilify (5mg). This was before I was diagnosed with bipolar.It was a while ago, so I don't remember exactly how I felt. I was pretty depressed, but had no manic/hypomanic episodes. I ended up going off them cold turkey as I left them in the southern hemisphere by accident. There was a honeymoon period after that, but then I went "full bipolar", and started different meds. I'm back on abilify now, at a higher dose. The only side effect I've had with abilify is weight gain (in particular, it makes me hungry all the time).I hope this combo goes well for you! Good luck :) [info] Bipolar NOS [info] 1546109959

lady_stardust_ [info] Myself. I was in a string of bad relationships with people who brought out the worst in me. I’ve had very low self esteem my entire life despite excelling in school and being (I’m told, but still sort of don’t believe) witty and fairly good-looking. I also struggled with undiagnosed bipolar disorder for ten years. This translated into accepting awful treatment from people who claimed to love me. Sexual and verbal abuse, cheating, alcoholics, run-of-the-mill jerks with stagnant lives. Don’t get me wrong, I was a shitty partner too. I was often emotionally unstable, selfish, and had bad habits of my own, like smoking weed and cigarettes constantly, drinking too much, and eating mostly junk food. I was a broken person and I fell in love with other broken people.After ending my last relationship in the midst of my first full-blown manic episode, I finally had time to be on my own. Being single for the first time in almost a decade allowed me to step back and look at the patterns in my life for what they were. I was diagnosed with bipolar and started treatment but I couldn’t come to terms with it and was struggling to figure out what my life would look like in this new reality. I also still couldn’t shake my unhealthy habits and didn’t really want to. My current partner helped me accept my mental illness, quit smoking cigarettes, and deepen my interest in healthy activities like writing, cooking, and exercise. He helped me change my relationship with alcohol and weed, which I now use in moderation rather than to numb myself from reality. He also provides thoughtful, nonjudgmental alternative perspectives that help me to reframe life challenges and work through them rather than avoiding them or feeling helpless. My personality hasn’t changed fundamentally; it’s more like I’ve finally been able to let the best parts of myself come to the surface. I feel stronger with him. He’s helped me shed the things in my life that I always knew were weighing me down.Plus the sex is ridiculous. [info] None [info] 1528572063
gaifish [info] How do you accept that theres something wrong? Hi everyone! I hope this question doesnt get asked too frequently lol. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 like a year ago but its still so hard to admit that somethings wrong with me. I can acknowledge that i have highs and lows, but its so hard to wrap my head around the idea that this isnt just how everyone feels all the time. I feel like ive somehow tricked doctors into believing that theres something wrong with me. I guess just because like, for so long i managed to get by without help that its really hard to admit that there was a problem. And like, now that im on antipsychotics that actually work its hard to really believe that the psychosis and mania i experienced was real.  Also, its really hard to admit that i cant just overcome this by working harder and that i really might need meds and that this is like, a chronic problem that wont just go away one dayAnyone else feel this way? Any advice on accepting the seriousness of your disorder without just feeling really depressed about it? [info] None [info] 1530465649
taytay9955 [info] Some people who have medicine resistant bipolar have better results from the keto diet ( which was designed to treat epilepsy) so maybe that is an option if you notice that it is responsive to changes in diet and exercise. I think if you check the boxes you check the boxes and it is just extra shitty that it doesn't respond to drugs, but if you have never had an EEG it might be worth having done. Sometimes epilepsy can seem like bipolar disorder. I have a really long story about this where I was diagnosed with bipolar, then diagnosed with epilepsy only to get a second and then a third opinion who told me I didn't have epilepsy. However, it could be worth looking into if you have any other warning signs.

sparklingdino [info] So how do you know/did you learn the difference between your normal mood and hypomania? I have been diagnosed with bipolar unspecified after a SSRI reaction, and am trying to figure out if I really get hypomania ever. Thing is I have had mood issues for like 15 years that cycle with the seasons and so there is fall/winter me and spring/summer me and yeah I feel way better during the spring/summer, but how can I know what my baseline even is at this point? Like I am way more productive and need less sleep, but couldn't that just be in comparison to my winter self? I do kind of think I have SAD. Plus I also have PMDD to further complicate things.So, did anyone else have issues with identifying hypomania, and how do you identify it now compared to a normal mood is my main question. Thank you!

Wondrous25 [info] Thoughts on psychotherapy? My pdoc told me she is more mastered in psychotherapy rather than meds. She also suggested to go to someone else if she isn't what I'm looking for. I believe my brain isn't functioning as it should be. I don't feel like she can find anything useful in my story(my life story basically) She also refused to talk to me when I told her I had a little drink. I told her I wasn't drunk and really I was fine. I just told her so that she can help me stop consuming alcohol. I feel she is more interested in making money rather than helping her patients. What are your thoughts?  edit: I'm currently on 200 mg lamictal 150mg lustral and 50 mg seroquel, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a year ago and had a medical report to take a break from college for 1 year.

wolfboy42 [info] It can be, but it's different for each person.  I was diagnosed with bipolar II, which was mild enough that the doctor put me on antidepressants to get through the lows along with guided mindfulness meditation sessions.  My manias only amount to me needing very little sleep, talking a mile a minute while jumping from topic to topic, and losing weight.  Sometimes I also become very irritable and get angry over what seems like little things in hindsight.  That's my least favorite symptom, but the mindfulness meditation helps manage it well.  I also think I get on my wife's nerves more during those times, but she is awesome and understands what's going on.Edit: added mindfulness treatment as I forgot it was something that was originally used but that I use on my own now.  Also added irritability as a symptom.Edit 2: As another user pointed out, Bipolar II doesn't experience true mania.  It's also not the symptom that I went to the doctor for.  At the end of the day, make sure you are open and honest with your doctor or therapist so that they can help you. [info] None [info] 1572322445

Vitkauskas [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder... She might be distancing herself in her manic state, it can last weeks or longer. Is she medicated? Stable?

She could be just having a hard time, and are you sure her period wasn't a miscarriage? Hormones really fuck with your head... send her a text if possible and let her know you're there for her if she needs you, no mushy stuff. Short, and simple, and nothing she can twist in her head. I'm really bad about that.. Then leave her alone. Give it a month of no contacting her, if she wants out, she has out.

danaofdoom [info] That sucks man, I'm sorry. I think you should confront her directly. Tell her that it was really not any of her business (in fact, its almost never appropriate to discuss someone else's medical history without their permission), and very embarrassing, and that you're disappointed that your own mother would humiliate and degrade you like that. Do this calmly. If you can't do it calmly, then write her a note. I guess you could have her retract the story but I'm not sure it would do much good. At the very least she owes you an apology.As for similar experiences, well, when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in high school (turned out to be a bullshit diagnoses, btw), my mother pretty much told her entire family and friends (I think it was some sort of "Oh look at how tough my life is! My daughter is bipolar!" thing). I had relatives that I hadn't spoken to in years coming out of the woodwork with unsolicited advice. Very humiliating for me. I eventually told her to knock it off, which lead to a huge fight, but she eventually did. [info] None [info] 1348012698

I can't stop imagining myself dying and laying on the floor bloody and my parents or roommate finding me. I know I need help but nothing works and i'll always feel like this so I really just want to kill myself because there's nothing I can do to make my life better.

alaskagreen27 [info] For starters, the public system is bollocks. Secondly, 10 subsidised psychology sessions are not enough and still very expensive. Psychiatry and psychology go hand in hand.After the Medicare rebate, I pay $115 to see a psychiatrist. But I have to be able to pay $230 before being refunded. Lucky for me I only have to go every couple of months now. Then I pay $75 for a psychology session after the Medicare rebate. I can only get 10 subsidised session per year before the costs goes up to around $150 per session. Then I get to pay for medications. Joy. Luckily I usually only take one medication which isn’t that expensive. I also pay for health insurance - because if I ever need to go to a psychiatric hospital, only a private hospital would provide suitable care. There’s a 2 month waiting period, so it’s better to stay insured if you’re at risk. Public hospitals really only aim to keep people from hurting themselves, or to treat those who are severely ill - they don’t take on patients just to rehabilitate them. I used to be on the most expensive plan because only top hospital cover will insure for psychiatric care. But now you can have one lifetime upgrade without serving the waiting period, so I’ve switched to basic cover.On top of that, mediations can cause side effects which might require you to see another specialist. For me, I have just been referred to see a dermatologist because my medication causes next level acne. Yay, more $ for specialists. I couldn’t imagine having to pay for my medical expenses while unemployed and on government welfare. I’ve heard of people spending about 25% of their welfare payments just on medication alone. I also couldn’t imagine being treated in the public system - imagine the waiting list and frequency of appointments.Also, before you are diagnosed properly, some medications can be more expensive because you are not covered by the PBS scheme. For example, a few years ago, before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was given an antipsychotic by a public hospital. This is a typical treatment for acute mania, but I wasn’t diagnosed yet and the hospital wouldn’t diagnose me after seeing me in emergency once. They only gave me about a week’s supply. I went to my GP for more, but she couldn’t diagnose me either so I had to pay $40 for a box of medication before being able to get into see a psychiatrist a month later. This is the type of medication which I only take in a time of crisis - and is generally only prescribed to bipolar and schizophrenic patients. You can only imagine the positions people are in when they need to take these kinds of drugs. I also see a GP who doesn’t bulk bill. I used to though. As someone with a lot of medical problems, I’ve realised that you often get what you pay for with GPs. Bulk billing GPs are usually ok strict time limits, or get booked out.

kissablyliterate [info] I recommend calling and speaking with your potential schools' mental health services department; most colleges have one. They can tell you about the services they offer, which usually include free therapy and granting accommodations. Accomodations could include things like a single room, or having a reserved seat at the very back of the room, and so on.I was diagnosed with bipolar during my fourth year. I absolutely failed every class my fall semester before I was diagnosed in December. I reached out to my program director and the campus mental health center. I was retroactively withdrawn from the entire fall semester, so it did not affect my GPA. I was able to maintain my status as a full time student while taking only three classes. My fifth year I lived in a single. I went to therapy at the MHC every week for a year and a half and never paid a dime. Without these accommodations and support, I absolutely would have flunked out. Having support from the college itself can be the key :) [info] None [info] 1522101643
enmason [info] I've taken the quiz before all of this shit happened (and before I was diagnosed with bipolar). I got INTJ.

yankowitch [info] I don't have bipolar as part of my identity. As a woman, I identify most strongly with my identity in relation to others. I am a wife and mother. I am Canadian. I work with computers and I'm pretty smart. These are the things that are me, help draw a picture of what I'm like. I identify myself as disabled in diversity questionnaires but that's just so I can get accommodation and treatment,  a label only in relation to the medicolegal complex.Having bipolar is interesting but so was my accident and bursitis. Both give cognitive effects, the hip condition counterintuitively can affect the brain more due to the damaged proprioception and cognitive effects of pain. Although the experience of both "builds character" I choose to frame the experience just through the lens of suffering, recovery, chronic disease management,  etc. My feelings and behaviors are part of the experience, not part of my identity. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 10 years, it never made it into my identity. I guess I just look at identity politics differently. [info] None [info] 1420393344

paperplanesss [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar, but i think that it’s incorrect and my impulsivity and elation from BPD is being misconstrued as mania, so I’m not really sure on the subject.

Winter-bells [info] Not that I know very much about it but there are certainly different paradigms that you can see your symptoms through. My friend has acute psychotic depressive episodes and prefers to see their experiences through a more shamanistic lens. Schizophrenia isn't at all shameful. My mother has schizoaffective disorder and I am diagnosed with bipolar 2, though I have hallucinations and delusions as well. I used to cry and feel a lot of shame, but now I just see it as the same as any 'disorder'. Some of my friends have fibromyalgia, some have diabetes, and I have bipolar.   That my brain sometimes glitches isn't at all shameful, it's just what happens sometimes. You're special for sure. You have a rich inner world, and the subjective experiences you had as a child are just as colourful as they ever were. Just because you now have the label of 'schizophrenia' doesn't invalidate your experiences a jot. Stigma is terrible -- but do you have one person who can understand? Who will listen?Your medicine is important to take, but can always be adjusted. Your colourful world isn't gone forever, you're just getting your dosages right to be able to function as best you can. You're still special, and your experiences are still valid, no matter what.  [info] None [info] 1485688205
thewhowithin69 [info] Burst my bubble?? Lmao. You really don't have a clue and should be cautious with your sterotyoing. I need kratom for pain (I don't care if a spinal tumor is a "legit" reason for needing pain control or not) because after too many years taking synthetic meds my body will not recognize them (genetic disorder) so you are assuming many things about me which is what frustrated me to begin with!! I know all about addiction and tolerance, first hand. And I know all about the damage that can occur thru injesting any product long term. I do not think that kratom isn't addicting but my point was it's not the plants that's the problem and I stand by that. If you struggle with addiction you can put anything in that spot (sex, food, etc) and still have this problem. Instead of focusing on this plant (or whatever your addicted to) it's internal personal work that needs to happen! So please don't think I'm just blindly prancing down the kratom to hell pathway because I know that isn't accurate. I am curious what you seem to think might be a good option for long term mood disorder?? And why do you have an opinion?? Because I was diagnosed with bipolar as a young person and have been treated with everything there is and so I actually come at this topic as a 50 yr old with some very strong opinions and experience!!

Sporie [info] When I first was diagnosed, I thought of this. I have obsessive compulsive disorder. I was diagnosed with bipolar II......and when I told some of my friends, they'd say, "So you're bipolar?".. I thought "Does this illness define who I am more than having OCD?". They'd never said "So you're OCD?". I thought about the differences between the two. OCD feels more like a glitch in my mind, however I thought about my bipolar diagnosis. It feels as though it's coloured more of my perception of reality than OCD did. I'd prefer to say "I have bipolar disorder", though... but I'm really not sure why exactly.. It's definately a part of my life. I'm not sure if I'd take it back though, it's made me who I am. [info] hypomanic hugger [info] 1353474390

termedea [info] That's a tough journey! I'm proud of you for getting this far.I didn't know about mental health awareness month. It's a great thing that I'll spread here too. It isn't a thing here where I live, but it should be. Now, considering your post, I've stopped to reflect on my own progress. I've been on sick leave for about 3,5 years for what started out as a burn out and later unraveled a plethora of issues and diagnoses for me. I've been depressed for most of my life, without knowing I could get help, I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 2, and now I'm awaiting an assessment to see if I'm suffering from a neurodevelopmental disorder.  It's been a tough couple of years, but I've finally started to move forward - and I've gotten far.  I've got a much better understanding of myself now, my strengths and limitations. I can work part time again and even push myself, because I know how to recharge and balance myself after challenges. I've got a better understanding of what I need from others. And probably most importantly of all, I'm more calm toward my bad episodes, and I rarely go into a depressive spiral where I fear nothing could get better again when they happen. Best of luck to you and happy Mental Health Awareness Month. Thanks for bringing this to my attention! :) [info] bp2 [info] 1556802702

I was diagnosed with bipolar at a young age and I really think it was a misdiagnosis. I work a shit job because I can’t hold down a decent paying job. I never have the motivation to clean my home. So it’s dirty a lot, which bums me out even more. Which makes it harder to clean. My relationship with my father is fucking bullshit. All over some money. Whatever. I have one friend who gets what I’m going through. I have one other who doesn’t understand but tries. My S/O has a lot of mental health issues which I empathize with but sometimes it feels like her needs ALWAYS come first.    I honestly don’t have any clue where I was going with this post. I’m just so drained and fucking out of it that nothing makes sense.      Sorry if I’ve broken a rule or wasted your time. Just figured you guys would listen. Idk. I’m tired of feeling like this.

holdtheearthinplace [info] So, first time posting here, I don't know what to expect or why I'm doing this (so much text). I just felt really shit, like to the point where I don't know what to do. I'm not going to do anything, I think I just lack the ability to muster up the enthusiasm.I'm 22, and I've been diagnosed with bipolar, but I'm depressed 99.98% of the time so here makes more sense, hope that's okay. I have a psychology degree (how ironic) that I'm never going to use. I'm back at uni to study english to hopefully do teaching later, I just have no energy. I thought I wanted to be engaged in something meaningful but I guess I don't. I kinda just make it through each school day, then I go to my job, I work with kids. It's stressful because it's casual. I'm just complaining now.I just want someone to talk to about it. I can't tell anyone. I stopped taking my meds (it was an accident) and then I couldn't get an appointment but I wasn't feeling so great before that anyway.  It's the first question out of everyones mouths. 'Did you stop taking your meds?' Yes. Oh just take them and you'll be fine again. Plus I think I've worn out the one person that cares about that kinda thing. I just don't know.Hi, I suck.I just want someone to care even though I know I don't deserve it. I'm short tempered and all around not interesting when I'm depressed. Urgh. I'm sorry.

EverlyBlue [info] It was good and bad.  I have a drinking problem, I had an awful incident after which I chose to go to rehab.  Rehab was a humbling experience and while in the end it helped me, I will never, ever go back. &amp;#x200B;I was diagnosed with bipolar II, I'm learning to deal with that now and it hasn't been easy. Quitting drinking, managing my mental health and doing all the normal stuff of being a wife, mom, employee isn't easy. &amp;#x200B;But I'm going to work even harder in 2019 and I'm excited to see what my focus and determination will bring.

IzThisMyLife [info] Ok this is a long one...... ready?TLDR at bottom. Hello I just want to say I'm so sorry you are going through this. I cannot imagine what it is like. Just remember you are doing the best you can and you're doing it for her father. It takes a strong woman to stick with someone after all of that most women would not be able to handle so many years with these issues from his daughter. I for one would be furious but I know what it's like for someone to leave because you have a problem child. So if nobody has told you or if he has not yet thanked you for the sacrifice and the effort that you are making I just want to say that I've noticed it and you should be proud of yourself for even trying. Reading this makes my step daughters look like angels. Even though they are truly good girls they are 18 years old and 21 so it's only a matter of time before they start being a little reckless. But this is okay with me and I especially don't want their father to think that I don't want them around.You guys are good parents and you're doing what you can. I also grew up with good parents although my father died when I was 14 my mother did her very best and I can truly say that she raised us very well. However that didn't stop my older sister from being a stripper and it didn't stop me from leaving the house at 15 because I wanted to party all night with my friends and take pills. I'm sure this is not what you want to hear and maybe I'll be singing a different tune when my little girls become teenagers. My youngest is 7 and my oldest is 9. My 9 year old is a hell-raiser she's been since she was a toddler and she is exactly like me and I am expecting the worse. I love my mother and I got arrested I used drugs I tried to kill myself the whole 9. She did what she could I've been in the psych ward like 11 times. But nothing seemed to help. I think when a girl gets a certain age she wants to have sex with boys and party and experiment with drugs as I did. There was no reason for me to do such a thing although I was diagnosed with bipolar Mania. I can say even after I got clean which was many years later I was still sort of crazy. Definitely emotionally unstable. I saw a psychiatrist and I tried medication and sometimes that's necessary. However I decided that I did not want to be a slave to another drug just because it was acceptable in the eyes of society. But that is my experience. What I'm just trying to tell you is that sometimes no matter what efforts you make or how hard you try you need to understand that it's not a mistake that you made especially since she's only been living with you since she's 9. I know this is tough for you guys but I think for your own sanity you guys need to let her be and I promise you she will come to her senses you just need to be there for her when she truly needs you. But at her age she's an Unstoppable Force. At least that is what I was and that is what I believe because I truly felt that nothing could stop me. No matter who I hurt. I was young and stupid.The issues with her lying though concern me also the incidents with the bloody sheets and pads in her room those are definitely signs that something is wrong. I suspect she has some type of mental illness.  but I'm not a doctor so I shouldn't comment. I think if you're truly desperate your last resort should try a psychiatrist which I think you may have reached that point. But if not, you need to just let her be she will go out and party and then she will struggle to find a place to live she will be hungry and only then will she appreciate all that you guys have given her. And then she will probably come back and try to be the good girl that you have been trying to raise her to be however there's going to be many f*** ups more lies and definitely stealing if she doesn't have a job and she's broke and hungry and living couch to couch. I know it sucks to worry and wonder where your child is but you have to remember she's not a child anymore and sometimes you have to let them learn the hard way which is the only way that I learned it sucks and I went through a lot and I feel sometimes that I could have been killed from being on my own at such a young age but what's important is that I learned from it and I'm an amazing daughter and I help my mother with everything that I can and it surely never thought that I would be the person that I am today I would even call myself emotionally stable and everything. But it took a long road I'm 33 years old and I can finally say that my mom is probably no longer worrying about me or what I'm doing. Now it's my turn to worry about her. Her time will come unfortunately nobody knows when. This may be bad advice but in my opinion you have two other girls that you have to raise and you and your husband cannot be at your wit's end because it's going to affect the lives of your other girls. Talk to your husband and either do the psychiatrist or stop pushing a girl who doesn't want to be pushed and will eventually push back and even ruin your lives possibly. Like I said be there for her when she truly needs you she will reach out to you when she's in trouble I promise you that. But until then it's going to be tough but you have to let her go.TLDR: the girls going to do whatever she wants anyways no matter if she's 15 or 19. She's got recklessness on her agenda and nobody's going to stop her. Let her go now and let her learn her lesson the hard way in order to save your sanity. [info] None [info] 1522714262
BeautifulGhost [info] From what I've learned with my doctor and research over the years it's a lot to do with medication and our unstable lifestyles when we stray from routine. Most of the medications cause weight gain and during episodes it's easy to stray from a healthy diet to over eating or not eating at all. I've had bipolar since my childhood but it wasnt treated until 7 years ago. I'm a rapid cycler so the ups and downs can sometimes change in as little as minutes. When this happens I CRAVE sweets. I can't control it and I'll cut anyone down who gets between me and the vending machine at work lol! My psychiatrist believes it's due to the instant release of dopamine that sugar gives us. Like a quick fix and a way for me to try and stop my sudden shifts. My metabolism is fast, my weight stays around 125lbs and I'm 5'6. My concern is all the sugar intake will cause me to have diabetes, it's a misconception that people who are overweight are the only ones who get diabetes.  Bipolar and diabetes are so toxic together because just like our mood shifts with bipolar our sugar also shifts constantly with diabetes. 3 years ago I went to a hospital because I was in a lot of pain and had a serious flu like cold.  I was also dizzy and my equilibrium was off. Once the doctor returned to the room she asked me how long ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She then went on to say that "sometimes, when those who suffer from this disorder have episodes, they often make things up in their heads that seem real but aren't." She gave me a xanax and released me with a pamphlet stating I had been treated for psychosis. My sister was with me and she about lost her shit in the room when the doctor said that to me. 3 days later I couldn't breathe and my mom rushed me to urgent care. I fainted when they took my blood pressure and was rushed to another hospital where I was admitted for a pneumonia, kidney infection and an unknown virus. They couldn't stabilize me and my doctor spent over 3 hours at my bedside trying to figure out how to treat the virus they had never seen before. It was so bad he started preparing my parents for worst case scenario and had a priest visit. I pulled out of it and was discharged 3 weeks later. Moral is a lot of doctors and providers write us off as being psychotic before actually treating the symptoms. I still remember hearing the nurse outside my room say "just a heads up this ones bipolar" and giggle to another coworker. When doctors dont give proper health care that can cause early death as well. [info] None [info] 1569165572
hallucinatingemu [info] I am having trouble thinking before I act. It seems like all I do is make bad decisions. I was diagnosed with bipolar a few yeara ago. It explains a lot of my decisions/actions in the past. I was self medicating with pot/pills/coke/alcohol but quit. Now I just smoke pot but because of a recent car accident that was entirely my fault, I have decided to give it up. I wasn't high while driving but I've decided I need to clear my head. I started taking lithium a month and a half ago and it has helped a lot. The problem is I feel stupid and I feel that no matter what I do I will always screw up. I am where I am in life because I keep making the wrong choices and it's hurting my marraige. My husband is afraid that I'm going to keep screwing up. My daughter (different dad than my husband) lives with my parents until I'm mentally and financially stable. I was on the path to success until i wrecked our only car. I just don't know what to do to change my way of thinking so I stop messing up. [info] None [info] 1532031160

gimv [info] Exactly. It makes me really mad because I was eventually going to tell everyone, obviously. This is family I see on a semi-regular basis, I was OBVIOUSLY not going to ignore the huge scar across my neck, but come on?! Was it that hard to allow ME to break the news about my situation? I don't think so. So far I've been going to other doctors (cardiologists, radiologists) and she's asked how it went (despite the fact that I'm not talking to her), and I'm giving her the tl;dr of everything: "fine", "I might look for another doctor", "I'm on meds now", etc. I think it's funny though how some things are worthy of telling, but others are worthy of shame. I was diagnosed with bipolar over a year ago. NO ONE in my same extended family knows. Maybe because it's mental illness isn't cool or glamorizing and tragic as cancer can be and wouldn't bring her much sympathy. Never worth mentioning. [info] None [info] 1533074048
destroying_maps [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar and complex PTSD, and I don't take meds for it. I do, however, go to therapy every week, and have to arrange my life carefully to allow for management of my symptoms. When I started T, we had to be careful about making sure my levels stayed stable as my body adjusted. This meant, in my case, breaking up my weekly dose of T into two shots per week. Did it suck sometimes having to stick myself every few days? Kinda. I also experimented with daily micro-doses, and that sucked too (and was thankfully unnecessary because it didn't differ much from the twice a week for me). But being on T has improved my ability to cope with symptoms and has removed an added level of stress that often triggered episodes, so being careful was worth it. [info] T - 10/'14. top - 07/'15.

caraconcerta [info] Why not both? WLS is a tool to help us realize our limitations, therapy is a tool used to help realize our mental limitations and overcome them. They can peacefully coincide and work with one another, no? They certainly have for me thus far. I am diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder, had binge eating issues and the first two months have been nothing less than unendingly agonizing. But that being said, it was the care I got through bariatrics, my psychiatrist, and my therapist that made the difference. I mean, that's what hospitals strive for right? Coordinated care? That's why nutritionists work with bariatrics, and most programs have us go to support groups. I'm sorry therapy did not work for you. That is unfortunate. I am glad that the surgery is treating you well mentally and physically! [info] 25F | VSG 9/9/19 | 5'8" | SW: 310 | CW: 217 [info] 1572552778

cmdr_felux [info] Sort of. They put me on a medication when I was diagnosed with bipolar that had a very convenient side effect of getting t-boned by a freight train shortly after digestion. I went from sleeping 3-4 hours to sleeping 9-10 hours. My body built a tolerance to it after being on it for 9 years and it stopped being effective as a mood stabilizer and sleep aid so it was back to square one. Traditional sleep meds haven't been effective since then so I've been sleep deprived these last 2 years as I tried all these other drugs. I'm waiting to get into a CBT-I program now to see if that'll help! I hear good things about it. [info] None [info] 1547561991
kykapoo [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar, a misdiagnosis, but during an internship I needed to take some days off so it was suggested I speak with HR. I didn't know what I had to say so I told them. I didn't get a job offer, everything pointed to me getting one, and after the intern head was let go she told me it was because everyone found out I was bipolar. That was five years ago.

mayidescend [info] I got diagnosed with BPD as soon as I turned 18, the psychiatrist i saw refused to diagnose BPD or any other major disorder until official adulthood- so I got diagnosed with basically everything else instead until then (it was annoying).At age 19 I started going to a different psychiatrist and decided not to inform her of past diagnosis to see if what I was diagnosed with truly was right. I even saw a therapist who I practiced the same thing with.I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, with small mania symptoms (the grading scale each of them used had mania with bpd 1).I learned how to manage my symptoms through therapy and eventually, at 20, was taken off medication (which I’ve been on different medications since age 11), and later in the year was released from therapy after being in it on and off since age 6/7. I wasn’t fully better, but I had the necessary skills to become better than I was in the past.Im nearly 22 now.I go to the same Psychiatrist every 3 months now. Just to make sure I’m managing myself alright: and She says I’m showing more mania signs off the medication, but all together, all my symptoms have gone down drastically to the point of me being considered “healed” if I maintain it for two more years.I still have bad spells, but I also have pretty good days as well. When I notice myself getting low, i practice what I’ve learned. Same thing if I notice myself getting too high and want to avoid a ‘crazy ‘spell.We are human beings and we are designed to adapt and change.We are adapting and changing.Kudos to you, and I wish you the best luck on the rest of your journey.Xo [info] None [info] 1571192803
devilwriter [info] Can't take it anymore and I really could use some advice.  I'll keep this short. I'm 26f and just graduated with my masters degree. I have a wonderful job and support system. I am clinically depressed. I've been adjusting and readjusting medications since I was 14. I've been in therapy for years but it never goes anywhere. I've dine research in my own and have decided that cognitive behavioral is beat for me but it always lacks. It goes in flows and in fact I was diagnosed with bipolar II two years ago. Everything is great in my life except I have no interests except work and school. I can't afford to spend more time going to school and I'm afraid additional work will be unhealthy. I have heard the mantras about finding a hobby, working out etc. I get it and agree but frankly have no energy to do much. I know I am in remission because I'd rather be asleep than awake. I am NOT suicidal I just like sleep more than activity if that makes sense. I'm not looking for sympathy but instead solid advice. There are a few more details I guess (we humans are so complex) but I think I gave enough--if not I'd be happy to clarify. Any and all feedback would be helpful at this point as my quality of life has dropped dramatically the last week or so. Thanks Reddit. You have at least kept me company.

Motion_ambient [info] Hating someone so much that I want to hurt myself. Hello. I realize this is an odd thought pattern/behavior, but I find myself struggling with it and was wondering if I was the only one. I was diagnosed with bipolar II last year. I have an ex friend who defended my abusive ex (that she knew I was sensitive about) which triggered PTSD flashbacks, which caused me to lash out. She then said that I was just looking for attention and that I was crazy. One day she consistently sent me text messages, taunting me. She continued doing this even when I told her to stop and that she was overwhelming me. I eventually had to block her. Basically, whenever I think about her and what she said to hurt me, I get so angry that I have the desire to inflict pain onto myself. Usually I scratch my arm as hard as I can, and I will sometimes make myself bleed. I’m not sure why this happens, but the anger and hatred for her that I feel inside are so overwhelming that I can’t seem to control it. Has anyone else dealt with similar thought patterns? Does anyone have any recommendations on what I can do to stop? [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1541572728
HeisenbergSpecial [info] One of the more valid reasons that I've heard from people who don't want to try drugs is that they don't want to lose control of their mental faculties.  Ironically, that's precisely the reason I started using drugs in the first place.

blackjustin [info] Feeling a bit lost. I'd like to share. I feel like I’m actually going crazy.    If it’s okay, I’d like to share and ask a couple of questions. I’m not looking to be diagnosed– I believe I may have aspergers and have an appointment set up, but my therapist is one of those “that isn’t what’s wrong with you!” type of people. I’d like to hear from others and maybe see if our experiences match up and get some evidence to present when we meet.    I’m a 34 year old male. At 15 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. Recently I was diagnosed with having ADHD, a memory/spatial problem, and a specific learning disorder (math). I think I may have been wrongly diagnosed. I’ve always had a bit of a social problem. Basically, I’ve always felt disconnected, or maybe alienated from other people. I don’t understand why people do the things that they do, and it’s been my lifelong mission to understand human behavior – which I still fail at. As I got older, this has only gotten worse. Sometimes when I speak, I feel like I speak in the most plain English possible, and I’m still not understood. Sometimes when I express intellectual ideas, it’s like me and the other person are talking about the same topic, but we aren’t talking about the same thing, if that makes sense?I was recently in a relationship that ended. I got broken up with. She said she felt an emotional disconnect, which really took me by surprise. I felt like I was doing everything right, but she said there were a few nights where she really felt like she needed emotional support, and I didn’t provide it. I missed this entirely. I don’t exactly operate like that; when a loved one has a problem, I fixate on trying to resolve the issue. Sometimes I feel like I understand feelings based only on an interpretation of that feeling. What I mean is – I think I may understand emotions based on what they look like, but not because I’ve ever truly felt them normally. A type of mimicry.  I’ve long realized I don’t experience emotions the way others do, and every time I meet someone I like, which is rare, that thought is only reinforced. It’s easy to say it’s others initially, but this has happened more than once. Pretty sure it’s a “me” thing at this point.       Other things I’ve noticed…I can only thrive with an incredibly rigid schedule. I’m at my best when my day is planned, almost down to the minute. Intense obsessions: I get obsessions with things until I know everything about them. This has included African Lions, snakes, MMA (spent seven years there), psychology and philosophy (which are both my majors). My current obsession is Nietzsche. I’ve been reading him for years, over and over. This also happens with TV shows – I have three TV shows that I watch over and over. Otherwise, not interested. Also, writing. It isn’t unusual for me to sit down and write a several thousand word essay in one sitting. If I don’t write, I get a panic attack. Sometimes I’ll even scrawl on the walls if there’s no alternative. Extreme social isolation without feeling lonely.Need for sameness: If something slight is different, it really, really throws me off. Last week someone switched seats in a classroom, and it really fucked me up. This type of thing has happened many times over my life. Overstimulation: I sometimes go to public events. When there is loud music, screaming children, painted faces = overstimulated, which usually expresses itself in hostility and the feeling of being trapped.  I also get overstimulated physically during intimacy with another person. Repeated movements: This used to be pacing for hours on end. But since I started taking Adderall, I’ve (mostly) stopped pacing and now I rub my fingers together almost non-stop. I’ve literally rubbed callouses onto most of my fingers. Is this what it’s like? I've never had anyone directly mention anything to me - but I also haven't known many people that deeply. I do have one or two professors who have noticed something is up - they occasionally send me random emails that more or less ask how I am - but otherwise, it's never been brought up.

PM_me_punanis [info] This is basically me except I have no affinity to certain noises, textures and smells. I thought I was just an angsty teenager. Or it was just a phase. Or just stress from school. At age 27, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I thought I was just depressed from the stress of medical school. But no. I graduated, moved to another country for a fresh start, got married, now a housewife that supposedly should have zero stress... And I still feel the highs and lows. I get anxious and can feel my heart rate going up in social situations. It is crazy and it's been getting worse. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have wasted the best years of my life in nursing school and medical school, aggravating my symptoms even further with so much physical and emotional stress. (We had 36 hour shifts for 2 yrs, no holidays, exams all the time, plus the fact that I see so much suffering every day, with the very real feeling that you have zero capacity to help someone because you aren't god.) Working in that field would kill me. Also, if I had known how much the medications would ruin my brain, I probably wouldn't have taken them. Yes, I stopped trying to kill myself after the 3rd time with the help of meds, but my entire life, I was the "smart one" and now my memory is shit.What am I if I wasn't the smart one? It's been a struggle but I shifted my focus on being the best wife. If my purpose in life is to support my husband, then that is what I am doing. I will always do my best in whatever I do, within the bounds of reason and within my limited capacity. I still feel so useless, from being so productive, I just spend my days doing housewife things.. But I'm proud to say I have made a bit of progress. [info] None [info] 1534593428
KnittedOwl [info] I'm a little younger than you but I've been dealing with mental illness since I was 9. My parents threw me into the psych department of my hospital for "anger issues" that no one could see. I was just a moody kid that didn't like talking to people. I never stopped seeing a therapist and psych. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder the day I turned 18. Now with a back story where parents seem to think something is wrong, you would think they are supportive of me having a diagnosis but having bipolar might as well have been a death sentence to them. They don't allow me to drink, though I'm 21. They don't allow me to be moody. I've learned to "fake it until I make it" until I reach my room where I lock my door and get to be however I want to be. I've given them the bipolar disorder survival guide book to read. I've had my psych write explanations to them on what I have.I think the biggest thing is that when they grew up, being bipolar was a bigger deal then it is now. People could be put in psych wards for a very long time just for the diagnosis. I have an aunt who was very helpful in explaining it to me. She said "If you had cancer you would get treatment for that right? Your head is just a little sick and it's something people don't understand and will want to say you don't have, just like cancer because it's scary, but that doesn't mean you don't have it. You just keep treating it, going to the doctors and doing what is best for you"In the long run I started ignoring most of what my parent's said that was discouraging including the most recent "you should come off your meds so you can be skinny again" and I'm doing really well.

I’ve had suicidal history because of it and it’s partly led me to make shitty choices which is why it pisses me off so much when people joke about this kind of shit [info] None [info] 1563321359
blackeyes1 [info] bad breath I remember smelling bad breath from somewhere it was just in the air but it was really starting to bother me. I even checked my own breath and I knew it wasn't me it was something else and it one of life's most annoying things to smell bad breath and embarrassing to have it. Talking to people or people talking to you with bad breath can be a very awkward situation. I could keep on smelling it though and I tried using air freshener and I even started to have mints and use more mouth wash on myself, just in case if it was me. It started to become really distracting and I always have been that sort of person to really zone in to small things like bad breath and dandruff and I don't know why but I have always been like that. I fell asleep on the couch one day and it was one of those power sleeps and you know where you find it difficult to wake up but you try your hardest but your eyes seem to keep shutting down. I remember trying to open my tired eyes and it kept on closing and when I peeked through my slow opening eye lids, I saw a ragged. sad and rough looking man opening his mouth and breathing on me and his breath was just terrible that it literally knocked me out. I experienced an out of body experience and I was floating in the air and then I went back into my body. I awoke straight away and what I had noticed was that I had some straw under my couch and I started to bend it little by little until I had a zig zag straw and straightened it and re did it. It was the weirdest reaction to a weird dream I had though to myself at the time, thinking it was a dream. I knew it wasn't my breath and I could smell it you know still in my memory and I could still feel the disgusting texture of the bad breath. I came home from work one late night and my wife was a sleep and my child was also a sleep and I found many zig zag straws  on the front room table. I knew it was me that had done this but I didn't have clear memory of it and I un-zig zagged the straws and kept on doing it. It helped with dealing with the bad breath and my morning started to become extremely hard to handle. I would awake half a sleep while seeing many ragged, rough looking, people in my room all breathing on me and all with terrible bad breath. It caused me such agony and my brain was in pain and my body was shaking and shivering. I would desperately go the bathroom sweating as if I had sprinted in a hot country and wash myself. It became so bad I peoples breath even if it wasn't bad breath I just hated being breathed upon. I would always find straws on the floor or settees and I knew i had left it there but the memory of the act. I started to find comfort in zig zagging straws and I even started to chew them as it helped with the stress. When I started playing with straws that I left on the floor it started to bring back memories of those people causing me pain with their bad breath. Then I started zig zagging another straw which I had done before and just left somewhere and it gave me a flash back of when again of me being a victim to their bad breath. I was forgetting when I was being attacked and these straws started to become my way out and dealing with it, but it made me forget some of the attacks that had happened to me in the past. I started to become delusional and I was diagnosed with bipolar and my wife was started to become irritated with my behavior.   Then the worst still had to come when my young son just a toddler, found one of my straws on the floor which had been zig zagged by me and he started to chew it. i found my toddler on the floor shaking and looking petrified. I chewed the same straw and It took me back to when I was being attacked by those disgusting looking people all breathing on me and causing immense misery and then my son appeared as he chewed that straw which had a connection to that moment. I saw my son smelling their horrendous bad breath and even though it was causing me physical/mental and spiritual dis balance, my son who is just a toddler started screaming and wailing in immense pain. My wife who by now becoming extremely worried and the both of us rushed our toddler to the hospital. He was fine later on the day and thank god he started to show healthy signs of health in all parts. I didn't tell anyone but I started to think about what was happening to me and the straws. I guess the straws were an accident a reaction I mean if it wasn't the straws it would have been something else. I don't know why I was the victim but I guess no victim knows why they are picked, its just simple luck and chance. My wife wanted to see her parents and she was taking our son with her and being alone in the house really didn't feel too good later on and I went out to the bars. I had a few drinks but I wasn't too drunk and I stayed at a bar just watching television and watching others becoming drunk. As I got home I saw my front door broken and I knew someone had broken into my house. As I went inside I saw a man on the floor and he was wearing what all house burglars wear and I saw a straw in his hand and I took it off him. It showed that he broke in and then he saw a straw on the floor not 1 but many and he found it strange and he touched one and it took him an event in my past where those things where breathing their breath on me and then I saw him appear. I called the ambulance and police and later on just like my toddler he was fine. I have had to adapt to alot things and I have not figured out a way out but I have decided to keep lots of straws in a secret cupboard and I keep a separate bin so that I can throw the straws in their. I sometimes sleep somewhere else but these things are part of my life now. Its like a disease I guess you have got to find a way to live with it and I study yoga and other meditative mind strengthening techniques. I have tried having bad breath myself to see if that helps but it did nothing except making other people awkward around me. [info] None [info] 1463735617

lotrfan12345 [info] Psychiatric prescriptions without therapy I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 almost two years ago and I've been unmedicated since then. I called a clinic to make an appointment because after doing some research I decided i'd like to try Lamictal. First off the waiting list was like two months long (wtf) and second they told me I'd have to sign up for therapy sessions in order to get prescribed anything. Is this common practice? I really don't want to get wrapped up in therapy. [info] None [info] 1384294495
syntheticgerbil [info] Luckily the calling work thing subsided after the first 3 years of the relationship, but it's like when I really started to think about her and BPD, that was one of the things I had read that stood out, since it was odd she used to be so clingy to that point. Also I didn't have a cell phone until 2008 I think. So now if there's some kind of cling or panic, it's just a lot of texts.I would like to get into therapy but I've been working contract stuff for the last three years and I'd either have to get third party healthcare or pay to be on my wife's plan. Both are not affordable for me by a long shot. I go to a psychiatrist because I was diagnosed with bipolar II back in 2011 so I do talk to him sometimes but it's not the same. I did do about 4 years of regular CBT therapy though from 2008 to 2012 so I still try to apply things like that I learned every day to keep the bipolar sadness at bay. They don't concern the mania part of Bipolar II so I just take a mood stabilizer every day that my psychiatrist seemed to figure out the perfect dosage for and I often just feel pretty content throughout my days.But yes, I hope to get into maybe DBT therapy myself if I can find a full time job with benefits. As it is right now, when I need healthcare stuff that isn't regular therapy, it's cheaper to just get the cash discounts and no insurance discounts as well pay the tax penalty.

InfiniteBlink [info] In there with ya.  I don't get the classic hangover with the physical debilitating body pain. Never get headaches or puke.  I feel like utter garbage though mentally.  I was diagnosed with bipolar about 19 years ago.  I took meds for a few months, felt great got my shit straight and started in my success path.Outwardly at 33 I've got everything you would associate with a successful life, career and possession wise. I have a huge social circle and do well with the ladies.Yet... There is a void I can't fill. I don't know what it is, but drinking and being social keeps me happy until the next day when I'm not.   Then I just repeat over and over.  My friends have no idea how I can rally night after night of going haaaaard.I'm thinking of going to see a psych again cuz my shit may be acting up again and I could be in a deflationary spiral and trying to use drugs and alcohol to give me the high I crave.Sorry for the rant, all these posts have me evaluating stuff.

Kighla [info] I wonder if he has some major self confidence issues, thus the need to "appear busy/useful".This reminds me so so much of myself about two years ago. I had just moved in with my boyfriend, was unaware of the fact I was bipolar, and started to get depressed.As I got depressed getting work done was harder for me. Everything seemed like a challenge and I started to realize I was getting nothing done. I'm also very ADHD and I tend to not notice very obvious things wrong (like doors falling off hinges) because I'm too focused on some small insignificant thing. Anyway, I got more and more depressed and was doing less and less work. Every day I felt like a bigger disappointment to my boyfriend. He would practically beg me to help but I would sulk and say I was too tired or it was too much. Any task he'd try to give me, I'd get an excuse not to. If he tried to give me ANY sort of criticism, even something small (like buying the wrong brand of whatever) I would get hyper defensive.The more and more depressed and lazy I got, the more and more self conscious and defensive I felt. I got it in my head that I was so fucking lazy and when he was home I tried to prove I was doing stuff, so I would do weird insignificant tasks loudly to be noticed. But I only did things I felt comfortable with, and neglected actual chores.Months passed by and our relationship got really fucked. He ended up losing it and we almost broke up. Luckily we both decided to do couples counseling and individual counseling and our relationship is very strong. Last year I was diagnosed with bipolar and started on medications that have helped me immensely. So perhaps it could end up being very positive for him too to go through the therapy to find out what's wrong. [info] None [info] 1478809577
seekingzen1 [info] Okay OP, you’ve been given some great advice here that mostly can be worked in after you have quieted your mind.  I’m an academic, PhD and bipolar.  I also am a bit older than a typical I went straight through from my undergrad to MA and then PhD.  Why?  I chose to get some life experience to work out what I wanted to do and then in my PhD, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had a 3 year pause before I finished.So I’m going to start in a different place. And please don’t answer these questions here.1.  Type of Bipolar 1 or 2.  If 1. Are you high functioning, medically compliant and able to function or are you struggling in any of these areas.  If you’re struggling in any of these areas, put education to the side.  Get treated, get functional, and maintain for a year before looking at school again.  Type 2, is it managed?2.  An associates is a respectable degree!  Can you do what you would like with it?3.  Is it your goal to finish undergrad or are you fulfilling a promise to your grandfather.  If you do this, you have to be in it for your own reasons...a degree has to be more important to you than it is to wanting to please someone else.  Your grandfather sounds amazing but is he accepting?4.  What type of support system do you have?  Are you accepted and supported?  If not, I would start looking for that support from other people and communities.  There is a great bipolar community here.OP, I think before you can find answers to these questions about school and work, you need to make mental health your first priority.  If it is great!  If it isn’t,  I can empathize bc making decisions when symptomatic is often impossible or unwise.  Can you talk to your grandfather?  Is he supportive?  And finally you have to establish a support system that you can rely on.  That knows you, supports you, guides you and keeps you compliant if needed.  I think if you address these things first, you will find there are interdisciplinary majors that would allow you to combine your interests.  Set some measurable goals and truly figure out is school is the best avenue at this time.  Once I stopped living by someone else’s definition of time, I made much more progress!Feel free to dm me!

MrPoppagergio [info] This is my first time writing in this sub. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 two and a half years ago. To answer your question, I have this same exact thing happen to me frequently. For me, it all started when my psychiatrist asked me the first time, "Have you had any homicidal or suicidal thoughts?" At that point I hadn't. After I left his office that day I began to contemplate what he said more on in depth. Now, sometimes I think about killing myself but I know deep down inside I don't want to. It's like it's just a sparked thought. I don't know why this happens and it sort of scares me at times. Reason being is that if I'm watching tv and it's a show about murder I sometimes picture myself (this is going up sound weird) killing a loved one of mine in a similar fashion. I am a little uncertain as to why this happens but I don't know what to do. I'm a little scared to talk to anyone about it because of fear of changing my meds and having to start over. I've been stable for the last two years and 5 months and I haven't had anything happen that makes me afraid for my life or anyone else's. I hope I answered your question and please feel free to discuss it more. I was overjoyed to see that this sub existed.  [info] None [info] 1392133817

ThorsPineal [info] Lithium Side Effect on Psychic Ability About three years ago, in my mid 30s, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD.In many cases, having extreme highs and lows has been a challenge. However, it has also allowed me to access areas of consciousness that most people I assume never do. One of which has been brief moments of psychic visions. Anyway, I've been off and on Depakote and continued to have interesting experiences with time manipulation and consciousness exploration. Recently, however,  I switched to lithium. Suddenly I feel "normal."  No more staying up for many hours contemplating the mysterious nature of consciousness and the universe. No more traveling into fascinating foreign dimensions within my mind. No more flashes of intense intuition. I am benefiting from the stable mood in some ways. I'm going to continue using it for now. I'm just a little disappointed about the loss of creativity. Anyone have advice or experience with this kind of thing? [info] None [info] 1519831846
fe_ursus [info] 27 female here too. Was tentatively diagnosed last December and put on cymbalta. My autoimmune tests and Lyme all came back normal/negative and MRI didn't show any damage to my joints. Cymbalta helped for a bit, but then I was diagnosed with bipolar after it put me in the hospital. Once I've been treated for the bipolar, a lot of the symptoms have lessened tremendously. I would recommend seeing a therapist, even if no mental illness is in your family. Fibromyalgia is so isolating bc it's so poorly understood and it takes a toll on you mentally as well. I'm so happy that you're getting relief with the new meds!! This group is fantastic and everyone is so accepting and understanding.Other things that have helped are yoga and low impact exercises. My husband got me an exercise bike and I've been able to regularly work out and my joint pain and back pain are getting better and I'm getting strength back. I also take CBD oil for pain and cramping (also have PCOS) and it's wonderful. There's no high, just relief.  [info] None [info] 1509804741

Mephistia [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teen, and always suspected I was misdiagnosed --- long story, family background and mom projecting her own illness and I actually have ADHD and whatnot -- but one of the key factors in my ultimate realization that I was in fact not bipolar was reading about how the disorder presents in children. Apparently bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are beginning to be viewed by some as less separate illnesses and more as the same illness on a spectrum of severity. Normally, these mental health disorders present in adulthood -- twenties, as our brains finish developing.Occasionally, they present much younger. I read a series of articles in the early aughts in Tme and Parenting and some medical journals about bipolar presentation in children, and they all basically said that kids who have bipolar will act out in extremely violent, self-harming,and repetitive ways. It's confusing to psychiatrists who are used to looking for "adult" markers of manic and depressive cycles, but the youth of the child means they lack the emotional maturity and structures of dealing with extremes in emotion, so they respond by becoming violent or dissociative. Also, hallucinations  (auditory, visual, and tactile) are normative symptoms in a bipolar manic state. So while its impossible for a layperson to diagnose over the internet, I would strongly suggest that you try to find a child psychiatrist who specializes in bipolar disorder to look him over, just in case. If nothing else, they might have suggestions or ideas for a direction in which to point you.  [info] None [info] 1452713879

stealthb0y [info] Bipolar 2 My mental health has been really bad lately and I just felt like venting a little about it and possibly getting to talk to others who experience similar problems. It helps not feelings alone with thisI'm diagnosed with bipolar 2, and my depressive swings outweigh my hypomanic ones by a ton. I can be feeling perfectly fine and something small will happen--or nothing at all!--and I fly into debilitating sadness and suicidal feelings and endless crying. Sometimes it lasts only a few hours but it can last for days at a time before I stabilize again, and I always feel so ridiculous for how I was acting when I was down. It feels like I become an entirely different person and I'm not in control of myself.I also can't help but feel bad for my friends when I'm hypomanic. I suddenly have energy, and I want to talk to them a ton and do things and I'm happy and social, just for it to inevitably go back down and I turn into a hermit for a period of time. Over the past week my friends have watched me go from crying for hours to cracking jokes and then back to silent sadness and so on and so forth. I can barely keep track of it, I can't imagine how it feels for them.I'm seeing a doctor and I'm on medication, which has helped, but I think what would really help right now is hearing from other people who can relate, so I appreciate anyone who reaches out. Thanks for reading and listening to me. I hope your day is well. [info] None [info] 1486922001
Randompasserby12 [info] While in an abusive relationship, I was diagnosed with bipolar (he told them my trauma based mood swings were bipolar disorder) and depacote made me suicidal. I didn't have the OCD diagnosis yet but it did nothing but make me a suicidal robot who felt numb to the trauma I was going through- it actually helped keep me in the relationship as well. They put me on lexapro to counteract the suicidal thoughts and the combo made me impulsively suicidal- it was the only time I actually attempted suicide.

brittymaa [info] Newly diagnosed Hey allSo a little back story here: I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar 1 for just about the last 5 years. When I was diagnosed with bipolar I was almost relieved because someone had finally put a name to what I was dealing with. My regular psychiatrist said I think about two months ago that he thinks I have borderline in addition to being bipolar. I was hospitalized for a week after being fired from my job and there they also said that they’re thinking I have borderline as well.After the first time being told this I was in denial.  The second time I threw a little fit.Since being out of the hospital I’ve been googling things like crazy and I’m starting to realize that I probably do have borderline personality disorder. I still don’t want to admit it though.But kind of replaying my life in my head the symptoms of this disorder are becoming more and more apparent to me. Sorry for the long rant, just wanted to get the thoughts out of my head. [info] None [info] 1540603624

persiancatlady [info] Separated and confused I (21F - diagnosed BP last month) have been separated from my husband (H) (29M) since December 2018. We were married for a year and it was constantly up and down. I knew he has Aspergers at the beginning of the relationship and I always thought that was the problem. (Though in actuality it is part of it). We had a lot of fights about lack of communication and I admittedly did a lot of complaining, pushing and crying. We attempted marriage counseling and it did not work for us. I became incredibly depressed and unable to do anything productive. H could not handle me as I would be calling him dozens of times all morning while he was at working absolutely freaking out and by night time I was up all night and unable to do anything around the house. At the time, I didn’t see any problem with how I behaved and thought he was the one ruining the marriage. It all came to a head in December and I had my first dose of mania. I was freaking out on him constantly when I found out H hired an attorney and was ready to file. He attempted to keep me out of our house so I did not take or destroy his property as he believed I was out of control. His parents got themselves involved - another story. Long story short, I had to break into my own home to get my toothbrush and clothing and I was completely moved four hours away within the same week. While what he did was also not right, I was not stable and I do recognize I was out of control at the time. I moved back home four hours away because I didn’t want anything to do with him and I filed to divorce before he got to it. He had me blocked and refused to speak to me. Long story short, I got myself into therapy and was quickly referred to a pdoc who put me on lamictal a month ago and I am now up to 100mg and much more stable. I’ve recognized a lot of where I went wrong. H called me in February stating that he still loved me and did not want a divorce. We have had multiple visits and each time has improved our relationship. I am continuing my medication and therapy. We have also discussed what happened in length, which is communication I never thought we would have. H has suggested plans for the future, for me to attend school in the state with him, for me to move back, and has even mentioned future children. During visits, everything is like way back when things were good. However, when I return home, he reverts back saying he doesn’t know what he wants and he is scared to try again. The ease he has to ignore me by phone causes me intense duress because my mind immediately jumps to the worst. I’ve expressed to H many times that I recognize how my bipolar impacted things. I do not take 100% of he blame. The main issue is that I am needing to know whether he is in or out because I need to make plans for my life going forward. Ultimately, I would love my marriage to work out but overall I just want to make the right choice so we are both happy. I am having a terrible time trying to be patient while he processes what he wants. I’m questioning if I am being impulsive or nagging him. I would like to hear from spouses of SO’s with bipolar. Do I need to give him more time? Am I being rational in thinking that you either want this or you don’t? From February 14th to now, is it unrealistic to expect some type of answer from him? TL;DR: Aspie husband and I had a rough first year of marriage. He hired attorney behind my back, I offered to leave then. Disagreements led to a nasty separation. Divorce has been filed and is pending. I was diagnosed with bipolar during this time and have sought treatment. Husband called out of the blue wanting to reconcile. Have attempted visits with success but husband is on the fence and will not provide a definite answer on if he wants to reconcile. His indecision is causing me intense pain and grief that I am unable to cope with. Should I give him more time to decide or learn to walk away? [info] None [info] 1556141292
rivanne [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar in January and dropped out of college. But I also have responded very well to treatment, (officially) moved in with my boyfriend and--best of all--got engaged! I'm going back to school in the fall and I'm probably about to get a job (unemployed for a year). The bipolar diagnosis has been an absolute blessing, and I'm finally starting to feel stable after years of struggling. I'm happier than I've ever been. I guess you could say 2015 is shaping up to be one of the best years of my life so far.  [info] None [info] 1432137397

lizcoco [info] I finally got a vape kit! Hey guys! Long time lurker!My SO finally got me a vape kit, including a bottle of 0mg eliquid and 100mg CBD oil. I've tried the CBD oil edibles from Green Roads. It was great! I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about five years ago and was on and off medication. It always sneaks up on me. But CBD gives me that calm I've always been looking for. Anyway, I now have [this kit](https://imgur.com/gallery/f7R0t) and I'm wondering what everyone's best suggestions and tips are. My SO vapes but not CBD. The guy at our shop said to mix regular eliquid with the CBD oil because it's so thick. But I forgot what ratios he suggested. I think roughly 80% eliquid/20% CBD?TLDR; I'm a complete n00b, pls help. How do I do the thing? [info] None [info] 1482685010

phatalphreak [info] 18 years ago when I was 15 I got tired of being bullied. So I took my dive knife to school, it was 12 inches long and looked scary as hell with a serrated back but was actually really dull. I was going to confront my bully and make him apologize. I was young and dumb and showed it off to some friends, one of them told on me and I was arrested. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and spent 2 years bouncing around between 9 psychiatric facilities and juvenile detention. I had a lot of adventures, lost my virginity, got into fights, tried all kinds of interesting drugs and picked up several fun hobbies. The one thing I remember most was at every facility the food was always really good. At one place we actually had a chef who was a graduate from the Cordon Bleue. If I have any advice to give it would be that the sooner you stop resiting the treatment, accept that you need help, and work with the counsellors, the better you will start to feel and the sooner you can get out and start living your life. This is the tl:dr of my story, if you feel like digging way down through my post history you will find a link to the full story or when I get home on my pc I might go look for it and edit it into this post.

uniquenamechosen-__- [info] What is a day lioe in the life of an experimental psychologist (and would you recommend it)? Hello all,I'm 24 and I've been jumping around between majors quite a bit lately, but the only thing that has stayed a constant interest is experimental psychology (correct me if I'm using this term wrong, I've only just started really looking into it). I've done what I can to avoid this field of study due to seemingly every person having a bachelors in this and never working in the field. From what I've gathered, it is a must to have a PhD, which is understandable.I like the research idea because I want to know what makes people tick, and I love figuring out why the brain does such weird things, but I'm not so good at connecting with others face to face. Honestly, I feel I'd be terrible in any therapy type position. Before, I was leaning more toward software engineering due to the enormous flexibility of the job after college and that seems amazing, but I find myself struggling to even want to go because I'm less passionate for the major than I had expected. I was in the military for a few years, so I have worked upward 90+ hours a week before, but I'm not necessarily looking forward to doing that permanently. And lastly, this ones a bit personal but I'm throwing it out there, I'm diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD. I know "technically" this wouldn't knock me out of a job, but sometimes I need some time to deal with the moods. Does anyone have experience with this illness in this field? Or by chance, know someone in a similar situation? Would you still recommend it from a practical standpoint (I'd really hate to go all the way to PhD and not be able to hold a job due to this illness..)?TLDR; What is your schedule like daily/weekly? Do you get vacation? Weekends? Is the work fulfilling? Can someone with their own mental problems go into this field and safely hold a job?Sorry it's so long and for any typos! This was typed on my phone. Thank you everyone for reading this!Edit: Aargh, the title got me!! [info] None [info] 1492914213

coleserra [info] I used to work with my Dad. One night I was having serious suicidal idealation to the point where I layed on some train tracks for a good 20 minutes. The next day I went to work and had I complete breakdown. I decided to talk to my Dad, had no one else to talk to at the time. I told him everything.His response?"Man the fuck up and keep that shit to yourself, you're a grown man, act like it."   I tried "manning up" for the majority of my adult life. You know what happened? I became a hardcore alchoholic who constantly wanted to kill myself or do something risky. Finally my Uncle and my ex convinced me to see a psych and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Even then, I didn't take my medication until a few months later because it made me feel so weak and I really did feel like less of a man. [info] None [info] 1565035905

WasARealBoy [info] I'm in the same boat. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since I was 17 and I think that goes a long way in "feeling" some of things that go on in the game. Your analogy toward uncomfortable therapy sessions is pretty spot on - that feeling of facing something you've been avoiding so that you can work yourself through it. It's definitely why I naturally gravitate towards things like LiS.&gt; Whether that's healthy or not is subjective I guessYeah, that's the tricky part. To the extent I've seen in some places, I really don't think it is. But I mean, I know that *I* do a ton of unhealthy things to cope, so I don't have a leg to stand on. I guess it's just a "do as I say, not as I do" thing. I just get worried about people.  [info] None [info] 1469960757
ObsessedAloof [info] My experiences with bipolar and harm ocd So it's my first post here, kind of forcing myself to write something after lurking for a long time. This is just what I have been going through for a long time, and I'm hoping that others can relate.So I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years ago, and ocd within the past year or two, specifically harm ocd. My doctor has been a great help and the medicine has worked wonders. Currently on Lamictal and most recently Latuda. Anyway, the weird thing that started happening this past year is, without realizing it, I was starting to experience the symptoms of bipolar psychosis. I began hearing a voice in my head related to the ocd telling me to hurt those around me, telling me I'd become powerful or godlike or whatever weird bs is associated with a voce in your head. However, instead of being repulsed by it like other ocd sufferers are, I would instead be elated and excited by it. I came to realize later that it's because I was feeling manic, so of course my emotions toward it were warped. I started feeling paranoid, having delusions and dissociating with reality, not feeling like anything was real. It finally came to a head a few months ago, where it caused me to lose my job. I was at work and had been feeling paranoid and delusional, and that was where the psychosis really hit me. I don't remember much of what happened, but the fight-or-flight, kill or be killed instinct kicked in to high gear, and I barely remember just walking out. At this point I had actually started identifying with these feelings and feeling like it was just who I am. I didn't like the feelings per se, but I started wondering if this was real or something instead of just delusions. I was even listening to music on repeat that exacerbated the feelings, a lot of heavy metal but in particular [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGwmkghsFz4), as it described perfectly how I felt. Needless to say, it didn't help.Anyway, I told my doctor and he put me on Latuda. I was very resistant toward taking it as it felt like I was killing a part of myself that I'd identified with for so long. For a couple of months I was in psychosis off and on as I refused to take the medicine. It wasn't until I pulled a knife on my roommate during a minor argument that I realized how bad it was. Nobody was hurt, and I was suddenly very aware of what was really happening.I started taking the medicine finally, still not happy about it but forcing myself. Over time the voice has gone away, I'm feeling more grounded in reality, and I'm not paranoid or as anxious. I'm in a new state to be with family now, and I've found some bipolar support groups near me that I'm going to start going to. A previous employer and friend of mine instilled a "get in the solution" mentality in me, and that's what I've been reminding myself every day. My family is very supportive too, as I've told them most of what happened. I'm not sure if others can relate to the whole story, but if any parts sound familiar it would be good to be reminded that I'm not the only one who's dealt with psychosis or anything else, and I'm just glad that I found this subreddit.

WHAT-WOULD-HITLER-DO [info] The worst part is that the more religious a theocratic politician is, the more sociopathic and callous their political ideology tends to be. Christian voters here are mobilized for the most fucked up things, like oppressing their LGBT brothers and sisters or making sure fellow Americans can't have feasible access to basic healthcare. Obamacare saved my life shortly after the age I can stay on my mom's plan was extended. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of trying to manage symptoms with alcohol and xanax because insurance companies usually didn't cover mental health services (which cost hundreds of dollars a visit for psychiatrists, at least $100 for the cheapest therapists who usually are just starting out and haven't established themselves yet). Plus I was just about to get kicked off because of the age cutoff, so other basic chronic health issues would have become a major financial strain. These bible thumping fuckers think what jesus would do (WWJD is a common thing on bracelets and whatnot) is tell me to pray about it and if my prayers aren't answered it's because I lack faith/am a sinner. So yeah in my mind the opposite is to distort/white wash/historically revise the polar opposite (Hitler vs Jesus) and pretend that Hitler was the altruistic and deeply empathetic leader who tried to bring about positive social change. Don't intend for it to be trolly in the sense of being online and starting arguments for dumb shit, but I can see why it comes off that way. I like comedy and I like to laugh at dark shit. My family came as refugees from antisemitism to the US when the USSR collapsed in 1993. I think the cure to all social fuckery is to laugh at how absurd it all is. Take the seriousness out of it, take away the power of words and references that are painful and destructive (and at times, genocidal/institutionally oppressive). As a female I love gender/sexist jokes and being in an interracial relationship my bf and I love racial humior. Rather than being angry at racism or sexism, we can destroy the power it has through laughter. Fresh Prince of Bellaire, Eddy Murphy movies, and comics who made it ok to laugh at race in the 90s really did have a major impact on white people who otherwise had a lot of shitty opinions on black people. I saw it in my parents and friend's parents growing up. Even seemingly "racist" jokes, when executed masterfully by great comedians and in epic movies/sitcoms, I think all contributed to easing how seriously people took themselves and their hatred towards others by forcing them to laugh against their will. Sure some jokes are a net negative, but those need to be able to exist too if we want the more fun stuff to be allowed to flourish. Like how Megan Kelly and others get fired for offending people, congrats, now you taught racists to just keep their shitty opinions private so that, as the late great Patrice O'neal pointed out repeatedly, he has no way of knowing who's racist. Which means he can't talk to them honestly and maybe change their minds. He "never met a racist", so he knew people existed who *thought* "nigger", but had no way of knowing if the person being polite to him hated him deep inside or was genuinely a nice person. On the other hand if we didn't try to censor people and let them be honest, we can laugh at the shitty things they say and take that power away genuinely vs just pretending it doesn't exist (which is does, but people learn to keep it covert, so you seem ridiculous for insisting it's real). To me, Hitler jokes do the same thing. Better to laugh at the insanity than to get outraged and radicalize people by fighting shittiness with shittiness. [info] None [info] 1555948184
katsudoom [info] Migraine free due to... therapy? Hello, everyone. I used to post here a lot with an old account but ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I decided to make a new one and focused on this new issue instead of my old friend migraine.I have migraines since 7 years old, my worst times were when I was a teenager because I did poorly in school due the lack of presence in class. Together with mood changes I always had migraines tagging along, so there was always a excuse to left jobs and miss compromises.Now I'm 26, I was having a terrible year full of migraines and mood swings and after a episode I committed to therapy like never before. Got my right diagnosis and things have been very good if you ask me about migraines. I knew I was a stressed person but I never thought therapy would help that much.Of course, I'm still on medication. I was taking topamax and I'm still on it, now together with Depakote. I don't know if mixing them is also a positive thing.All that I know is: since December I haven't been in pain. To be totally honest, i ate chocolate the other day and felt a pseudo migraine but it went away with a cup of coffee and a triptan pill.So I was thinking, how many of you can benefit from therapy too, right? If you feel stressed, depressed and fed up because of anything and can make a way to find professional help, why not trying?I don't know maybe I'm being too positive but maybe someone is also like I was and never thought that talking to a therapist can help. Truth is.. Some of us need it. [info] None [info] 1491942641

jillerski [info] Recognize that speaking in absolutes always places you into an antagonized perception of yourself. Don't feel that you're dumb for doing so because I still struggle with that tendency myself. I would advise you to take a moment and acknowledge your feelings and break them down to their root causes. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder several years ago and there's times where I simply have to acknowledge that the root of my depressive episodes were simply biological. But I also recognized that I do have control of how I react to it. Instead of writing off my life as a permanent and hopeless end, I acknowledged that yes I am experiencing a bad cycle (term used for long depressive episodes) and I also acknowledged that this cycle was temporary and that really was key in helping me cope. When you're in the desert dehydrated, a simple drop of water feels better than nothing. Keep at it and don't speak in absolutes. Always address your feelings in the present tense but never as your absolute outcome.  [info] None [info] 1548721029

TheSausageTurd [info] I agree to a point. I use it both recreationally and medically. I was diagnosed with bipolar 5-6 years back. They put me on a concoction of medications saying it would help. These included but not limited to prozac, lithium, and Xanax (not all at one time but when one didn't work they would give me another one). Most of the medications did get rid of the extreme mood swings but completely took away my personality. I started smoking weed over a year ago and I will never go back on prescription mood stabilizers. While weed does has it's downsides including not being able to drive or work it allows me to be myself and keeps me in a good mood for the entire day. I've tried CBD gummies and whatnot but they don't seem to have the same effect for me. It could be placebo but whatever it is weed truly is a hell of a medication but it should be used responsibly.

Trillibub [info] I'm not attacking you, but you sure went all-out defensive.  Many bipolar people experience exactly what you listed, and those things are not generally considered functional. If you meant to say that they're functional with medication, you should realize how different that is and possibly correct it. Since you want to puff chests and bring it up, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for almost three years. I've been hospitalized and gone to support groups where I've met many like me. It's been hell, and I'm often only functional *with the right cocktail of meds.* As are many who are diagnosed. It's not some mentality or way of thinking; if the whole world was as depressed as some of us have been, there'd be far fewer people alive today. Thanks. [info] None [info] 1461708646

frangipani_c [info] I'm 02/08/1981 (2nd August 1981).Completing my specialisation as an anaesthetist in Australia.  I love my job and feel blessed to be able to make a living doing something I love.Undergraduate Medical Science (Honours) degree and then my MBBS.Have had my first dog (as an adult) for nearly a year now.  He is a 2yr old staffy kelpie cross who I rescued from a shelter.  I'm so happy to have him in my life :) .I live on the opposite side of the country to my family.  I moved here with my ex and I haven't left.  Been here for 10yrs now.  I miss my family very much but we also have our issues, so sometimes the distance is good.  I speak to my mum nearly every day.  I have a strained relationship with my older sister that improved somewhat when she had my niece.  I adore my niece and am sad that I am not a part of her day-to-day life.  I have a younger brother who I speak to maybe once a week or fortnight, but when we talk, we really talk.  We understand each other very well.I am in a fairly new relationship (less than a year) with a lovely guy who really loves me and I think I am falling for him.  My main hang up is that I am still in love with my first love.  We were together from the age of 18 to 29.  We were each other's first relationship.  We were engaged to be married and inseparable.  Then I had a depressive mental breakdown in my final year of med school and became extremely self destructive.  Excessive drinking lead to black out drunk episodes which lead to an infidelity at a med school party whilst my partner was away with work.  Whilst drunk, someone I thought was my friend (who was 'looking after me whilst drunk') kissed me and I initially kissed him back.  I ended up pushing the 'friend' away once I realised what was happening and drove home drunk.  I confessed to my partner and after a time, he forgave me.  However, my self destruction just got worse as I then started to doubt that I truly loved my partner if I had put myself in a position where I was unfaithful.  Yet, I did love him, but I couldn't resolve the internal conflict of what I had done ... so I somehow convinced myself that I didn't do anything wrong.  This then led to a spiral of deceit and further infidelity, and eventually to the loss of my partner, loss of my reputation, and loss of many friends.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my manic episodes coincided with my infidelities.  I truly had no insight at the time that what I was doing was wrong.  I had days where I would barely sleep or eat but I felt incredibly energetic and daring.  I drank excessively during those episodes and didn't care what I did or who I did it with - I honestly thought I could do no wrong.  Those few months altered the course of my life catastrophically.  I managed to complete med school and have since created a new life for myself, but I now have very few friends and I'm scared to get close to people for fear of losing them.  The loss of my ex and of so many mutual friends devastated me and I just don't have the strength to go through anything like that again. I have travelled all around Australia quite a few times and have travelled overseas to New Zealand, Indonesia, Thailand, Eastern Europe, Switzerland, Spain and London.  I'm hoping to travel much more.I don't have any kids and due to the demands of my career, my creeping age, and my history of mental health disorder, I'm not sure whether I will and/or want to have children.  Being a doctor just makes me even more aware of the risks of my advancing age and of the risks of a relapse of my bipolar.  Overall I have a pretty great life.  Yet losing myself and therefore my ex will always be my life's biggest regret.  I am now a strong advocate of seeking help for mental health problems early and not buying into fear and stigma that stopping me reaching for help when I first needed it.

I’m just saying that I felt like taking medicine or trying to find medicine that will “fix” me was like .. someone else doing my homework. Sure, it gets done, but now the whole point of it is moot because I didn’t learn anything, or grow as a person. I’m spiritual which has a lot to do with it, but I chose to give up the shortcuts and work very very hard to have my moods be self manageable. And it worked! I’m more content than I’ve ever been and I know how to let my low moods come and go without attaching to them. I made this decision right after seeing a video of middle aged woman whose organs were failing after having been in lithium for so long. If medicine were the solution to my problem, it wouldn’t create more problems. I’m glad that I was confident enough in myself to go against the advice of my doctors... who never even had a chance to know what I was capable of without them. [info] None [info] 1536765109

Ihatethatrabbit [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II, given four different meds. Started them the morning after I picked up prescriptions. An hour after I took them, I felt a *POP* inside my head, the right side. Then it felt like....trickling going down my head, my skull. I thought I just had a brain anurysm. I was home alone and called my sister and talked for awhile so I wouldn't die alone. Obviously I survived. When I called my doctor to tell her, she was clueless as to what happened. Crazy. I hate prescription medication.  [info] None [info] 1455777020
shmeeks [info] Insight/advice about transferring credit card balances Hi friends! So most of our debt is from credit cards.  I have student loans, but my husband doesn't have any so that's a plus.  I accrued the credit card debt because I was very young and misdiagnosed with the wrong mental illness and spent way beyond my means.  About three years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and on the right meds and I am very stable now with my spending under much better control.Anyway, we have a better handle on money and we are slowly chipping away at what's now our debt.  Someone at work told me about transferring credit card balances to a new credit card that has 0% interest upon opening, that way you are paying off principal as opposed to paying off principal plus interest.  Then once your 0% interest period is over you do the whole process over again with a new credit card.  Also, you then have a credit card that is now "paid off" so to speak, that is open to any emergencies.  To me this sounds like a good idea, as we currently do not have an emergency credit card, which I believe we should as we have 3 dogs, two of which are older and health issues are more at risk.  Also, I feel like the transferred balance would be paid off faster.Haven't researched this as much and haven't really found the pros and cons about doing this so that's why I'm reaching out on here--to hear from anyone who's done this successfully.  Does this affect your credit much?  I feel like opening so many credit cards would negatively affect your credit, but I don't know.  I appreciate anything anyone has to offer on this subject! Thanks in advance! [info] None [info] 1572307128

wannabeomniglot [info] Between my first read and my first reread, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.My entire perspective has really changed - Cersei, whom I hated, I now feel an odd kinship with. I see her arc as less ruthless and more tragic; in her I see a woman helpless against her own delusions, at the whim of her uncontrollable lust for vengeance and power and love.Arya, whom I loved unconditionally (and still do), I now see as much more pathological. I feel like in order to deal with the trauma she has endured, she has decided to be perpetually in motion, and I'm very concerned about what will happen when she stops moving forward.Depression, which is half of what I struggle with, is occasionally described as a grieving disorder. With that in mind, I have come to connect with Robert Baratheon, whom I saw as a philandering asshole completely out of touch with the reality of governance and an entirely self-centered worldview. I now see him as somewhat powerless in the only ways that matter. I am much more sympathetic to his perpetual grief now than I was before.This was probably quite influenced by the show, but I went from loving Petyr Baelish as a crafty mastermind, to being really disgusted as I watch him take advantage of the weak and the principled.

The only times in my life I've been seriously happy were when I was 5 years old playing nintendo, when I was 13 smoking marijuana, when I was 17 when my ex was in love with me. I'm just literally always on the edge of having a mental breakdown and I have one every day. I have no friends and I talk to no one. My family always brushes me off and I just feel like I'm crazy and I need my ex back in my life, for him to call me and talk/laugh with me. I'm currently in college and for 10 hours a day I have intrusive thoughts like "I don't matter, college doesn't matter, no one will ever love me" and further on. I just lie in bed crying and feeling like I'm paralyzed, like I cannot do anything to fix anything. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I don't believe I have bipolar, I actually think I probably have borderline personality disorder like my mom. Whatever you can label my problems, I really just have no control over my emotions and I'm a very emotional mess with bad mood swings. I just wanna be happy alone, I just wanna feel calm, I just want to be normal.&amp;#x200B;What Can I do? Does anyone relate? Any advice please.Edit: also a major thing for me is feeling like I absolutely cannot picture my future self. I can't picture myself having any type of career.

405sucks [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2012 and I’ve been through many unstable relationships that included self harm, abuse, suicide attempts, manic spending / infidelity, the list of shitty things I’ve done to my partners because of my bipolar goes on.  Only after going on Lamictal in late 2016 did my relationships begin to show improvements/stability.  However, I did date a girl with BPD (borderline personality disorder) and I gotta tell you that BPD puts bipolar in its rear-view mirror.  If you think this sub is depressing, head on to /r/bpdlovedones and check it out.  At least as a bipolar patient, you’re still manageable under medication. You can (to some extent) recognize your symptoms or episodes by monitoring your sleep or your spending habits, sex drive, etc.Bipolar disorder is a manageable mental disability compared to what’s out there, so don’t give yourself a hard time. That being said, it’s still a disorder which brings instability. My advice is to respect the boundaries your SO sets for you. Take your meds, sleep well and you’ll be better than 90% of bipolar patients out there.  [info] None [info] 1549772113

DexterMorgan67 [info] As a teen, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but we kind of chalked it up to hormones and I was mostly fine. I know some of my behaviors are reflective of the disorder though, but the last time I was on medication I grew lethargic, gained over 100 lbs, and did actually try to commit suicide. However, that was over 10 years ago, and in my early teen's (14-15). I probably should work on seeing a therapist, but I'm taking 14 credit hours, work ~50 hours/week, and work out five times/week.

BabyGirlR [info] (23/F) 3-4 severe mystery headaches a day. INFO: 23, Female, 235LB, 5'4. Caucasian. Diagnosed bipolar disorder I, PTSD, only allergy is nickle, suspected gluten-sensitivity. TMJ. PCOS.Medications: Lithium 300mg, Latuda 40mg, Lamictal 200mg, Gabapentin 600Mg all at night and Ativan .5MG as needed. Heavy ibuprofen usage.  Melatonin before bed.Other; Nexplanon birth control implant. I drink roughly 250-600MG of caffeine a day in the form of energy drinks.I started getting headaches back in late September and taking ibuprofen to help get rid of the pain. It would always work. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD so I am on a *lot* of medication to help manage those symptoms.  The headaches started at once or twice a week and progressively got worse. The last two months have been terrible as they've not only shifted from happening every day to multiple times a day. One a scale from 1-10, they average about a 4 but grow quickly if I do not take something for them. They almost always come back in a few hours and have become more resistant to ibuprofen. They are entirely resistant to Tylenol.  Sometimes I have to take 1600 (800, wait an hour. 800 again) to make them go away and that doesn't always work.  They mostly happen while I am up and moving around at work or in public.I drink a lot of water. I have a healthy diet. I am unable to exercise right now as activity seems to trigger them or make them worse. Sunlight and bright lights tend to trigger them. Yesterday I drove against the sun and ended up sobbing in my car because a 3.5 headaches turned into an 8. I couldn't drive and I was VERY nauseous.   Stress triggers them. Eating anything like bread or pasta, or even eating the meat off a sandwich triggers them. Caffeine helps but only for a little while. I have tried hot packs and cold packs, both have mixed results but cold seems more successful. I have tried antibiotics, sinus rinses, and decongestant medication with very little change. I HAVE gone to my doctor about this and she was completely baffled by the headaches and told me to just keep taking ibuprofen and watch what I ate. She must've asked me 50 questions and told me she wasn't sure what was triggering them but because of my medication, she couldn't give me anything. I asked if it was safe for me to take ibuprofen at this rate and she said it was fine as long as I ate when I took them. I'm taking 4 200mg tablets a time at least three-five times a day. She tested me for allergies and nothing came up food wise, but she said gluten might trigger them. I agree with that statement since I've tested eating pasta and some bread and gotten a NASTY headache every time. She doesn't think it's a brain tumor or anything like that.   She ran a lot of blood tests (like, 25 vials worth of blood) and didn't find anything that was off aside from having low estrogen and confirmed I'm healthy. The headaches almost always come with nausea. They feel like they're mostly in my upper forehead and the top of my head. I have a lot of problems sleeping as well. I wake up a minimum of three times a night and have been doing that *every* night for months. I practice healthy sleeping habits and even take melatonin to help me sleep but I still wake up. I'm at a loss of what to do, I even got new glasses thinking that the headaches might be triggered by that.  I had Nexplanon put in early February and while they definitely got worse after that, I was still having them before that.  I'm not sure what to do but living like this is inhumane and makes it impossible for me to function. Any advice is appreciated. Where do I go from here? [info] None [info] 1583507649

alliengineer [info] I am also a victim of CSA. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was a teenager and struggling to cope with what happened to me. I was put on medication for 11 years. As an adult I started to go to therapy and I realized I did not have bipolar disorder. The medication was simply keeping my feelings under control and it was unhealthy for me. It took me a very long time to wean off the medicine in a healthy way because my body was addicted and I realize my brain and body will have lasting effects from taking the medication while I was developing. As an adult and not on medication (after about 4 years of therapy) I think my brain has healed quite a bit. I still suffer highs and lows but I feel much more normal now, and I continue to go to therapy when I need it. I don't know if you have bipolar disorder or not but I am telling you that you are not alone, and to really give therapy a shot with a psychologist. My mom had originally sent me to a psychiatrist and all he did was diagnose me and prescribe medication without actually helping.  Take care.  &amp;#x200B; [info] None [info] 1539018865

DearyDairy [info] Likewise in Australia,  once you have a diagnosis a lot of specialists and treatment services are free or heavily subsidised,  but if you're over 18 the process required to get a diagnosis can be expensive,  if your GP doesn't think you're mentally unwell then you can't access subsidised psychology. When I was a teenager I had a diagnosis from my psychologist,  bipolar psychosis.  My mother and I believed thus was incorrect,  and that I actually had PMDD,  it took many years and a few thousand dollars from our wallet to see the specialists needed to make that diagnosis,  in the meantime most experts agreed with the bipolar diagnosis and reassured us that the reason I wasn't getting better with bipolar treatments was because bipolar is very hard to manage. When I found a psychiatrist and endocrinologist who believed it was PMDD and got me started on HRT,  all of my symptoms resolved within a week. Completely. During the year when I was diagnosed with bipolar but chasing a PMDD diagnosis,  I won't lie,  I told people I had PMDD even though at that point it was a self diagnosis. The fact is that my self diagnosis was later supported by specialists and getting it looked at professionally allowed me access to effective treatment so it could stop disabling me and ruining my life. Taking my suspicions from self diagnosed from actual diagnosis was the only option for me in terms of living my life properly. Yes,  getting the right professional care is difficult for a lot of people,  access is difficult because the nature of the disease prevents normal social ventures like going out and getting help. But you can't claim that you suffer if you're openly choosing to remain self diagnosed and not looking into how to get a clinical diagnosis. In Australia headspace can consult you via Skype, cam, talk or text. You can talk to a therapist while taking a shit!Our system is not ideal,  people slip though and get missed all the time.  It's mostly because their illness is such that they don't want care or require so much care that short of a full time personal mental health nurse,  they will just bounce around in the system or fall out of the system completely.  I see it a lot,  but these people who fall through are not the same people as the timblrinas who complain.  [info] None [info] 1457415014

Horrible coincidence, but all the docs said it was NOT caused by the weed-one even said it might have HELPED it! I had had a depressive episode in the past as well, so I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1(long story short).

Medical bills are expensive.Then they drove me two hours away in handcuffs after i said i would comply with everything, had me involuntarily committed to a mental ward even though I did everything i was asked, meaning i would need a doctors note to leave instead of being able to check myself out after 72 hours.I was malnourished and didn't eat a vegetable for two days because they messed up my order.

BaltsDeep [info] This is actually the reason I smoke.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 7 years old, and spent the years from 7-23 heavily medicated.  In the process I became hypothyroid, went from slim and on a swim team to a morbidly obese compulsive eater whose metabolism was basically switched off by anti-depressants.  When I was 14 I decided that I wanted to have such a level of self-control that I could stop myself from going into a manic rage.  Didn't start smoking until I was 21, and I instantly found that it was a substitute for just about every medication I was on.  Feeling stressed/manic?  Take a puff and level out.  Feeling depressed/anxious?  Take a puff and level out.  At 23 I stopped the last of my medication cold turkey, a mood stabillizer.  And at the time I wasn't really smoking much because I had become a dad and didn't want to smoke around my child.  But I found very quickly that moderation is key.  A quick puff before I go into work makes my fuse 30x longer.  A bowl after a hard day when I'm feeling depressed helps me see the light that paints my life, not just the darkness.  And aside from the ever-looming possibility of a random drug test at work, there are no side-effects that cause it to even come close to what those prescription pills did to me.  I'm healthier than I've ever been, weigh what I did as a fat 8th grader, and love my life.  Big pharma be damned, this herb is a lifesaver! [info] None [info] 1483649849
Zero132132 [info] Not the same disease, but I had a similar experience when I was a young'un. I was diagnosed with bipolar at a very young age, and during manic episodes, I often would be awake for days at a time. My manic phases often COULD include a violent component if I got a bit too excited. They put me on lithium when I was still in middle school. The lethal dose and the effective dose are close enough that they had to run blood tests pretty often to make sure I was taking the right amount. The lithium itself made me feel like absolute shit, and drained me of all energy. Everyone else seemed to think that was a good thing.Not the same, obviously, but excluding the surgeries to remove necrotic tissue, I see the outline of a familiar experience that not many others understand.

cigsxcoffee [info] Does obsession have something to do with my bipolar 2 disorder? I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last November. I'm not taking meds for it, because the psychiatrists wanted to confine me in a hospital. I didn't think my mental health was that bad, so I refused to be confined, and that meant she wouldn't give me the meds.Fast forward to now, community quarantine. I am working from home but I still got plenty time on my hands. I've been watching the series Feel Good on Netflix, and I developed an intense obsession with the lead actor, Mae Martin. So intense that I would send her messages every day on all her social media accounts. I tweet her and when she likes my tweets, I'm on a good mood all day, but when she doesn't, I'm on awfully bad mood. She turned off her DMs just now so I can't send her messages anymore, and that really devastated me.I actually have a real life girlfriend and I don't think my obsession with Mae Martin is ruining my real life relationship. I just don't like this feeling of being intensely heartbroken for someone who doesn't even know me, and someone who will surely never get to meet me. It's affecting my focus already, and I feel like I'm trying to compensate it by messaging my girlfriend more than usual.What's happening? Is the quarantine doing this to me?

After trying a variety of antidepressants the doctor prescribed Wellbutrin.I have been very happy with Wellbutrin thus far. I have however noticed my tinnitus is rapidly getting worse. Both a [Google search] (http://www.google.com/search?q=Tinnitus+Wellbutrin) and cursitory browse of r/tinnitus suggest there is some anecdotal evidence the drug can be in some instances be ototoxic. Obviously, if true, this is a concern.I am desperate to get my life back but aggravating my tinnitus (or  trashing my hearing) would be an extremely steep sacrifice — even at current levels the ringing is  virtually unbearable Another option, iis to find a medication that protects hearing — does such a medication or supplement exist? if anyone has information on non-ototoxic antidepressants that would also be of help.I am in New Zealand so trying to find more exotic antidepressants is difficult. Obviously I will consult with my doctor but any suggestions, words of advice would be appreciated. Edit: Heading off to bed now. Will reply to any responses tomorrow. [info] None [info] 1503488124
ShortFantasyChick [info] Complete loss of motivation, help? I've been severely depressed for nearly 2 years now, but in the last 2 months I've completely lost the last shreds of any motivation. Now I can't even bring myself to cook, clean, do work or even take my medication--even though I know it puts me at a very real risk of another heart attack &amp; death. I was diagnosed with bipolar I at 14, but I've never had a depressive stint last so long, &amp; affect me so much. I haven't been out of bed for more than a few hours collectively in the last 3 weeks &amp; my family is threatening to hospitalize me if I can't pull me self together to ensure I at least eat daily (not anorexic, just no will to make any food). I'm on abilify, klonopin, &amp; stallera for this problem but they seem to have lost their mojo--which leaves me on shaky ground as this combo was already my last resort--everything else seems to have a history of dangerous drug interactions with my meds for my RA.  So my question comes down to how do you guys find lost motivation? Alternative meds etc? I tried going on a very strict schedual, which worked for a while, but can't even care about keeping that. I'm honestly desperate at this point. I used to be able to count on my manic cycles boosting my productivity but that's clearly not an option to wait for anymore, and my highs now only last for a few days at most. Please help. Any advice on methods for boosting motivation while this depressed is much appreciated.I [info] None [info] 1416475029

justforyou87 [info] So irritated  I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 a few weeks ago from a questionnaire and some long test by a neuropsychologist. well I went to a psychiatrist today and because I'm not completely irrational he believes I don't have bipolar. so whatever. but he's still having me start lithium. if he doesn't think I have it, why the hell is he putting me on something that obviously has really horrible side effects? and originally, I went in to get tested for adhd, which turns out I do have. however, I'm not allowed adderall because it will trip the bipolar that I may or may not have. I'm so fucking sick and tired of doctors. I don't have time to make my body a drug disposal for shit I don't need.  I'm just trying to get through college, but all I want to do is crawl  into a fucking hole and die now.  Edit: Thank you for all of the responses. I was about to rip my hair out earlier, but I feel so much better now.

Joakur [info] Help!? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by my doctor about a year ago. I always felt like something was wrong and that I was socially inadequate. I don’t take any medications because I can’t afford them. I used to use substances in ways to kinda calm the storm but I’m trying to achieve complete sobriety. I find myself never being able to sleep, Loosing my appetite, stressing about everything, getting angry at everything, and just dreading every meaningless task. I feel like my life has unhinged and I’m not in control anymore. Is there any advice that anyone has on how they “cope” or “manage” throughout the day because I feel like I’ve tried everything and I’m running out of options. [info] None [info] 1532614760
prefontaine250 [info] What should the role of drugs be in our life? I feel incredibly conflicted.Almost a year ago (last winter) I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital after being held on a 5150. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and they told me if I ever drank or did drugs I'd end up back in the psych ward.Many doctors I met (particularly the female ones, I don't know why) spoke to me in a condescending tone, as if I was subhuman and bound to mental illness. When I was released from the hospital they drugged me with  high doses Zyprexa and Lithium. Taking the meds made me drowsy all the time, I lost my sex drive and endangered my relationship. The anti-bipolar meds were ruining my grades and my life. So I decided to stop taking them. No issues. Things actually got better. I switched to a much cooler psychiatrist. He said it was ok if I drink alcohol but I should avoid marijuana. He also thinks I have ADHD (he emphasized nothing can be known for certain in psychiatry) and gave me adderall which helps me study. I am thankful for that. The only problem is that I feel incredibly depressed. Weed was the thing that made me more relaxed and allowed me to enjoy life.So I don't know where to find a balance.  So much conflicting information that I don't think can be answered rationally or scientifically. Any thoughts? [info] None [info] 1411936085

Sometimes I feel hopeless. But it gets better. If I were you, I would talk to my doctor and check in, let him/her know how I'm feeling. You feel like a failure? You are anything but a failure.

I like that I don't have to interact with a lot of people and have no responsibility or anyone counting on me (I hate letting people down and them getting angry with me), and if I coud, I'd love to be a neet forever. The other side of me is saying that I can't maintain thid lifestyle forever. One day my parents will get tired of me. They probably won't throw me out since I'm a girl, but hey, my dad threatened to do so once years ago. And when my parents finally die, then what will I do? They're already old with tons of health problems. And society expects people to be independent and contribute. I feel peer pressured to get a job, so to speak. Even though I don't want one people try to force work on you and look down on you when you don't have a job. Used to play games and wanted to be a designer my whole life, but earlier this year I lost my love for games, and am disappointed with the current state of the industry. It's mostly that I don't enjoy programming and am not an artist so there's nothing I can contribute to a company. I have a lot of ideas, but there are thousands of Joe's out there with "ideas". Companies have enough idea people.So now that I've given up games I don't know what to do with my life now. It's funny. All these years I waited to study game design, now I'm in school and hate all my classes/find them very difficult, and my interest in games have diminished. It's a sick joke played by the universe.

CoffeeCrazedMom [info] My thoughts are just my experience.I used to break things and I still have those urges. It's just that my son is very important to me so I'm trying to act right tho I do fail from to time.I think around the time my son was a year old I was thinking I had bpd as well. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and also pmdd. I talked to some friends and they said my current med (lithium) was effective for both bipolar 2 and bpd so it was my choice if I wanted to go in to see a doctor or not.In hind sight I'm thinking maybe it was more hormonal than anything. I went through a bit of PPD and from what I read that can start even after a year post partum. I breast fed for 9 months so that could have had something to do with it too.Or it may have been that I started back up on lithium after breast feeding and weaned off again because I didn't like the weight gain (dumb I know).I haven't broken anything in over a year and my son is 2.5 now.

BigTrain2000 [info] What Makes Someone an Empath? Am I One? I'm not a fervent believer in the paranormal. For example: I believe there are ghosts, I believe there are also demons and angels, all three by the Christian God's design. I consider Wiccans to simply be passionate lovers of nature, and don't believe in Karma. My logic is cool and collected, while my emotions are wild and unbridled. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder, and several psychiatrists have mentioned I have many qualities of an individual with borderline personality disorder. One psychiatrist told me to read up on "The Gifted Child," a book which details how individuals who endured abuse as children had to become hyper-tuned to the emotions of others as a survival skill (the abuser's momentarily raised eyebrow may indicate a beating later; the abuser's calm, shallow breathing may mean no food for a week.) I noticed I have many of these qualities, in regards to being hyper-tuned to emotions. So, what makes an empath? I think I may be one, but in the terms that I can sense other's hidden emotions and physically feel their emotions wth them. Not by any paranormal means. [info] None [info] 1485293831

iMainLucina [info] My (18 F) friends (18 M, 18 M), best friend (18 F) and ex boyfriend (18 M) left me DISCLAIMER: I hope you don't judge me for this because this is the first time I'll really open up, and I'm scared. I have a really bad temper and when it comes to group works, I really explode. I often lash out to my friends whenever something bad happens or something doesn't go my way. The two friends were my research group mates and I exploded to them twice, saying that the second time, I was so agitated because I saw a corpse that was hung at our parish church. As for the best friend and boyfriend, I lost them at the same time because I also lashed out on our social science group. My ex's best friend, who was my group mate, was doing all the work and I felt like there was no communication, so I got really angry and tried to rant to my boyfriend but he couldn't take it and asked the best friend if it were true. We've had the same problems over and over again, but there was a time when he realized he just couldn't accept how I am. He tried his best to change, but I didn't, so we ended up parting ways. I still think about him, though, and my dreams are always full of him and his friends. I remember all the good times and it hurts that I was so immature it caused 4 important people in my life to leave me. My best friend doesn't even talk to me anymore, apart from discussing requirements. She told me a week after the social science incident that I had to change and she gave me a list of things to remember by, but I have very bad memory, so all I could remember was to leave my ex for good because he couldn't give me my needs (I have very low EQ and I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and adhd). I tried messaging her, but she wouldn't even seenzone me. To add, she also told me to change during the three times I did that to her, but I just couldn't. As for my ex, I did it to him more than 10 times probably in the duration of our almost 2-year relationship and he says I never change so he doesn't want to interact or anything. It's the first time I ever felt so chronically sad for weeks and it's also our time to graduate already. I got so crazy I cut my hair yesterday, but I don't think anything changed in my outlook in life. I flooded my best friend in a lighter way than I would flood my ex, but that's still bad. I know I'm an awful person and it takes time to heal the wounds I caused, but I don't know how to change. I would appreciate if you guys could give me tips because I am also very impatient and it just breaks my heart that I lost 4 important people in my life to my attitude. They were putting up with me for the longest time, and I just can't believe that they've had enough. I honestly have been like this ever since I can remember because of the way my family brought me up (e.g. slapping, spanking with a belt, verbal abuse, kneeling down with books at my hands to teach me a lesson). I tried to fix my relationship with my parents, but I can't help but blame them for my mindset. I really think I haven't healed from my childhood and there's no way of healing because I still live with them, and I'm envious of how other people could have space from me, but I can't have space from them. I'll give it to them though. They really tried to change, but I don't know how to heal. I don't know how to change myself so that I won't lose any more people. I don't know how to healthily cope with all the break ups I have had and how to win them back somehow in the future. Because, in all honesty, I loved all 4 of them in different ways, but they were all staples in my life. Sometimes, I think of ending my life so that I wouldn't be a bother or hurt as much anymore because I lost important people in my life, but that's a different thing from what I'm asking. I'm also very afraid that they cut me off for good and I can never regain the beautiful friendship or relationship we once had. I really do desperately want to change, and I know the first step is acknowledging those problems, but I've been in step one for 5 years and I don't know what to do. Should I isolate myself so that I wouldn't be able to lose any more friends? Should I keep talking to my other friends about my sadness? I don't have much to do and I'm an extrovert and I just don't know how to proceed with this. Tl;dr I have really bad temper that is probably caused by my upbringing which led me to lash out on the people I care about the most. I lost 4 of the most important people in my life, and I don't know how to gain their trust back. I also don't know what to do to change so that I would stop losing any more friends.

Detonato [info] Had to quit my loves again I had 2 seperate psychosis episodes before I was diagnosed with bipolar, one was in private and one was more public. The fear of having another psychosis episode which were 2 or so hour long frantic hours of insanity became my greatest fear. I quit smoking weed and drinking for close to 2 years because I was convinced that's how the insanity manifested as both happened while I was high. Fast forward to a time where I felt stable after living to a regime of my pills and mental health, I decided to start using pot again. At first it was fine but if I ever started to feel "too high" I felt like I was no longer in control of my stability and would be convinced I was slipping into a psychosis episode. This goes on for months and everytime I got high I felt like I was playing Russian roulette. I made the call to quit weed again and decided to stick to drinking, but this week after having a few extra beers I started to feel those fears I had of losing control or slipping into a psychosis rear it's head.

jetais_la [info] Question about Mania &amp; Bipolar II Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2 in 2014 after a 10-day long hospitalization from a manic episode. From what I've seen on this sub, I understand that bipolar disorder type 2 patients don't experience mania? So I'm really confused about why I was diagnosed with type 2 if I've experienced full-blown mania. Shouldn't I techically have bipolar type 1? lol I'm so confused any help clarifying this would be appreciated [info] None [info] 1503117490
sketchypudding [info] This is literally me. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 14 years old and I felt the same way like I was just faking it. IDK why I would fake it it's not like being bipolar is a desirable thing. But unfortunately, almost 10 years later, I still feel the same way. However, after years and years of trial and error I have finally found a cocktail of meds that would only work on someone who is bipolar, so that kind of reassures me that this is who I am and it's not all in my head. I wish you the best of luck! I know how hard this can be but you just need to stick with it.  [info] None [info] 1535127787

Wee_Albet [info] TL;DR: Yes, I have mental health problems and one night I was suicidal and we spoke via WhatsApp for 6 hours until I fell asleep. Details on what happened that night:We will do that too. He goes to stay with his mum at the weekend, so we will talk through messaging during the day. But we will also talk through serious things through messaging too.I have mental health problems and before the diagnosis I had was questioned (Sept last year), I had a very bad depressive episode towards the end of July, which lasted throughout August and into February of this year. Very confusing.Anyway, on August 5th last year, I was feeling very low and had decided to take my own life that night, which was a Saturday, so he was at his mums an hours drive away. I had tried calling him and my family and no one had picked up.He had fallen asleep and had woken up at 11:30pm and saw the missed calls. I was sat there, about to carry out the act (no further info will be given on this, so no methods or mention to what I would have done). He didn't know if I would be awake or not and didn't want to wake me of I had fallen asleep, I'd been awake for nearly 4 solid days with no sleep at this point and he hoped I was sleeping.He sent me a message apologising for missing the calls and asked if everything was OK. I couldn't think of anything to say and any way of lying was lost to me at this point, so I simply replied back saying "no" and he tried calling me. I felt completely ashamed about what I was going to do and what I would be leaving him to come home to. I couldn't bear to talk to him on the phone. So I kept rejecting the calls and I was eventually able to get a message over saying I'd talk on WhatsApp.We then went through absolutely everything that had gone one over past few months (which we now know was hypomania, I was diagnosed with bipolar). We spoke about what I was going to be doing and about why I was doing it (an even longer story than this, sorry for this story). For about 6 hours we both sat up and spoke about everything. Not just about how I felt, but also him too.So, yes, we do reach out through messages too, and by doing that, it saved my life.I hope everything is OK on your end. I'm sorry this reply was so long.

cakecakepiecake [info] MIL and baby clothes A few months ago I went through my daughter’s baby clothes, getting everything sorted to donate. It was an emotional process for me. I was diagnosed with bipolar and it’s not a good idea for me to have another baby until I’m more stable. We also aren’t in the best financial situation. We were sorting through the clothes, picking out a couple sentimental outfits to keep. MIL didn’t want us to donate the clothing. She wanted us to save them for when SIL’s kids. SIL is not married, but is engaged. She also isn’t interested in having kids anytime soon. And there’s no guarantee she’d have a girl. We hung onto the clothes in case any of our friends became pregnant. But the only couple we knew are expecting a boy, so our hand me downs aren’t useful to them. I was so pissed. First MIL wanted me to give wedding decorations (that I ended up not having) for SIL’s wedding. Now she wanted me to save baby clothes for SIL’s baby that might never happen. She’s so desperate for a grandchild from her daughter, despite having a grandchild from her son. [info] None [info] 1526935567

bkrandomz [info] If you're not hypomanic/manic are you in a depressed state? Hey guys I'm diagnosed with bipolar type 1 with psychotic symptoms. They say I'm possibly schizoaffective.I ended up in a hospital when I was manic because I never had an immense feeling like I did in my head. I thought I was going go die and that everyone was out to get me, even in the hospital. I was in an inpatient program for almost 3 weeks which was like hell for me.Now I'm at home and I'm on 15mg zyprexa and 1.25g depakote. I turned to caffeine and ecigs because I felt hypomanic at times and needed something to stimulate my mind.Now I don't have that hypomanic feeling and I crave caffeine because I feel so tired and depressed. Is this because I'm now in a depressed state because my mania/hypomania has ended?Thanks [info] None [info] 1435239570

More than anything, I would like to confide in my best friend that I pushed away a long time ago, because I miss them and they didn't deserve that. I have a feeling there's a certain etiquette to letting someone in on the condition of your mental health (and probably the sooner the better) but I just haven't figured out a way to tell them without coming across as *wanting* to be a victim.

Silent_Sibyl [info] I went through school to become a funeral director. Graduated summa cum laude and loved every part of the education. Once I got a job at a funeral home, I lasted three months. It didn’t help that the owner was a chauvinistic asshole, but what really got to me was that I had to constantly walk on eggshells. Even answering the phone  with “good morning” set some people off. It’s been six years since I left that job and the field, and I wish I could say I’m doing much better and that I’m happy, but I’m really not. At the very least, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 last year, so now I have an excuse why I couldn’t handle the job emotionally.  [info] None [info] 1552942243
ggema [info] Does anyone else ever miss the highs and the lows when on meds? I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for about two years now, and have been taking mood stabilizers for quite a few months now. I'm doing better than ever. I'm able to actually keep up with my schoolwork, I've been making better and more thought-out decisions, I cry less and smile more, but I can't help but miss being all over the place. Even though my lows made me want to die, a weird part of me wants to experience them still. It's like I've romanticized the idea of them. Same with my mania. I miss being the crazy-impulsive and fun version of me who felt everything so deeply. Even though some of my decisions made in mania hurt myself and the others around me.Does anyone else ever feel this way? tl;dr - I miss being depressed/manic now that I take meds regularly. Do any of you ever feel this way? [info] None [info] 1463893712
hazelerea [info] OH MY GOD THIS. My ENTIRE life, as far back as I can remember, I was the "drama queen." "Hazel you always start drama." "Hazel this is why nobody likes you because you're so dramatic." And now, years later, they know I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Their new favorite lines? "Hazel nobody likes the dramatic bipolar little b**** you are. Are you off your meds again??" The most ironic thing about it? They send me book long text messages explaining how "dramatic" I am, failing to realize that they're projecting themselves onto me. No nondramatic, sane person takes minutes out of their day to text entire books to people detailing how horrible and dramatic and terrible they are. [info] None [info] 1558647718
autonomous_foxfire [info] I think it would make sense for him to be caught off guard by me responding positively to his compliment if it happened once or twice. However, it happened at least a few times we would see each other in person. This happened once or twice a week (we live about an hour and a half away from each other). Him and I had a lot of issues dealing with communication, and I don’t think I am out of line for shifting that blame to him. The relationships prior to the one with him, I did struggle to communicate my feelings and problems. I never wanted to step on any feet or create waves for the other person. Going into that relationship I laid everything out for him, I was an open book. If there was an issue I would bring it to his attention so we could work on it. If something was bothering me I would confide in him.  I opened up about my past, a history of abuse and mental illness. It started with my mental illness. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder four years ago. I had told him in great detail how that was for me. He would start by making passive aggressive comments here and there about my diagnosis. Then followed hours of cryptic texts. He would allude to something being wrong but refused to explain what had been bothering him. It became a stressful guessing game. He had told me that he knows I am going to cheat on him because he read somewhere that it was “impossible” for someone with bipolar to remain faithful. It was only a matter of time. It seemed fine when we together in person. At least it felt fine at first. When we would talk about more in depth subjects and beliefs he would question my understanding but phrase it in a “nice” way. Like it was “cute” that I thought I understood the topics. He would ask me loaded questions about my ideals, personal beliefs, and personal experiences. I could feel that I had to really think about how to answer these questions because if I remotely eluded to something that would upset him I knew he would use it against me. There is a long list of experiences with him that felt like he wanted us to be doomed. It was one dragged out conversation after another that kept planting thoughts in my head that he never wanted this to happen to begin with. One of the things that bothered me the most was when he asked me what traits are important to me. I told him I value loyalty, autonomy, honesty, and sincerity. He responded by telling me he thought I was vain and fickle. I hope this sort of explains why I feel his response seemed more calculated. It felt like each new day was a new chance for him to test me and see how far I could be pushed before I broke. It felt like the beginning of a very toxic, abusive relationship. I think if he had come into my life when I was younger, I would be in a worse situation right now.  [info] None [info] 1509638400
kattbug989 [info] 20.I was very musically proficient in high school. It earned me a shot at a statewide recognized concerto spot (i was a finalist), a professional gig in a community band, and a whole bunch of miscellaneous prestige as a high schooler. When i got to college, i got a combined $36,000 scholarship due in part to that talent. I ultimately gave it up/simply couldn’t handle college in my mental state. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a hospital stay that caused me to drop out. I’m starting from scratch at a community college, still unsure of what I want to do. I would say my biggest accomplishment is getting through these two years of hell. I went from an apartment i simply couldn’t afford (i was working 26 hours a week with an unemployed boyfriend), using drugs to cope, and having mental break down after breakdown... to a steady full time job, paying for college classes for the summer out of pocket, and a wedding date on the horizon. I’m currently moving into a 2 bedroom apartment with my fiancé and our best friend, and i couldn’t be happier. My job is good, there’s money in the bank, food on the table, and none of those drugs in sight (aside from my bipolar meds, which are also part of my accomplishment). I’ve reached my first point of stability in my adult life, and i couldn’t be happier with myself and my life. [info] None [info] 1522291181
Morris_the_Fraggle [info] I spent a week in the psych ward where I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder. I’ve been, successfully, medicated for 15 years.

I’m hurt that they can’t trust me and my mental health enough to treat me like an adult. I have a mental illness, I’m not unstable, I won’t kill myself, I won’t freak out.

Baby-Baphomet [info] Anyone else have problems with tics while medicated? Tl;dr meds cause me to have very distracting tics, anyone else deal with this? Before I was diagnosed with bipolar ll I was on an antidepressant that put me in a hypomanic state for about a year until I went off of it. I was super productive when I wasn't overwhelmingly anxious haha. During all that time I had a lot of tics, they weren't involuntary but I felt a lot of discomfort if I didn't do them. Thing like sniffing/inhaling through my nose, blinking hard a certain way, often one eye at a time, etc. Now I'm diagnosed and am on Lamictal and I'm having the same tics again! It's really bothering me and the sniffing and eye strain are really starting to give me headaches, plus I feel like a crazy person when I can't help do them in front of people lol.

MrB0mbastic [info] I've thought there wasn't any difference between a person with aspergers and a normal person, and I even have a sneaking suspicion that there isn't much difference in any mentally ill person and a normal person. I was once a pretty uncontrolled person but I've been getting better, I recently got off my meds and feel much better since I did. I was diagnosed with bipolar and getting off meds is supposed to be the last thing I should be able too do. I feel better and they say I shouldn't. I have no way to back this up but I'm certain that the brain is just the hardware that we write our thoughts on is the software. And I feel just like how a computer can get a few important drivers become corrupted, same goes with the brain. If a child is told that small talk means people don't like them and no one corrects it and if that small child grows to adult hood then there is going to be huge holes in their experiences with other people. and I've been thinking about this for a long ass time. It's like some people think that is someone is so stupid to never figure out that small talk is fun and leads to good things then they must be stupid, but in reality all it takes to never learn that is a hateful parent or one that is too controlling. lots of things can cause that and no one seems to get that. They just try to say it's some sort of genetic bullshit.The truth is no one needs any pill for an emotional problem, the truth is they need someone to care about them. Sad too say it but the idea that pills can fix anything has caused way more harm then good. Pills for mental health is going to be the death of mankind if we don't stop it.

boombeyada [info] Relapsed after 14 whole months I don't know what happened.I'm diagnosed with bipolar II and I used to self harm quite a bit back in the day. Wasn't until sometime in july in 2018 did I resist the urge to cut after I finally got on latuda. But it wasn't until while did I actually get a breath of fresh air once I was on latuda 40mg and lamictal 200mg. It felt like bliss. I even got a 60 and 80mg increase and it was amazing.But then something happened. I just feel like I'm not invited to anything. I'm in a frat and I'm not in one 'special' group chat with anyone. I hang around with people but I'm not invited to a single fucking thing. I just kinda invite myself everywhere and I hate myself for it. It hurts knowing I'm always the odd one out and I feel like I'm worthless in that regard. I feel like I'm kinda extroverted at times, so I get energy talking to people, but I can't seem to ever enter conversations with other people. After a party I was at that was an open invite tonight, I realized how awkward I felt, so I left crying on the way home. There I took my razor and just started cutting my leg. So yeah, here I am after 14 months. [info] None [info] 1568435408
megapizzapocalypse [info] About my dad So throughout my childhood my dad would scream at and intimidate me and my brothers, make misogynistic comments to put me down (once I was a teenager) and would constantly tell me and my brothers that whatever we did, it wasn't good enough. I always had to go back and do it again (chores, schoolwork, music practice).  When I left for college things seemed to get worse. After I graduated and was living at home looking for work, it seemed like we had weekly screaming fights. At one point he threatened to kill me then a day later gaslit me and denied ever saying anything.   About two years ago he decided on his own to start going to therapy. As far as I know no one pushed him into it. I had already moved out at that point and was seriously considering no contact / very low contact but was held back by the fact that I wanted to stay in contact with my mum and brothers. I wasn't aware he was in therapy until one day I was visiting and he told me he wanted to talk to me about something. We sat in my parents' living room and he explained his worldview as he had worked it out in therapy, how he sees any "outsider" as an enemy and only cares about "insiders" (me, my brothers and my mum). He said that as me and my brothers became adults he was often very confused about whether we were "insiders" or "outsiders". He said that his worldview was a result of his upbringing and he was trying to change. Throughout the whole conversation I was in fight or flight mode and kept looking at the door. He said he didn't think an apology would be enough. I asked him for one anyway and he said, "I'm so sorry". After about a year of seeing that he was keeping his temper, not putting people down I slowly started to feel more comfortable around him. I still don't hug him or touch him but I'm not afraid of him any more. I started to make small talk and casual conversation over the phone and when I visited, where I had previously avoided him to the point of not staying in the same room with him. Around this time I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my parents were very concerned about me and supportive of me getting treatment. Talking openly about my mental health made me more comfortable and trusting around them.Recently, over the last several months, I have become comfortable enough to talk about my childhood with him. We had three separate conversations that I think had a big impact on both of us. The first time, I mentioned that his temper tantrums had made me afraid when I was a child. This was big news to him (why?? we were ducking and flinching and running out of the room) and he seemed very shocked. He said he hadn't realized what type of impact he was having. I think he apologized but I don't remember the wording as this was a little while ago.  On a second occasion I used the word "abuse" during a conversation about my childhood and he cried. It was surreal. He said he thought he had done better than his parents. He talked a little bit about how his need for control had affected the way he acted and how he is learning to recognize those thoughts and not act on them through therapy.Most recently I had the courage to bring up some of the negative comments he used to make about my body. Even thinking about the comments makes me feel disgusted and ashamed so it was the hardest conversation we've had. He was again very shocked to learn what impact he had had on me. I told him his comments made me feel "gross and disgusted with myself" and he put his head in his hands and stayed that way for about ten minutes. Maybe it's wrong but there was a part of me at that moment that was like, "Yes! Suffer for what you did!". He said he was sorry for how he acted and that he wasn't going to try to excuse it. He said he was trying to understand how I felt when I felt disgusted. I don't think he's made the connection that his behavior was due to a specific pattern of toxic thinking (misogyny) in the same way that he made the connection about his need for control. I am hopeful that he will eventually realize with the help of his therapist.    Maybe I'm naive but I'm hopeful that this is real change and he will keep making improvements, even if it is gradual. If you see red flags that I'm missing let me know.   Thank you for reading this far I appreciate you xo&amp;#x200B; [info] None [info] 1551194788

11Y1N [info] Struggling... help! I’m 5 years clean, heroin being my DOC, but I haven’t been sober. I occasionally drink and sometimes smoke weed. I was diagnosed with bipolar type one about 6 months ago, and I’ve been struggling with managing my sobriety since a recent(ish) med change and concussion. These happened around the same time. I switched from one mood stabilizer to another to prevent further weight gain. The first stuff was good other than gaining weight. I felt happy and was outgoing and talkative. The second stuff just isn’t doing it. I feel dependent on meds now, and since this second med isn’t creating this artificial happiness I feel like I’m self medicating with the stuff that does (weed and sometimes alcohol). I’m worried about my behavior. I impulsively bought a pint of whiskey and a 6 pack of margaritas. I smoked before work and then couldn’t go in because I was too high- and then lied to my wife about all that. I’m going off the rails I believe and I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow. How do I explain my relapse concern when it’s not a full blown binge but just as impulsive?

CaptainSteelmeat69 [info] **Recently single people, read this:**About a year and a half ago my ex left me for someone else and I was diagnosed with bipolar II around the same time. These two events set off a chain reaction of addiction, abuse, brief homelessness, joblessness, and overall a shitty life situation. I was left legitimately wondering if I had any purpose in life or if I should just end it.It's been a rough 18-20 months, but my boss (at a job that I love) asked me today if I wanted to move to full-time during the summer, I went on a date with a wonderful girl and we're meeting up tomorrow, and I registered for classes in the fall.When you're recently single, it can feel like nobody wants you, or that you're not of value without your other. I can tell you that, after many months of undoing a lifetime of self-hatred and learning to know my own value, that is a load of bullshit. You are worth more than what you'll ever know to a whole magnitude of people.

TheVampiricOne [info] nMother Denied Me From Getting Mental Health Treatment It seems I finally found a place where I can express how I grew up. I have a nMother. She has a severe drinking problem. Bad enough that she would fall out of her wheelchair (used because of neurapathy, now she just uses a cane) and she would shit on the floor.

The last straw was her breaking my nose and calling me a selfish bitch (for the 100th time). Here's a list of what she has done that has hurt me to this day:-Denied me mental health treatment while I was suicidal and self-harming (even after calls from the school)-Made my father's death all about her, even though she divorced him-Turns everything I talk to her about into something about her- I'm a firm believer she is a reason why I've been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder-She treats me like an awful person because I don't want to see her, but she hardly treats me like a person-Has made fun of me for seeking my own mental health treatment I understand she has had cancer and has a lot of trouble after the fact, but taking out everything on the people you claim to love is not the way to express your feelings. Thank you all very much for reading. I hope this made sense. I'm not great at expressing my thoughts. [info] None [info] 1549061153

BrozBros [info] snappa.com is a great website for all things channel art. and [panzoid.com](https://panzoid.com) is good for intro videos. like the other commenter said, watching youtube videos about how to start a youtube channel are SUPER helpful, so I would start there and just kind of play around with it. I don't have any grand advice, as I am a beginning youtuber (just started a channel with my sister last week), but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder half way through college (I was also a psychology major until I switched to neuroscience), so I just want to say how much I admire you for what you're trying to do, and also how much my heart aches for what you've been through (and I know that without a doubt you are one of the strongest people on this earth). If you private message me the link to your channel, I'd love to subscribe! I will definitely also be talking about my mental health issues on my own channel at some point down the line. Again, I very much admire you for what you're doing, and really wish you the best of luck.  [info] [1λ]  [info] 1551495653
theboolk [info] Friend is pissed at me Background info: I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1, and I drink a lot and do a lot of drugs. I am also on medication.So last night my friend was going to come over (she does drugs too). She and her boyfriend both came over. She wanted to talk about some problems she has been having (real bad ones). She specifically asked me to be sober. I was coming down off a shitload of clonazepam and a little bit of gabapentin. I was almost sober and she was an hour and a half away so I knew I was good. I didn't drink anything until she got to my place.Once she got there she said it was fine if I had a FEW glasses of wine (she wanted to talk not party). I had 2 and a half glasses of wine, the booze mixed with the come-down of the gaba and klonopin. It got me SUPER fucked.I sat on the bed and passed out. I did not know that was going to happen. I genuinely was going to stay sober last night so we could talk.She left with her boyfriend after I passed out. She is pissed at me. She told me she was hurt (which hurts me, I hate to see others in pain or hurt).I was just wondering what your guys' opinion on this was. What you think I should do etc.This whole thing is making me more depressed (my meds are being adjusted and I'm in a BAD depressive part of my disorder). I've been nervous and having panic attacks thinking I hurt and lost a friend. Its just killing me inside. Edit: this is like my BEST friend too. We are like family.Edit: please don't tell me "stop using drugs or drinking". I just want advice for my friend.UPDATE: So I just talked to my friend on the phone. I apologized and I'll probably see her in a few days. [info] None [info] 1504533056

yeslekkkk [info] My time in law school is more marked by my struggle with mental health. Law school is a very stressful experience, as you probably have never worked so hard in your life. I also did law review which is a shit load of work. Law school pushes people over the edge. For me, it brought out mental health aspects that I didn't even know existed. In a way, I'm thankful because it made my bipolar disorder come out and be so undeniable that I had to seek help. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder halfway through. Like many other people on this site, it led me to behave in ways that I'm not proud of. I ended up hurting people and feeling ostracized. I would wake up everyday and have to face what I had done to people while still continuing to do my work. It was incredibly hard.I like the material of law school, and I'm really glad that I'm going into law.

FemaleScientist17 [info] So I just finished my third year of grad school in molecular biology and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder this past year even though things have been rough for the past two years and I didn’t know why. I have not taken a leave of absence but it has been on my mind a lot. For me work and education was the most important thing my entire life, but when my world fell apart I have learned that you have nothing if you don’t have your health. My PI doesn’t know about my diagnosis but he does know that I have health issues. He is understanding about me having to be at appts and sometimes even taking a day off. I work as hard as I can in lab, but I don’t overdo it because that can be chaotic for me. As for labmates, they don’t know my diagnosis either, but know I have health issues. If they were actually nicer and more understanding people I might tell them, but knowing them rather well I feel like they would be judgemental. Everyone’s situation is different so telling then or anyone is something you should think about and base on your experiences with those people, which can be really scary but also can be rewarding in the end. As for the leave of absence, if you feel that is what’s best and will help you find your footing then do it. Ultimately, taking care of your mental health will make your life better overall. Good luck and stay strong. Keep working on yourself and on your science!  [info] None [info] 1533703711
Fatassmatilda [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 10 years ago and I was diagnosed with borderline 4 years ago. I think I was always both at the same time but they finally realized the borderline part too. So living with both idk I figured out bipolar i can see when I'm becoming manic when I'm becoming depressed but o god the mood switches with borderline are fucking terrible they can change at any moment so I am rapidly cycling through moods on top of whatever bipolar is doing to me. I don't have any friends n my family all want me dead. And on top of this I also have PTSD and a panic disorder. Idk I got hit with the crazy stick hard. One interesting thing though that made me respond to ur post is that everyone always tells me " ooo no u can be both bipolar and borderline it's one or the other " but my doctor's diagnosed me so fuck those people they r not doctor's idk have u ever had someone say that to you?

littlelivethings [info] I would get some protein bars or Lara bars if you're more in need of carbs than protein for energy and eat them around the time you normally have breakfast/lunch. You will be less likely to binge in the evening, will have more energy, and will eventually start to realize when your body needs food even if you don't feel hungry. I was on Wellbutrin for a while and would constantly forget to eat and not feel hungry, just faint/exhausted/nauseous. I kept taking it even after I was diagnosed with bipolar (anti depressants triggered mania for me) because I was worried I would gain weight. Eat regularly, have energy, try to get yourself back to a healthy eating schedule while you recover.  [info] None [info] 1491094446
harlow1986 [info] Can anyone help me with my situation?? So I used to work for Piedmont Airlines under US Airways but had to leave due to medical issues. I was diagnosed with bipolar and unfortunately became medicine resistant. I now am being treated by getting Ketamine Infusions which have put me back in control and Its no longer an issue and I am ready and healthy to get back in the air. My problem is this...while I see a doctor who administers the ketamine its still known as a club drug and will no doubt show up in a urine drug test...I know that they’ll want to look into it as they did before when I was on adderall for a.d.d...and if they do theres a chance that they’ll find out about my diagnosis..which i know for a fact would be my kiss of death..i plan to keep my “illness” a secret because its no longer and issue and I know the stigma attached to it. Also they may just not accept me being on ketamine and working as a flight attendant due to peoples lack of knowledge about Ketamine and how beneficial it is to not only mentall issues but chronic pain as well.     Can anyone shed some light on this for me? Whether it be your knowledge of what they will or will not accept? Any advice or knowledge about this situation and maybe how to handle it would be so very much appreciated!! [info] None [info] 1557063168
theskittlestubesock [info] Mixed episodes I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 17 (21 now) and I feel like I’ve never exactly been educated on what a mixed episode is. I’ve had hypomanic episode where I can’t sleep, have racing thoughts, act impulsively but in a negative way. The racing thoughts are negative and the impulsivity is things like getting into a fight with a friend. Basically I feel hypomanic but I’m sad. I’ve tried looking it up but it lists the symptoms of manic and depressive episodes and just says you have to have some of both. If you have had a mixed episode what was it like? And how did you know you were having one? I’d love if someone could educate me a little more on it. [info] None [info] 1563095583
themarajade1 [info] Actually if you read my original comment, you’ll see that I clearly stated my defense for her. (which in case you can’t tell, is the very first reply to this whole comment thread.) Also, I’ve been through two nightmarish pregnancies, both alluded in the original comment. I had HG with my first and lost 15 lbs in the first trimester. I couldn’t even keep water down. Not to mention, he was born five weeks early and he’s now an autistic five year old boy. My daughter was conceived through a sexual assault, so imagine that, and the entire time I’ve had either of my children I’ve been a single mother. My entire experience as a parent has been borderline a nightmare. Also if we want to talk about mental health, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder right after my daughter’s birth and it’s taken me a really long time to get to where I’m at now, which is a good place. So don’t @ me with that no compassion bullshit. I still fully believe that OP’s wife needs and deserves some serious support and probably therapy/professional help but at some point, also, people are still responsible for their own actions.

growlergirl [info] You guys are being way too harsh on this girl. Let me guess, you're all a bunch of nice guys and nice guys finish last, right?I'm in the same predicament as this girl. I recently dumped a guy because I was falling in love with him. I broke it off because I was scared that sooner or later he'd see the real me then reject me. So I got in there and rejected him first as a defence mechanism. I felt so guilty that I wound up in hospital with self-inflicted injuries. The day after that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.Your ex sounds like she has a similar pattern of behaviour. You saw her at her worst (drunk and careless) and I think she probably broke up with you because she felt ashamed of herself. She was afraid that eventually you'd begin to feel just as much shame for her as she does and dump her. So she beat you to the punch as a defence mechanism.Should you try and win her back? I don't know. If I had a chance to get back with my ex I probably wouldn't take it because I still have a long way to go before I get better and I wouldn't want him to have to endure me at my worst.She can only learn to love herself on her own, until she gets to that point she probably isn't ready for a relationship.

raynazyn [info] Is it normal to question your diagnosis? Struggling. Before I had my psych evaluation, I just *knew* I had bipolar. I was so excited for my appointment to finally have an answer as to why I act the way that I do.So, of course, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 on the 7th of this month. But do you ever feel like you’re *not*? A part of me thinks I just made it all up, even though I’ve attempted suicide at 20, have had passive suicidal thoughts since 11, had my first major depressive episode from 15-18, and had my first (that I’m aware of) hypomanic episode at 19. Here’s how the last 3 months for me have been.[mood graph](https://imageshack.com/i/po96pyhKj)How can I be so sure??? I don’t really think I’m making it up, because it fucking sucks. Like why would anyone even fake this. God the lows are so crushing. When I’m baseline, both high and low are so far away that I can’t even believe I was that bad or that good.When I’m hypomanic, I always think that I’m “cured”, and “how could have I ever been suicidal?”When I’m depressed, I always think “how could have I ever been so happy?” [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1569454781
smallest_ellie [info] Totally. I'm diagnosed with bipolar as well and have never been able to have a healthy relationship very much because of me (which is something I've realised in retrospect).I feel like a sane person trapped in an insane person's body.My advice? Don't stress looking for love until you figure out how you can live with your diagnosis and be stable (as stable as is possible for you, I know it varies). Do it for you and not for a potential relationship in the future.Your relationship to yourself is the most important one you'll ever have.When you do find love - make sure to COMMUNICATE. And find someone who's willing to communicate with you.I recommend watching Lady Dynamite on Netflix if you haven't already. A crazy, absurd comedy series made by Maria Bamford who's also bipolar. It helped me a lot and it also touches on healthy relationships.Hugs! [info] Yuhua Hamasaki [info] 1520710158
krissithegirl [info] The major reason it seems that there is an increase is because there is not so much stigma around mental illness. More and more people are starting to realize that it is ok to seek help instead of suffering with their illness.

Rachnee [info] Trans Girl going to see psychiatrist for a potential diagnosis reconsideration tomorrow - wondering if others are in a similar position I don't know if anyone here would be offended by me posting here, but I have been reading the links and articles here and compared to the normal /r/aspergers subreddit the way females show aspergers seems to resonate with how I act more. I was diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD as a 9 year old kid, and put on nerouleptics (Invega) from when I was 13 until just over two years ago (currently 23). After coming off of the Invega, I keep showing more and more signs of aspergers (could the Invega have suppressed any autistic tendencies?) The more I look into aspergers in general the more I question the initial diagnosis I had and question my actions as a kid. I kept reading about how males presented aspergers and while it seemed to sort of fit, it didn't really explain it. Whereas while in the process of searching for answers I found BPD; it matched how I acted to a T. More recently (as in tonight) I was reading this subreddit looking for more answers as to what I have, and found that BPD and bipolar are common misdiagnosis in women with Aspergers. Does anyone have experience talking with or being an autistic trans girl who experienced aspergers in a typical female way versus what would have been considered for your birth gender (a typical male showing)? I know the article that made the clock turn over in my head was this one:https://everydayaspie.wordpress.com/2016/05/02/females-with-aspergers-syndrome-checklist-by-samantha-craft/I knock off literally almost every trait on that list. I know it's rude of me to ask for confirmation, but I just want to know how the community here experiences it, or if someone could direct me towards a sub reddit of transgender autistic girls or otherwise that I could talk to? Literally anything I can present to my psychiatrist will help in seeking this rediagnosis, because having the bipolar diagnosis on my file has done nothing but harm me, and prevent me from figuring out who I am (Long Term Antipsychotic (Invega) use I think?) And could have been making me present as bipolar; apparently long term antipsychotic use can make people bipolar in some ways? Anyways sorry for the long post, any help I can get in this matter would be great!Thank you so much!      Lily [info] None [info] 1500964209

I find that art, like music, and even fictional characters sometimes helps me understand myself.  I mean, obviously, it's all fiction, so it's not going to be a perfect representation of my problems, but for me it helps.

Seattleite97 [info] Poor speech/articulate skills. Why? Most of my life (elementary, jr high, HS) I've always been pretty articulate, especially for my age. My story telling was on point, explaining a situation or a scenario to someone was never difficult, just talking in general was never an issue for me. Being 19 going onto 20 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. I recognized my thoughts were more racing, and my emotions were harder to control. My speech was still the same but I was definitely going through some huge (scary) changes. Around turning 21 is when the speech started to go. I started a new job wich tanked my confidence. That was over a year ago. I feel like its gotten a lot worse over the past year/year and a half. It feels like my brain cannot put the right words together in the ride order. Its honestly caused me to become socially awkward. Has anyone had this happen? Is there a different subreddit I should be posting this on? Im desperate for help. It's terrible feeling this stupid.

Beaky1505 [info] My (25F) PMS and periods have been getting worse each month. It starts at least 10 days before my period and my mood swings are horrendous, I get horrendous cramps and sore breasts and body aches and night sweats. I'm a right misery to be around and just want to cry and complain and eat chocolate.Then my period comes and it's heavy for 3 days then abruptly stops... No light bleeding just pure heavy blood.It's horrid. It's been horrid since I came off birth control after having my son in 2015 as I was diagnosed with bipolar shortly after and the pill messed with my moods more.But just these last few months they've been getting worse.

MySpinMove95 [info] I honestly don't think they were doing it for the good of my child. I have no criminal record, no drug issues...they flat out said I was depressed and that makes me unable to care for my toddler, and I don't deserve him. Mind you....none of this is true. They went through my old Facebook messages with my ex (and sadface reacted to me saying how much i miss my son at like 3 in the morning.. on my dead exes account, like a week after he died) and found out that I had an abortion (my own and my exes desires, nobody was forced and we were both totally okay with it). They tried to say that makes me an unfit mother. They also used the fact that I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a couple years back, and was anorexic when I was a *teenager* against me. Mind you, I go to a therapist, and am on medication for my bipolar 2, and they knew this. Being depressed doesn't mean you deserve to have your son taken from you. Also, another thing that makes me think the "best interests" argument is bullshit. A few days before my ex died, he sent me a message saying he's doing fine for the time being, but if anything happens to him, he knows he'll be well taken care of with my boyfriend and i. He sent a 3 paragraph message to me on Facebook thanking me for giving him a son, loving him so much, and being a kind mother to him. I KNOW his parents saw that bc of the random 3 am sadface reaction. I have never done anything but love my son and try to give him a "normal" life. I'm not perfect, but they made up lies and tried to put my life under a microscope to take him away from me. Shit, the courts even try to reunite crackheads with their parents...yet I'M unfit and THEY'RE the best when all they do is park him in front of an ipad... ok. I've lost a sister, and when she died, my own father tried to take her kids from their biological dad. You'd be surprised at how common this bullshit is. It's all centered around selfishness.

LusciousPubes [info] I'm just meaning that researchers haven't gone out of their way to be sexist. It was a product of the times.It's also my right to deal with the fact I have an iud that caused 3 months of hell. I got it for me, not anyone else, even though I was in a long-term relationship at the time. It may be a little different in my country as we have a public health system and so finances aren't really an issue. I've also never had a doctor take bc lightly - I was given information on all the options. When I was diagnosed with bipolar they were extremely careful about which bc I had - basically nothing hormonal. So they were extremely open about potential side-effects. I personally would feel a bit weird relying on someone else for bc, so either way I would have gotten it. It's my body so I see it as my responsibility. Not everyone feels like that, so male bc will be an amazing thing.Just had a thought - it's probably tied into the taboo of periods etc. and pms symptoms are potentially why it's side-effects have been played down. Amongst everything else. The reason I keep saying to read -wasn't meant to be patronising sorry - is partly because it's a bit of an echo chamber in this sub imo.

egretregrets [info] Yes, that's how I was for years; just absolutely depressed, and then as years went by, hypomanic features started showing up as irritability and anger. They eventually became frequent, which is how I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. The more I think about how I was before diagnosed, the more I realize I may have been BP instead of unipolar depressed. This is why bipolar2 is so difficult to diagnose. Then there's mixed episodes, too, to further confuse diagnosis. In a nutshell, it's quite possible. Hypomania is much more subtle, too, than the mania of BP 1. [info] None [info] 1503177809
thetigertree [info] Is it worth getting a second opinion I was diagnosed with bipolar at a hospital a few years back and I never actually thought about getting a second opinion.

kohays [info] Yeah smoking can bring out psychosis. Drinking is okay in moderation but it's best to stay away completely from substances when you are dealing with OCD. I have pure O too so I know what you mean, I have an obsession about developing schizophrenia and when something seems off I go into a mode where I start getting paranoid that I'm crazy, seeing things, hearing voices. But the thing is I know it's all in my head. Anyways, from what you described it sounds like it's just obsessive thoughts, are you diagnosed with ocd? Or on medications for it? I was on Luvox and it did help alot with the intrusive thoughts and conversations I get in my head from ocd. Unfortunately I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I can't take Ssri's anymore as they tend to bring out mania. But for intrusive thoughts the best thing is Luvox, exercise, staying sober, keeping busy, and eating healthy.Are you seeing a therapist for OCD as well? [info] None [info] 1529446860
katatl [info] I genetically am predisposed to addiction but didn’t realize I was an addict until I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last year. I was lucky in some sense that my addiction was cigarettes and a ridiculous amount of pot, but it was still pretty hellish and I felt completely out of control. For me, my addiction was actually really escapism. The smoking was great but it was more I was addicted to running away from myself. It has taken a lot of time to be able to be quiet with myself without altering my state chemically, and I’m still fucking up here and there (sometimes everywhere) but I’m blessed to have a support system of friends who know that though it’s not their responsibility to keep me sober, it is important that I can share with them and be honest about my struggles. Good luck. [info] None [info] 1562511651
vicuna76 [info] Why the heck do I feel in the wrong taking medication that helps me? I was diagnosed with bipolar back when I was in middle school and improperly treated for it for YEARS . A few years ago I was evaluated again and found out I do not have bipolar and it's ADHD. I was put on Adderall and instantly (for the first time in my life) felt okayI now take Vyvanse 50mg in the morning and (if needed) 5 mg of Adderall in the afternoon to get through the rest of the work day. When I take my medication I feel like myself. I feel like I can think clearly. Be productive. Carry a conversation. Be a better friend. I just feel like I can be the best version of myself when I take my medication. I get confused though because when I don't take it I basically feel like shit and can't get anything done. My friends confuse me by saying things like "oh you're addicted to your medication that's why" or that I'm dependant. I don't know if I'm dependant or not... I guess I depend on it to make me feel better? I don't know. I feel guilty and ashamed taking this medication because why the f can't I achieve being my best version without it? My friends claim it's because "I'm probably high all day" Does anybody else feel anything similar to this? Should I stop letting my friends confuse me because they clearly ARE NOT medical doctors???  Do you think it's some type of bias because it's an amphetamine?? What do you think? [info] None [info] 1561318138
mischief-managedd [info] I tried to kill myself. She visited me in the psych ward  and she told our friend group that I tried to kill myself over a guy (which is NOT true) I was diagnosed with bipolar after my attempt and she would always tell me to “hop on taking my pills” if I expressed any emotion other than happiness. She also drunkenly messaged our mutual friend and said “The next time mischief-managedd tries to kill her self, tell her I’ll push her off that overpass next time and make it look like she slipped.” (My attempt involved an overpass....) I was heartbroken. I cut her off completely and she tried talking to my boyfriend and telling him I was an awful person and that my promiscuous past would catch up to me and we would break up. We haven’t. There’s a lot more context and other situations that led up to this where I should have cut her off earlier. I’m glad I finally did, though.  [info] None [info] 1554004862
jessicadiamonds [info] I think INFO is the only way to actually respond to this. She has told you she does not feel "love" for people. But perhaps that is just the perception of what neuro-typical people act like love is. Maybe she doesn't even understand it? Her brain doesn't work the same way as the larger population of people, but that doesn't mean that there isn't any kind of feeling at all towards others, otherwise I'm not sure you would have a relationship with her in any meaningful way. I mean, love isn't a specific thing. We as a society act like it must be this very specific thing, but what is that? I believe it is different to each person. The fact that her boyfriend loves her and wants to marry her tells me that they at least on paper have a good relationship. Do you believe that she has manipulated her way into this for the purpose of some sort of gain, like wealth, status or security? Sociopathy is not actually a medical term, and ASPD focuses mainly on behaviors rather than specific traits, or psychopathic traits. It doesn't sound like she behaves in the same way that she did when she was diagnosed, am I hearing that correctly? &gt; DSM criteria include a disregard for and violation of others' rights since age 15, as indicated by seven possible features: failure to obey laws and norms by engaging in behavior which results in [criminal](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/punishment) arrest, or would warrant criminal arrest; lying, [deception](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception), and manipulation, for profit or self-amusement; impulsive behavior; irritability and [aggression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger), manifested as frequently assaulting others, or engaging in fighting; blatant disregard of safety of self and others; a pattern of irresponsibility; and lack of remorse for actions. \*This is from [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-is-2020/201812/difference-between-the-psychopath-and-so-called-sociopath) about the difference between ASPD and psychopathic traits, for others who are reading this. I think it's much more complicated than anyone here can say. I definitely do not believe that a DSM diagnosis is something that anyone else should disclose other than the person with the diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder, which I am open about, but I would not want other people telling my own diagnosis, especially since I have sought to manage my behavior, which it sounds like she is doing.&amp;#x200B;Lastly, does it matter if her love is real or if she is just going through the motion of it for her own happiness? I'm not so sure. If she is happy and he is happy, why does it matter? [info] None [info] 1558496287
shawnbenteau [info] Lithium and loss of identity I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 just about two years ago now and have been on lithium since. I started at I think 600, then 900 after a few weeks, then 1050 a few months later and finally 1200 after my counts didn't come back after a rough bout of serotonin syndrome a year and a half ago.The changes were so slow that I didn't notice them until I went back and read posts I had made at the time. I've never really interacted with other bipolar people so I don't have much frame of reference, and I've been worrying lately that I might just be different now and I don't notice it (from either the lithium or the serotonin syndrome). It feels like the kind of thing that's impossible to know. I can't remember who I was six months ago, much less two years.I've had the intrusive thought of "stop taking your meds they're bad for you and you don't like swallowing them" and was hoping to reach out for some commentary one way or the other.

MadCalvanist [info] ITT: Look, we can form words!Listen. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since 1997. I recently graduated Magna Cum Laude from Liberty University with a Bachelor of Science in Religion. Do you know how many pastors there are out there who have this disease?Calling it the work of demons only lends credence to the superstitious nonsense of backwater hillbilly country Christians who think *indoor plumbing* is the work of the devil. Just because its not curable doesn't mean there's no medicinal answer. In fact there are so many treatment options, if the doctor tries you on one and it doesn't work, guess what? You try another one. There are actually enough that within the typical ten year period they project to finding your best diagnosis, you will have found the exact right amount of medication and/or therapy.We live in a fallen world - sin is part of the natural order. The devil might try and take advantage of your condition, and by all means, that can and will happen. But remember even Paul had a thorn in his side, we don't know the nature of, but God didn't heal for one reason - it was Paul's job to work *in spite* of that thorn for the glory of God. Bipolar disorder is not your demon, its your thorn. It's your opportunity to glorify God by overcoming your illness every day... not by curing it. By defeating it daily. I've been doing it now for 17 years. Some people have done it for far longer. You can do it to. But do it with your doctor - not a bunch of armchair theologians and the opinion machine of Reddit.

spacedrgn [info] Sounds exactly like my symptoms before I was diagnosed with bipolar. The last six weeks have been an emotional roller coaster for me, in every direction and sense. Last week I haven't been able to sleep well due to my problems. A month before I was on such a high, I was crying tears of joy because the world we're living in is so beautiful... then I came crashing down.My doctor raised the daily dosage of my medication a bit and it seems to be helping. Remember, like everything in life, this too shall pass. You're feeling shitty now, it's gonna pass. Consult your doctor, make sure you exercise regularly (it sucks for the first weeks, then you start getting used to it -- see /r/fitness), eat well, drink enough water (really, it helps) and most importantly, try to socialize. Sometimes a walk in the park is all you need.It's hard to stay strong when you're alone with your thoughts. Keep yourself busy. [info] None [info] 1462364378
Perkinz [info] Eh, from where I am you're all eastern ;)And to be honest, I'm not sure why.I doubt it's insomnia, though it's definitely easiest to describe it like that.It happens maybe once every month or two though.For a couple of days I'll be... definitely not amped or energetic, but well, "normal"---Like a short rest would be nice but can be done without----And when I do go to sleep it's for short periods of time (3~5 hours) and I wake up feeling groggy but otherwise still good to go-----And then for a couple days I go to sleep early and sleep for long periods of time (9~12 hours).Typically the whole cycle is over in less than a week, though a couple years back I remember one time where just the first phase lasted 2 weeks.Last night was the first night this time and I was able to get to sleep decently ish, and I assume this coming night or the one after will be the last of the first phase.I know back in high school I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and when I was on the pills for that it was much, much worse---But, then, my mother was going doctor shopping for someone who'd believe everything she said, so who knows whether or not I actually have bipolar disorder and if its even related to this at all.All that said, apart from a small handful of times it's not debilitating or hindering and I function well despite it.I've definitely come to like the second part, though.I get the best sleep then----When I'll lay down in bed it'll just feel like I'm melting into my bed and it's just so damned comfortable and I wake up feeling real nice.Definitely have to thank this, though, as those nights where I'm unable to sleep gave me a chance to woo my current girlfriend and she's absolutely wonderful.

jaahrome [info] Misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Long story short, I quit Navy boot camp, was sent to a psychologist, answered a few questions, and then I believe I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I insisted that I didn’t need meds and I just wanted to go home, and I feel like she diagnosed me with the disorder just so I could. I’m mentally stable. The answers I gave her weren’t really ones I’d consider to be deciding factors on the diagnosis either. Example: Q: “Has there ever been a time where you’ve felt very happy and confident and then very sad and doubtful?”A: “Yes?”I feel that everyone has those days. But after all that, I insisted that I didn’t need any meds and I wanted to just go home.So now I want to re-enlist into the Air Force. My code is Re-3e, which means I can enlist with a waiver and that my enlistment was erroneous. JFC is the code. Went to my recruiter, said that I wanna re-enlist, but he said he would need more documents relating to my separation from the Navy because I only had 1 page of my dd 214. I’m not sure if the documents I’ve requested from the National Personnel Records system in St Louis say that I officially have Bipolar disorder, because if it did, I’m thinking that I wouldn’t be eligible to re-enlist, but I just want to be extra sure.  Is it possible I can get re-evaluated by another psychologist and show the results to my recruiter so we can move forward with the process? I was a dumbass a year ago and I didn’t know what exactly i was signing up for and didn’t care cause I thought boot camp was gonna be cake. When I was shown otherwise, I wanted out. But now I think I need to try again. Tl;dr: Went to navy boot camp, quit, I think I was  “diagnosed” with Bipolar Disorder, insisted I didn’t need meds or anything, (because I knew I wasn’t mentally ill) went back home, now I need to re-enlist, codes are Erroneous enlistment, re-3e, JFC, not really sure if I officially have bipolar disorder, requested separation documents. Is it possible to re-enlist after a second (or third) psychological assessment stating that I am not mentally ill? [info] None [info] 1564125235

der_konig [info] I'm an INTP with bipolar disorder Just felt the need to share this with someone, and the rest of my fellow INTPs seemed fair enough, since I found this revelation to be quite interesting. Hopefully you guys do as well.I've been interested in psychology for years, and though the Meyers-Briggs personalities aren't largely accepted by psychologists/psychiatrists, i still found it interesting as a means of  categorization. Many years ago I took several tests (I originally tested as an ENTP) and realized that I identified with INTPs the most. Weak I, weak N, strong T and P. So that's the background.Recently I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type II), and it really changed my perspective on my entire life. While I'd always known that I fit the INTP type best, there always seemed to be inconsistencies. Every so often, I'd act completely irrationally, was overly emotional, and saw things as much more black and white. Oh, not to mention the paranoia that ensued. Being diagnosed as bipolar helped explain much of that. Those were the times I was experiencing a hypomanic episode.These episodes caused my otherwise stable and normal life into quite a mess. It would always seem to happen right as things were getting back to normal and all was well. Then I'd do something crazy and fuck it all up. Destroyed relationships, fucked up my finances, failed easy classes, etc. The exact opposite of an INTP. After reading up on it more, a personality change is often an indicator that a manic episode has started or well on its way.Now I'm on medication, and seeing both a psychologist and psychiatrist regularly, and I'm starting to piece my life back together. But it's strange; sometimes I miss the craziness, the rush, the energy, and the willingness to follow my every impulse, no matter how idiotic.Anyway, I am posting this more for myself than anything else, but hopefully you guys could find it somewhat interesting.

frenchiestfry96 [info] Yes! A ton! I personally have a lot of addiction in my family as well as mental illness. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I keep a strict regimen of what drugs I ingest (weed and alcohol only on rare occasions) just because I'm paranoid I'll turn into one of my family members. I say this only because I think a lot of the kids in med school live in a bubble. They've usually grown up in upper class families in safe neighborhoods. These kids don't know how surprisingly functional addicts can be. I know a ton of kids who have self-diagnosed themselves with mental disorders/illnesses so they can take the class II drugs. Even worse, some of these kids have doctors in the family who write them scripts whether or not they have an actual issue. They'll  often abuse stimulants or painkillers in the morning, only to go home and drink a ton in the evening. However, they would never tell you they may have a problem. Most of them believe the stereotype of the "drunken bum": If you're not poor, living in an alley, and smell like 5 year-old hot milk, then you CANNOT be an addict.  [info] None [info] 1547617186
1LongStorm [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar2 when I turned thirty. It cost me my job, my relationships and my entire world pretty much fell apart. Through years of meds, therapy and sheer determination I feel like most of the time I manage the beast. I now care for my 94 year old Gran, my Dad who is in a care home dying of COPD, and this weekend my Mom is in the hospital following a heart attack. My ability to care for others came from my learned ability to face things one at a time, stay mindful, avoid triggers and know and respect my own limitations. A huge part of my ability to function came from the epiphany that my brain has a glitch and I can't just allow it to randomly choose emotions and reactions... I am my own mental police. It was really hard to accept my limitations, but being stubborn about self care and self monitoring has been essential in allowing me to be well enough to care for my family members as well as myself. I found peace in mindfulness. My mantra is "I am here, and it is now." It has been surprisingly effective in helping me remain grounded in the now without letting the future or past overwhelm me. I also repeat ad nauseum "It is what it is" Acceptance of reality moment to moment helps me cope. Edit: I also read a LOT. The best escape is always a good book and there are always books to help understand/deal with  pretty much any situation. And I ditched TV 12 years ago because it is a trigger for me.

silent-roar [info] Is it worth it to see a doctor for mild focus problems? I’m a 21yo white female in Indiana. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but I do not currently take medication due to successful CBT therapy. I’m 5’2” and roughly 125lb. I have problems focusing for long periods of time as required by college classes. I smoke marijuana but not cigarettes, and I only smoke at night in very small quantities. I have previously been prescribed Wellbutrin (25mg I think) which caused me to have blurry vision and also adderall (10mgXR) which I feel is too intense. I currently drink coffee which I find is incredibly helpful for my focus. I don’t really like to drink coffee because of caffeine addiction potential and the negative effects on teeth. I’m wondering if there are medications I could take that would essentially be like drinking a coffee (a 12oz cup provides me positive effects for about 8 hours) but won’t be too intense like the adderall I used to take. I’m sorry if this is a ridiculous question I’m just not sure if it’s even worth pursuing a medication, and I have no knowledge of potential medications that may help. Any advice is appreciated. This has been a problem for me my entire life, however my courses are now difficult enough that I really need the extra help for focusing and motivation. [info] This user has not yet been verified.

mrscarpenter25 [info] Hi there ,I know your looking for an answer from a specific type of people , but I felt I needed to give my advice about the medicine from my point of view. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1. My psychiatrist prescribed me zoft ( the generic brand sertraline ) once a day and another antipsychotic rispodone once ever evening. It took a couple months for me to finally start feeling happy (peaceful) again. I never once decided not to take my medicine at will (once or twice I would forget if I had a busy morning) . The biggest advice and fact you should know is if you are not getting your proper sleep , you medicine will not work . You must let your doctor know your sleep amount and if your having issues. There is help and it does take time and patients . I hope it gets better for you !  [info] None [info] 1424881660
EvilAngel13 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1, schizoaffective disorder and borderline personality disorder years ago.  I was absolutely terrifed and heartbroken and embarrassed but I did believe it...and I spent about a year going to therapy and trying to find the right cocktail of medications that would help me "function normally" without making my entire life suck (lol).I ended up gaining a ton of weight and spent several months feeling emotionally numb, completely detached from everything and just sort of existing rather then living.  I pretty much gave up and bought into the drs and my (now ex) husband's assertions that this was how my life had to be and that wandering around in a numb, emotionless fog was better than riding the rollercoaster that was my life before. Until one of my daughters' best friends (they were elementary school age at the time) was hit by a car on her bicycle right in front of our home and did not make it.  And I felt nothing.  Literally, nothing.  Not at the accident scene. Not at the hospital.  Not while my 2 little girls were clinging to me for comfort.  Not at the funeral.  The night after the funeral I was trying so hard to just feel...something and it kind of dawned on me that the medications I was taking were the cause. I threw them all out and flushed them that very night and I haven't touched psych meds since.  I quit seeing all of the drs and therapists.  And have never gone back.  My (ex)husband tried ultimatums, coercion...even force to get me back on medication and back into treatment but I absolutely refused.  He ended up moving out and I filed for divorce immediately. It took some time to get everything out of my system and to sort of reshape my thoughts pertaining to mental illness, personality disorders and the field of psychiatric medicine.  While I do believe that mental illness obviously does exist and I would never ever discourage someone who feels they need help from seeking treatment. I also believe that sometimes drs/pdrs are too quick to diagnose and medicate what just a few years back would be considered personality traits but are now labeled as mental illness. I realize this isn't going to be a popular statement and I hope that I don't sound critical or judgmental or unsupportive. [info] None [info] 1563026171
YOUREABOT [info] The line between logic/delusion gets really blurry during manic episodes, especially with the internet. Who's to say what's possible. Done different he might have actually been able to get Drake, or some other big name, to come out.  I just started to come down from about a two weeks of mania. I ended up doing a couple of mania fueled things (like deciding to raise money to fly from Taipei, Taiwan to Milwaukee to see a Wu-Tang concert…  haha ) I've been documenting the whole thing (in a long form sloppy way).  What I know, that other people don't, is that these "manic projects" often times have paydays at the end up them. Like, for example, in 2008/9 (while at the peak of my YouTube career) I won a laptop from Tim Ferriss and  a car with free gas and insurance from Ford (when the launched the Ford Fiesta). If anyone saw what I was doing and thinking to myself behind the scenes I was clearly manic in both cases (I was diagnosed with bipolar in 1999). I was actually off my meds too.  Anyhow… it's complex. The "delusions" can have very real positive effects. For example the delusion from my first manic episode set me on a path to becoming a serious martial artist.  Anyhow… there's a bit about me. :) Thanks for making this video. I subscribed and hit the bell button (the first time I've done that. :) ) [info] None [info] 1552291793
sayheythrowawayy [info] How to discuss med changes? Foggy/tired I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2 in my teens. I was medicated for a little bit, my mother didn't like it and pulled me off. I started my meds journey 3 years ago and I haven't quite ever find a 100% kosher combination, to me anyway. I'm definitely in a better place than I was 4 months ago, 4 months ago I was planning my suicide and happened to start therapy the very next day, coincidentally. For the last 4 months I was put on 750 mg of depakote, 20 mg of latuda, 10 mg of buspirone 2 times a day (I usually forget one dose), and 25 mg of hydroxyzine every 6 hours as needed (I usually forget these and they make me very dizzy and my legs wobbly and I feel like they don't do a damn thing).I cannot take the foggy, words being jumbled, difficulty waking up/tired while driving, inability to focus, incredible weight gain anymore.How do I explain this to my doctor? Would it be odd if I asked for something to help with the foggy/inability to focus portion? It is like there is a huge disconnect between portions of my brain and definitely my mouth. I know they don't make a pill for weight gain but despite my best efforts... the weight just keeps coming.Help please. [info] None [info] 1575468002
marksyc [info] Not a doc, but I experienced a manic episode (hypomanic but with some paranoia/delusions) which was decided to have been caused by a high dose of sertraline and my own non-compliance with mood stabilisers. Since then I have been diagnosed with bipolar and was able to identify a family history of bipolar in my paternal grandmother and maternal aunt. Interested to hear others’ experiences too.

Splinter1010 [info] Alright, here goes.It all started when I was molested at seven. I trusted her, I thought she just wanted a hug, but then she reached in my pants. Let me tell you, pedophiles are scum of the fucking Earth. They deserve to burn for eternity, with what they do to children. If they don't act on their urges, whatever, I don't care. But if they do...After that, even though I didn't fully comprehend what had happened, I was numb. I couldn't feel shit. I was just a walking shell. From fourth to seventh grade, I was bullied horribly. People telling me to kill myself, I got in fights, it was bad. I started cutting at age nine. I tried to kill myself three times at eleven. I was fucked up. I was depressed.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in sixth grade, or when I was eleven. I went in a psychiatric hospital. I got medication, but it didn't work.I started hallucinating, and developed sociophobia, in ninth grade. Or around there somewhere. I had panic attacks every day, and by this time I was off medication for some reason, so I had nothing to help with my bipolar disorder.I went to a psychiatric hospital again, and was put on a different medication. That one worked for a while, then they switched me because of hormone levels, and that one worked until a few months ago.Now I'm seventeen, and fucked up with no medication to help. So yeah, it sucks.And that is why I haven't been happy for ten years. [info] None [info] 1403816015
Lipbanging [info] Mental Illness Resource Suggestions So next week is NAMI's mental illness awareness week October 5-11.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 4 years ago, but I've only recently been speaking out about my experiences.  I posted something small about mental illness in response to Robin Williams' suicide, but other then that I've been very quite about living with bipolar.  But I've decided that I'm part of the problem if I continue to stay quite.  I really need to speak up if there is any hope of the stigma attached to mental illness to ever go away.  So for this year's NAMI Mental Illness Awareness Week I want to post a different resource everyday day of the week. I was thinking of posting things like blogs about what living mental illness is like, how to support mental illness charities, different resources about how to get help, or just a helpful article about how to support someone with mental illness. I have some ideas in mind but I was wondering if any of you had a good resource I could include.  I really want to post some good information so if anybody has any ideas I would really appreciate it. Thanks! [info] None [info] 1412039492
rorylupin [info] Distraught over symptoms and diagnosis I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 over summer after being hospitalised for a manic episode where I became acutely psychotic. Since then I’ve experience a mixed episode,during which I displayed psychotic symptoms and have been pretty stable for about two weeks. Last week I became really paranoid for a few days. I feel very suspicious of my parents, who I live with, and kept thinking they had been altered and weren’t their original selves. I also had several auditory hallucinations for just one day. This whole this is extremely worrying as I have been violent when psychotic before (if I feel my life’s in danger, I’ll fight and have assaulted staff). I have a great MH team but I’m hiding things from them, I don’t want to tell them about potential psychotic stuff because I can’t face it, I can’t face them suggesting I’m Schizoaffective or prone to psychosis or this is going to happen again. I just don’t want to even think about it. I don’t want this to be happening. I’ve worked hard to get into university and want to get my degree and not be sick (already been signed off for like two month - drs orders). I think if they suggest I might be regularly psychotic or more than BP (which I’m already struggling with) I might end it. I don’t want to put people through episodes time and time again, the last ones were hellish enough and it’s not fair. I’m drinking to cope but am epileptic and constantly consumed by guilt. My parents are away for two weeks and I’ve asked for them to be cut out I’m my care updates whilst they’re away so they can enjoy their holiday. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want this.

pkbooo [info] It sounds like this feeling isn't constant, but happens in phases.  Is that correct?  It can be a difficult cycle, to do really well and then fall really hard.  I wondered why that kept on happening to me, and then I was diagnosed with bipolar.  For me, part of the problem was I didn't feel like I needed to seek help when I was doing well and I wasn't able to seek help when I was low.  Do you think you might be able to talk with a doctor or therapist?  Regardless of where you go next, thank you for talking with us here.  I'm really glad to have you with us.

-A-Unique-User-Name- [info] Speaking from personal experience only... the first medication I took was a SNRI and it triggered a manic episode. I had the same question about whether it was only a s/e of the medication but I was diagnosed with bipolar anyways. About a year later I experienced another manic episode while I wasn't taking any medication. Maybe you have to wait it out to be sure which it is?I think I remember reading somewhere that if it was just a s/e, the manic episode will end pretty quickly after discontinuing the drug, while if it was BP the manic episode may last longer.

Joreggy528 [info] Brain "deterioration" Stage? In 2015 I suffered an unknown disorder that I called "the deterioration." Basically what happened was that I couldn't think or do things correctly. I would forget things in about &lt;10 seconds. At school I couldn't do well because I was in this deterioration stage. My grades dropped from Bs to Ds. This also wasn't just for school. It also happened for less important things such as video games. I would get about 15 kills and 40 deaths. Usually it's the other way around. In sports too, I just could not think straight. When I had to play a position I knew I was familiar with, I couldn't remember what to do when I had to play defensively. What happened? I was diagnosed with bipolar recently, does this have anything to do with my bipolar? [info] None [info] 1453625076

lobotomydave23 [info] February of 2017 I tried to kill myself, was doing drugs before that (cocaine, fentanyl, xanax). Stress of college was really getting to me and I realized I wasn't as smart as I thought I was and I was extremely average. I was in a mental hospital for a week, and barely passed most of my classes that semester. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the meds I was taking made me manic as fuck. I married a guy I knew for a month and a half, and a few months later moved to a random state with him I've never been before and had no resources. We both had no job and relied on my school for money. I flunked out because the stress of school was still too much. I got checked in to another mental hospital because I was a danger to myself again. We got evicted from our apartment and we had to move back home. He was abusive and controlling the entire time and accused me of cheating on him 24/7 (he and my mom were the only people I talked to) and he didn't want me to work because of that. I ended up leaving him and now live with my mom again. My mental illness fucks me up so much that the only job I can keep right now is a live in nanny for my brothers and step brothers. I don't get paid but I live there with no expenses. I have a shit ton of student debt that I have had deferred. I have other debt that I'm just ignoring right now because I can't afford to pay it. I have no money, no job, no car. I'm just living day to day trying to survive. I haven't gotten out of it yet. I'm lucky that I have a loving and supportive family or else I would be homeless.

MistressVelveetaVida [info] Ok I think I might have some perspective on the meds thing at least. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 15. It was bad. I'm almost 42.  I've been trying to find meds and combos that work until about 2 years ago when I when to a psychiatrist who did something call a "gene sight" test. Basically they take a cheek swab and send it into this lab and they then send your doc the reports of almost every drug for this and tells you which ones most likely won't work, ones you should not take, ones most likely to work and if the levels of medication you're on is too high, too low or just right. I was very surprised with the results, my doc ended up changing a few doses of my meds, stopping some and trying ones from the list of most likely to help. I cannot express how much this has changed my quality of life. Have a sit down with your doc and lay ot all on the table. You may require inpatient treatment for a short period of time to safely change medications. I wish you the best of luck [info] None [info] 1571364479
thumper5 [info] I'm 25. As for how I've changed... I used to be severely depressed, and when I was 20 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was a mess and a half. I tried to kill myself 5 years ago in April. I was an extremely angry person. I had very little respect for myself, or anyone else around me. I was selfish. Generally speaking, I just wasn't a very good person.  In the past five years, I've found a... serenity, maybe? I don't know. I very rarely get angry anymore, I go out of my way to be kind, I'm a good friend, I'm no longer medicated. I think I'm the best person I've ever been. [info] ♀ [info] 1420734382
cheweduptoothpick [info] I'm 40, diagnosed at 36 after an incorrect diagnosis of bipolar when I was 16. I am a master of masking and by the time I was diagnosed with bipolar,  could have already won an Oscar for my acting ability although I had no interest in acting at all. I was operating from a place of making people comfortable. I had so much confusion about social tradition, dating and everything that I just emulated people around me.  My parents were extremely supportive of my quirks, my brothers too,  he is undiagnosed however definitely autistic, and my father also. I basically just tried to not be too weird. I have hyperlexia and my grades at school were great,  but my behaviour was poor so schooling was a seesaw. I hated clothes and would try to wear as little as possible, except in winter as I'm super sensitive to cold. My brother and I both couldn't have the seams of our socks touching us,  his ears were supersensitive and my stims are making noises so we triggered each other into meltdown a lot (my poor Mam). Getting an actual diagnosis has helped me by being able to know my limits and remove myself from situations that are too intense for me. My workplace is supportive,  although it's rife with mental illness so nothing is taboo.  [info] None [info] 1536563198
space_impala [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 in May, but at the time I was living alone in apartment by myself. I wasn’t physically taking care of myself and my psychiatrist thought it would be a good idea for me to get an ESA because it’s something I would have to take care of and it would also calm me down when I have manic episodes. I moved back home, went off my medications, and am doing much better, but my cat is now mostly for when I experience those episodes. My mom lives about 30 minutes from where the house will be, so not terribly far. I just have to be aware of when my episodes are coming.  [info] None [info] 1548978187

I was just thinking about this on my drive home today- how I've been diagnosed with bipolar, and how it is supposedly a chemical imbalance (though they don't seem to know that for sure), but that I have this fractured family history that must have something to do with my damaged relationship with the world and with living in it.

iRoastaJWhenIWakeUp [info] Philosophy. Medication is all about differing responsibility for yourself to a drug. Therapy is about expecting someone else to make your life better. It's all about taking responsibility for yourself.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and took medication and received therapy. First, how do you even diagnose someone with a mental illness? With physical illness, there's a clearly defined norm to point to i.e. 98.6 degree Fahrenheit, x many ccs of mucous coming out of their nose, etc. With mental illness, what's the norm? You'll quickly realize that there isn't one. It's all arbitrary. And yet they'll prescribe hard drugs like amphetamines and antidepressants (in my case, "mood stabilizers") to people who they can't even definitively say have something wrong with them. In my opinion, you're better off learning how to live and fixing your own problems in living rather than relying on someone or something to make your life better for you [info] None [info] 1517812949
quanell [info] This happened to me, and I wrote about it not too long ago in this same subreddit. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/tuak1/its_been_6_months_of_steady_progress_and/)Basically, I had been messing around with weed and magic mushrooms for too long, about 2 to 3 years, and had become really introverted and a bit of a social outcast. If you do any drugs as well, STOP AT ONCE. Paranoia and loneliness often manifest themselves in auditory hallucinations!The important thing to remember, which I wish I had, is that you were completely fine in this regard at an earlier point in your life, and it's very much possible to pick yourself back up.For what it's worth, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type II) WITH psychotic tendencies.Lastly, I myself became convinced that the thought broadcasting was real, because the voices in my head would always go "It's real!". Fuck that, IT'S NOT REAL.After being completely sober for almost 2 years, I don't have auditory hallucinations anymore, due to a mix of going back to school, getting steady work, and building up a close circle of friends who didn't want to throw their lives in favour of getting high/fucked up.

firecrackerdingo [info] Telling Parents when they visit I haven't broken it to my parents (well, mom.) that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few months ago. Honestly I'm having a hard time with it myself and I feel bad for keeping it from her but honestly I'm not sure if I can tell her.Some background on this- my mother was diagnosed with bipolar but always denied it, and growing up with her not getting help was not the best to be honest. She still denies it to this day. My dad was a drug addict and died when I was young, long story short. My mom is very much so against medications like antidepressants and such, but I'm on medications for my bipolar.I'm scared that my mother will find my meds and take them away or something. (I'm 21 and live across the state) She's been known to do crazy shit like that.It doesn't help that my current medications aren't helping due to being wrongfully diagnosed as depressed at first. I was on zoloft for over six months before my psych cut me off and had me go straight to abilify and lamictal. So I've been out of it. I worry that she will notice how out of it I am when she comes to visit for the holiday and something will happen, I'm not sure what. Or nothing could happen, and I could still feel like crap for being so groggy I can't enjoy the time I have with my family. [info] None [info] 1479875391

LeafyQ [info] My mom refused to take me for ADHD testing as a kid, although it was recommended over and over. She convinced me that it didn’t exist. I struggled a lot in school, even though I really loved it and I’m not a stupid person. I got by, but college took a couple of attempts, and my GPA is piss poor. I spent my entire school life super stressed out about my performance, and I spent hours and hours every day just to keep up. I want to go to grad school, but I really don’t think I’ll get into any programs. I’ve now been diagnosed with ADHD, and on Adderall I’m a much, much higher performing individual, but I think it’s too late for me to change my life. She also would never take me for any kind of mental health evaluation. Since I was a teen, I’ve gone through long periods of horrible emotional struggles and more. I also had periods where I was doing really, really well. I won’t go into detail, but a few years back I was diagnosed with bipolar I. Lots of therapy and medication later, and I’m just so much more stable.  [info] None [info] 1553031579

Anakin_Groundcrawler [info] Concerta questions Four years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and have successfully overcome that obstacle, for the most part. Recently, I was also diagnosed with ADHD. I had symptoms that, in hindsight, I was kind of stupid not to notice, but all the same I've begun treatment, so I guess that's all that matters. Anyway, tried straterra and had to quit that a month in because it was really messing with my mood disorders, for example, I had about two emotional breakdowns and I rarely cry any other time. My doctor took me off that and put me on 18mg of concerta and it seemed to do fine. He was afraid with it being a stimulant that it would affect my manic episodes, but thankfully I've been pretty stable as far as my mood goes. Anyway, as far as concentration goes, it was a little better, but ultimately once I notice I'm "concentrating" I then start congratulating myself and think about how awesome it is, and before I know it ten minutes has passed of me day dreaming. So it's been working in spurts, but nothing too much. Went for another visit yesterday, and he increased the dosage to 27mg. So my basic question is, will this ultimately improve my concentration? I think I found a good medicine as far as stable moods go, but am afraid it won't have any affect on me and I'll have to go from square 1. Anyway, sorry if this is a wall of text, I've never really posted on mobile so I'll try to make any necessary revisions whenever I'm back onto my laptop. Thanks, guys! TL;DR: Just upped concerta, will I finally be able to concentrate? [info] None [info] 1384031491
Couldawg [info] Please. [Read the transcript](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2018/10/11/kanye-west-donald-trump-and-jim-brown-the-full-transcript/). Forget right-vs-left. Here are some of the points he makes: **1) Cops and Blacks are both victims, being driven towards each other by the system:** &gt; And that’s a major thing about racial tension. And we also, as black people, we have to take a responsibility for what we’re doing. We kill each other more than police officers. And that’s not saying that the police officer is not is not an issue, because they are in a place — a position of power. But sometimes they’re in a place of law enforcement. They need to be law-power. It’s force versus power. And when you — you shouldn’t have to force people to do that. So a lot of times the police officer is sitting there, they’re being forced to do this and forced to do that block. And then they force somebody into something and force into something. Cops are told to "clean up the streets." So they do. They arrest Blacks for crimes, and into the system they go. Once there, they are marked with a record and a Scarlet P (probation), and turned back out. Things don't look good from there...**2) 13th Amendment as a "trapdoor"**&gt; There’s a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment. I did say “abolish” with the hat on. Because why would you keep something around that’s a trap door? If you’re building a floor — the Constitution is the base of our industry, right? Of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you — accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber? You end up — you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship.The 13th amendment abolished slavery. What is this "trapdoor" he's talking about? READ IT: &gt; Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,** shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.Maybe he has a point? The 13th didn't abolish *all* slavery, only *illegal* slavery. *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*... it's right there. Look at the prison system. Loaded with people, most of them Black. You might say, "that's not slavery, that's prison." I refer you to the Scarlet P from above... **probation**. [4.5 million](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2018/04/26/probation_update-2/) are on probation or parole. We are accustomed to viewing that as a *good* thing... after all, they are getting a "break," since they *could* be in prison. But let's change up our perspective here. Why is prison the default? Honestly... because we don't have anything better. Right? &gt; "Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read — or African Americans to read. And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave."Is he wrong? He's talking about how petty bullshit spirals into a lifelong sentence, unless you have the education and/or resources to tread above it. Is that not the crux of the Black Lives Matter argument?&gt; "Again — so what I think is, we don’t need sentences; we need pardons."In other words, if I've done my time, then get the damn chain off my ankle.**3) The Role of Mental Illness in All These Problems**&gt; "And I think it would be cool to have Yeezy ideation centers, which would be a mix of education that empowers people and gives them modern information like — sometimes people say, “This kid has ADD. This kid has ADD.” He don’t have ADD. School is boring. It was boring. It’s not as exciting as this. We have to make it more exciting. We have to mix curriculums. You play basketball while you’re doing math. You learn about music while you meditate in the morning. We have to instate mental health and art programs back into the city."&gt; "We need to talk to people. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. And he looked at my brain — it’s equal on three parts. I’m going to go ahead drop some bombs for you — 98 percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards, (inaudible), so I’m going to work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent — Tesla, Freud. **So he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar; I had sleep deprivation,** which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name."&gt; And then, we got rid of the mental health institutes in the ‘80s and the ‘90s, and the prison rates just shot up.After Kanye left the White House, the MSM pounced on the meeting calling him crazy and unhinged, *while referencing his prior mental health issues.* They repeatedly referenced his alleged bipolar diagnosis. But wait... is that even true? Or was it sleep deprivation? Does it even matter? If so, why? If it wasn't bipolar disorder, does he now have to *disprove* that it was? What kind of BS is that? Also... Kanye gets a LOT of flak for all the self-promotion and braggadocio. But what is the theme? This isn't the typical  "sting-like-a-bee" rhetoric you hear from athletes, or "bitches-n-hoes" boasts you hear from a lot of rappers. He's bragging about his intellect. When is the last time you can remember a Black man bragging about his *intellect*? What is the context for his comments? He's talking about education. He's talking about standards. He's talking about Black kids who are bored out of their minds, subject to insulting low academic standards... schools that simply teach from the book, and only care about getting kids in and out. What if inner city schools started with the presumption that their students are *smart*? Why are they all built and operated on the presumption that these kids are one inch away from failure? Why is every student in the inner city schools placed in "intervention mode" from the very start? Maybe if we treat these kids like they can have a bright future, some of them will actually... believe it? Why are distraught young kids in the inner city treated like criminals who simply haven't learned how to shoot? Why is a distraught middle class suburban white kid stuffed with medication and sent to the rainbow room for nappies? Does either system work? At least we talk about the second system for a minute, when someone shoots up a school. Do we *ever* talk about the first system? Nope. We just comfort ourselves with images of [Michelle Pfeiffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_ShmAq4sqc), [Jim Belushi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9ps--2lySY) or [Hillary Swank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhXMJlm852A) or [fucking Meryl Streep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p50UW7zhM4) making it all better, so we can *pretend* that this is what's happening downtown. Oh, and don't worry, [disillusioned white kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQht2yOX9Js)... you get [Robin Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zivL4GgPxKg).**4) Liberal Ignorance and Hypocrisy**A reporter reminded Kanye what he said about George Bush, and essentially asked Kanye why he doesn't *also* think *this* Republican President is racist. Kanye: &gt; "So — and that’s a move. One of the moves that I love that liberals try to do — the liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism, because they know that we are very proud, emotional people. **So when I said “I like Trump” to, like, someone that’s liberal, they’ll say, “Oh, but he’s racist.” You think racism could control me?** Oh, that don’t stop me. That’s an invisible wall." Directly after Kanye says this...... a reporter asks the following: &gt; "But you don’t think — you reject those who say he’s racist?"This reporter... I don't know, man. He didn't even *pretend* to be listening to what Kanye was saying. It's like the reporter just heard "I don't believe... Trump... is racist," and wanted Kanye basically given him a weaponized soundbite. Kanye responds: &gt; "On your question — and you had *one* question; we’re going to do it to another question."The reporter: &gt; (Laughs.) Okay.	 What the hell are you laughing at, dude? Kanye just called out this bullshit, and your impulse is to double down on the *same bullshit*?Take this interaction together with the SNL episode, and Don Lemon's reaction to this interview. If they don't *have* to listen to you, they won't... they'll just shut you off. If they *do* have to listen to you, they'll just nod and smile, but they won't hear what you are saying. Instead of hearing and absorbing, they are positioning and packaging. *How can I lead this towards a bombshell soundbite? How can I use this interaction to talk about George Bush or Brett Kavanaugh, or the electoral college*? The Left comes to the table with talking points, and treats every interaction like a poker match. They are just staring at their cards the whole time, waiting for you to throw down a particular card, so they can lay out their hand. _____Obviously, there is a lot here. One reaction could be to actually listen to him, and take from it what you will. You don't have to worship the guy, or even agree with him. But can we at least make a good faith effort to listen to him, and *try* to hear what he's saying? Another reaction is to write it off completely, as crazy rantings, to avoid any opportunity to discuss *the very same issues* that everyone is talking about... to scroll through the video looking for the "wildest moments," kick out a story about his phone password, kick out another story about how he banged on *the Resolute Desk*, and call it a day.

Cowhaus [info] Possible med change I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 15 years ago. It took 5 years of different medications until I finally found lithium. I have been relatively stable for ten years. Last week, I was given some bad news. I have severe hyperthyroidism, most likely caused from the lithium. Tomorrow, I am going to see an endocrinologist who will be deciding if I need to change meds or if something else can be done. I am terrified. Finding the right meds was the most challenging time of my life. I had awful highs and lows, multiple allergic reactions and my marriage was on the rocks. I am worried that the next few months could be rough. I’m scared to have to learn to be unstable for a while and somehow manage to keep my life in order. I’m really glad I found this subreddit.

HavartiParty [info] I just woke up so this probably wont be quite as coherent as I would like, but whatever.  I encourage my clients to use "person first language"-instead of saying "I'm bipolar" use "I've been diagnosed with bipolar."  Your diagnosis does not define you, unless you let it.  You're a thousand things that are NOT related to your diagnosis, try defining yourself that way rather than by an illness.  When people are diagnosed with cancer they don't say "I'm cancer" so why is it that we tend to use a mental health diagnosis as a defining characteristic when describing ourselves?  I hope that makes sense, I was up for 1.2 million hours entering DAP notes. :D  [info]  [info] 1396271014
greenbriergoodsire [info] It sounds like you and I have some common ground in experience, though differing degrees I believe. I'm also 23, have been measured as having an above average intellect, and am going to a good school (at least I am now, one more bad semester and I'm calling it). At 19 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, then at 22 it changed to bipolar I w/psychotic features. About nine months later, I still had quasi-psychotic symptoms and I was told I have StPD, closely related but typically without true hallucinations or bizzarre delusions. The scattered, impossible to "herd" thought problems are still there, so the cognitive issues I definitely get. I get really frustrated with myself with regard to cognitive problems because I feel like I should be able to do it, and my brain is just gonna fail me more and more until people can't understand me at all. Most of the time I get my point across, but stress these past couple weeks has amped up all of that for me.In a general sense I dont know its the same worthlessness, but I am almost incapable of instigating social interaction because I get this picture of whoever it is rolling their eyes and letting the call go to voicemail because my friends don't actually like me, they're just indulging me out of pity. I don't have that self-directed shame or anything, but I do get caught up worrying for like 30-45 minutes that all my friends are eventually going to gradually chip away and I'll have nobody. Those are the hardest for me to handle, because I  can see why others wouldn't be on board with me.As for finding something elevated to channel energy and time into, I've always gone creatively. I write and play bass to unwind, and for purpose in life I have stand-up comedy. That was when I found the "joy in life," when I started writing jokes and realized that the world isn't as odd as I see it, but it's not far off. There's also something to be said for looking for reasons to laugh, even passively. If there's anything you used to do that you head just clicked with and you understood viscerally, pursue that. It may give you a good flotation device. [info] None [info] 1467796720

thogervo [info] Constant inner monologue? Hey folks,I've been diagnosed with bipolar II, and when I feel I'm in a hypomanic episode I sometimes feel as if I have an inner monologue that cannot be stopped. It feels similar to the typical 'quick thoughts' of mania, but it's usually in my own inner narrative or augmented with little tidbits of songs that have been stuck in my head.It can get unbelievably distracting, and it seems to be more likely to happen if I sleep poorly the night before... Or (and this is odd) if I've been intensively reading books that have many characters. For example, I recently finished A Song of Ice And Fire and throughout the books, after reading for extended periods of time, I would (involuntarily)  invent new dialogues for the characters or keep a running dialogue going, in my head, of what certain characters had said with typical responses by other characters.Anyone have any similar experiences?

I have no experience in psychology, I'm diagnosed with bipolar II with psychotic features (but pretty sure I am schizoaffective, I've been experiencing psychotic episodes since childhood).

asocialwarrior [info] Hi there! I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15, but my symptoms had been visible a year earlier. Uni wasn't difficult until my very last year (this academic year), and my downward spiral started last semester when I was dealing with a sad break up. Towards the end of last semester, I was very bad and decided to stop taking my meds because I felt like they weren't "curing" me after all these years (which was a huge lie that my illness persuaded me into swallowing because I had been stabilised since being on meds). I was well-surrounded and always have been, but gosh I was a pain in the arse to deal with. I was hurt and had a hard time trusting people, even my closest friends and my family. I refused to be fished out of the abyss. I started drinking just so I could pass out instead of sobbing myself to sleep. I started smoking so that I could just feel something. I stopped booking and going to my psychiatric appointments. And guess what? It was the dumbest decision my whole life! I realised how much it was affecting me and my trust circle. Everything was shit. My depressive episode was way longer than my hypomanic phase and I couldn't bear it. I wanted so badly to feel joy again, even if it was just two seconds. This semester has been shitty and my marks have suffered because of my stubbornness. I ended up being transported to Montreal Gen for suicidal ideationat some point. I have however recently resumed my meds (switched from Seroquel XR to IR) and seeing my psychiatrist, in addition to seeing a therapist for the first time my entire life. I have never been better honestly, but I have just realised that I started recovering at the very last moment of my BA. Somehow I have stopped caring about my grades and academic performance. I don't know why. Grades used to matter a lot to me and I would just fight until my last breath to get the grade I wanted/thought I deserved. But somewhere in my struggle, I lost my interest in everything and got on my way to recovery land at the very end. I don't regret the late realisation/recovery though. I know right now I'm standing in a war zone, but I'm happy to finish my degree and I'm happy with myself. I'm happy to have learnt to take care of myself, even though it's just very simple things. Just remember that you have the agency to choose to get out of the mess. It's okay to make baby steps and it's okay to fall the first few times. I know McGill can be ruthless and unhelpful and sometimes you have to seek outside help (Suicide Action saved my life, but you can also call crisis centres like Le Transit or Tracom - Le Transit has been particularly great in my experience). Free group therapies at Revivre or Maison St Jacques are also great resources if you speak French, or if you're on Blue Cross insurance, you could use Empower Me which is a free 24/7 counselling resource (http://studentcare.ca/rte/en/McGillUniversityundergraduatestudentsSSMU_EmpowerMe_EmpowerMe).

pipette_on [info] Bipolar and Getting Healthy (Help) Hi all,I know variations of this topic have been posted before, but I feel like they have revolved around eating disorders and I’m not quite looking for feedback from that realm. I am being discharged from a partial hospitalization program for mental illness on Thursday after being in it for three weeks. In this program, we were fed all three meals and had snacks available to eat during the day, so pretty much everything we needed was provided for us. I was diagnosed with bipolar II and started taking the proper medications about two weeks ago now, but it will still take a bit of time for the meds to really sit in. After a lot of treatment and a diagnosis, I realized that the biggest reason why I have struggled with my weight is because I behave so differently between my highs and lows.In my highs, I’m working out and have no issues with counting calories because honestly, I’m not that hungry. The tricky thing here though, is that because I’m not hungry, I have no problem going from “1500 cals? Let’s do 1200! No 1000! No 800!” which obviously isn’t healthy. Once when I was on anti depressants and taking them consistently, I lost 50 lbs in about three months. (If you’re bipolar and take antidepressants, they can push you into mania).In my lows though, I struggle with binge eating and using food as a way to punish myself sometimes. I used to purge sometimes but it hasn’t really been a thing.  I struggle especially because I can’t really differentiate between being hungry or full. I talked to the nutritionist about this, and the hope is that when I’m stabilized, I’ll be able to make rational, reasonable decisions. She also suggested I start eating 3 meals and two snacks a day in small quantities to help bring back my full/hungry signals.  The thing I’m most worried about though, is that I’ve realized that I don’t really know what reasonable is because I haven’t really experienced it. There is also a part of me that fears that if I start counting calories again I’ll start doing what I used to do and decrease my limit more and more. I also am trying to get into a normal workout routine, but again, reasonably. I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to go about fitness reasonably, especially with mental health issues too. I’m 5’6” and weigh about 220 lbs and I really want to be strong and fit again because I used to be an athlete and didn’t start gaining a ton of weight until I was 22. I’m 26 now.Thanks.

So my psych wanted to try generic Wellbutrin (whatever the name is) and even the introductory dose seriously effed me up.

ashalisig17 [info] I've actually been wanting to get this off of my chest. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (annoying ass mood swings) nearly a year ago, and I'm on a medication that has stabilized my mood swings. My psychiatrist told my parents that it explains why I would sometimes be unnecessarily irritable, and it made a lot of sense. My mom has taken this is as "every time she's mad, it's just the crazy talking". I don't remember why, but a month or so ago we had started arguing about something on our way home, and my sister (who was in the car with us, but didn't know what happened) asked my mom why I was angry. My mom responded with "it's just that time of the month" and did that hand gesture of twirling her finger next to her head implying that I was crazy. Maybe this isn't a huge deal but it really hurt my feelings that my mom doesn't take my feelings seriously just because I have a mental disorder. She's "apologized" but I know there wasn't any meaning behind it, my mom never thinks she's at fault for anything. I say "apologized" since she only said sorry because my dad told her she should, she didn't actually care. [info] None [info] 1559416215

hippiehen54 [info] Three doctors have said bipolar pretty much means you have bipolar disorder. Think about bipolar just like you would if they said you have diabetes. Take the meds=controlling the disorder. Stop the meds=the disorder will control you. I've had b/p disorder since I was in my teens. No one diagnosed anything until I was in my late twenties when they put me on a tricyclic med. It wasn't until I was in my early 50s that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I never talked to the doctor when I was ecstatic or full of energy. Only when I was depressed. Now we know the anti depressants triggered mania. A lot of the meds today weren't developed back in my early years of treatment.I still have times where I decide to do something that later doesn't make sense And I still can't forgive myself for choices I made even when I can clearly see the influence of the disorder.

scoobitywoop [info] I don’t want to take my meds I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 years ago. I was put on medication and I never felt happy, I felt like I was watching everyone around me go through life and I was out of touch so I stopped taking them. I hated that feeling of never really being happy. I also couldn’t cry so I felt like I couldn’t be sad either, and sometimes you just need a good cry ya know? I eventually stopped going to therapy too, I didn’t like different meds being pushed on me or being told to try other ones. I love myself now and I feel much more happy. Sometimes my emotions can get the best of me but I have definitely found what works (most of the time) for me. Bipolar has such a harsh stigma so no one knows that I have it and even fewer know I’m unmedicated. Though medication works for some I hated the feeling. And now I can be as happy or as sad as I want and feel the full spectrum of emotions. [info] None [info] 1563486557

Ravido-the-Clown [info] Lamotrogine withdrawal Hi! I’m new to this reddit.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 2 years ago. I haven’t really talked to anybody I’m close with extensively about it. Never really related to anyone regarding how I function, so I feel kind of like the black sheep in the herd.To the main part of this post:I started on lamotrogine about a year ago (400mg).It works decently, nowhere close to fixing anything but I guess that’s to be expected.Sometimes I forget to take my medicine (I take it morning and before I go to bed, 200mg per)I’ve been browsing around the internet for withdrawal symptoms, but there isn’t really anything stating something substantial happens. Here’s what happens to me (this is consistant with every time I forget to take the medicine)Whenever I miss both the morning and night doses, an awful feeling starts crawling in. I start to feel more and more sluggish, my balance is weakened, when I stand or walk I feel a pushing or pressure on my chest, breathing becomes heavy and I am overall dizzy. My vision also becomes ‘blurry’ of some sorts, not badly but enough that I feel there’s something wrong in the vision department. Normal functions like forming sentences becomes difficult.These symptoms worsen rapidly over time bit by bit until I take my medicine again. Every time this happens it gets severe enough to the point that I have to ask someone to drive me to the closest 24/7 pharmacy. I’m on the verge of being too dizzy to walk by myself at all. It’s like my brain just shuts down incrementally. It feels like slowly losing brain function I guess you could say.Are there anyone else on here with similar experiences? I assumed this was normal until I looked it up.(Edit) Thanks for the responses! [info] None [info] 1551251844

dreamyproject [info] Ooh, I'd like to enter! OK, so my best girl is obviously Honoka. I watched the anime for LLSIF in 2014, around when I first realized something was kind of "off" with me. And it made me cry a lot to see Honoka say the things I was saying to myself ("I'll never be as good as them" re: A-RISE in season one) but then, in the end, with all of her friends by her side, she never gave up. Not long after I watched the anime I was diagnosed with bipolar, and years later I still look up to her a lot because I have she gets me up when I feel lost and down. She's one of my inspirations to never give up, even when I feel the lowest of low, and her shikishi is right across from my bed on my nightstand so I can always look at her to cheer me on with a "faito dayo!" Last two little reasons: I would love that account is because it has a UR Nico and Nico is right behind Honoka in my fav girls! I've never rolled a UR Nico on my main and would love to have her. And despite my ex-dolphin tendencies I don't have an idolized UR on any account I've ever had.The best thing that happened to me in SIF was probably scouting New Years Honoka on my first JP account because UR of best girl! And I love "hatsumoude" themed cards because while I studied abroad in Japan, it was one of the things I really wanted to do. (Unfortunately I lost that account when my phone just decided to dump a whole bunch of data so that's another reason having her idolized would be aces. Thankfully someone was nice enough to trade me an unidolized Taishou Honoka though!)And now that my story is done, I love Ene the most and I played her songs a lot on rhythm games while I was in Japan!

meow_mixxer [info] I am a closet borderliner.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15, after a suicide attempt. Sometime in the next couple years, I remember it was changed to borderline personality disorder, then back to bipolar with the next psychiatrist. Fast forward though years of self harm and failed relationships and electric emotions to age 27. (Those years were also filled with college and children and art and other Really Good Things.) I earned a degree in psychology and landed a job in a group home for adults living with mental illness. I don't think I have the correct words to express how much I love my job and my residents. I love being at work equally as much as being home with my children. They are like family. They depend on me and a few other colleagues.... For everything.At any rate, I get a front row seat to the current state of psychiatric care and mental illness in this geographical area. Half promising, half disheartening. I work with some residents who have a BPD diagnosis. Where some of my colleagues see manipulation and evil (yes, I've heard that word used) I see a person wading through their past trauma to get through the day. I see a person aching for love and simultaneously ferociously guarding their heart against hurt. The stigma sticks out like a sore ugly thumb. I see how my colleagues frown disapprovingly at the BPD diagnosis on intake paperwork. I see it.I could go on; I won't.I'm still diagnosed with bipolar disorder, unspecified type. I've never felt that bipolar quite fit me. It's like wearing one shoe that's too big and one that's too small. The only time it really resonated with me was during a brief period after my divorce, when I was abusing alcohol and pills on the daily. Drinking my brains out then taking enough stimulants to keep me up so I could drink more and just sleep the next day or the day after. Of course my moods were wild.Then one day I was browsing the DSM and it hit me; they were right all those years ago, I'm borderline. It all makes sense. All the pieces fit. The more I read, the more thoroughly I'm convinced.However.I don't know if I even feel comfortable talking to my psychiatrist about this. I'm afraid, number one, that she will think it's preposterous that an 18 year diagnosis is incorrect. I'm also afraid she'll look at me differently, treat me differently, trust me less. Is this silly? Maybe. Now, I have spent 18 years becoming comfortable with the bipolar diagnosis and rejecting the shame I felt. I can finally look any doctor or colleague or family member in the eye and mention my bipolar diagnosis without flinching. It feels like starting over.I'm 99% sure that BPD is the correct diagnosis for me. It may be just a couple words and a few numbers in my medical records, but it's so much more than that to me.I just wanted to get this off my chest.Thanks for reading. [info] None [info] 1549213553

LazilyGlowingNoFood [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I do not take my medication because I do not like it, and as a result my academic success has fallen since it began to develop out of latency. Many people think that I am extroverted because of how wild I can be sometimes, but its just an affect of my disorder. I'm not quite sure what will happen to me as a result of my refusal to take my medications; both polar moods can provide me with great inspiration and interesting experiences, but it will probably ruin me.

ediesweet [info] I was in a similar situation to your daughter. I was a little younger than her when I was diagnosed with bipolar. To this day my father thinks I am making it up, that bipolar isn't real, and that I'm just mentally weak. Being around him was very upsetting and infuriating for me, because I always considered him intelligent and wise and I couldn't believe he could be so ignorant. I think it's for the best if she doesn't see him until he learns to empathize. I can only speak from my point of view but that is what I did. It seems like your daughter is taking positive steps and is getting better. I think things should stay as is for now. Good luck, you're a great mother!

Hey Everyone,&amp;#x200B;I am currently awaiting a referral back into the mental health services, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2016 following a period of elevated mood (manic). I have had my mood decline the last few months but I am confused over my diagnoses and condition.&amp;#x200B;Some of my symptoms  I experience doesn't seem to match those that others have. I don't really have anyone to talk too about the condition so I could be wrong but I have limited experiences of discussing my issues. I am extremely paranoid I am being watched, I feel like there are cameras over my house and there are people watching me and judging my life. There is a big mirror in the bathroom and I feel like it's a one-way mirror and a camera behind it. I don't want to tell my girlfriend or doctor about it because they might think I am crazy or pretending but I am really worried about it. I don't like showering because I feel like I am being watched and recorded.&amp;#x200B;Is paranoia a symptom of bipolar disorder? sometimes I get really confused. [info] None [info] 1551369654

BipolarTypeOne [info] Ulgra,Whenever you start something new in life, you start from first principles and with beginner lessons and techniques. It doesn't matter if it's a sport, programming language, cooking, whatever. This illness isn't that much different. You start with basic techniques and move up as you learn. Decades of medical experience treating patients with bipolar disorder have taught clinicians to start with mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, sedatives upon first diagnosis which they tune over time. This is the medically indicated way to treat this illness. Someone who is just starting treatment or considering it, should start at the beginning by following medical advice and taking their prescribed medications. Suggesting otherwise is unethical as it steers them away from proven treatments and worsens their outcomes.After a few years trying lots of medications and living with the illness you become more knowledgeable about yourself and about which medications have worked and have not (something you cannot at the beginning). At this point, if the medications have worked poorly or are a direct immediate threat to your health, it might make sense to start considering med-free as your other options have been exhausted. This is not a recommendation to make to someone who is just starting out.People who have this illness and are untreated are in a very poor position to learn how to "think critically" about an illness they don't yet understand much about. That is a time where their focus must be on medical advice and stabilization, not on how to avoid taking medications because they read somewhere that yoga and a better diet might do the trick. It is so hard just to get people to seek professional help--telling them they don't have to take medications is fundamentally irresponsible. I can't tell you how many times I've heard someone say "Oh, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but I've never taken any medications so I don't think it's that bad." That is what you are enabling.Holding out the idea that there is a point in the future where medications can be discarded is also unethical and against medical advice. There are special cases and considerations, but these are a minority and must be treated that way.This kind of "guidance", take your medications, is as straightforward as "quit smoking because it is bad for your health". It is unambiguous and not debated by any reputable clinicians. Your thoughts and feelings about smoking do not change the fact that it's bad for you. The same goes for the need to take medications. People who are just starting out should focus on the basic rules as promulgated by medical mental health experts, not the rare exceptions. In this case, it's "you must take your medications." When I was diagnosed, I needed my psychiatrist to unwaveringly tell me that I needed to be hospitalized and stabilized on medications after which I would need to keep taking medications. The worst thing he could have done is said "well maybe you'll do ok without meds. why don't you think critically about this and get back to me if you need anything else?". That guidance to take medications remains the same decades later. It is the only responsible advice to give a new patient. Period. There's nothing flaky about guidance. It isn't a shot in the dark. It is the best known course of action as determined by thousands of clinicians analyzing decades worth of data to discover what works and what doesn't. Your car may seem to drive fine on bald tires, but most don't and even yours should be changed according to guidance (laws) provided by your state.People can decide not to take their medications, it's just that in the vast majority of cases, that's a really bad decision. I think we, who have been dealing with this illness all of lives, understand that point and should guide others towards medical guidance not provide them rationalizations for blowing it off.

jaydenh [info] Lithium and mood stabilisation. Hey guys, I have been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and put on lithium, for 2 weeks no, i'm on 500mg and it pretty much has no effect, also on latuda(anti-psychotic, 1 month) 40mg and seroquel IR (3 months) 200mg (sleep).It almost feels like my hypomania can't be stopped with this combo. Wouldn't a significant amount of my dopamine be blocked at this point?How can I be constantly hypomanic for 6 days and be on lithium, my friend tried 250mg and was FLOORED.He said he felt extremely dedated and drunk, clurring his words etc and sleeping for like 12-14 hours, I'm lucky to get 7 hours sleep myself..I understand i'm tolerant to seroquel and probably getting used to latuda but this is ridiculous, I've had serious arguments with friends, coworkers and family due to my expansive mindset and irritability/rages. (usually at retards at work, or stupid people in public, Iwould like to believe its justified, since theyre retards, but even that sounds like a hypomanic thing to say.Anyway, send your experiences to this space, I'm keen to get an idea of how other people experience such combinations, especially the lithium side of things, thanks for taking the time to read this :) [info] None [info] 1555056559

Namaslayy [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 19 (I'm 31 now). The best thing you can do before seeing a therapist is to keep track of your moods. The therapist is going to want to see if you have rapid cycling, to be able to determine the type of meds you may need. However, the only other thing that is going to determine it is your life, lifestyle, and behavior. You won't know until you see a professional. But please do it because you've got to trust your gut too when it comes to your mental health.  [info] None [info] 1516315992

herbistheword [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at age 22! In my experience, life has been a total 180 since my diagnosis... So many of the things that, up until that moment, felt to me like personal failures and flaws were explained by my disorder. I learned to spot signs of the onset of an episode (for me, I develop bouts of insomnia before any behavior effects kick in. If I can can get myself to sleep during these pre-episodic symptoms, I can abort the swing completely!) and my therapist and medication have helped me develop into a more grounded person that I'm proud to be.Basically- it sounds scary because there's such a stigma associated with it. It implies that your life and emotional state is out of your control... but in reality, a correct diagnosis is the moment you get to reclaim your control.Don't let yourself be defined by a disorder you have. Define yourself by the person you become and the actions you take. If you wanna talk ever, or have any questions, please shoot me a PM. You aren't alone! [info] None [info] 1444937925

awkwardaster [info] I have Bipolar 1 and also respond well to medication. I haven't gone to therapy much, but lately because of a recent episode I will be attending therapy. I have psychotic manic episodes and rarely get depressed. When I am exposed to extreme stress and have a hard time sleeping, I will have racing thoughts and then get into a manic episode. When I'm having a manic episode I typically get extremely philosophical (I'm normally not) and sometimes paranoid about the government, my family, etc. I will think that other people are living with a blindfold on and I'm the only one who can "see the light". Sometimes I become "promiscuous" or want to buy things I don't need, but I typically do not harm myself or others. If the episode is really bad I will have outbursts and panic attacks as well as paranoia.   I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 17 (I am currently 22), in the spring of my senior year of high school. I have been hospitalized because of it. Fortunately I have an extremely supportive family who always help me recover after an episode. Since my diagnosis I have only had 4 bad episodes. I know that I need to live a life where I have a good self care routine and am exposed to low levels of stress. I can get by on just one mood stabilizer when my stress levels are low, but when they increase I need to take an antipsychotic. I would prefer to not take medication, but it is something I need because of my condition.  [info] None [info] 1381423922

withdelight [info] I have both. I was diagnosed with bipolar not long before I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's. Honestly, my diet needs some work so I really can't be of much help there...but I do take synthroid and cytomel for the thyroid, and wellbutrin, lamictal and cymbalta for the bipolar. I have a psychiatrist who deals with my psych meds and an endocrinologist who deals with the thyroid, but when I get labs for my thyroid they usually send the results to my psychiatrist as well to keep him in the loop. My labs have been consistently in a good range for several years now. As far as fatigue, I do have a lot of fatigue and always have, but since going on medication for my thyroid I've found the fatigue to be more related to my psych medication; for example, I was on seroquel for several years, which made me exhausted! So besides the thyroid, you may also want to do some research on whatever psych meds you're taking, in case that may be part of it.Oh, and I also take a multivitamin, plus fish oil for omega-3s, every day, per my last psychiatrist's recommendation.

AffableJoker [info] It's been so long since I played the med merry-go-round, it's hard to remember what did what.Before I was diagnosed with bipolar I was diagnosed with psychotic disorder NOS. So I basically had a psychotic episode seemingly on its own, but I'm pretty sure I was depressed at the time and was just withholding that information as it was viewed as a sign of weakness in my family (at the time).So my first round of medication was antipsychotics on their own.Zyprexa was first, but it caused a huge amount of weight gain. It did stop the psychosis, but I went from very underweight to overweight very fast. I was also tired all the time, pretty much spent the year sleeping.I stayed on that for a year or so, then ended up back in the hospital multiple times for mood symptoms and got rediagnosed as bipolar and was moved to a different psychiatrist.So then I was put on Depakote, didn't do much. No side effects but didn't really help.Lamictal, didn't helpTegretol, didn't helpSo then we decided to try other kinds of stuffLithium, did help but I was right at the cusp of the toxicity level so we kept trying.Abilify, helped but made me tired all the time.Risperdal, helped but a ton of weight gainSeroquel, helped but made me a little tired. Not as tired as the others though.Geodon, absolutely terrible side effects. I don't even want to think about it.Saphris, terrible.Gabapentin, absolutely nothing, no side effects or anything.Citalopram, made me manicLatuda, made me super tiredWellburtin, made me super manic.

babyforks [info] We just seem like good friends now. He asks about my day, how I felt when I was diagnosed with bipolar, how’d the break up go. No one else asked me how my diagnosis has affected me before. I think he may just want to travel because he wants to see more. It’s only been a few days since we’ve reconnected, but they have been nice. I don’t think we could do long distance though. That would be selfish. He also has one semester left of college and I have three. We’re both design majors so it feels so good to have common ground with someone. When we dated in high school we went to different high schools and neither of us drove. We never really had a chance. We were both immature.

shitdownhill [info] Just diagnosed with bipolar. Hi guys. Yesterday I was diagnosed with bipolar. I am scheduled to see a psychiatrist and nutritionist. I originally was so hopeful for an answer, but immediately after she said it felt so overwhelming and devastating. I just feel empty now and confused. Where do I start? Are there resources about bipolar other than on reddit and webmd? I am worried now because what if the diagnosis is wrong? What if it’s BPD? They are so similar. I am concerned about the effects mood stabilizers could have on my brain anatomy and physiology if this is the wrong diagnosis? How do clinicians differentiate between the two? I have a biology background. And then how the hell do I continue my life living as “my normal.” Where do I go from here? I feel so lost. Edit: spelling [info] None [info] 1523715984

divineintervention17 [info] Okay.   I don't think that my family was as rich as yours, but we were upper-middle class and my dad (and to a lesser extent my mum) did see people with extreme mental health issues, or homeless people, as inferior or forever damaged or lost causes- this extended to the homeless. I think that you might feel this way at a subconscious level too. My parents had a shift of perspective when I was diagnosed with bipolar after doing a serious of erratic things that eventually landed me in a hospital (due to a drug overdose). I know that schizophrenia is harder to handle, after all one of my best friends from high school unfortunately suffers from it, but I believe they are stigmatised in a similar fashion.   Anyway, I am fairly stable now with a well paying job from my undergrad degree in writing and am also doing a masters of historical research. My parents were (happily) surprised that a person with bipolar could be accomplished in any way. People are not only their illness, they are nuanced and potentially capable and are not just write offs. I hate telling people that I have bipolar because often times they will start subtly studying me like I am an illness and not an individual. Don't make this mistake.  [info] None [info] 1529234034
trashy_cakes [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 before adhd even though I've had the latter for longer. Once my bipolar was under control, I told my psych that I've been having trouble concentrating and staying on task, getting distracted easily etc so she prescribed me Adderall. Basically I double checked the symptoms of adhd before my appointment, mentally checking off which ones I have and went in with the intention to get Adderall. Don't ask for it specifically though, at least not until they tell you what they're giving you then maybe you can request it [info] None [info] 1564486760
weHenley [info] 15. My dad would offer me alcohol when I was depressed (I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years later), and when I refused would not speak to me for days. So eventually I just became his drinking buddy, which lead to alcohol abuse then alcoholism. I wish I'd said a firm no and not let him emotionally blackmail me. Alcohol has screwed up a lot of things in my life and I can't get that time back. [info] None [info] 1546254174
subcuta [info] Regret impulsive legal name change Hi everyone (x-posted with small changes to r/bipolar, but I really look forward to your thoughts here on this sub!)About 4 years ago I legally changed my middle and last names. My reasons weren't entirely meritless but in retrospect I regret everything. I would appreciate any reactions or advice you may have as I prepare to change it again.For context I am 33F, never married. I was undoubtably exhibiting hypomanic behaviors/symptoms at the time (I'm diagnosed with bipolar II disorder) and was also struggling with alcohol, relationships, and finding a job after graduation from a program I frankly should have failed out of. I was awfully proud of myself for the name change at the time (naturally, given my mental state) but now I think it is juvenile and silly: both the names I chose and the act of the changing.(I also struggle with codependence and a dysfunctional childhood, which I believe is the root of my struggles with mental illness. Since working on codependence, I have been more content/stable than ever before.)Anyway, it occurred to me about a year ago that there was nothing stopping me from changing it back or to something else. I considered:* **Keeping my new/made up surname as a middle name** (dropping my new/made up middle name and not re-adding my birth middle name) **and changing my legal surname back to my birth surname*** **Changing my entire name back to my birth name** (dropping made up middle and surnames, adding back birth middle and surnames)* **Letting my mother choose** my new nameI had the idea of letting my mother choose recently while musing with her (we have repaired our relationship) about why it was hard for me to decide what to do about my name. I told her I regretted taking the issue of my name into my own hands and I just wanted nothing more to do with it. Perhaps on a whim, I asked her to choose my new name.She agreed, and I told her she could decide whatever she wanted: my original name or anything else. After a few days, she decided on keeping my birth first and last names and adding a *totally new* middle name,\* which she personally likes, sounds nice, and she believes has meaning for me (Renée, meaning "rebirth").*\*My birth middle name is one of those kind of filler names that is very common in certain ethnic/religious groups and is almost all girls' middle name on my dad's side of the family.... (my parents are no longer married). I never cared much for it, but it's common for people on my dad's side to call me FirstName BirthMiddleName (still).*I think having my mother choose is potentially a brilliant and poetic ending to a weird, uncomfortable story from an equally weird, uncomfortable time in my life. The only thing holding me back is the idea of having *YET ANOTHER (!)* made up name. Like, when does the crazy stop?? I know this feeling is more about fear of what others will think (strangers and also my dad/family) than anything I feel myself. Still, I found this whole ordeal painful and am understandably reluctant to go through it again, therefore I am also leaning toward just changing it back entirely to my birth name. And then I worry that doing that would basically disrespect my mother after I asked her to help me with this. I also like the name she chose a lot.Getting a sense of what others think about this will (I think) help me come to some peace with whatever I decide. Perhaps you (being a name nerd) have some ideas about what kinds of questions I should consider as I make this decision. Or if you think you really do know what is best (maybe you've been through something like this), I am all ears. Thank you for reading.**UPDATE:** Thank you to the user who suggested adding Renée as a second middle name in addition to my birth middle name. I had thought about doing that using my current/new/"made up" last name as a second middle name, but hadn't thought about it in this iteration (for some reason). Renée works well with my birth middle name as they are both French and I can even hyphenate them easily (Marie-Renée). I ran it by my mom and she loves it, too! I am really happy with this name and decision and I really appreciate all your support and enthusiasm. Thanks everyone! [info] None [info] 1534266455
magicelastic [info] Paranoia / hallucinations? Help? I sometimes get very scared that something (a black entity / Satan / a demon) is coming for me and it is so terrifying. I will also hear things (knocking, light walking, small physical noises) and see dark shapes. Usually it ends up in me starting at the door or ceiling with the lights on until I go to sleep, and doesn’t happen unless I am already in a depressive state and / or it’s super late. I’ve had this problems since I was a kid (abused Jehovah’s witness kid scared of Satan), but it was very bad last night. From 1AM to 6AM, I stared at the door in the bedroom and only spoke on whispers because I could feel it coming for me. I was so terrified and my boyfriend was trying to help (saying it’s not there, trying to get me to look away, turning lights on), but I couldn’t move or stop rocking aggressively or do anything but keep watch. I also hyperventilate a few times because my boyfriend tried to get me to look away and I just freaked out. Do any of y’all have experience with this? What the fuck basically?Edit: I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 14 and I’ve been in a depressive state for months atm [info] None [info] 1526687722

Oakland_Raiders [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and ADHD 8 years ago. I have done ADA paperwork for accommodation in college and I have received treatment consistently since my diagnoses maintaining a record of my disability and my belonging to a protected group.I am a teacher, my principal and vice-principal are egotistical, control freaks who have been trying to make my life hell and push me out since October. The way they have gone about this has left a trail of inconsistency, contract violations, and unjustifiable treatment. Had I submitted ADA paperwork in August, I would have more than sufficient evidence to prove I was harassed. However, up until I turn in my paperwork on Monday, I have been nothing but a white male in their eyes, but that doesn't mean I haven't had protected status the entire time, they just didn't know about it.I want to know if I can claim I was harassed while having protected status, not necessarily because of it.

dublinhank [info] Mental illness is always a bummer. Just because one is more debilitating than the other, doesn't make your situation any less valid. Depression sucks. Anxiety sucks. The good thing is it seems like you've made a bit of a revelation. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about seven years ago. Like you, I used this as an excuse to justify all of my shitty behavior, even when I knew it wasn't the cause. The most important thing that I realized is people will only be understanding for so long, if it all. If you're an asshole, it doesn't matter that you're a bipolar asshole. The diagnosis is important so that you can learn the things you need to do to live your best life. [info] None [info] 1539824451
colethania [info] Guys there’s anyone here who also has sleep paralysis in a daily basis caused by bipolar? So I always had episodes of sleep paralysis, since I was a kid but there were not so regularly. Since I was diagnosed with bipolar, that was when I had 14 years old I’m now 21 but back then I didn’t know that what I was having was sleep paralysis I thought it was nightmare and hallucinations, so two years ago I discovered by googling that I was experiencing SP, since I’ve struggle a lot with it, earlier this year I decided to see a “sleep doctor” sleep specialist and I did that test that you spend the night in a lab and they watch your sleep. So the result came in and I went to the doctor appointment and she said that everything was normal but the SP happens to me regularly because of my bipolar and there’s basically nothing that can be done about that, she said that the medicine she would prescribe to help with SP would affect my bipolar and it could initiate manic and depressive episodes so I cried and everytime I go to sleep and I have a very aggressive and confusing  experience with SP i get bitter and bitter but also hopeless cause I can’t even take a nap during the day it’s literally a constant fear of falling asleep. But like I’m dealing you know, somethings are not on my control I guess, I can try to be more positive and be more racional during the episode but still I can’t be free from them.

0aabceh [info] Relationships and pursuing relationships leave us vulnerable and sometimes feeling stupid comes with the territory. It happens to most people, it's definitely happened to me. I am sorry your "friend" or her friend "set you up" but it sounds like you made the right move steering clear of them. The "shy" guy sounds like a good one to have dodged as well. Any guy who is going to interrogate you and then ask for a secret relationship is a hard pass and has some weird complex or something. How would you explain that to someone? Well in a way you kind of just explained it to me (us) and it doesn't sound all that bizarre or out of the ordinary. Sometimes it takes a long time for us to meet the people we are supposed to, maybe some of us won't meet them. Maybe there are no people we're "meant" to meet and it's just dumb luck you come across someone you connect with. Maybe we can influence our luck by changing our scenario or actions. It's hard to say, it would be awesome if there was a guide with procedures and we could just follow that and BOOM Boyfriend! or BOOM Girlfriend! I think the best we can try to do is be honest with ourselves (you are) and try to look forward to the next opportunity and be prepared.I can empathize with the idea of feeling undesirable because of mental health issues. My dad killed himself, I am diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, "insanity" is rife in my family. So firstly, how the hell could anyone ever be attracted or find something so damaged appealing or desirable? Two, even if I was in that situation how could I in good conscience have a biological child knowing how fucking insane I have been? Those questions still really bother me now and I don't have answers. Most of my relationships now are brief because if I find someone who seems attracted to me I lose attraction to them because I hate myself, why would they like me?  [info] None [info] 1523335790

Hydroelectric_dam [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 13. I am now 28 and in remission after years of counseling and treatment. Ultimately, I found the counseling and delving into philosophy and myself far more beneficial for my recovery than the drugs ever were, but I would be dead if I didn't have both. Based on what you just said about dosages, etc., I believe you probably have been diagnosed as well. Believe me when I say I understand wanting to get away from traditional meds. I urge you, however, to really think about the effects you are describing. It does not sound like you are experiencing remission, it sounds like you are hypomanic: you have it all figured out, what you have found "is love for everything and everyone" , "mystical effects" of the treatment you came up with.  I know how incredible it feels, but you are not better, and the crash that is coming is not worth it.   Do this microdosing thing if you want, but please at least be in counseling if you are trying a non-traditional approach. Please don't fight this battle alone, we don't all make it when we do.

ipoviged [info] How to rekindle friendships with people I pushed away while depressed? I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder last summer, and everything started making sense to me. It took me 6 months to get in to see a psychiatrist, and I’ve been on lamictal for a few months now. I realized that I had been so depressed for the last two years that I’ve pushed away basically every friend I’ve ever had. I only have one friend left in my life that I’ve known for more than a year. I’m starting to realize that I really want that human connection again, but I just don’t know where to start.

AstralMarmot [info] Poor impulse control just screwed up a important relationship at my dream job. Here's how I'm dealing with it. Apologies in advance for the length of this post.I have been a professional organizer since I dropped out of college at 19. I've mostly worked on political campaigns, which I have a strong aptitude for, and also meant I struggled financially when campaign season was off. At 27, I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI, in the 98 percentile (I'll never forget the doctor incredulously asking me, "You have a job??"). In 2017, I stopped drinking. Last year at 33, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. All of these things have fundamentally changed my life for the better. As everyone here knows, it is a process. But I've been doing the work, and I'm seeing the results.Last year, I ran a successful city-wide campaign that implements a new environmental fund that predominately, but not exclusively, benefits low-income and minority communities on a huge scale. That success opened many doors to me, and at the beginning of April, I was hired as Executive Director of a vibrant environmental activist non-profit. I finally have stable employment, a position of leadership, and the chance to use skills I've spent so much energy developing. I'm a woman of color in a mostly white city, and the recognition of the need to form coalitions between under-served communities and environmental orgs is a powerful new paradigm reshaping this movement. To be part of that shift, to be asked to bring my vision to bear in service of the climate crisis... it's my dream. I felt like I finally made it. (For the record, you're free to disagree with the politics, but that's not why I'm here).I knew the honeymoon wouldn't last. And today, I ended it in a big way.I was in a staff meeting, co-leading with the interim ED. We have very different styles of operating. She is meticulous, organized, extremely linear, and a morning person. I am... none of those things. I've learned how to cope for those deficiencies, but that difference has made my onboarding process difficult. In the meeting, she said something about how much I had to learn. I'm sure it wasn't personal. But I reacted. I Google chatted one of the staff members (a good friend of mine) that I was starting to get a little tired of being babied by the interim ED.That person was projecting the agenda. Everyone saw it. Everyone.I hurt someone I value, someone under a tremendous amount of stress, who has been working really hard to be an advocate and a resource for me. I embarrassed myself and her in front of the entire staff. I was rude, thoughtless, and disrespectful. And I belied something I believe about myself, that I am direct and deal with problems head on.I haven't felt shame like this in a long time.I have been very up front about my ADHD at work. The people I oversee are people I know and trust, and I want them to know where I'm strong and where I'm weak. Mostly that manifests as forgetfulness, leaving my shit everywhere, not tracking pieces of paper, and needing to move around constantly. Poor impulse control is something I've worked so hard on that... well, I forgot about it. I let my professionalism lapse and just blurted out a passing emotion in a way that caused real damage. It felt like I just stepped all the way back to square one.That's the context. What I really want to do, aside from getting this off my chest, is explain how I dealt with and am dealing with it.1. **I owned it.** Immediately after the meeting ended, I had a conversation with the Interim ED and said how sorry I was.2. **I shut up and listened.** I held space while she explained her hurt, and the frustrations she has with training me and the organization as a whole. Most of it is organizational, really. But my actions reinforced that feeling. And for a neurotypical, I must be insanely hard to work with.3. **I didn't make excuses.** Nothing can excuse shitty behavior like that, especially in a professional environment. My mental afflictions are mine to manage and no one else should be asked to do so.4. **We addressed the heart of the issue.** We went through the roots of our frustrations and sorted them out together. Frankly, I'm lucky she is level-headed and kind enough to have done so with me. If she had just walked off, I would have understood, but it would have made a bad situation even harder to fix.5. **We made a plan**. A plan to address the frustrations, and to continue the conversation. That space was mostly for expressing feelings, but we ended with concrete action that will help us both move forward.6. **I went home and cried my brains out.** I needed to get the feelings out. I needed to experience the shame, because it was there. 7. **I made myself let go of the shame.** Feelings are kind of like house guests; you honor them when they show up, treat them with respect, and also make sure they don't take up residence on your couch forever. Shame in particular is a hard one for me. My parents didn't believe in mental illness, and my struggles were attributed to a failure of will. I believed for so long that I was a shitty person, wasting my gifts because I wouldn't apply them. Now I know I couldn't apply them without help. I sought that help, and began the long process of dismantling the self-loathing I'd accrued over a lifetime. As Uncle Iroh said, "Pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. The true opposite of shame is humility."8. **I went back to work.** I had committed to facilitating a difficult conversation. It was a success, and I think that's due in part to the humility I brought with me - and of course to the amazing people willing to sit down and give their thoughts in a constructive context. I also made a point to honor the Interim ED's hard work. She has earned that and more.9. **I told people I trust about it.** That's all of you. This sub has inspired me so much. This is my first post here, but it feels like the right time. I have so much gratitude for all the wisdom you've given me, and for knowing I have a safe space to admit my failings.And now I'm going to play Stardew Valley, sleep, and start the day tomorrow on the road to being a better human.If you read all of this, thank you. I hope any of it helps you as much as you all have helped me.TL;DR: Hurt someone's feelings at work. I addressed it, owned it, processed it, and now I feel like I can move on.Edit: I clearly have no idea how to format. [info] None [info] 1557459990

jimzsche [info] How do you endure pregnancy without mood regulating medication? I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I do not plan to become pregnant anytime soon. But when that day comes, I’m worried I won’t be able to go through a full pregnancy since I was an absolute mess before going on lithium and lamictal. With raging pregnancy hormones and the absence of mood regulators, I’m almost certain I’d have a manic episode or just become completely psychotic, which I’m sure would be harmful to the baby... and also every other facet of my life. I’d rather not spend 9 months in a straight jacket.  So to women with bipolar disorder who have successfully navigated a pregnancy, how did it go? How did you do it? Are you OK?

11LeRichard11 [info] Do you think it's type 1 or 2? I'm trying to figure out if I have bipolar type 1 or 2. I know no one here can diagnose me, but still I value your opinion and feel like I would benefit from any closure I can get. I am a 26 year old male. I had my first affective episode (severe; depressive) when I was 12. It wasn't until I was 19, a freshman in college, that I had my first (hypo)manic episode. I started to get depressed/feel strange by the end of my first semester due in part to drug use. So I went to the doctor and was put on anti depressants. When I went back to school after winter break, I went through a traumatic experience during fraternity rush week. I suspect it was both the antidepressants and the rush-week trauma which triggered the (hypo)manic episode that would quickly ensue. During the episode, I totally lost control of myself. I was partying all the time and was really behind on all my work. I still felt like shit a lot of the time but was having a great time "living it up". I was set to fail all of my classes though: I was missing classes left and right, never doing homework, and failing all my exams. I wanted to catch up on my work, but I was so impulsive that as soon as someone asked me to drink with them, I would agree. This happened often because I quickly garnered a reputation for always being down to party. I ultimately had to take a leave of absence because the only other option was straight F's. I went home and I was advised to join an inpatient program (i think mostly for alcohol abuse, but I'm sure I would probably have been placed on a dual diagnosis unit to include bipolar disorder.)To me, this sounds a lot like what doctors call a manic episode with mixed features, a diagnosis which would make me have bipolar type 1. At the time, my doctors had a hard time figuring out if I had type 1 or type 2 because I wasn't taking my medication regularly and because I was abusing substances so frequently. So, I was diagnosed with bipolar not-otherwise-specified (NOS). Eventually, once I started to seem alright, my doctors defaulted to type 2... because I seemed alright. From the beginning, I've stayed well-read on this affliction, but only recently have I looked more into the specifics of diagnosis. From what I've read recently, psychologists and psychiatrists determine if an episode is manic or hypomanic by addressing the patient's functionality during the episode. If that is the standard method of differentiation, I feel *very* insulted that any doctor would look at my case and think to label the episode I'm talking about as hypomanic. Feeling so insulted, I got in contact with the therapist I had had during the episode (and who I continued to see for the rest of my time in college). He is the gold standard of clinical psychologists, so I really wanted to hear what he had to say about it all. He said that diagnosis had always been difficult with me. He said that in particular the substance abuse complicated matters. But he said he thinks it's a good thing that I'm thinking about my diagnosis. By this,I think he means it's good that I'm thinking about it because it's relevant to my life and it shows maturity and self-respect.  This made me feel a little better because he basically re-diagnosed me with bipolar NOS, even if only implicitly. But it still annoys me because in order for the episode I'm talking about to be a hypomanic one, that would essentially mean that I wasn't meeting my responsibilities, perhaps because I was abusing substances, but either way, that I still had the means and ability to function... That's not true though! I couldn't meet my responsibilities because I was so impulsive that I was partying all the time AND because I was so impulsive that I couldn't focus on my homework ever... not even for a few minutes. I realize my being on antidepressants at the time complicates matters, and I don't remember exactly when I was taken off them. But I've tried to put the pieces back together in my memory, and I think my full-blown manic symptoms must have lasted weeks after I was taken off the antidepressants, and the DSM makes a point of saying that episodes with such features should still be labeled as manic and the patient still diagnosed as type 1. People probably make posts like this one all the time, so sorry if you're sick of them. I really want to hear what you think though. Please let me know. Feel free to ask me questions too. I will edit this post with more details of necessary. EDITFor the record, I have had another "up" episode that I can confidently say was hypomanic. I actually started losing weight because of it. Still, it was not nearly as bad as the one I have described above. [info] None [info] 1519513495
BayazRules [info] Meth puts me in my own head, kinda relaxes me. I hole up in my room and fap or listen to music.I did kinda edge into stimulant psychosis last night, though. I'd been up for three days and smoked probably 2 grams in that time frame. I started hearing voices and remembered that I'm a powerful chaos magician who can bend reality, and the voices wanted me dead. I thought I was being remote viewed and my devices had been hacked. Long story short, I went to bed and problem solved. Not once during that ordeal did I consider leaving my room, let alone any kind of human interaction. Believe it or not the scariest psychoses I've had were induced by heavy cannabis use. Twice in the past ten years, smoking weed has driven me out of my fucking mind and landed me in the psych unit. The second time, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I'm not claiming "meth &gt; weed", this has just been my experience and I'm an outlier. [info] None [info] 1552353621
UNPER50N [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and my mood swings varied. Mostly I had long depressive episodes interrupted short and sudden manic episodes.

egglentine [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 I had the hardest time remembering to take my birth control. I was put on psych meds after a complete breakdown that landed me in a hospital. It magically became easier to remember to take my meds after that. I had such a strong desire to feel better. Sounds like you also have that desire!Now I take my meds right when I wake up. I keep them next to my bed with a glass of water. I also have a pouch with "e-z dose" bags so I can carry my meds with me at all times. I sing a little song to myself as I'm walking out the door. "Phone Keys Wallet Meds!" Carrying the pouch around means I can take my meds as soon as I remember instead of waiting until I'm home again. It's also more discrete than any other method I've tried.The meds won't make your symptoms disappear completely. They WILL take the edge off. They reduce severity and frequency of my episodes and that alone gives me enough clarity to keep my meds (and myself) in check. It took me a long time to find the right doses of the right meds but I'm so glad I stuck with it. I feel more stable now than ever before.  This may be an extreme statement but I truly believe that my meds saved my life.  [info] None [info] 1476673440
pepsi109 [info] Worried about symptoms that meds fixed coming back I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a three-month episode of bipolar-like symptoms along with psychotic features. I've been on medication since it happened two years ago. One of the nurses at my mental health clinic told me yesterday that bipolar disorder cycles, saying people might not experience cycles again for years. I knew that people went through shorter cycles but not years.Honestly, I don't even think I am bipolar because I never had symptoms up until my episode and I haven't had any since I started my meds. I was struggling with a large amount of stress in a matter of a month or so and I think that's what triggered a breakdown in my brain. But now that this nurse said it might come back, I'm worried. Has anyone ever had symptoms come back even though they were on medication? Is there such thing as a "bipolar episode" without having bipolar disorder? [info] None [info] 1441240950
GunshyJedi [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 1 1/2 years ago. One thing I've realized is that it's easier to be *sick* than *sinful*. I'm constantly tempted to hide behind my illness and I see others do it all the time. He can be bipolar and function like anyone else if he applies himself and seeks honest help and keeps the pills down. Don't give up on your love without a fight. This may sound crazy, but the best treatment I've ever had is my little brother, my mom, and my sisters getting in my face with genuine love and breaking me out of my own jail. *Edited out my original first paragraph, I over-reacted. My dad was also bi-polar and he verbally abused my mom and us growing up. I realized I was projecting that into OP's situation which is unfair so I took it out* [info] United Pentecostal Church [info] 1380045727
soundoftheunheard [info] Mourning: I lost my Nan Although this isn't directly bipolar related, I'm putting this here because this community has been an amazing support for me in the past and I don't really have anywhere else to turn. *What Happened*My Nanny (grandma) died two weeks ago tomorrow. It's frustrating to say, "She was my grandma." because she was so, so much more. She helped raise me. My mom and I lived with her and my grandpa until I was 6 years old. Every year until I went to college I spent a total of a couple of months with them each year. After I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I moved in with them again and they supported me—paying for my medical care, getting me through college, being whatever I needed—from when I was 21 to 28. That's now. I also lived with them during my sophomore year at college and summers.  To say, "...my grandma died..." doesn't encompass the loss I feel.She was 66 when she went to the emergency room, and died, only 67 years old. I thought she would live a long time. All of her siblings, many more than a decade older, are still kicking. I had recently made plans to stay in the same metro-area so that I could take care of her in old age. I knew I would take her in and take her on travels once my grandpa passed. He's older and in worse health. There was so much I wanted to share with her. Her death was both expected and unexpected. 52 days earlier, she went to the emergency room with another bad headache and nausea. Later that night, the doctors said they weren't sure if she would make it to morning. I didn't go to the ER with her that day, because it was a headache. We all felt she had been depressed and the issues stemmed from that. Frankly, even the doctors can't say for certain what happened that day and the following weeks, so explaining all of the medical issues would be an exercise in futility. But, it can be summed up in saying she had severe brain damage. During the 52 days, we would go four steps forward, six back, two forward, then one back. By the end, the backwards steps were dominating. Eventually it was clear she would never be off the ventilator and her quality of life would never be sufficient. She wasn't in a coma. We were able to spend time talking with her (lip reading), reminiscing, and eventually saying goodbye. October 6, 2018 was the hardest day of my life. It was time to disconnect the ventilator and let my Nanny pass. We were able to say goodbye and I love you to each other one last time. Her weeping while I was telling her how much I loved and how much she's meant to me will be forever branded in my brain. I also needed her to know that I had done everything I could. I'd made sure she had the best doctors. I'd read all of the research on the theories of what was happening. She told me that "I know you did."*Failure*While I know it wasn't my fault, and I don't feel guilty; I feel devastated that I failed. I couldn't save her. That may seem silly. If the best of the best doctors were at a loss, how could I have done anything more? I'm one of those mentally crazy guys that also happens to be blessed with a bit of brilliance. In my embarrassing hubris, I often feel responsible for fixing the problems that others can't. When family or friends are struggling with problems, I can often step-in and offer a solution. I feel ashamed even writing that, because the amount of ego belief in myself required to think I'm the last great hope is astonishing. But that's been my life experiences and I need to share that to explain why I feel like a failure. If I couldn't save her (by finding a medical professional that had better than a best guess of what was going on), then she wasn't going to be saved. I feel stupid for spending time listening to so many lectures on ancient societies the past six months. What if I had focused on neuroscience? What if I had went ahead and gone to medical school? All of my studies, all of my reading, all of my nerdy lecture-listening habits—all of it—didn't matter. I couldn't save one of the most important people in my life.I want to say again, I don't feel guilty. I feel like a failure. I feel like all of the work and research I've done doesn't matter. It feels so small and is meaningless. I've spent the past couple of years working on research around early voting schedules. It has been meaningful and impactful, but feels like such a waste.*My Relationship Status Quos*So why am I here instead of talking all of this out with my friends and family? My best (only) friend and I had a falling out. I'm still not sure what happened. We decided to live together this past spring. I didn't even know we weren't getting along. I was having some issues and needing medication adjustments, but she said she understood, until suddenly she didn't. I send her an email (she was at work and that was the way we communicated during the day) to apologize for taking so long getting some things out of the garage, but I was on it. I had actually moved most of it before I sent the email. She responded that she doubted I would ever get it done and that it'd be "best for you to find new living arrangements." It was the first she had even brought up that she was irritated by my books in the garage. They were where my car was supposed to go, so it wasn't like they were in the way. I had just parked in the driveway. They had been there three weeks. One of those I was on vacation, the other two, my grandma had started to have headaches, so I was trying to help her and my grandpa out. I was dumbstruck because this was the first time she expressed frustration with anything about our living situation. I admit I can be very ADHD (because I had ADHD), but she was aware and knew these tendencies. Many times I had confided in her my fear of abandonment because of my biological dad's actions and expressed the need to be told explicitly if anything was wrong because I'm awful when it comes to reading people. I responded to her email saying I was kind of shocked. She basically said everybody has things in life they have to deal with and I don't even have much to deal with. I had tried to explain that I knew I had been off, and was working with my doctor to get back on track. She suddenly became very dismissive of my issues with bipolar disorder, which has been a true and difficult struggle. Instead of going into every detail, in summary, she said I needed to suck it up, I had two weeks to move out, and she would prorate August's rent. I don't know the real reason why we had a falling out. In hindsight, it was clear that she was planning this for at least a month before. For example, among other things, anything I had the account for, she had moved to her email. I included this to say, I don't have friends now. Who I thought was my biggest support decided she didn't want me in her life anymore. A week later my grandma ended up in the hospital. She never reached out, despite me contacting her. A week ago she unfriended me on Facebook. Those abandonment issues? Yeah, they've gotten worse. I honestly have no idea what I did wrong.What about my family as support? My family is amazing and great. I have a great mom and dad (step, but that doesn't matter) and three younger siblings I'm close to. The thing is, my grandparents were/are like an additional set of parents to me. More than losing a grandmother, I feel that I've lost a mom. But I don't want to hurt my mom by her taking that the wrong way. For my siblings, they weren't raised by her. They loved her dearly and she loved them. I don't want to talk about my special relationship with her and how much it's hurting. So, I'm here. *Today*Today I've been crying at the smallest thing. The song I want to dance to at my wedding came on. I weeped in the Home Depot parking lot, knowing she won't be there. I saw a sewing machine on Craigslist. For years now we've been trying to find a decent budget one for us that actually works. Again, I cried. Almost every night I have nightmares. She's in life threatening situations. I'm never able to save her. She always ends up dying. Over and over. And over. Sleep is hell. Being awake is hell. I hurt so much. My chest literally aches. Whenever I read old Bible stories or other ancient text and read about the mourners ripping their clothes and pulling their hair out, I never understood. It seemed hyperbolic. It doesn't anymore. I know what it means to feel such loss that you tear at your clothes and hair. My other grandma died a decade ago at the way-too-young 56 years old. That hurt. It hurt a lot. But it hurt like you'd expect. It was awful and sudden and I mourned. But Nanny's death was horrific. It was emotionally traumatizing and exhausting. When she first went into the hospital, my body went into crisis mode. I'm great in a crisis. It's like a calm hypomania that lets me handle whatever serious and timely challenge I face. But now that time is over. There's no more research to do. No more hospital visits. The battle is over and the war is lost. Now there is only pain.I'm not sure how to live life feeling like this. There's no fix or way out; there is only through, but that path out of the darkness feels infinite.TL;DR: I lost one of the two most important people in my life. I'm in immense pain. I don't know where to turn or what to do. [info]  [info] 1539992270
sigmatt13 [info] Needing to vent Life kicks my ass sometimes and I don’t know what to do. My girlfriend and I split due to the distance and although there aren’t hard feelings between. It’s been so difficult because she still wanted to stay together, but the distance was making me feel unable to stay present and happy. I’m about to go abroad for school in Magdalen oxford. My dad went there and has been talking about it his whole life and I feel pressure to enjoy it. I was just diagnosed with bipolar 2 and take so many meds that I don’t need to take breakfast:Lamictal- 100mgProzac- 20Buspar- 15Hydroxyzine pam- 25 mg 3x a dayAllergy medsI was just recently increased to the 100 mg of Lamictal from 50mg and put on buspar at the same time, and my head hurts, I feel hopeless, and I don’t even have the energy to get out of bed. The two times I left my bed today I started feeling an overwhelming sense of emotion and ended up in tears going back to lay down. My lamictal gives me nightmares every single time i go to sleep, and then during my depressive episodes, being awake is a nightmare too. I can’t escape my own mind, and think to myself, “what’s the point of letting this pass since it’ll just come back”. At one point in my depressive episodes, I came to the conclusion that I would end up taking my life at some point (not now, not 5 years from now, but probably before old age), but I really want to live. I love so deeply and want nothing but love, but feel so unlovable. It feels good to have a diagnosis, but I still don’t think I’ve figured out my medicine entirely.Depressive episodes are living hell. [info] None [info] 1537743219

pistachioxo [info] I was recently diagnosed with ADHD - I'm 22. Apparently it's easier to miss in girls because symptoms tend to present differently, and because I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago any attention or hyperactivity issues were kind of written off as hypomania. Nobody told me bipolar and ADHD have a really high co-morbidity rate. Additionally, ADHD is harder to diagnose when you're over the age of 18. So I kind of had a triple whammy lmao.In the end I sprung for the full panel of testing through my therapist's colleague who specializes in adult attention deficits. In total it cost me $900, and that was on the low end (in my area anyway) because I gave my therapist permission to collaborate with her, so she was able to help her complete the report faster. Luckily I screened positive for ADHD so it wasn't all for nothing, and my psychiatrist was able to prescribe me dexedrine.I'm not trying to discourage you at all though! It's done wonders for my attention span and combined with my other medications has honestly made me feel better than I have in years. I'm in university and literally went from dropping out of a semester and failing the semester I got back, to getting straight A's in my spring/summer courses because I could finally concentrate. If you can afford to get screened by a professional, I 100% recommend it. Just know that it's often costly - happily for me, the benefits outweighed that. [info] None [info] 1530945428
midnight_sparrow [info] Please go back to your doctor. Having a child really does things to your brain and body chemically.I say this with experience as I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of ignoring signs and symptoms. It has saved my life. Literally. My relationship was tanking after almost daily fights. I attempted suicide twice. I'm lucky not only to be alive, but that my boyfriend was a good enough man to stick by me, and who supported me in getting help for me and for our relationship in couples counseling (which I also recommend).Trust me, getting outside help is going to significantly benefit you and your family. Call your doctor and schedule an appointment, and seek a marriage counselor. You'll see major differences in your situation. [info] None [info] 1537405085
chhharl [info] Starting Lithium-side effects? Ey! Some quick bgAt 14 I was diagnosed with bipolar but never found meds that worked and stopped then at 17Was hospitalized a few years back and they told me I DONT have bipolar, that I have BPD (which I definitely do). Still couldn't find/stick with treatment.Now at 27 after another hospitalization, my new doctor is telling me I have both, which has been my suspicion since the beginning.She's put me on Lithium, I've been taking it for 4 days 300mg extended release at night. Starting in a day I'm gonna be taking 600mg at night.I'm really bad at keeping hydrated, but I'm cutting out soda while I get my meds figured out. I know lithium can make you nauseous but when does it go away? I started taking it Friday and Sunday I was foggy and nauseous and tired all day. Today I was fine but now (4:40am Tuesday) I'm starting to feel the same way. Will it get worse when I ramp up the dose on Wednesday?Also, how am I supposed to feel after it starts working? I've been on a lot of meds before but I don't keep taking them bc I don't see a difference. I'm a very paranoid person but I'm pretty even. I haven't been depressed in awhile?

FusRoDontdothat [info] I've never been on adderal, I do have some kind of add, but not diagnosed. My family just thought I was a forgetful child. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder though.Well anyways, back when I was struggling with BPD, what money I didn't spend on rent went to beer and weed. I was always with a bad crowd. One day, were all hanging out at my place, and this guy whips out a big bag of meth. we're all partying, and I just want to get fucked up, so when he offered me some, I said sure.Now the point here is, I was expecting a high, I was expecting a burst of energy, I was expecting to get fucked up. Everyone else was tweaking, but not me, the effects I got from it are the same that I've heard of adderall.My brain slowed down which is rare for me, I had perfect concentration, I didn't even feel like partying anymore. I saw my keyboard(piano) across the room, plugged it in, threw my headphones on and went at it. That was around 11pm. The next time I looked at the clock, it was 7:30am and everyone had left. I was just in the zone playing piano, so concentrated on it that nothing else existed.Basically what I'm saying is, when you have add or ADHD and do amphetamines, you're going to get the same kind of effects whether its meth or adderall(which contains amphetamines). So essentially, they are the same thing. They may be two different substances, but they both affect the body in a similar fashion. Adderall is made to help people with add or ADHD concentrate, but if you do meth with add, you're going to get that same concentration adderall would give you.Now, I don't condone drug abuse(unless its pot), but have you ever done meth or adderall?

evil-rick [info] I was taking it when I was about 16 and had the opposite reaction. Prozac made me severely depressed but a lot better at hiding it. Finally I got angry that I was depressed one night and took the whole bottle, then I started taking every pill in the cabinet. Just a few weeks ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder which explains why regular anti-depressants have an adverse reaction with me. But it also tells me that these facilities are playing a dangerous game with kids that they probably can’t even speak to. Forcing a child to take any sort of medication without knowing their current mental or physical health is pure American cruelty. [info] None [info] 1533053556
AndySipherBull [info] And really, the reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, that he wasn’t just one of a monolithic voice, but he could wrap people around. So there’s theories that there’s infinite amounts of universe and there’s alternate universe. So it’s very important for me to get Hoover out, because in an alternate universe, I am him. And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I’m moving back to Chicago and it’s not just about, you know, getting on stage and being an entertainer and having a monolithic voice that’s forced to be a specific party. You know, people expect that if you’re black you have to be Democrat. I have a — I've had conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat. They say — you know, first of all, it’s a limited amount of jobs. So the fathers lose the jobs, and they say, “We’ll give you more money for having more kids in your home.” And then, we got rid of the mental health institutes in the ‘80s and the ‘90s, and the prison rates just shot up.	 	And now you have “Chiraq,” what people call “Chiraq” — which is actually — our murder rate is going down by 20 percent every year. I just talked to the superintendent; met with Michael Sacks; that’s Rahm's right-hand man. So I think it’s the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. You know, they tried to scare me to not wear this hat — my own friends. But this hat, it gives me — it gives me power, in a way. You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn’t have a lot of male energy in my home. And also, I’m married to a family that — (laughs) — you know, not a lot of male energy going on. It’s beautiful, though. But there’s times where, you know, there’s something about — you know, I love Hillary. I love everyone, right? But the campaign “I’m with her” just didn’t make me feel, as a guy, that didn’t get to see my dad all the time — like a guy that could play catch with his son. It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman. That was my — that’s my favorite superhero. And you made a Superman cape. For me, also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys — non-political, no bullshit — put the beep on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay — and just goes in and gets it done. Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas. Because at Adidas, when I went in, in 2015, we were a $14 billion company losing $2 billion a year. Now we have a $38 billion market cap. It’s called the “Yeezy effect.” And I went to Casper. We had a meeting in Chicago. And I said, “You have to bring manufacturing onshore.” And not even shore; into the core. It’s not about the border; it’s the core of Adidas. And Chicago is the core of Middle America. And we have to make Middle America strong. So I had the balls — because I have enough balls to put on this hat. I mean, this Adidas thing made me a billionaire. And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal. But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than to have no fathers in Chicago with no homes. And when we do have prison reformation, for no — because it’s habilitation, not rehabilitation, because they didn’t have the abilities in the first place. We never had anyone that taught us. They didn’t teach us. Exactly — we had no one that “taught” us. Right? So it’s more important than any specific deal — anything — that we bring jobs into America, and that we provide a transition with mental health and the Amer-I-Can education curriculum that Jim has worked on. Larry Hoover also has a curriculum that he’s worked on. We have Montessori curriculums that we worked on. WeWork has a beautiful curriculum. The Waldorf establishment has a curriculum. We have meditation. There’s a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment. I did say “abolish” with the hat on. Because why would you keep something around that’s a trap door? If you’re building a floor — the Constitution is the base of our industry, right? Of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you — accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber? You end up — you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship. The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment — and I think the way the universe works, it’s perfect. We don’t have 13 floors, do we? You know, so the four — the four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn’t look like the people they were amending. Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read — or African Americans to read. And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave. Again — so what I think is, we don’t need sentences; we need pardons. We need to talk to people. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. And he looked at my brain — it’s equal on three parts. I’m going to go ahead drop some bombs for you — 98 percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards, (inaudible), so I’m going to work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent — Tesla, Freud. So he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name. So all this power that I got, and I’m taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn’t be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage. And what we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money. That’s one thing — I’ve never stepped into a situation where I didn’t make people more money. So we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories. We can bring not only Adidas onshore, we can bring — Foxconn has set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota. edit: I notice now that the transcript has periods and commas which is weird because Kanye doesn't use them.

I made the mistake of checking off the part on the form about a mood disorder and he completely based off all of my issues on that. He asked me I was diagnosed with bipolar and I said yes. He actually checked me out and then gave me a 7 hour lasting melatonin pill and told me to use that. That's it. He thinks I should just take pills because I'm bipolar. I told him it's a misdiagnosis and I just need some sleeping pills but he denied and said I just need help with whatever symptoms I'm having in a psychiatric setting.

Secondsemblance [info] Hey /r/askreddit, I'm thinking of doing something crazy, wondering if anyone else has tried this before I've begun to realize something about myself. My whole life has been preparing me for this decision. My childhood set me up to be a loner. I grew up on the side of a mountain in Pennsylvania, completely alone except for my family. I learned to live off the land. I can hunt, trap, fish, and I know how to survive. I've been training as an inland search and rescue specialist since I was 15. I joined the military at 17, and served for 3 years as an infantryman. I've logged 40 hours as a student pilot, and I flew my solo flight through a thunderstorm. I'm not afraid of death.A lot of things have changed the direction of my life recently. I was a college student with near perfect grades, planning to go to medical school. I finished 2 years of an undergrad biochemistry degree. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder shortly after my life completely fell apart. Several things triggered it, but mainly I begun to realize what I was doing in the military was wrong, and my whole life was a lie. I received a medical discharge from the military, and I've felt pretty aimless and disillusioned since. There's only one group of people who I fit in with... dreamers. In the *Waking Life* sense of the word.Here's my plan. I'm going to settle everything here in my life, pack a rucksack, and leave everything behind. I'm going to hitch hike up north as far as I can, flying where I can, driving where I can, walking where I have to. I know my way around airports, and I know the people to talk to at FBOs to hitch hike on airplanes. I'm going to disappear and live off the land for as long as I can. If I end up dying, that's an outcome I can accept. But I feel like I need to strip everything away, and find clarity before deciding a direction for my life. I need to unlearn every bad habit that I've learned, and start over. Maybe I'll come back and finish my education. Maybe I'll find happiness out there somewhere and never come back. I don't know.Has anyone else done this? This plan is still in it's early stages. I would love advice. What are the biggest dangers, how to not be a target, how to not get arrested, how to tell my family that I'm going to disappear, etc. [info] None [info] 1313052556

ladyboylawrence [info] NMom hates Google or probably just me I've talked in one other post about AttorneyMom and now it's time for the reason her job is relevant.  This may be a bit long, as I just touched on it in therapy this week.I am a bright woman. That sentence took me five minutes to type because I'm afraid to call myself smart. Gifted burnout fits me better I think. I will be 28 this year and dropped out of high school at 18 just four credits shy of graduating in spite of a mess of drug addiction and roller coaster mental health issues. When I was 13 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (learning at 25 how far off base this diagnosis was really changed a lot). I was always the intuitive, quizzical, top of the class kid. My fifth grade teacher bought me a tote bag to carry all my library books in. Then I dropped out of high school, because I honestly couldn't handle it anymore. My self esteem was shot (check comment history for more on NMom attacking anything from my appearance to my choice of clothes), I had never had a boyfriend because I had almost zero social skills. AM on the other hand did her undergraduate in psychology and runs a very successful firm. She is *obsessively* protective of her education. Because I dropped out of school so early and have had no friends for a decade and only two boyfriends, I learn. I watch university lecturers, read psychology journals, political pundits, history, medical curiousities, random facts, really any bit of information the internet can provide my ravenous brain. Here's the problem, if I participate in a conversation that makes me look bright in anyway, whether I accidentally call myself a smart girl (no you're not Larry, you don't even have an *education* I run a *law firm*) or mention that someone else called me smart (your father is an *uneducated loser* and isn't *smart* at all). The italics are to emphasize the disgust she uses all the time. I have tried so many times to finish my schooling over the years but I'm always met with mocking, ridicule and mother taking bets on when I'll drop out. She tells me what I can and can't handle, what I should and shouldn't study, she even told me I'm lying about being bisexual because I date men organically. My therapist finally had enough of "but my mom says," in session this week and laid it out on the table: I was diagnosed with CPTSD, BPD, DID, Anxiety in June 2017, in a little under two years I've almost completely done a 180. Biweekly therapy that I usually forget to go to isn't the cause of that. It's because my illnesses fascinated me and I spent weeks learning about how to care for them at home. I read books on mindfulness and learned about trauma processing. I can recognize triggers because I learned how to access the memories that caused them.Because I *am* smart. I *am* capable. My mother wants to keep me from flourishing because once I have my own education, she isn't better than me anymore. [info] None [info] 1550336118
Jade_Shift [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at a young age and still have pretty strong episodes but I'm not so sad in them as just tired these days, I have a supporting spouse and a very happy life but I was in a pretty dark place for a while. I'll never be cured but I'm mostly happy and the thing that worked for me was managing my thinking. It's very difficult to do though, your brain will want to snap back to negative thoughts really hard, but you can do it! Good luck =) [info] None [info] 1525271541
halcyondazed88 [info] I keep seeing these distorted images and I’ll be honest. I debated whether or not I’d ever post this. I guess I was afraid writing about it would make it real, you know? I’m 23 and I live in Florida. I got my Bachelor’s in a big college town and officially moved there after graduation once I found work. I work as an entertainment news writer for a medium scale publication that I’ll keep anonymous for now, unless it becomes important in the future. It’s worth mentioning that I struggle with a fuckton in terms of my mental health. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years back and recently got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I mention this because I’m used to fighting off thoughts and going against my own brain. So, I’d like to think that this is all a symptom, something that will eventually disappear like a bad depressive episode. See, I’ve always had a wild imagination. I’ll see shapes and faces in things most people don’t, like tile floors and ceiling patterns and fabrics. Usually, these images are pretty harmless. Or at least they were. Not too long ago, I wrote an article about Judy Garland. Journalism can be a rather cold-blooded industry sometimes. We write about the dead after they’re gone with such coldness, laying out their every flaw for the world to see just for good SEO and web traffic. It’s brutal, but necessary for us to stay afloat. I was fighting off a bad depressive episode that night. I had absolutely no energy and struggled to do any more than just stay in bed and sleep all day. I knew my job was on the line, but that was barely enough motivation to inspire me to push myself. So, by the time the sun went down, I was still trying to make up for a full day of writing. I decided to try and cash in on the attention that the new Judy Garland biopic was getting by writing a memorial piece on the late actress. The writing itself being a nightmare because of my hazy brain. There’s this specific website full of entertainment related photos we’re licensed to use. It rarely actually has anything relevant to what you’re looking for but I figured there would be an image I could use somewhere. I scrolled through black and white pictures for some time until I finally found what I was looking for. But it caught me off guard. One of the images seemed... off. I was so exhausted that I couldn’t pinpoint what was wrong with it exactly, nor could I really process what I was seeing. It was a black and white picture of Judy Garland, smiling, but something was off about it. Her face just... didn’t seem right somehow. Her features were kinda twisted. Her smile was a bit too wide, her teeth seemed a bit too animal-like, and her eyes seemed far too dark. I stared at Judy trying to figure out what some internet asshole had done to her, and she stared right back. Unnerved, I quickly went to the next page to find another picture. Any other picture. On the next page, another off-putting image was there to greet me. Judy’s eyes were glazed and wild looking. They looked to be staring right at me, but seeing nothing. Her head was warped into an odd impossible shape with the angle, but it looked natural at first glance. From the feral way she grinned, I half expected the picture to jump out and bite me. I rubbed my eyes, thinking the image would snap back to normal after. It didn’t. Judy continued to stare with her animalistic teeth bared in a smile. What the hell did they do to you, Judy? As I scrolled, I kept finding more and more of these.... weird distorted images. It wasn’t long before I started seeing pieces of her face and her insanely feral grin in my sheets, my tapestries, my walls... I felt surrounded. It was nearing 3:00am and my lack of sleep was really beginning to eat at me. Creeped out and exhausted, I just quickly picked the most normal pictures I could find and closed out of the website. I suddenly stopped caring about my production quota. Something about those images had put me off my work. I curled up and went to sleep. At some point during the night, I woke up to an odd noise that reminded me of a cat wheezing up a hairball. The pictures of Judy had me more freaked out than I originally thought, so I tried to reach for my phone for some kind of eye bleach. But I couldn’t move. In the corner of my eye, I saw a shape. A large shape. A body laying on my floor. I wanted to move. I wanted to scream. I wanted to run. I couldn’t move. But the body did. It slowly sat up and turned to my direction. It was too dark for me to see its features but it started to move toward me. It crawled into bed with me as I silently screamed for help. It came closer and closer and I began to notice it’s disturbing features. Flint black eyes that didn’t blink. Only stared back into my eyes, emotionlessly. A pale, bald head. And a row of feral, grinning teeth. It sat on my chest and stared down at me. I gasped for breath and tried to push it off, my body locked in fear. Its head inched closer and closer to mine, baring those horrible teeth... I then screamed myself awake from another nightmarish episode of sleep paralysis. When the fuck would it end, I wondered to myself with annoyance. I dug through my bedside drawer in search of my water pipe. A loud thumping noise caused me to jump and drop everything, spilling weed and bong water all over my bed. Damn neighbors, I thought. I got up and lazily cleaned the mess off my bed before stumbling into the bathroom for a quick smoke. I stared at myself in the mirror for a long time, trying to find distortions in my own face like I did Judy’s. Nothing. The thumping continued and I thought for a moment that there could be someone outside. I peeked through my curtains and didn’t see anyone. Right then, an odd dark shape quickly crawled past, like a spider. I quickly jumped away from the blinds, my heart in my throat. Go look, my brain ordered, stop being a coward. Against all my better instincts, I obeyed and slowly opened my front door...I could still see the spider-like thing running about through the field below my apartment. Though, I don’t think it could see me. I couldn’t tell what it was from a distance, but heard its snarl and decided to head back to bed before I freaked myself out anymore. I knew of a three-legged stray dog that often ran around the property after dark, and tried to convince myself that this was the explanation for the odd noises and unnatural movement of the creature. But the thing is, that thing outside moved too quickly even for a dog. I did my best to force it out of my mind, promising myself that I’d never walk around my complex this late out of fear of encountering that thing again. I drifted into a warm, yet uneasy sleep. I kept seeing the images and shapes in my head over and over and over. The spider creature. Judy’s smile. The body on my floor. I kept trying to use the binder of mindfulness skills from my treatment center, but the images continued to make their way into my brain. It’s been like this for weeks, guys, and I’ve barely slept. I can still see the large shape of a pale, twisted body sprawled out on my floor. I keep hearing all sorts of odd noises throughout the night like violent wheezing sounds and guttural croaks. I can’t find the source of them. Even now, I can’t rest and can’t sleep in my own room. These distorted images and sounds just keep getting worse and I think I’m going crazy. I’m going to try and get out of the house today. Maybe that will put my mind at ease. In the meantime, has anyone experienced anything like this? [info] None [info] 1570978874

Apathetic_Doodles [info] Things are going to be very hard at times. I am 35 weeks pregnant and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14. I managed about six years ago to go off meds and until recently I had been fine. Make sure that she takes time for herself to relax and decompress. If she is like me she is fully aware of when things aren’t how they ought to be and she will probably be beating herself up about it already too, so just gently remind her that’s it’s okay to not be okay and that she isn’t broken, she just has an illness. I am certain since you guys are married you know her love language, so when she is struggling do what you can to make her feel loved. Some people need gifts, even small ones like a candy bar from the gas station. Some people appreciate service so do something nice like a chore she would normally do. If she wants to talk it out then do that, cuddle if she want/needs to cuddle. It’s going to be hard but you can do it. Also don’t be afraid to go back on meds if needed, there are options that are totally safe to take while pregnant. [info] Team Pink! EDD 8-18 [info] 1531764822

trollfairy [info] Hey buddy, First I applaud the courage thus far we are all so unique and what your dealing with is nothing to be ashamed of. It is the way you were born. I honestly recommend owning it. God if you believe in him or if not let's say the universe has a way of presenting us each with situations we need to face that allow us to grow as human beings. Don't take that opportunity away from your parents. When I was diagnosed with bipolar I never wanted to tell anyone and I still hide it to some extent because our Indian community is judgemental. But that's selfish we should talk about such things openly because 1. We have no reason to be ashamed and 2. It gives others an opportunity to grow. Talk to them about it-- I think you'll be surprised with how supportive they are. It'll be awkward but it'll bring you closer together.Sincerely,A friend of Trollfairy [info] None [info] 1506288828

onceblue [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder before being diagnosed with ADHD. The bipolar diagnosis never sat right with me, but I couldn't figure out what else it could be, so that was my label for a while. Because I did well in school, I didn't think I had much of a problem with focus/distractability until I ended up in the working world and everything started unraveling for me. I think the added responsibility of the working world plus the fact that everything isn't laid out neatly on a syllabus way ahead of time is what really tested my ADHD (although I was still a chronic procrastinator, even back then). Also, once I started having important meetings, I realized I would zone out during conversations and miss chunks. I always assumed I would zone out during conversations because I merely was disinterested, but I would actually try very hard to pay attention during meetings and still have trouble. That's how I ended up discussing it with my psychriatrist and ultimately getting diagnosed. I have had hyperactive symptoms that have persisted into adulthood (running around, being ridiculously goofy, being unable to sit still) and these were previously misdiagnosed as mania. When I take Adderall, they completely go away. In fact, I even feel a little sleepy on adderall, but I don't think it's a "real" sleepiness. I think it just feels that way because some of my energy finally gets mitigated. Anyway, the point of all of this is that I don't think it's black-and-white. I think plenty of people learn coping skills to help them get through everyday life that makes it even harder to distinguish ADHD from other disorders.  [info] None [info] 1436379034

I will not risk putting a child through this. I can not go off meds to have a child because I would be both a risk to myself and the spawn.

mother-of-puppies [info] Family is using my diagnosis as an excuse to not take me seriously 😢 Hey you guys. Fist of all I really love how supportive this subreddit is, and I was wondering if I could ask you guys for some advice. So I was diagnosed with bipolar II two months ago and my medication seems to start working, I feel more stable. Yet, something I’ve always had that hasn’t gone away is that I’m really sensitive and get easily hurt. I complained to my sister last week that it upsets me that she’s always on her phone while we’re doing stuff together (at a cafe, watching a movie) and yesterday I told my father in law that he was hurting my feelings by always answering stuff I tell him with comments like “I don’t know about that” and “that sounds like nonsense”. I know this is pretty harmless stuff but it really hurts my feelings. In the past when I’ve expressed these feeling my family usually apologised or brushed my comments off, but now they’re getting really mad at me and accusing me of letting my mental illness hang out and not controlling my mood disorder. Both times this happened recently I was so shocked by their reaction that I instantly apologised and both times was told something to the effect of “wow, it’s so great to see that your illness is healing!”. I wish I had never told them about my diagnosis because I feel like they’re using it as an excuse not to take me seriously. The funny thing is my friends have been nothing but supportive, even when we disagree. Does anyone else have experience with this? I would appreciate any advice. [info] None [info] 1577103453

madison_eevee [info] Mixed Episode- What does this mean? Hey guys!&amp;#x200B;So, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I when I was 19, and I'm almost 22 now. I've dealt with it okay, and I haven't been on medication in about a year due to some not preventable circumstances. I've been on a manic upswing since late November/early December and it's been the typical not sleeping, too much energy, spending money, etc. WELL, last week, I suddenly felt more depressed and just straight up anxious than I have in, gosh, I'd say a year or so, even on a downswing. Like, it was to a scary, very uncomfortable degree, and I feel pretty much back to where I was now. I don't think it was situational as nothing was going on that was out of the ordinary, and I usually cycle every four months so I don't think that was it either.&amp;#x200B;I just want to know if this is normal or what I should do or how to avoid this. It's never happened during a manic episode before, and I had no idea what to do. I admittedly don't know a lot about bipolar disorder really, and this isn't something I feel comfortable talking to my family about. Is this what a mixed episode is? [info] Manic [info] 1548317804
LookingForVheissu [info] I don't know man. I leave them have it and make fun at a distance. When I was a teenager I was pretty constantly in pain. I wanted to die, and these kinds of thing let me feel like I wasn't alone. Seeing them, and trying to find sources let me know even the greatest minds suffered substantially. Then when I was twenty four I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I don't think *we always understand them or their pain.* [info] None [info] 1502575287
mortalmarch [info] I love your videos on YouTube. I was watching them mainly in December, just before I was diagnosed with bipolar and they really helped give me some insight and understanding of what was going on. Keep up the good work! [info] None [info] 1488894224
peasantsean [info] I hope this doesn't get too buried, I might be able to help. This story sounds all to familiar to me and I hate to admit it but I really think sharing my thoughts might be of some use. Your bf sounds exactly like the type of guy I was to my ex. The relationship started off great but soon became overwhelmingly toxic. I was very emotionally abusive/controlling. She was the nicest person I have ever met and put up with it for so long because she empathized with my struggles with mental illness. During that time I didn't want to admit I had any issues, in my head everything was her fault. But after a few escalated incidents(similar to your bf - just doing stupid dangerous abuse tactics) I felt like something had to be going on in my head. I knew something was weird with my reactions to things that shouldn't have warranted such a strong reaction. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which makes sense since it runs in the family. But that's not an excuse for the way I acted. That was a starting point to figuring out how to grow. I knew I was abusive. I knew I didnt want to be, and now I knew my manic and depressive episodes contributing to my lack of self worth probably werent helping the situation get any better. &amp;#x200B;Let me just tell you, it WILL NEVER get better. The more you put up with his crap the worse it gets. He needs help. So good on you for finally ending it. You made the best decision possible. Your feelings towards the decision are understandable but please do a lot of research on domestic violence to get some context. &amp;#x200B;So back to a little background on my story: I started to resent myself for being so abusive. Which made the relationship even worse. Every time I couldnt control my anger or be the ideal partner to her I would self harm hoping itll teach me a lesson and id learn to get better one day. And it became this horrible cycle of me abusing her and myself until one day I snapped. We got into an argument and I left her house and sliced up my arm pretty good. I wasnt trying to kill myself, just take control of my emotions...or get help...or maybe even manipulate her?? idk really. But her dad took me to the hospital and I got 19 stitches. Her parents were very supportive of me getting treatment but didnt want me so close to their daughter anymore. The best thing that happened to me was going in and out of psych wards until I found treatment that actually helped. Also, letting go of that relationship so we can both heal was a step in the right direction. It was the only way(looking back on the situation now) that I see the abuse would have ever stopped. &amp;#x200B;I believe 100% that as long as you guys are in each other's lives neither one of you will move on to a healthier future. I now have a daughter and am in a loving relationship with somebody else. There's no abuse on either side and we're constantly growing. But that's because I had to admit I had issues and learn to grow/move on from them. The best thing you can do for yourself is accept the fact that you deserve MUCH better. It's time for you to heal. Do not visit him in the hospital. Dont have any contact with him at all. Its going to be tough but its completely necessary for your safety and well-being. Reach out to some support during this process. Maybe look into getting therapy. Join some sports clubs, find hobbies. Keep yourself distracted and moving forward. &amp;#x200B;So yeah, I dont think domestic violence ever gets better. It ends badly. Personally I think I got lucky by being so passionate about not being an abuser that I forced myself to cut contact with my ex even after she initiated contact months later. He needs to admit he's abusive(to himself), learn to grow and then move on. If he honestly cares about you he'd leave you alone to prevent from causing any more damage. But just like I was, he's manipulative af and cares more about himself. &amp;#x200B;Accept your decision to leave him. And learn to love it. It probably saved your life. &amp;#x200B;Also, if anyone is curious why I think I was abusive, I was thinking about this recently. I think it all came down to the fact that I was very weak. Of course there were a combination of other factors(seeing abuse growing up, mental illness, never learning a healthy way to express emotions etc). But I was weak and had no self worth. So control was the only way I think I found any sort of comfort. It started off small. Like getting annoyed when she talked to other dudes. Then it escalated into full blown screaming at her, attacking her self worth and preventing her from going certain places or speaking to certain people. I hated doing it. But I didnt know any other way. If I knew then what I know now I'd see those early signs of weakness in myself and be mature enough to say "hmmm, getting this jealous isnt a good sign for our future. Maybe I shouldnt be in a relationship at this time..." So, if any of you see those ealry signs in yourself or in a partner really look into ways you can improve the situation. It wont improve on its own.  [info] None [info] 1538924035
Aden_Sickle [info] A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, "strong anti social tendancies" and a schizoid affect. I have atypicsl reactions to most drugs, especially psychotropic drugs so taking any kind of medication comes with serious risks. It was decided that the best way to treat my psychosis was to not treat it. I smile and wave a lot and most people think I'm this happy well adjusted normal adult. In reality I smiling cause I'm envisioning all the terrible things that could happen to you.On the outside: "his Josh. Nice to meet you."On the inside: "do I look like I give a fuck about you or your name. I hope you fall into a valcano and die." [info] None [info] 1347900861

Brocktreee [info] I read both posts. The biggest thing that stuck out to me is that you have a relative with schizoaffective disorder. I don't know how much you know about that, so:Schizoaffective is a blend of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and when I'm manic, I get paranoid that I'm going to be attacked, I see things out of the corner of my eye, very anxious, agitated, it's bad. I don't hallucinate outside of mood states. Schizophrenic hallucinations and delusions/paranoia can happen outside of mood episodes. There's a lot more to mania than I'm getting into here, suffice to say that it's a very nasty combination.**Let me be absolutely clear:** I am not saying you have bipolar, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder.I am saying that because you have a relative, the risk of you developing one of these is higher. You have an underlying vulnerability that people unrelated to you don't have.**Let me be clear:** I am not a licensed mental health professional, just a psychology and drug education buff.That said, it is absolutely crucial that you seek emergency mental health assistance ASAP. You are not well psychologically, and you need help in getting stabilized. I'm glad you posted here.This constant drug induced derealization and paranoia is scary, for sure, and your local doctor's can help you start to get a handle on it. Big hugs. I hope you feel better soon. [info] None [info] 1531056839
captainmittens [info] A question about identity, and then an interesting happening in my family. Something's been bothering me for quite a while. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost year and a half ago now. The fact that I have bipolar disorder is on my mind pretty much all the time. I have long drives to school and work almost every day and listen to music and somehow it all reminds me; I relate it all to the bipolar without trying. It's with me at work and at school and at the grocery store and at the movie theater.Is it just like this? Will it go away in time? I keep reminding myself, "I am not my disorder," but with this playing on repeat, it gets very frustrating.Anyway, something interesting happened when I spoke to my mom on the phone today. I have been the subject of a lot of discussion and excitement for my family states away, since I'm getting married later this year back home. Suddenly I'm in contact with extended family. I'd always been the black sheep but the extended family is very close, until I moved away for school and stopped communicating. I guess I just didn't know how to keep up those relationships that were already strained due to my unmanaged disorder.My aunt has been particularly involved in the planning. Out of nowhere last week, she asked my mother if I had talked to my cousin (her daughter) about anything. Her daughter has a doctorate in psychology and is a therapist, and it was implied that perhaps I'd talked to her about a mental issue, as people do occasionally come to her with questions.Well, yes. My immediate family knows, my grandmother, and the cousin. Today my mom asked if I would think about opening it up to the rest of the family. She was surprised when I immediately said yes.Maybe it has to do with the above. It's part of my life and there's no denying it. Maybe if they know they will be more understanding; maybe it will help our relationships. Maybe when I go home for Christmas and don't join them in all-day shopping trips to the mall, there will be less eye-rolling. Or when I call my mom and she's with a large crowd of family and she tries to pass the phone around and I beg her not to, or when I text or email an aunt or uncle on their birthday instead of calling, they won't be offended.Mental illness is generally dismissed in our family as a problem with a relationship with god, or alcoholism or drug use. This could go either way but I hope it ends in education. Besides, if anyone is suffering, they don't need to do it alone like I did. [info] None [info] 1400649510

Shivoe [info] Holy crap! I have had issues with my bipolar and dr' s, as well as not being taken seriously about complications when I got the paregard as well.I was diagnosed with bipolar at 12, and they thought the best course of action was to rapid cycle me through meds every 2-3 weeks to see what worked instead of 6-12 weeks. They resulted in me being either extremely manic or completely suicidal and never finding a middle ground. That went on from age 12 to 16 until my parents divorced and I moved in with my father.After my second was born I got the paregard and about a week later my entire body, neck to the bottoms of my feet, was covered in massive hives and no one would believe me that it was the paregard! It took me 3 months before I found a doctor willing to remove it to see if the reaction stopped. Some even told me it was mental and they would go away if I stopped worrying about it (wtf?)After it was removed my hives went away in about 4 days. [info] None [info] 1520452978
captainelf [info] Why do I keep losing weight without trying to? Hi guys. I have no idea where to really put this question, any help will be valued.I'm 26,and I weigh less now than I did at age 18. I'm 1,72m tall, and I weight 74kg then. Now I weigh 63, the least that I have ever weighed. But I keep losing weight.My health background:I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and fibromyalgia at age 19. My meds was changed about two years ago from Nuzac to Lexamil. The doctors also prescribe me a lot of prednisone.I'm asking because my mother-in-law keeps commenting on my loss of weight and saying how unhealthy it is. I don't think it's a problem, seeing as my metabolism is super fast and am under a ton of stress and pressure.  It makes sense to me that I keep losing weight. Depression tends to curb your appetite, but I still eat a lot. I'm talking in the sense that I drink 1l of Coca Cola a day.My question is why do I keep losing weight without trying to?

aerikson [info] This is probably going to be buried but whatever.I was a fit and active kid growing. I played organized baseball and soccer, plus football, cops and robbers, etc etc with my friends in the neighborhood as often as I could. My mother stayed at home and made sure I ate healthy for the majority of my meals. I didn't drink much soda and the only junk food I got was when my friends and I got some extra money and bought some at the grocery store after school. Then, when I turned 11, my mother left, leaving me with my father. I don't remember much of that summer, but it was not the typically fun and active summer I usually had. Because of the various things that happened, I quit many of the things that I used to love, including soccer, baseball, and piano. Because my dad worked long hours and commuted at least two hours a day, he often was unable to feed me properly, and even if he could, he was not a good cook. So, if we did eat at home, it was something awful like Hamburger Helper, but more often, it was pizza or McDonalds. That same year, my father and I moved to a different neighborhood. While I stayed in the area somewhat near my friends, I was far enough away that I didn't really want to go for the long walk and meet up with them. So, that lack of any social activity not only took away the last bit of common physical exercise it got, it also depressed the hell out of me.Over the next 6 years or so, my life was mostly video games, junk food, and mental health problems. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (probably from my mother who I rarely saw then nor do I see now) and put on drug after drug after drug. The most significant being Lithium, which I think had a major effect on my weight. I don't really hold anyone responsible for the drugs though as I was an awful child, often skipping school and reacting aggressively towards others. I got expelled from three schools from the ages of 11-15.As I got older, my diet and physical activity level still remained unhealthy. I did start getting more active once I dropped out of school and started to work full time. Most of the work was very physically demanding which was wonderful, but with my own income and now a car, I usually made up for the increase in exercise with even worse food. Mentally and socially, I got better as well though, as I met new friends through work and have been able to stay sane without drugs since the age of 17.It was this year that I actually decided to change my lifestyle and become a physically active adult who eats healthy. Last year, two of my best friends got married and went to Disney World during their honeymoon. They wanted to go again and bring their friends along. Knowing I would be wary of going since my size not only made air travel uncomfortable but made some rides impossible for me to go on, they said they would pay the whole way if I lost weight. They never said how much or how I should, they just said lose weight. It took a few months for that offer to kick in, but I realized, why the fuck not?So, starting in April of this year, I picked up a low carb and low calorie diet, started working a very physically active job, and found myself at the gym once a day. On April 20th, 2012, when I started this whole mess, I weighed myself at 389 lbs. As of yesterday, I weigh 255 lbs. No lies, no bullshit. Most of the time, I don't believe myself, but I did it. I'm not going to say it was easy, because that isn't fair to other people who are doing the best they can to lose weight, but it is possible to lose weight. [Here is a picture of me from my aforementioned friends' wedding and a picture of me last month](http://i.imgur.com/QUw9e.jpg). I will also be happy to say that my friends and I went down to Orlando two weeks ago for five days at Disney World and Universal Studios and I had an amazing time (even better when they're paying!).

Myself and my fiancé have just moved into our first house together and whilst getting his life insurance sorted would be fairly straightforward, mine is an absolute nightmare. I’m a female, non smoker, non drinker. Aged 25. Sadly, I tried to commit suicide in August ‘16 leading to me being sectioned until October ‘16. Whilst an inpatient I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I’ve been on a number of medications since then, although this has now been reduced to just two.

For the last four years, I have become unpleasant manic with strong irritably where I am throwing things, yelling, and hiding upstairs so my extended family doesn't see me yelling, though I know I'm not hiding it well. My family has tried to help me by providing quiet, small, and non-stressful holidays, but the same thing happens.

CuriousQuill [info] Only love can hurt like this. Unrequited love, at seventeen, will affect your brain chemistry just as much as the roll call of substances you've taken for the pain. When your heart gets emptied out like that, you do what you need to fill it up. A broken heart leaks though, so you keep on pouring the shit in... and your heart doesn't heal. I hope you can keep up your sobriety. You have a lot of insight. I was suicidal when I was 30, after I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I thought my life was over. The next 10 years were a struggle. And life still is a struggle. But those 10 years were also filled with life and love and genuine happiness at times, and although they were hard to live I am glad I lived them - even the really shitty parts. Bad experiences make for good stories: today's catastrophe is tomorrow's amusing anecdote. And remember: you are only a truly rounded human being if you have had your heart broken.

ittyxbitty [info] My green day story. Green day has been playing in the background of my life for as long as I can remember. My oldest sister has been a huge fan since dookie. Because of this I have always been aware of them and since becoming a fan in my own right it seems they've put out music I just happen to need at that point in my life.In 2005 I entered high school, started those weird, awkward, and sometimes horrifying teen years, my parents got divorced, and the Jesus of suburbia became my savior. My father was severely depressed, my mother moved in with her side piece, and I was lost. The anger, pain, and sense of rebellion that poured out of American idiot brought me back.A few years later 21st century breakdown dropped right in the middle of my own personal breakdown. My mother had given up on me since I wouldn't fit myself into what her idea of a daughter should be, my dad worked a Lot and I was alone 80% of the time, I was a senior in high school and I thought i was going insane. Turns out I was. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was riding the tide of trying to find the right medication and attempted to kill myself. I left the hospital a week later and received a therapist from my mother and 21st century breakdown from my sister. The therapist helped a bit but the music helped more. Then I got pregnant and that album carried me through the Terror of becoming an adult and mother. In 2012 I hit a really rough patch. I had just turned 21, I was trying to get a hold on my mental health and raise a 2 year old. We can all agree that a Lot of the trilogy was bad but the lightheartedness mixed with serious and emotional songs was exactly what I needed as I navigated the stormy sea that was my mind. After billie joes meltdown green day fell off my radar a bit.Then 2016 happened. I saw the lyric video for bang bang on Facebook. My sister called to tell me about the AMAs (No KKK no facist USA no trump). Then my father ended up in the hospital. He had to undergo a quadruple bypass on his heart which then got severely infected and he was placed in a coma for almost 3 weeks. During one of the many long drives to the hospital still breathing came on the radio and that song broke me. For the first time since he had been admitted I cried. I had a panic attack. Then I felt better, because I was a mother barely holding it together but I was still breathing. And so was my dad. He got better. Things got better.I listened to rev rad in its entirety and it resparked my mild obsession with the band. I received tickets to see them for the first time on my birthday and I cried when they played still breathing. And yes I had the time of my life. By no means has green day been the only music to get me through but they have been the most consistent. Even though I've never met them it feels like they're old friends. Even though they have no idea, we've been through a Lot together. They were my friends when I had none.I grew up in a very musical household. I heard country from my mother, rap from my brother, pop from my middle sister, classic rock from my dad, and punk from my oldest sister. Green day is the band I credit my life to even though plenty of other music has helped me along the way. Green day is the only band I feel an emotional attachment to. I feel proud of them like a person would feel proud seeing their best friend succeed in life. Their passion, and how far they've come yet how humble they remain and how open they are with their fans makes me feel as if I know them personally and I'm so excited to see where they go next.I suck at endings so I'll leave it at that. I would love to hear others stories as well. How you found them, why they stuck with you, how they helped you. If you made it this far, thanks for hearing me out.*edited to add that I completely forgot it was Sunday. [info] None [info] 1505068606
BabyAfricanElephant [info] Take her to dinner and start a conversation talk about your childhood or your past and then say yeah and at 16 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it was pretty rough but I managed to cope with it through medication. However, it still affects my life from time to time blah blah blah. And see what she says if she says nothing then move on or answer any of her questions. You could then say that you are glad that you finally told her because some people find it a deal breaker and you wanted to make it known before it got more serious. Then she is aware of it and you can talk about it freely whenever you want from then on to give her a better picture!  [info] None [info] 1484018442
ReddyLee [info] I met my husband at 19 and thought I wanted children at the time.  Though, I was confused and conflicted about a lot of my beliefs.  I was Catholic, but didn't feel that fit me right.  I was struggling to come out publicly to my family and friends (I'm bisexual.)  there were a lot of fundamental beliefs to contend with at the time.  I solved the bisexual outing first...kind of the low hanging fruit.  Next I danced with childfree and my husband was supportive.  Then I put that idea back in a box and continued wanting children.  Meanwhile, i came out as an atheist and I went back to college.  I got a degree in psychology.  During this process, I finally solidified my childfree decision.My husband and I decided our life should be a childfree one.  I was about 27 at this point.  I finished college at 29.  And I succumbed to my uterus' desperate plea for me to grow a baby in it.  My husband was reserved, but on board.  Then three months later, I decided that my major medical issues (gut stuff) made me unfit to carry a child and I had always thought of myself as someone who would adopt, not conceive.  So we adjusted the plan and started looking into adoption.Then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  This didn't automatically stop the adoption process for us, but we did have to pause and take stock of our lives and the practicality of parent a child or children with one of us having mental illness.  We decided that without our support network in place and our access to resources, that we could totally proceed with adoption safely.Then we thought about it a little more and realized that it wouldn't be fair to depend on a support network and it wouldn't be fair to a child.  We also recognized that living childfree is something that we loved for 10 years already, so why consider changing that?  We decided to commit all our love and devotion to each other instead of having children.  My hormones calmed down enough for my heart to have a chance to be heard.  And it said it didn't want to be a parent.  I think I wanted to be childfree all along, but I really knew after truly considering and investigating the process.  The hormones were overwhelming me.  It was all I could think about for a while there.  My body's biological needs were really trying to be met! But once they calmed down a bit, my heart and my head were able to finally figure it all out.  It was about 11 years total with the up and down.  Mostly knowing I wanted to be CF, but occasionally getting confused.Tl;dr I want 29 when the CF lifestyle and I fully clicked, despite my ladyparts' best efforts.

lankira [info] I, too was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. However, I don't have the psychosis nor symptoms as severe as the ones you listed (mania for me is mostly just the rage, self-destructive behavior, and mild insomnia). I am also rapid-cycling (my cycle is weekly to biweekly instead of the yearly "standard").Before I was diagnosed with bipolar, a doc had assumed it was PMDD, and prescribed a birth control to help with that. The pill only made my periods worse and didn't help with the psych problems. Conclusion: Sometimes, even MDs don't know the difference. [info] None [info] 1316800636
yaosio [info] I used to yell and scream and threaten to kill myself as a little yaosio. I had no problem physically attacking my parents, but I never damaged anything because I would feel bad knowing somebody would have to clean up the mess. I think I hated my parents as much as a little kid could hate their parents because I was an angel at school and around everybody else. My parents changed nothing and I grew out of it. A child psychologist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder, but then it turned out he wasn't actually licensed. Later in life I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a licensed psychologist.How it presents is completely different today than as a little me. I would cry at the slightest frustration and become very angry but only directed at my parents. Now I am depressed all the time and get very anxious when I am frusturated. Very particular frustrations make me angry instantly, like bad UI design.So now you know what that dude does can be an innate trait regardless of parenting. [info] 💩 poster [info] 1519295665

Weissach [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I have my master's and have been working in that field for roughly 4 years now. Historically I did the 2 years at one place thing (since undergrad), but it was mostly because better opportunities presented themselves. I have been working for the government for a little over 2 years but in different positions (recent change). I've gotten lucky and have had really understanding/supportive coworkers and supervisors, so the BP hasn't really been an issue (i.e. never fired for disciplined). I do find myself getting bored, though. Regardless, don't let you BP deter you from doing something you love. I've had good luck with being open about my illness at work, which has made the bad times much easier to deal with since my supervisors knew it wasn't "me". If you made it through a master's program, then you can handle a job =] Also, talk to your therapist (if you don't have one, I highly recommend seeking one). [info] None [info] 1558310342
gotstonoe [info] i say take the risk but ultimately it comes down to what your mental illness is like. If you think you can manage it or will be able to see a therapist while in uni then by all means go for it. Also uni is where a lot of people get mental illnesses since it is at about the age where they show up and the stress of uni can push the stress-diathesis. I would suggest if you do go don't overwork yourself, eat healthy, exercise, and create a solid support system while there. Don't be afraid of seeking help from profs, friends, and in some cases family. I was diagnosed with bipolar II this past year and i'm still in uni and working my ass off. I've learned as much as i can about it and seek therapy. It can get in the way at times tbh. It's hard but i've grown and learned so much these past couple of years that i don't regret coming. I'm glad i have my support system and i help them out when possible.I hope this helps [info] None [info] 1439580735

FieryGhosts [info] Link between bipolar disorder and IBS? I was diagnosed with bipolar bipolar 5 years ago (but had 4 years of other mental health diagnoses before they decided it was actually bipolar). Earlier this year, I was diagnosed with IBS and put on the FODMAP diet. It’s turned my life around. People had always told me that my IBS symptoms (like periodically not eating) were bipolar symptoms.This new diet has improved not only my IBS symptoms, but also my bipolar symptoms and resolved the first thing I went to the doctor with 9 years ago.I’ve done some research and they’re starting to find a link between bipolar disorder and IBS. Has anyone else here been diagnosed with IBS or tried the FODMAP diet? Has it helped or no?Would anyone here be interested in trying the diet to see if it helps their bipolar symptoms?How many people here feel as if doctors completely dismiss their physical symptoms.

exulansis- [info] The payoff for an accurate diagnosis is greater than the cost of its impact on self-image. Self-image will adapt. The same cannot be easily said for the repeated scarring and open wounds from years of untreated bipolar.I was diagnosed with bipolar and OCD roughly 15 years after they first emerged. The bipolar is treated. An enterprising pdoc decided to go after the OCD with high-dose Zoloft. The OCD is only now being treated, more than 20 years after onset. I have endured horrors due to both illnesses. I have lost a great deal. I would not wish this on you. [info] None [info] 1493197948
LaneyyCakes [info] Hey guys, so I've been dating my boyfriend now for 8 months. He's 22 and I'm 19. We met in college and had the time of our lives together. We're absolutely head over heels for each other and are talking about getting married. The problem is, he graduated last spring and moved to Indiana for grad school while I'm still taking classes in Delaware. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in the spring of last year and shortly after, tried to commit suicide. Since then I've been living at home with my parents and taking part time classes at the University. I absolutely hate living at home and I feel like it's making me feel so much worse about myself. Me and my boyfriend decided to give it a trial run and I went to visit for a week in August. I had the time of my life and he hadnt seen me that happy since we lived together in Delaware. While I was there I decided to stay an extra three days. I called my mom and she proceeded to tell me that I was ruining her summer and that she's disappointed in me. Fast forward to now, me and my boyfriend have decided on moving in together on the 26 of December. I have no doubts this is the right move but the only thing that worries me is telling me parents. Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I'm absolutely horrified to bring this up.  [info] None [info] 1537416821
myotherguy [info] I’m sorry you’re having this experience, as I’m sure it’s fairly disconcerting. It also does sound pretty fascinating, though. Upon first reading, I thought these sounded like petit mal seizures, but I’m not a doctor and I don’t have epilepsy myself.I used to have a similar experience pretty regularly, albeit a bit different, so maybe I can help a little? Idk. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar II, often late at night while I was getting ready for bed, I would have some phrase from a song lyric or a line from the Mass that would get stuck in my head. I would start repeating the line to myself over and over again, and it would produce that “tip of the tongue” sensation that you describe— I would feel like I was just on the edge of having a break through and that phrase or memory was somehow the key to unlocking another memory or some secret that would help me understand something intensely profound. It would be this overwhelming sense of foreboding, but like, a *positive* foreboding, if that makes any sense. After I was diagnosed with bipolar and started taking medication, these episodes stopped. This was before I had ever smoked weed, though, so it was unrelated to that. I’m sorry if that’s not much help. TL;DR: used to have similar experiences when I was unmedicated bipolar. Went on medication and they stopped. Not weed related for me.  [info] None [info] 1514307383

SartesLazyEye [info] Hello! I am diagnosed with bipolar 1 and ADHD. This is actually a rather tricky situation, a huge side effect of attention stimulants is that they can cause irritability, mood swings, and excitability--which are all bipolar symptoms. However, if your mood symptoms are properly stabilized with a mood stabilizer, then you shouldnt be susceptible to those side effects. I personally am on lamictal, hydroxizine, and abilify. And adding adderal literally changed my life for the better. However, one thing i did experience was when i started i became a little hypomanic, then slightly emotionless following that peroid. However, now all that stabilized and i just get high attention and productivity, with our any impact on my mood [info] None [info] 1573432723

SoButtscrewed [info] I went through something similar, OP! I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one. I was diagnosed with bipolar in the Air Force about a year in and had attempted suicide. My actions also led to a stripe being removed (which I never think is the right thing to do with someone diagnosed with mental illness). I personally faced my leadership not being as understanding (my commander even said he didn't think I was mentally ill!). I think it's great you wrote this because it's important for people to understand what mental illness is like and that it's not a state of mind that goes away by smiling or watching sponge bob and pretending everything is hunky dory. In most cases it sticks with you for life. I've been out of the Air Force for about 6 months and the outside world will do you so much better. I'm off my medication, I've lost 30 pounds (gained 100 in the military), and I have a job where I feel appreciated and needed, and have time to spend on myself.

You're not a piece of shit for "not being able to handle the mental illness", she's a piece of shit for using her mental illness as an excuse to behave however she wants with no regard for how it affects other people.Also, sudden, unexplained accusations of cheating usual mean that the accuser is cheating.**TL;DR:** Dump this girl, she cray :P [info] 24, Boston [info] 1475954116
yeoldesarz [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a little over a year ago after a pretty bad manic episode. The signs were there for a long time, but most people (myself included) thought I was just depressed. Even today, I think the worst part is not knowing whether you're having a good day or you're a bit manic. I've been prescribed meds which I take most of the time, but every now and then I stop because I convince myself that I'm not bipolar. And that's when I realize that I most certainly am bipolar.

DelMaximum [info] I'm not suggesting a compete rehaul of the educational system. But more of a consideration for an individuals capacity for knowledge or activity would be beneficial I think. I could use myself as an example of where this point is coming from.As a very intelligent child, I was often bored in class. In both public and private schools I quickly learned how to skate through my classes, barely passing on the tests alone, rarely turning in homework. Rather than having a system that could rise to my needs, I began to backslide, not seeing the value in an education that could not sate my thirst. It was only when I could not get into college that I realized what I had done to my chances. There are countless variables that led to all of this. One of them is that at the age of seven or eight I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD. Medication for these 'ailments' began immediately. Before I had even got well into my development I was undergoing a regiment of chemical all for the sake of helping me fit in. Today I am perfectly healthy and functional without the use of those pills. Had I been undrugged through my childhood, and placed in an environment where my mind was accepted and nurtured instead of drugged and forced to behave against it's inclination, I probably would be in a much more successful position in life. But now I'm just a very intelligent barista.  [info] None [info] 1301957493
FlamingZebra [info] It made me realize a lot about the world. But also it split my ego with my ego-less self. A lot of times I have problems coming back to reality because reality is a place where ego will push you into a place where you work and make money and are a slave to society. I want to be successful, but losing me ego has caused me to realize that life isn't about anything that society says it is. Acid can help to a certain extent, but when you become addicted to escaping reality it becomes something that pushes you away from the world itself. I find disconnect in other people. However, I am getting better. I am going to treatment and learning ways to piece my reality back together.Edit: I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and taking acid took the different personalities in my head to a different level to the point where it's hard to know who I really am anymore. If you start feeling like acid is creating a different world for you, you should take a step back and take time to settle and understand that being able to cope and work with reality is a part of living a happy life. It is a beautiful drug don't get me wrong, but when you start getting to know people who take acid way more than they should, you start to realize how it can negatively affect someones life. It's a drug to take with caution. Every trip is a different experience, and for some people, it's hard to stop thinking they way they did when they trip. It's a powerful tool for altering the mind, but that doesn't always mean people use it in the right way. [info] None [info] 1442008774

Ryveks [info] I never was officially diagnosed with PTSD, but I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I probably do have it, it's been thrown around by my psychologists. I watched my mom die of a cerebral hemorrhage when I was 17 and had to deal with a lot of family drama (taking care of my father and older brother). I really didn't exhibit any serious signs of being bipolar before that (though looking back, there were a few times here and there you could say I mildly was). When I was 20, I spent almost a year psychotically depressed. This, too, contributed to me being severely traumatized (including very vivid/lucid dreams of my mom trying to kill me). I'm on medications now, and I phase in and out sometimes of having milder versions of the feelings of being traumatized by losing my mom. Sometimes I can have those nice hypomanic phases, where I feel like I have so much still ahead of me, and I can take on the world. If you can't afford therapy and medications for now, and you do the diet, exercise thing, try finding someone, anyone you can open up to. Maybe your closest friend, maybe us on here. I found that it helps a lot when you remember there are people out there who care about you. I know I have a huge, huge problem opening up to my friends. I always feel like I'm a huge burden to them, raining on their parade, making them feel bad for me and helpless because there's nothing they can do for me. One of my biggest issues has been feeling like I have nothing to fall back on, no safety net. I was super close to my mom, a total homebody, and now I don't even have a place to call home. I think one of the biggest steps for me has been finding a place I feel safe. When I find those places, yeah I'll still have my depressed moments and even some hypo-manic ones, but I can handle everything better. I realized that with the added stresses, I feel more like I'm losing control of everything, making everything worse. I can control myself a lot better when I'm depressed (or so some part of me thinks) so I almost feel like I shut myself down. When there's some thing that grounds me, somewhere I can go and feel safe, my brain kind of rides the bipolar waves much more easily. I can handle the depressed bits because I know eventually I'll feel grand again and I have the energy to take what comes. [info] None [info] 1278273894
VistaVilla_Mac [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 before BPD. I used to have major mood swings that were long lasting, but with proper medication they went away. Then BPD was apparent because I would have regular problems with emotions that didn't last very long essentially. To answer your question if you get the right medication for bipolar disorder it can be managed very well. That allows you to work on dealing with BPD through DBT or something like that.

JamalPancakes [info] In 1996... In 1996, I was 20 years old. I felt isolated, hypnotized by soap operas and clinically depressed. (7 years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.) But I wanted to be an actress. This time of my life is very convoluted in my mind because I was drunk a lot, doing drugs, having sex for the first time. I was performing in a theater group with people who were several years older than me and liked to party and hook up with each other. It was a lot of fun. I felt free but also constantly confused, insecure, and clueless. My friends regarded me as an innocent. Part of the group was MM, who wrote music for our shows. I was dating his 32 year old band mate (BF). A few things had happened between the 2 of them that broke up the band:~~MM apparently stole a bunch of BF’s equipment. In retaliation, BF made a webpage featuring MM’s ex-wife’s naked pictures announcing that MM stole his equipment.  The .com was the name of MM’s new band. ~~When MM started his new band, BF attempted to sabotage a contest MM’s band entered. They aborted the plan when I unexpectedly showed up at the show.  I’m not sure what BF and his cronies had planned... I think maybe egg them when they were on stage?  It was definitely to humiliate them in some way. I was shocked, drunk, naive, and had no idea how to handle the situation.  My reaction was to try and not get involved. I just knew that I liked MM’s music better than BF’s, (Haha) and I wanted to remain MM’s friend, but had no idea how.  A few months before all the bullshit, BF had me sing on a parody song of an incident that took place between MM and a girl sexin’ it up in a parking lot that went wrong.  I thought it was all in good fun. Several friends took part in it too, but I was singing, I was the featured one. I became super regretful. It was mean spirited.  So I’m sure MM believed I was a part of BF’s other schemes too. His nickname for me was “Linda”, then it became “Yoko”.  Great. I ended up becoming one of those drunk &amp; psychotic girlfriends. Rambling on about nonsense. Resentful. Angry. Inconsolable. Until BF cut off all contact with me. I needed it, but I had a major nervous breakdown requiring hospitalization. I got clean and I’ve been clean ever since. 15 years now. I had no idea what the rest of my friends knew about my situation. If I was hated, if I was forgiven?  I had cut all of them off too.  I’m sure I became “that psycho chick”, but they knew I needed to change. So 3 years ago, MM posted on Facebook a video of a musical we had done. It is excruciating to see myself in it. The regret is overwhelming.  MM friended me, we messaged very briefly, I was weird and vague. I don’t know why  He was reaching out, but I was weird.  But we were cordial. He unfriended me soon after. And I was embarrassed all over again. So today, that video must have come up on his memories notifications, and he commented.... “There’s a really nice moment near the end where it seems that the two almost kiss.” The two. THE TWO. Not “you guys”, not “you two”.  The two.  Like I’m a non-person. A non-friend.  I really feel like I’m overreacting. Is he reaching out again?  Why would he say it like that?  It was also a nice thing to say, but it definitely felt like a fuck you. I’m remembering those crazy person feelings and I understand how I would blow any unpleasant feeling I had out of proportion. Y’know how social media makes you think that everyone’s life is better?  That all of your old friends are still best friends and are hanging out without you?  How they’re able to maintain a good relationship for years and years and you’re just a failure because you don’t get the wedding invitations or get to have a lovely genuine reaction to their baby being born. I don’t always feel this way, but seeing his comment made me remember everything. I guess this is what happens when you’re 42. And a recovering addict. And have mental illness.

Church-of-Nephalus [info] Feeling 'high/good' and 'low/bad' days? [Discussing Bipolar 1] So I was diagnosed with bipolar I a few months ago and I am getting treatment for it, but I do want to discuss something about it. My mania days, or what I call high days, involve extreme activity. I get more work done, I feel a lot better about myself, I feel like I can take on the world. The best part about it is that I get stuff done, as I have a lot of projects. My bad days, or low days, are sluggish. They make me want to stay in bed, I get very depressing and even suicidal thoughts during those days. I get existential.But is it weird that I can feel these days? For example, on a mania day, I feel lighter. I feel more active. It's like I'm in full swing, I can't stay still, I'm very excited. On a low day, I feel heavy. Everything is slow. I don't feel like getting up. My eyes are constantly down. I feel like sleeping constantly.Is it strange to 'feel' your mania or low days? [info] None [info] 1581820337
bhgiel [info] Bipolar, addiction, and shrooms Psyhcodelics have been all the buzz lately. The part that catches me the most is the possible ability to combat addiction. I have been an alcoholic for years and cannot put down weed or cigs. I really feel that a trip on shrooms might really help me out. Unfortunately I have been diagnosed with bipolar for the majority of my life. I often hear that these two dont mix well. I also always joke with my friends that I am one psychotic break away from this or that... lol. I've got a micro dose of shrooms and want to give them a go, however I am unceartin of what may happen. There is not much research on this and was curious what the university of reddit thought. [info] None [info] 1531185253
EtherealBipolar [info] It’s my 23rd birthday in 20 minutes and I feel like I should have died last April So, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 with rapid cycling in June last year after trying to kill myself in spectacular fashion between April and then. I still feel no closer to anything and can practically feel myself getting worse. All I can think is that I regret failing, and I wish I’d never made it to this birthday. I hate my birthday as it has REALLY bad memories for me attached to it and family keeps saying happy birthday because none of them know and it just makes it worse. I didn’t want to do this again and I feel like healthcare and those around me are dragging me to it. My best friend decided that it was best that I failed my 4 (and counting) attempts as he can still spend time with me, completely ignoring the fact that I find mere existence painful. Not just bipolar either, I have a trapped nerve in my spine, so constant burning pain in my arm. I just feel like everything is always getting worse and I can’t tell anyone. I didn’t ever want to get this far but I feel like my choice has been taken away. [info] None [info] 1553470801

Mittinmang [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a professional psychiatrists in a clinic. I've made my peace with it, or at least I try to cope with it and try to keep my balanced without medication. I just wish my family, especially my mom would understand that I'm trying my hardest but sometimes I'm just depressed and sometimes I do crazy stuff out of nowhere without caring about the consequences. Her constant judgement makes it hard to fight against my own brain because I feel like it's my fault, I'm doing it KNOWING I shouldn't, which isn't true.But to be positive: In my manic episodes I'm doing crazy stuff, and yeah, I'm in debt. But it's an adventure and it sometimes actually helps me doing things that I always wanted to do; Just like moving 600km away from home for my first love. I may be struggling a lot, but at least I get to see a lot of beauty. [info] None [info] 1540507091

wheelchairassassins [info] I love my story. I was in a manic phase, it was a long one with a lot of promiscuity and thievery and compulsions. He found me on MySpace and after a month of talking, invited me to his house for a movie. He had a cold, so I brought a can of soup and didn't even heat it up. Let's face it, I was planning on getting laid and that would probably be that. I ended up spending the night, and we watched Star Trek: Wrath of Khan (first brush with real sci fi I had ever had) and then the next day I watched him play video games all day. The next weekend we spent together and Sunday night, after I went home, he checked himself into a hospital for hallucinations, visual and auditory. He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and I felt like just bailing on him because he had a diagnosis of some kind. (This was before I was diagnosed with anything, I just thought I was generally fucked up.) In the ensuing months, he was kicked out of his house, had to move in with his terrible birth parents who he didn't have any contact with at the time, off and on all kinds of anti psychotics...it was a really hectic year and I didn't know what I was doing. I just knew that a) I was emotionally dependent and desperate for someone to love me and b) I really liked this guy a lot! He went on disability, things settled and we're now 11 years on. Since then, I've been diagnosed with bipolar, gone through ridiculous med changes and have also gone on disability, so now we live the life of two 30-something octogenarians. It's my favorite love story. [info] None [info] 1477612734
_exobot [info] My new medication change is making things hard. I just got on Ritalin for the first time since I was little. Today is only the second day, but I already feel like it's ruining everything. I've been stable and feeling good for a long time. I've been on the same prescriptions for at least two years. I had been feeling good about myself, healthy, stable in my moods, and reasonably happy. But now I feel awful. My self-esteem is in the toilet. I'm moody, I'm sensitive, and I feel like crying throughout the day. I know I've made a lot of progress over the years, and my psychiatrist of 11+ years says I'm the most responsible mentally ill young person he's ever treated. I take all my medication every day at the same time (I even have a watch set). I've worked so hard. So, so hard just to try to be functional and I know this may be wrongheaded, but I've fought to come off as normal as well. If you met me, you would probably never suspect that I'm disabled. I've done so much to try to live a normal life. I take care of my teeth, my hygeine, my own bills, my social responsibilities. I'm unemployed right now, but it's so I can take care of my dad, who had a heart attack two years ago and is in a wheelchair, but I had a job for over half a year where I fit in with no one the wiser. And it was a HARD job. Average day was 11 hours and I once worked a 19-hour day. And I was the one who left. But now I feel like I just have nothing. I feel like I don't have friends, even though I do, and I feel like I haven't made any progress, even though I have. I've been here before. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder, GAD, panic disorder with agoraphobia, ADD, hypothyroidism, and I've got sleep apnea on top of it. I usually don't dwell on it, but I'm back to feeling like I got fucked sideways by genetics. I'm on so many pills I can't even remember how many I take each day most of the time. I think it's two Lamictal, three Klonopin, one Lithium, one and a half Liothyronine, one Levothyroxine, one Pristiq, and now one Ritalin. My attention span is improving, but I just feel so ruined. Like I'm falling apart. I'm being pushed to my limits for the millionth time. I'll never give up, ever. Life is too precious. But I'm just hitting bottom. I've felt for years that the only way to rehabilitate is to do it all yourself, so I'm not used to reaching out for help, but I just feel so helpless and awful. I don't know what to do. I don't even fully know why I'm here. I guess I just need to reach out. Can someone help me? This is terrible. I'm so sick. [info] None [info] 1453488015

Void_pup [info] “You don’t have that genetic mental illness” My NMom has always made things about her- no matter what happens to the members of our family, she wants to be in the spotlight more than she wants to support.In March 2017 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder- which is late-onset (I’m 23 now) and genetic. I confide in my parents as this is the hardest thing- or at least how it affected my job- that I have had to endure, and I was living out of state away from family anyway. They seemed pretty supportive over text... but then I went to visit them. While I was with them for 2 weeks, my illness was brought up because of circumstances, and my NMom had the gall to tell me that, despite the clinical diagnosis, do not have bipolar disorder. I also heard this from my parents’ friends when they filled them in. I, and adult who has lived away from family for 3 years, was obviously mistaken about my mental health... /sAnyway, after my visit I returned to my own home states away from them and get a text a couple days later. From my dad: “Your mother has appointment April 9th because she has (insert my symptoms here)”. Keep in mind, now, that bipolar disorder is late-onset in that it will show up around 16-25 years old (most commonly) and is not later developed at 47 years old weeks after your daughter finds out she has it. Weeks pass and she has her appointment. She talks to a doctor and gets diagnosed with Adult ADHD. She says it makes sense of her growing up and how her personality is, which should be supported, sure. But wait, she needs to find resources like support groups and doesn’t know if she can take Adderall daily. She tells me how hard it is to work with her condition, and she’s taking time off to “figure some stuff out”. About a month later she starts texting me to talk to my doctor about my diagnosis. Because surely, I have Adult ADHD and not bipolar disorder. Because I’ve “never shown signs” when I was growing up, and that if she has it then I do too. This was easy to ignore the first few times it was brought up. I told my psychologist, moved on, whatever. Now I’m living with my parents again, after losing my job in another state (because illness, mind you). It’s harder to ignore now, as my mother and I drove 1500 miles to get me back to my hometown, I was berated about how the doctors and medications I had were not going to do anything for me. Because HER diagnosis makes more sense than MINE (in her eyes, not in actuality).And it’s something I’m still annoyingly dealing with. She wants me to see her doctors and get the “right diagnosis”. As if my own plights and difficulties I’ve endured over the last 5 years as my mental health has suffered all mean nothing.  Because, obviously, I’m not as sick as I think I am.

Explolguy [info] First, I'd like to thank you for replying.I understand very much where he's coming from. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years ago after a suicide attempt. I spent a lot of time in a very bad place, and got out because I realized I needed help and let people help. A lot of my suggestions at doing certain activities come with the offer of doing them with me. We play games, we go out and do random whatever now and again. There are also days where he needs to vent, and I listen. But he asks for advice, and I give it, and he simply shrugs it off, saying he, "Can't do it and will never change," among other things.I am one person, and obviously not qualified to give suggestions, opinions, a diagnosis etc. that professionals are qualified to give. He acknowledges that he needs help, but doesn't want to make the jump to get it. I've been going around for months with him. And as ashamed as I am to admit this, I'm ready to throw in the towel. He has a bunch of people ready to help him at a moment's notice, and it's getting frustrating  [info] None [info] 1389269022
IEatYourFruitLoops [info] Hitting rock bottom, not sure where to go In a therapy session this past week I realized that I'm depressed. I was diagnosed with bipolar ii a few years ago, but I've been mildly medicated since then, so it never occurred to me that it might still be a thing.About 2 years ago I was in the middle of a serious weight loss attempt that left me 50lbs down and feeling good. Then I started a new job that provided free unlimited snacks (Cheetos, Cheez-its, etc) and I gained 15 lbs back. I haven't stepped on a scale since then but based on my current back pain, I'm probably another 10+lbs up.So I'm depressed and overweight and constantly in pain and I'm feeling helpless. My boyfriend has been amazing, but he deserves so much more than what I am able to give him. Every time I think about sex I feel embarrassed and gross. I look down at my naked body and think "ew".I don't know what I'm looking to accomplish with this post, but I'm constantly stressed and grumpy and feeling desperate, so I guess I figure, what's the worst that could happen. I'm already at the lowest low that I've seen since my sister died, so how bad can it get.I have an appointment with a psychiatrist, but I have to reschedule it for work. I hate picking up the phone, and my workload makes for a convenient excuse. Everything is hard. Getting up is hard. Making an important phone call is hard. I love my job, but going to work is hard. Every day I want to cry, but I'm an adult and there is no crying in baseball.I keep telling myself that I need to keep going for my boyfriend and my family. My family has already lost one sister/daughter, it wouldn't be fair if they lost another. And my boyfriend has been nothing but wonderful, and he doesn't deserve anything like that (not that anyone does, but him especially not).The people I love are the only ones sustaining me these days, but I'm not sure how long that's going to last. I need to find a solution soon. [info] None [info] 1481515678

HarryTheGreyhound [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about eighteen years ago.  It is hard, but lithium/lamotrigine are effective and the side-effects are manageable.  There is absolutely no shame in having an illness like this, nor in getting help.

Lequids [info] Am I becoming immune to my medicine? Hello all,I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about a year ago, and I’ve been on Lithium for a solid 4 months straight now. It worked really well in the beginning. My moods were stable and controllable, my sleeping schedule was on track, and for the first time in a while I finally had some mental clarity. But the past month or so, I’ve noticed the effects have been deteriorating. It started with my sleeping schedule. Instead of getting a normal 6-8 hours every night, I went back to my usual routine of not sleeping more than 3 hours a night for 2-3 days and then crashing for 12+ hours. After that, I noticed that I was getting more irritable than usual. I chalked both of these up to personal stresses and ignored it. But the last 36 hours have been really weird. I didn’t sleep at all last night, and when I finally managed to take a short nap, I woke up feeling very depressed for seemingly no reason at all. I’ve been very adamant on taking my pills, I think I’ve only missed it 3 or 4 times in the last 4 months, and none of those times were within the last month. Anyone else experience anything like this? [info] None [info] 1546812539

IcarianSkies [info] My daily emotional state was just empty sadness. I thought a lot about killing myself, I planned to off myself before 25, no point in living through adulthood. I self-harmed. I slept all day and found very little joy in anything. I was prone to fits of violent rage, and periods of random crying. But there were random periods of time where everything was sunshine and rainbows and I had to do all the things. Omg my room is dirty clean the room ahh somebody left dishes in the sink wash the dishes I don't like the furniture arrangement rearrange the living room. A million miles an hour. I'd sleep 3 hours a night versus my normal depressed 14 hours. And then I'd just crash and go right back to the empty sadness. It took me a while to realise it, but I did eventually come to the conclusion that this mania was nowhere near normal, and I'd grown up seeing it in my mother and recognised the symptoms. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder last year and I'm a completely different person now that I'm medicated. [info] None [info] 1498356323

zemorah [info] I think part of the reason, unlike other illnesses, is because you can't "see" it most of the time. Also, people with mental illness might go long stretches of time without visible symptoms so maybe people think they were exaggerating before or aren't as ill as they claim to be. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago and my illness was quite obvious then. I've been off meds for awhile and function fairly well these days too. But there are still times I feel it creeping up on me. I think my long stretch of "normal" makes people think it isn't that serious. It's just as serious though but I've learned to recognize it and be proactive about it.I hope that makes sense.  [info] None [info] 1504415800
mjb8989 [info] StrawberryBlondeHaze I really can relate. I lost a lot of my friends to drugs after I decided to finally walk away from that life. It kills me to see where some of them are at now. But that’s where you just have to remember to care for yourself before anythingIt doesn’t matter how hard your goal is, you can 100% do it :) just take it slow and go day by day in the right direction to get you there. As long as you continue to progress, you will get to where you need to be. And if it’s not where you WANT, that just means you set yourself for something better that you never even expected, and I’m saying that from experience.Okay just a heads up StrawberryBlonde, what I just typed is long as f$¢€, but I did it because I just have this gut feeling I needed to share this story with you. So, you’ve been warned!I was in retail for 10 years in the wireless industry. Started at WalMart, went to work at some cell phone kiosk in a Sam’s Club, left there to work for Sprint, then AT&amp;T and then Best Buy. I stayed at Best Buy for 5 years and moved up to assistant manager of a small wireless store in the mall (I was previously a supervisor in a regular store) through the years, retail has just consistently drained me. I’m a musician and have always been very creative when it came to writing music. I always wanted to either be in a band and just tour all over, or work somewhere in the media. Well, I got in a band. One day, I decided to call my local radio station and ask if my band could come in and do an interview on air lol I mean, why not? Well holy shit the guy actually told me he would do it. So we did this really funny interview on air promoting a show coming up and even had a song played. The host of the radio show and I kept in touch. Come to find out, we had a whole lot in common. Networking, networking, networking.So eventually, he knew how much I loved music and media. Couple years later, the band broke up and I decided not to give it up and do my own solo stuff. Well sh!t, long story short I had my music regularly played on that same radio station on a weekend night show, did an interview with a station based out of Florida (I live in Virginia) had articles written up about my music, so an underground musician making and producing his own music in his apartment, things blew up way more than I thought. Let word, “producing”.My buddy from the radio station ended up getting fired (he was getting sick of the corporate attitude his bosses had and uh, had an episode) he took a job at a different broadcast station in the area and he was given his own morning show on a classic rock station. People in the area love this guy, so they followed him wherever he went. Bam, the show is a hit. Well one day we are talking (my solo stuff has kind of slowed down at this point, I started recording just for the fun of it) he asked what I had been doing lately and I had just finished recording a cover of Come Together from The Beatles, but it was like a way heavier version lol. I sent it over to him, and he loved it. Apparently, he didn’t know I produced my own stuff too. So he told me tomorrow morning, meet him at the studio at 4am and that we’re about to have some fun. Say whaaaaat.So for a few months, I produced different plugs for his show and occasionally would be on air with him taking calls for listeners whenever there was a fun, debatable topic (like where’s the weirdest place you ever threw up.. yeah lol) it was so much fun.. but then he got offered to move to Seattle and work on The Delilah Show.. womp.This whole time I was an assistant manager at Best Buy lol as much fun I was having, i was EXHAUSTED. Until I another guy from the old station my band interviewed at contacted me, “hey, I heard you’re in sales and have been wanting to work in the media?” The following month, I quit my job and started working for iHeartMedia.“Holy sh!t, my dream just came true! This is amazing! I have the job I’ve always wanted!”***3 months later***“Oh my god, I hate this job and my entire life.”The job I thought I always wanted turned out to be the job I hated more than any other job I ever had. Guess what happened? I lost my job, during the same time I was trying to plan my wedding, during the same time I was diagnosed with bipolar II and taking different meds every two weeks. I wanted to die. I wanted to die so bad, that I ended up staying in a mental hospital for 5 days after coming close to attempting suicide until I talked to my wife.I ended up back at Best Buy, but not a manager. I was a part time sales associate because they had no other available positions. My pay had almost been cut in half. I loved Best Buy, but I ended up hating it while I was there because management changed and they knew my experience, so they would take advantage of me to do work that I wasn’t getting paid to do. I felt like the biggest waste of life. I truly, 100% hated myself.Then one day, my old boss from Sprint calls me, who I haven’t talked to in years. “Hey man, I hope things are going well. I’m working for a new company and one of our partners are hiring for a position that I thought you’d really fit into.” Well okay, that sounded cool. I tightened my resume up and sent it to the email address he gave me. The next day I had an interview over the phone. The next week I had an interview over Skype, a few days later, one more phone interview that lead to an offer. Today, I’m working the most unexpected job I never thought I’d be able to have. I’m a territory manager for a company called Mosaic, who has a contract with a cell phone brand called tracfone, who’s accounts I manage are all in Wal-Marts. Talk about a vicious circle. I manage 54 stores across Virginia, drive around all day, visit stores for about an hour each and be on my way. They pay for my gas, they pay for my food if I’m staying out of town and they pay for my hotel. Once every month, I get to stay at VA Beach for 3 days in an oceanfront hotel. And financially, I’m making double the amount I made at iHeart. The best job I could ever ask for at this time in my life was the last thing I ever expected.This is in NO one way me trying to brag about anything. The only reason I’m telling you this and so much in detail is because I believe this can happen to anyone and everyone. Things connect together in the most strangest ways, we just have to keep our eyes and ears open so we don’t miss it. StrawberryBlonde (if that is your real name ;) ) you can be anything you want, and if not, you’re going to become the best version of yourself that you never even knew was possible. Trust me, it’ll will fall into place. Just know there will always be a struggle. I know this job I have now wont last forever. I also know eventually, I will struggle again. But I will survive, and just like I thought the band was my dream, and then working on radio as my dream, and then iHeartMedia was my dream... at some point, you realize it’s not worth wanting the “dream” when you’re always going to wake up eventually. Appreciate today, have faith in tomorrow. Alright, that’s all I got lol   [info] None [info] 1523399819
OldSpentQueen [info] Man, I can relate to just about everything here! I was diagnosed with bipolar II at 16, and am just starting to get it under control in my 30's. A few things: GET MEDICATED! If you don't have insurance, look into applying for SSI or SSDI. This will automatically enroll you in medicare. If you are medicated, it's time to talk to your pdoc and switch things up. I've been on more meds than I can even remember, but all that trial and error was worth it once I found Lamictal. It's night and day! The suicidal ideation and crazy lows are all but gone, which is something I NEVER thought would happen. This is what I imagine "normal"(Sorry, only word I could think of) people feel day to day. This should be priority before going back to school or finding work, I can tell you from experience.  Don't feel guilty about being supported by your family. I had very similar feelings for a long time. I have an amazing support system, and I felt like I had every advantage and just squandered it. This is toxic thinking. I obviously don't know your whole situation, but I'll assume since your family supports you financially that they love you and want to do what they can to help. If this is the case, feel blessed.  Feeling like you're a loser going nowhere sucks, but I'm pretty confident that's not the case for you. Try to focus on improving yourself all around. Finding the right medication is a big part of that, things like developing daily routines and eating better honestly help quite a bit. This can be frustrating in the beginning because it honestly doesn't feel like you're really doing anything constructive, but the baby steps add up and you'll ultimately feel a bit better about yourself and gain confidence.  I'm sorry for rambling, I'm a tad manic tbh. The last thing I want to bring up is friends. Once things start clicking and you're feeling a bit more stable this won't be a problem, I promise. Don't feel bad about having few friends in the meantime though. Late 20's and early 30's isn't like high school or college. I'm lucky if I see my best friend once a year, and most of the people I associate with are work colleagues. It's just a crappy part of growing up  Aaaaanyway, really sorry for the wall of text. Like I said, I'm a bit manic. There's tons more I'd like to talk about, but I'll cut myself off here. Please feel free to pm me if you need to talk, I've been where you are and it's horrible, but things will get better. Fair fortune [info] None [info] 1527898749
Chanchan012 [info] Weight loss and meds? Hey everyone. I was diagnosed with bipolar in October/November 2015 and at the time I weighed 57kg/125lbs. Rather quickly after being medicated with Lamictal (which I was assured wouldn't cause weight gain) I gained about 20kg. I was taking urbanol as well.I've since come off urbanol and now take depramil instead.I've tried to lose weight so many different ways. I gym regularly, I try eat healthy, I drink a lot of water... How can I go forward? I'm fat and sad. [info] None [info] 1529918523
GypsyRose_83 [info] I get it...I used drugs for years to feel normal because my altered state of mind felt right. My sober me was not who I thought I wanted  or needed to be. But I got older and my actions from doing drugs came with heavy consequences and I was hospitalized after trying to commit suicide from being depressed because I just did not understand why everyone and everything was against how I wanted to live.  Long story short I was diagnosed with bipolar while in the hospital. Learning about this illness and being medicated over the years has put sooo much into perspective of why I did the things I did and why they felt right and justified. I’m not saying I’m cured by any means but now it’s been almost 10 years since then and moved away from my home town and I now live a life I never thought I could.  A sober life.  I urge you to seek help for your addiction.  Good luck my friend [info]  [info] 1544002312
seeking_freedom [info] I am writing this post based on my own experience and acknowledging that everyone's mind and situation are different. Hopefully some of this turns out to be helpful for you, but always defer to your doctor. I was diagnosed with bipolar type II 6 years ago, and your post resonates strongly with me. Moving out of my parents' was the best decision I could've made for my mental health, because it removed so many triggers and negative experiences from my day-to-day life. Believe me, I know it's hard -- but it does get better. It doesn't ever go away completely, but you get better at knowing yourself and managing your symptoms so they don't spiral out of control (or at least, you know when to call for help). I've learned to recognize and validate my feelings, even when my logical mind knows they're irrational. For example, I might wake up feeling utterly depressed for no reason. So rather than beat myself up for not being happy, I'll think to myself, "All right, I am feeling depressed this morning. That is ok. Today is a down day. I'll make myself a hot tea to take to work, and maybe later have a relaxing bubble bath. Everything is ok. I have shelter, I have food and creature comforts, I have people who love me. Even though I feel very down, things are going to feel better eventually." Obviously when the depressed mood has a specific, stressful trigger, things work a little bit differently. And sometimes I've had to call into work "sick" to get a recovery day (use sparingly). But for most days when your mood just decides to act up on its own, positive self-talk and little self-indulgences do uplift :) My best advice? If you have a medication prescription, take it as consistently as possible, even if you feel like you don't need it. Try to eat a steady diet of good nutritional foods, and try to stick to a sleep schedule. Food &amp; sleep make a huge difference for me, but being bipolar means it's hard to control impulses and overcome insomnia. Some days will be easier than others, for sure, but striving for a schedule definitely helps. I wish you the absolute best on your recovery journey.  [info] None [info] 1425505693
SilverSword7 [info] I appreciate the prayers and I do believe God loves me. I suppose however that I also think he gives us challenges in life. Part of me very much believes that this is simply a challenge for my life that he has put in my life. I used to believe that I would be happy if I just mastered myself, that if I just had total control over what I did with my life, if I was hard working to a certain point and if I arranged my life to where I was progressing in all the areas of my life, then I would feel peace. But then I was diagnosed with bipolar and then it was like I could almost hear God saying that my beliefs wouldn’t be realized and I wouldn’t be able to have that kind of peace and that it’s simply apart of the cross to bear through life.

ligadeleyends [info] Lil' Mama so dope I fucked around and got addicted Hey so I saw your post about addictions and wanted to talk with you about being bipolar and being addicted to something. A little background about myself. My name is Michael. I am 28 years old and live in the USA. I have been diagnosed with bipolar for 8 months but lord knows ive been bipolar all my life. I have 2 addictions, they are video games and weed. They basically run my life. I have friends who do them but they aren't addicted, they're functioning adults even though they smoke and/or play video games. Some thoughts on this; What is the cycle of addiction and bipolar? Maybe it is that at some point in the cycle, you need help mentally, like anything to feel good because you're in the depressive part of the cycle, or maybe you're in the manic part and HAVE to do something "cool" and "fun" so either way you go to your addiction, your life force, what keeps you here. Then because of this and through this, you're addicted to something.&amp;#x200B;But like, so what? I'm just speaking out loud here, but I love my addictions. I don't want to quit them. I play league of legends, and smoke weed. I love doing it. Am I really happy while doing those two things? Deep down, I know the answer is "not really", BUT AT LEAST I am not drowning in despair. My addictions keep me from going over the deep end, they are what make life "okay". Isn't it acceptable to use these things for my own benefit?&amp;#x200B;However this brings me to my next thought. Do I over-use them? I play league for like, 7 hours a day on average. I smoke CONSTANTLY. I'm high right now as I type this. At work. Was late because I woke and toked, played League for 2 hours, THEN came to work. My boss isn't happy with me. My addictions are a hindrance to my life, as you can see.&amp;#x200B;Are video games and weed ruining my life? Probably. Will I regret it someday? I already do, and will probably continue to further regret they're use as I get older. But they're also saving me.&amp;#x200B;Therefore I, like any other addict out there, don't know what to do.&amp;#x200B;If I decide to quit.1. Will life be bleak and dull or will it refill itself with other things?2. Will I just find a new addiction? I heard it's impossible to "quit" addictions, one has to REPLACE addictions.3. When I am drowning in bipolar, which is often, what do I use as a crutch instead of my addictions. I use video and games to ESCAPE! I escape from reality all the time because it is so vicious for me because I am bipolar. I see the world as hell, everything is horrible because I am depressed. When I am in this place, and I need to run away and can't use my addictions anymore, what do I do? That is the time when I would relapse, not knowing what to do but needing something to help me escape my problems.&amp;#x200B;4. What about quitting addictions would improve my life?I look at this as a cost/benefit ratio question. Simply put; is the cost of quitting my addictions worth all the work it will be? I will be missing out 100% on the things that I "love", being League of Legends and marijuana, and I will have to put in a lot of work finding new things to spend my life doing. And I probably wont find them as much fun as my addictions! Fuck that man, why the hell should I quit? What makes it worth it? I can't find an answer man.&amp;#x200B;EDIT: Am I just considering improving my life is SUCH a BIG fashion (cause quitting my addictions WOULD be a huge change in my life) only because i'm swinging in the cycle? I mean, I really am addicted but is this will to quit just a temporary thing? [info] None [info] 1546445683
drinkupbabydoll [info] Should I reach out to my sister I haven’t seen or heard from in years who has a dx of schizophrenia or should I just leave her be? I haven’t seen or heard from one of my sisters in years. We were never close and she is 20 years older than I am. When I was younger, she always made me uncomfortable. I didn’t know why and I still can’t seem to eloquently explain my feelings towards her back then. I sort of feel guilty because I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about a year and a half ago after a severe manic episode with psychotic features. The last time I heard about my sister from other family members, I heard she wasn’t taking her meds for her paranoid schizophrenia symptoms and she was living out of her car. I guess I just genuinely hope she is ok but I don’t know the severity of her disorder and I don’t want to bother her if she just wants to be left alone. [info] None [info] 1570396506

2Turnt4MySwag [info] No, I was a straight A, dean's list student and did really well my freshman year of college. Sophomore year it started to go downhill, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, and was abusing drugs because nothing seemed to help. I had to get a medical withdrawal from an entire semester. I took off last spring to work and let my brain heal from the drugs (even ones I was prescribed, they screwed me up). I started using kratom as a replacement for stimulants and used lions mane and fish oil to help speed up the recovery process. I would say it worked well enough that over 6 months I finally feel somewhat normal again. The biggest improvement is my memory, which the difference is night and day. It was really bad.

Celarcade [info] Is there a reason that you can't tell your parents you've gone to a psychiatrist? Are you safe if they find out you've gone to see one? You're right: It would probably be relatively expensive to see one out-of-pocket if you don't make a lot of money. For my family, even $200 is a lot of money, so I totally understand. If it's just a matter of having an argument over it with your parents, I would put on my brave face and do it. You don't owe them an explanation. Just use the insurance and get the prescription you need. I also think you should use all the resources available to you, including those available at school. It probably won't replace the help of a real psychiatrist, but in conjunction with his/her help, it could make a difference. Even just having someone to talk to can make a huge difference. I've been under the care of a psychiatrist for a few years. I'm diagnosed with bipolar type II with psychotic features. Before that diagnosis, I was also diagnosed with PTSD.

colby-klaus [info] Three things:1. Voter fraud has never been widespread. It just hasn't. In the last decade, the total number of fraudulent votes that Voter ID laws would have stopped is in the hundreds. *Hundreds.* Out of, what, nearly a billion total votes? 99% of the votes people point at as fraud aren't things that Voter ID would stop, and aren't actually fraud. Someone who is registered in two places, because they forgot to void it after they moved? Not fraud, and it turns out people don't vote twice even when registered in two places. A felon who isn't legally allowed to vote, but does anyway? Incredibly rare, and those votes get caught. So, Voter ID proposals, as they are, have been a solution looking for a problem. 2. We both agree that access to the required ID is inconsistent and leaves some people without the reasonable ability to exercise their fundamental right to vote, correct? **Voter ID doesn't fix this.** IF a Voter ID law was introduced in my state and would introduce mechanisms to ensure that people like my grandpa could have the means to meet the requirements? I'd support it! But I haven't seen one yet. Know why? Because that would need tax dollars, and (in my state at least) the sheer mention of spending is akin to being told your favorite sports team is garbage. Literally, in Nebraska, our republican governor has rejected proposals to lower property taxes **for the very people who elected him** because the only solutions involve increasing or introducing a different tax that spreads the burden more fairly. Why? Well, he signed a pledge to not raise or create taxes. 3. Undermining democracy. Have you heard of CrossCheck? It's a program that was introduced in Kansas about a decade ago, and has spread into other states. It purges people from voter rolls if they have similar names. These people aren't notified, they may have no idea they've been purged until the day they go to vote. Is your name John Smith? There's probably 100 of you in Kansas. All of you just got purged, without knowing. Is your last name Gonzalez? Well, there's 15 other people with that last name, and even though your first or middle names may be different, it still seems suspicious. So, you're purged. Now, with Voter ID, you've been purged, you don't know you've been purged, and you show up to the voting booth to be told you're not registered and must present your birth certificate, your photo ID, and some other document. Do you have your birth certificate at home? I know I don't. The one time I needed it for anything, I had to wait a week to get a copy because I lived in a different state than where I was born. And I've moved so many times since then, I couldn't tell you where it ended up. So you just got purged, you can't provide every item needed to cast a ballot, and **if you're absolutely lucky** you might get to cast a provisional ballot that will never get counted. Does that not sound like it undermines democracy more than the possibility of 1 person in your entire state committing voter fraud? Because, remember, the only known cases so far of actual voter fraud **nationwide** in the presidential election totaled 5 out of 120,000,000 votes. Yes, there have been cases in the past where local elections have been rigged, but again, **Voter. ID. Wouldn't. Stop. That.** Ballot stuffing, intimidation, paying for votes, that's stuff that Voter ID will never fix, and has nothing to do with individual voters like the people in this article. The thing is, I can't point to anyone in my group of friends and acquaintances who is opposed to the idea of an ID for voting. What they're opposed to is the **implementation** presented by proponents of Voter ID laws. And the reasons I've listed are exactly why. But our concerns are dismissed if they're ever even heard. We're told we want to bus people from Mexico to make Trump lose California, that we want to drive people from poll to poll to poll to poll and fill out a dozen ballots, that we don't care about democracy and hate America. All we really want is for people to look at the long-standing facts and guarantee that any law they introduce will address these concerns. That's it! That's all we want! And thank you for your kind words. We have our struggles, because I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, ADHD, and PTSD, our farm doesn't make enough for me to afford insurance, meds, and therapy, and after four years of living with him he still has trouble understanding what any of it means. But we've built something that's working, and I know I've improved his life by looking out for him.  [info] None [info] 1494724941

mattsulli [info] I had a fiancée before I married my wife. During an alcohol withdrawal stint at a hospital I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I never sought treatment and let my behavior get worse and worse until she finally left me. I beat myself up over and over again, cutting, lashing out, drinking, spending days crying and other days going out trying to get myself killed on the streets of Baltimore. When I spent a couple of years dealing with this and getting a little better, I met my now wife. I was honest with her about my disorder but lied pretty heavily about my past. When I eventually got on some insurance plan I started seeking treatment. I became more honest with my wife about my past because I began to understand that as long as I got better I could unload the truth and she would understand. She has. Past that, getting on meds and understanding the nature of my old behaviors has allowed me to come to terms with losing a woman whom I loved dearly. I don’t know why I’m typing all of this out.

BornToClaire-ify [info] Years ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was put on a medication that actually slowed my heart down because that's how my panic attacks/episodes would start -- increased heart rate, then shortness of breath, a feeling of the world caving in... I'm sure you know the feeling.I hated the medication. It was great if I were to have an episode, but on normal days, I felt like a zombie in slow motion.About 6 years ago I weened myself off the medication by talking myself down when I felt an episode coming on. I'd like to share what I do now with you, in an effort to help.*Close your eyes.  Breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth.  When you breathe in, do it for 2 beats: I-N.  When you breathe out, do it for 3 beats: O-U-T.  Count your breaths.  For each one, picture the number in front of you, large and 3-Dimensional.  Now as you inhale, picture the number filling up with water.  As you exhale, picture the water draining.  Do this for as many breaths as it takes to slow your heart, and feel like your feet are on the ground again.  The sweet spot for me is about 15.*It doesn't take long. You can do it in a bathroom stall at work, and no one will be the wiser. It's *really* helped me, and I hope it will help you, too.Please reach out if you ever need help.

anarchyarcanine [info] I wish you both the best. I was diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD in 2010, when I was only turning 18, and then a few years later was told I had Gen. Anxiety Disorder. It's scary at first. It's gonna feel freaky, but the best thing to do is to keep it from defining you. I've had the hardest time with that, because it's been a rollercoaster for me with tons of meds, and dealing with new situations and recurring/new symptoms, but you have to remember that you are still a person underneath of it, one that is valuable and precious and wonderful.You don't have to tell a single soul. For me, the people I trust know, and I only tell other people if it might be beneficial for them to know in order to understand me better. The sucky part for me is having to explain to people that PTSD is not just a soldier's disease, but having to only vaguely explain why I have it because I don't feel okay with telling people my story.You two are gonna be just fine. Get treatment that you are comfortable with, and think will be best, if you choose to treat it. But above all, remember to take care of yourself first and foremost. Do what makes you feel happy and safe, and check in with yourself now and again to make sure that you're still doing that. If not, figure out how you can change it. It's sometimes a continuing self-discovery.  [info] None [info] 1435480680
salty-MA-student [info] I have been seeing a black shadow since Fall 2013. It keeps beckoning for me to come towards it. In fall of 2013, I started working in a seasonal haunted house that is located inside an old penitentiary. After working there for about 2 weeks, I noticed a black figure about 5'5 in the corner of my eye while I was doing my makeup for the haunt. It made a beckoning motion to me. When I fully turned to see what it wanted, it vanished. I didn't see it again until a month later when I was at my grandparents house. I was standing in their hallway, and again- it looked like it was making the motion to come towards it. I turned to the figure and it lingered for an extra second before vanishing into the utility closet. No one but myself was in the house at the moment. A few days later, I was at the townhouse I lived in during college. Both my roommate and I were upstairs. I went to walk downstairs, and it was waiting by the foot of the steps, almost crouched. When I fully acknowledged its presence, it slid into my air vent. With three different sightings, I was becoming increasingly worried something intelligent followed me home from the penitentiary. The shadow is intelligent. It isn't popping up in the dark or in corners, it appears in broad daylight. It is making motions to come towards it. Since the initial sighting in 2013, the shadow appears at least once a month. Sometimes it appears before significant events- it doesn't matter if they are happy or sad. A miscarriage, a friend coming to visit, before a big breakup- it appears. Most of the time, it appears peripherally. It will stay there and make beckoning motions. When I fully acknowledge it, it'll linger for maybe 5 seconds, then slide up or down the wall into a vent or closet. I have never gone to it. The first time I saw it in my full field of vision was in June of this year. I went on vacation with my family at a beach. As I was walking into the elevator, it appeared just slightly to my left, and shook its head. I didn't go on the elevator. Later that day, we discovered that the specific elevator I was going to go into stopped working for a few hours. That's the first time its truly warned me about a bad event. The funny thing is that I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I have been on anti-psychotic medications for 2 years now. Throughout my life, I've had hallucinations that consist of bright light with shapeless visual disturbances, never a full human-shaped object. I was hoping after starting medications I would cease seeing it, but nope. I just want to know what it is, what it wants. I'm pretty positive it's an attachment from when I worked in the penitentiary. It's definitely startled me, but I don't feel scared or a sense of dread when I see it. I want to know why it wants me to come towards it. [info] None [info] 1565559706
fujifilm96 [info] I'm not going out much, and I do have some people that I talk to in uni. I don't hang out with them, though. They're more of acquaintances, and I don't feel confident enough to hang out with them (idk if that makes sense). I'm tired all through the day, but I can get my homework done. Uni is really manageable, actually.I didn't know if it was my depressive moods coming back. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a couple of years back, but the past 6 months have been great and honestly I thought I was cured from it. I thought that it was a matter of motivation, or rather the lack of it. I've given it a bit more thought and from reading everyone's comments here and I think I'll agree that maybe my mood is worsening. I'll look into it and speak to my psych when I next meet her I guess. Thank you for your help anyway :) [info] None [info] 1556610383
Bleeglebeagle [info] Is mania induced curiosity a thing? I'm on mobile, so please excuse any weird formatting. Okay, so I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 when I was 19. I am now 24 , and I've noticed after taking Prozac for a while that my mania has been getting slightly worse. I've also noticed that during mania, I have insane amounts of curiosity. Meaning, I constantly think about random things that have no effect on my life whatsoever. I spend a lot of time googling and researching random topics that I would otherwise not necessarily care about. During my depressive stages, I don't care enough to look into anything unless I absolutely have to. So, I'm wondering if mania induced curiosity is a legitimate thing? Am I the only one who experiences this? I've experienced other common things during mania, such as hyper focusing and having an insane amount of energy, but lately I've noticed that my curiosity has almost been uncontrollable: it disrupts my daily life. Please tell me that I'm not the only one. [info] None [info] 1539815154

For a career that needs a decent level of intelligence, and also requires a LOT of work by computer these days, there were some seriously stupid women working there.

Brocolli12345678 [info] I started taking Lamictal for my second time a couple months ago. I don't remember my experiences the first time but this time it's definitely positive. A day or two after I started the 25mg I went from 12 hours of sleep a night down to 8-10. That was huge for me. I didn't start feeling better til I got to the 150 dose, which I started I think two or three weeks ago and I started feeling better soon after. Lamictal is prescribed often for bipolar, and I've heard more good than bad about it, especially compared to other drugs.About antidepressants- after I was diagnosed with bipolar I was told I can't be on antidepressants anymore because it might make me manic. I have type 1 maybe that's why, idk. Ask your psychiatrist why some people with bipolar can't take antidepressants, maybe he/she'll know. [info] Schizoaffective [info] 1532107616
cutie_cthulhu [info] Mania?? I was diagnosed with bipolar over 4 years ago. We have a difficult history.  Last September I started a med (latuda 80mg) that actually works! I’m actually stable for the first time since I was diagnosed. I was super anxious last night and realized something. I quit my job this month. I’m impulsively spending and it’s causing issues in my relationship. I’m not sleeping much. I cut all my hair off yesterday after pulling an all nighter and I’ve been very anxious.

MoxSkeleton41 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (currently super well treated; no one figures it out until I tell them), and a few years into my treatment I almost died from a painful and inexplicable illness. Later on, doctors found out I have Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, which means I can't take most of the medications available for bipolar people. It also has an 80% mortality rate. I stopped taking several of my medications cold turkey, went through pharmaceutical withdrawal, and did inpatient electro-convulsive therapy.Now I'm well medicated (without any neuroleptics), I just transitioned off of benzodiazepines (the hidden epidemic), and I'm more stable than ever before! But I'm super lucky I didn't die. So thankful for modern medicine.  [info] None [info] 1550754110

milkiebuttle [info] This year, I will stop letting my mother control who I want to be and how I feel about myself. Let me preface this story by starting from the beginning. When I was 5, my older brother died in a car crash. This tore my family apart as you can imagine. Growing up was tough for me. My mum was forever on edge and anything will trigger her. It was especially hard when my dad worked nights and eventually moved overseas for work. In the worst of times she stripped me naked and threw me out of the house or she told me she would rather I have died rather than my brother. I was no more than 10 on both occasions.Having grown up in this environment, I was depressed and anxious from a young age. When I was 18, I was diagnosed with bipolar and an eating disorder. My mum ridiculed me and said that I was weak.I always tried to give my mum the benefit of the doubt. She lost her son; she herself was hurting that’s why she hurt me. We’re Asian so it’s culturally okay for her to call me fat and make fun of me although I know I am NOT fat and she knew about my E.D. We have good times together too so that makes up for the bad times.Eight years ago, I met the love of my life who helped me through dark times. He helped heal me. Last year, he asked me to marry him and I said yes.It’s been a few months now and my mum has not expressed any happiness for me. She is acting as if my engagement is something to be ashamed of. She’s telling me not to wear the ring or post on social media. She has told me multiple times that my fiancé is not good enough for me and that she hated him. This really hurts me because apart from my dad, he is the person I love the most. He is the one who protected me and it makes me sad that I can’t even protect him from her.But I am so tired of her behaviour. I have lived like this for 20 years. I have let her choose how I should live my life. Even subconsciously I do everything I know will keep her happy or keep my safe from her.But from 2019, I am making a pact with myself to stand up for myself. I will no longer let her change the way I feel about myself or let her tear down everything I have built for myself. I will no longer put up with it and say that it’s ok. She may be hurting but I am too. I have not had a suicidal thought in a long time but today I felt that creeping back again and that is not ok. I swear to myself that I will not let her hurt me anymore. [info] None [info] 1546519992

gdet5 [info] AITA for shouting back? My mum and I get into a lot of arguments, we don't have a very healthy relationship. A lot of the time she'll turn things back on her and say shit like "you never think about my feelings" and "you never worry about me". I can't really control my emotions, which my mum should know especially since my happiness fluctuates a lot and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. A lot of things I say are in the heat of the moment and I always apologise afterwards if I say something hurtful, which I usually don't because I'm pretty scared of her ngl. The thing is, she never apologises for saying hurtful things to me but I always apologise for doing things wrong. She's said stuff like "you're an embarrassment to this family" and "I'm going to send you somewhere else, I can't deal with this anymore" and yet she never thinks about how her words affect me. The meanest thing I've said to her is "I hate you", which I did end up apologising about. Every time we argue and she shouts at me, I shout back and stand up for myself, to which she responds with "don't you dare raise your voice at me" most of the time. Am I an asshole for shouting at her? I understand that she does a lot for me (feeds me, makes sure I have clean water everyday, etc) but I really just can't control my anger and I'm not just going to stand there and let her shout and swear at me. I get angry about a lot of things and tbh that runs in the family, my whole family gets angry over the smallest of things yet they're all so blind to it. I'm grateful that she doesn't hurt me anymore but I'd really like if she was just calmer about things and actually took into account my feelings [info] Partassipant [1] [info] 1560880881

ishitart [info] Seeing my older brother reminded me of WHY I take my meds (I just need to vent a little) So I (23F) recently went on vacation down to southern state to visit my Dad and family. It had been about 2 years since I last saw anyone and in the 48 hours I spent with my 43 yr old brother confirmed my need to take medication. Both my brother and I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 and all I can say is that.. I don’t know? He was dealt shitty cards? Or maybe has given up on himself since his diagnosis about 8-10 years ago. He’s completely let himself go, to the point where he came to FAMILY DINNER WITH DRIED FOOD ON HIS JACKET AND CLOTHES UNDERNEATH IT! He was more concerned if I would smoke him out than hanging out with the family or even interacting in general and him and my dad can hardly interact with each other without one of them getting pissed off. He can’t hold down a job (which I understand, it’s hard I really do) lives with his mother and pays no bills. (Can’t keep track of his money obviously) I’m not sure if he takes medication even though he tells everyone he does. Which I honestly feel like is a lie he doesn’t show any improvement in the years he’s been diagnosed. I’m just so sad for him and I don’t know what to do or even if there is anything I CAN do. He used to call me and the conversations would always wander towards bipolar and weed. I felt like he was beginning to use me as his therapist and as a fellow BP person I just couldn’t mentally handle it so I began to not answer as much (I know that’s terrible I’m sorry but I just couldn’t deal). I’m not sure where this post is going other than.. can I do anything? Dad can only do so much without getting REALLY pissed off at him and his mom (half-siblings) doesn’t ever have anything good to say about him. I worry that when his mom gets older I’ll be stuck taking care of him which really isn’t an option for me mentally, unless he gets his shit together even a little. Edit: I do want to add my brother is smart and he used to be VERY motivated and I know he can get that back. He had the ability to get a degree, has moved out before and has been successful. I just don’t want him to give up on himself anymore. [info] None [info] 1547757536

Domidoggy8 [info] One of the issues is that I don't have direct contact with the psychiatrist. I was referred to a psychiatrist back in December but am being told that an appointment is still 4-6 months out. My social worker at my primary care office consults with this psychiatrist once a week. My only other option is to pay out of pocket to go to a private psychiatric facility. It isn't a possibility with my income and I've already paid about $200 in co-pays since the beginning of this month when I was diagnosed with bipolar. I thought I was a bit paranoid when I got an appointment last Thursday for a rash that was only on my legs. The psychiatrist saw photos and said it wasn't Lamictal related. I then proceeded to buy new body wash, detergent, and laundry softener because maybe I was reacting to something else. After it spread Sunday night, I saw my primary care physician yesterday and stopped medication. I feel let down because I thought I was doing well on the medication so far. None of the other Drs. have been able to get in touch with the psychiatrist for medication recommendations since my appointment for the rash yesterday. [info] None [info] 1553712152
Waffles0701 [info] I am bipolar and I’m a hypocrite. So I’m 28 and I was diagnosed with bipolar II ten years ago, you’d think I’d be used to it by now, right?Well after three years of medication, coming off those meds (safely), a few psychologists and training my mind to become hyper aware of my behaviour over the next seven years, I thought I had this shit pegged.I wanted to be that open book, the one you says loud and proud that “this is me! I am a fully functioning adult, I have bipolar and I’m not ashamed to admit it!” For a while, I was.  I was comfortable because I hadn’t relapsed in two years. I was a huge advocate for seeking help for mental health and well being - the self-proclaimed poster child. Well, for those of you playing at home, complacency isn’t the best thing for people like me.I started a new position in a company I have been at for a few years. It was a new team, great boss (who knows about the polar bear in the closet) and a role I knew absolutely nothing about, but that I could sink my teeth into. I was working with people from all around the company who I had worked with before. I thought sure, this is going to be easy! People respect me enough to  be patient with me while I learn.  Idiot.As the year went by, more and more people became dismissive and impatient with me. Mistakes I made were so small and trivial, but the more I made, the bigger the deal got in my head. The relationships I thought that I had with these coworkers had completely changed dynamic. In a classic boiling frog situation, I ended up being more hard on myself than anyone else. I refused to take days off owed to me, telling myself that I didn’t deserve them, that I had to do better. I stopped eating and was in a constant state of nausea.My boss sat me down and told me everything that I needed to hear. He laid out my biggest insecurities on the table, things that are never said out loud in fear that they may be true. That I was rational, that I didn’t need medication, that I was okay. Ever feel like you’ve been stripped completely bare and are vulnerable to the entire world? Same. And what came out of that vulnerability was shame. I was so ashamed for letting myself get this way. For getting to the point where someone felt the need to sit me down and tell me these things. I’m supposed to be the role model for sufferers, and I didn’t even know that I had relapsed and was in a manic state for six weeks. In my complacency I had absolutely no awareness that it was happening. How god damn embarrassing.After that talk, I completely closed up. I shut down, because shutting down was better than feeling vulnerable. The heart that was on my sleeve was tucked deep down inside, the fear of being exposed again all too real.  I eventually picked up the phone and called a psychologist, disgusted with myself that I had to do this. Me? Im the person who had won that battle, I shouldn’t have to do this. I had balance for so. Damn. Long.  And now it’s gone.   I’m now the person that advocates so strongly for seeking help for your mental health, but has such a strong sense of self loathing when she has to do it herself. Hypocrite. [info] None [info] 1549191213

dialogics [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2 and have experienced the shifts in self-confidence like what you describe. It's played out mostly in my career; I can look over my career history and see the peaks and valleys of bipolar influences - professional positions in my field when elevated and hiding-behind-the-scenes labouring jobs when low. It's good to start exploring things now, at a younger age, so that if you do fall somewhere on the bipolar spectrum you can address it and potentially ward off or at least minimize the periods of low self-confidence and other effects. I'm 46 and am just now starting to get things under control with medication. Good luck to you and if you can, I'd recommend seeing a psychiatrist for a diagnosis and if warranted, treatment.

Waitatick [info] Why can't you just say to them "I no longer can accomodate you in my life or my child's life." and leave it at that? Your father and step mother are obviously toxic, you know it, do something about it instead of whining about it. I had to do this after I was diagnosed with bipolar and realized I couldn't emotionally handle a certain family member, even though she's very close to my mother, etc.You're the only one whose job it is to protect your baby. Even if the threat comes from within your family.  Simply mail your dad a handwritten letter, laying everything out, then don't answer calls, etc. from him. Done. And stick to it.

lxlCaraBoolxl [info] For as long as I can remember I have had this habit of picking my nails. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I am on medication for it. I have a job where I count cash to hundreds of people a day and I am so embarrassed at how my fingers have gotten. I wore acrylics from July of last year til October. Took them off for a month and had a relapse into picking. Put acrylics back on November til March and now I am back to doing it. This time it’s progressively worse. Before I was maybe a medium picker but now it’s gotten severe for myself personally. I have gotten to the point that I can ignore the severe pain while bleeding. Everything hurts. Showers hurt, washing hurts, just moving them hurts. On top of my hands are swelling this time from the picking. The one finger I don’t pick doesn’t swell. I do like this Rip-Fix lotion I get on amazon and I prefer not to do acrylics again because working out and lifting weights is hard but ultimately I might have to. Any tips or tricks?

GoodAtExplaining [info] um... You know, I'd like to have an answer that doesn't make me sound bitter, burnt-out or tired, but...I think the fairest way to say it is that I found myself becoming that bitter, burnt-out teacher, and I didn't want to be that. I wanted kids to love the language and be fascinated by it, not subject to the bitter disillusionment of someone who no longer loved what he did.Basically, if you're going to be a teacher, you gotta love what you do - The kids can see it. If you don't love what you do you're not going to make them love it, and we all remember what it was like to learn from a teacher who'd lost their passion. I didn't want to do that, so I left while I still could.About eight years later I was diagnosed with bipolar, so that might've been a reason as well, in fairness. [info] TOR - NHL [info] 1463618811
codemule [info] Can long-term intensive meditation "cure" bipolar? So, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 in 2003. I've had much success managing my symptoms with medication so far. I began meditating in 2015 and logged over 1500 hours of time on the cushion since then. My ability to stay centered and calm is worlds better than before I began meditating. I had been content with managing symptoms, but I'm beginning to consider the possibility of a cure.I've read anecdotal stories of long term insensitive meditators (like 2+ hours a day for 10+ years) who overcame mental illness.Unfortunately I'm having trouble finding more scientific evidence of this. I would imagine that's because there probably haven't been many (or any) studies done like that.I'm not going to be stupid and just stop taking my meds, but I the next time i see my psychiatrist i plan on discussing how to make a long term plan to eventually get off my meds. Has anyone tried doing something similar? Is there anything I might want to talk/ask questions about with my psychiatrist besides just a long term goal?Thanks r/bipolar. [info] None [info] 1546903448

lsmels [info] Hi I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2 and GAD. I take seroquel XR and took it all through my pregnancy and currently while BFing. I was on 200mg but dropped it down to 50mg. I'm also prescribed klonopin as needed but I'm much more leery to take this if I know I'll be feeding soon and I only took it 2 or 3 times during pregnancy. My psych is super conscientious about meds and pregnancy and made me nervous about benzos while breastfeeding. My psych, OB and baby's pediatrician all know about the seroquel and didn't have an issue with it, and I didn't notice any withdrawal symptoms in him after birth. I also used to take lamictal and my psych didn't have any issue with that but did tell me to start taking a folic acid supplement along with my prenatal due to he chance of neural tube defects.

TangledUpInAzul [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple years ago. Because of a few factors in my particular case, it was statistically like a doctor telling me, "There's a 90% chance you'll kill yourself before you're 40." In the days that followed the diagnosis, I probably listened to Looking Like You Just Woke Up fifty times. It has, in fact, gotten harder and only slightly easier to hide. It's scary knowing just how steep and potentially short the uphill climb will be for me. That's my lifelong aching.Also, "When I am sad, oh god, I'm sad, but when I'm happy, I am happy," is *painfully* relevant to me. I'm like 95% sure Brian or someone very close to him has bipolar disorder because of how specifically relevant to bipolar disorder many of his lyrics are.  [info] None [info] 1447908719
Bowserette [info] Unfortunate that it’s the same policy as for pilots. I earned my PPL at age 19. Later that year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on medication. I’ll never be able to fly again and that kills me. It was the best experience of my life, and I was looking forward to making it a career. The FAA is slowly starting to accept a couple antidepressants, but certain conditions are permanent disqualification. That also means pilots often self medicate with alcohol to cope. I’d rather have a stable pilot on medication than one who pushes the “8 hours from bottle to throttle” guidelines. [info] None [info] 1558719065
thecalicreole [info] I've messed up... So 3 months ago I was in Los Angeles for about 3 years. Within those 3 years I got depressed and had hypomania. I was doing the usual: unsafe sex with everyone, spending all my money, etc. Turns out I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. I went to therapy, learned coping techniques, and was put on Abilify. Everything was going great even though in the beginning, the meds were making me tired all the time. Then one day I felt different after missing sleep and my diet changes. I was very emotional and existential. My mood went to shit. Impulsively I wanted to go back home to New Orleans so I can be around family. So I quit my job, lucky my boss was very understanding and stated I am welcome back, and moved back home. Now I'm here in the worst state for mental health services and with a family that's not understanding of bipolar disorder. My meds are gone and I feel nothing. I feel like I've made a big mistake and want to go back to my real home in Los Angeles. I have a lil bit of a plan to save money after getting a low paying job and move back in either November or December. I also want to start college when I go back (I'm 20 bi male). But how do I stay on track with no access to meds or support? I still talk to my west coast therapist but it's not enough with my meds. [info] None [info] 1439927939

mre5052 [info] personality disorders and emdr I had my first appointment with an emdr therapist today just for the initial consult. The first actual session is next week and even though I’m nervous, I’m hopeful at he same time. I’m just curious if anyone has heard a similar thing from their therapist or has had this experience themselves—she said that the majority of her patients who had bipolar doisorder or borderline prior to emdr and had successful outcomes from the treatment, no longer had diagnoses of personality disorders. She talked about the similarities of BP/BPD traits and the crossover in diagnoses, which I agree with—the traits definitely overlap. I already had suspicions when I was diagnosed with bipolar a little over 3 years ago but the more research I did the more I thought maybe deep down it’s actually borderline. I guess if you’re trying to heal the diagnosis isn’t important. but point being I told her that once I had a manic episode bipolar was clearly the answer. and she said she’s not convinced I’m bipolar bc those episodes could have been a moment where the “bus was hijacked by 10 year old me” or whatever the metaphor was that I’m clearly too cynical to remember yet lol  I’m still going to try emdr but at the same time I just think it’s an oddly bold statement to say that if this worked I could likely come down off of medication bc I wouldn’t be bipolar anymore...like I kind of get what she’s saying, but also wtf?

LilyChickadee [info] Simple living is embracing the boring and stable I spent my teens and early twenties feeling like I had to do things extreme. Had to travel, hike, live off the grid, consciously living in poverty regardless of my income. Even constantly striving for a “simple life” in unhealthy ways that bordered on obsessionI was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and realized I had to change my life drastically. I resisted and mourned the fact that I couldn’t have the things that I had yearned for.But I’ve come to realized the yearning was simply a way to fill some void I had in my life that I couldn’t accept internally. I find happiness in having a stable job, a home, relationship, dog, children in the future. Building up a happy and stable life that I thought was a cop out in my younger years.There’s nothing wrong with being normal. My childhood was chaotic and I am absolutely content having a simple, normal life filled with family and love. I don’t need to live out of a backpack, live without electricity, a phone, internet. I don’t need to backpack the world or gain “experiences” to give myself self-worth. I find happiness in sitting quietly and watching the world go by. [info] None [info] 1558303595
kybp1 [info] My mom is diagnosed with bipolar type 2; I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 1. I was undecided about for three years. I didn't believe in mania, for one. After two years in denial about my ever-worsening manic episodes, I finally decided that whatever is meant by "bipolar type 1" is similar enough to my experience for me to justify trying BP1 treatments. And, lo and behold, lithium brings me out of mania (and the psychosis of peak mania...). Meanwhile, my sister and brother have no bipolar symptoms or diagnoses....  You may not have "bipolar 2," whatever that is. And, as someone with what I consider to be bipolar 1, even I'm *a little* iffy on what "hypomania" looks like. But -- without seeking to convince you to decide in favor of 1) bipolar two's existence or 2) that you have it -- I do vouch for how useful the "bipolar" diagnosis and treatments can be for providing effective solutions to people's health problems. If you're interested and/or haven't done so already, you might lurk around /r/bipolar/. Posts from people unsure about their symptoms or diagnoses are common and welcome.

entombedgosling [info] can anyone relate to this? This would happen even when I wasn't in episodes.  I am diagnosed with bipolar II.  But some people say it sounds more schizophrenic.  I used to have intense fear of paranormal situations.  I was absolutely afraid of ghosts and of being abducted by aliens.  I could not go outside at night, drive at night, or sleep at night.  As soon as I would walk outside I would see images and imagine things, and as soon as that would happen I would have a feeling of complete horror, like something was standing right behind me, and I would constantly look behind my back.  This might not sound bad, but I literally could not sleep until it was light out for fear of being abducted.  I actually hallucinated once and saw the aliens on my back porch and actually called my parents who were able to talk me down.  I have not had a single one of these thoughts now that I am on Risperdal, so it has been at least 1.5 to 2 years, thank god, because they were really scary.  Can anyone relate?Edit:  I also had an auditory hallucination of someone aggressively whistling to get my attention while I was hunting.  I know it wasn't real but it scared me so much I fired a warning shot and was yelling who is there?  No answer.  I ended up crying and running out of the woods.  It took me 1.5 hours to get out of the woods because I was in the middle of nowhere and I was scared to death and thought I was being followed on the way out.  Not a fun day.

jeanadhoc [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was given Zoloft for an MDD diagnosis. I entered a manic episode almost immediately. This isn't an uncommon reaction to SSRIs, probably due to an already present imbalance of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, and since Zoloft increases serotonin (and in its specific case, dopamine as well), it's not at all uncommon for Zoloft to antagonize the underlying symptoms of bipolar disorder. I'm not sure how Zoloft reacts with atypical antipsychotics like Abilify, since I haven't taken it without the addition of a mood stabilizer. If you haven't been having any adverse reactions to sertraline (such as hallucinations or common manic symptoms), then it's probably alright. I will say that when I was in the hospital right after my first manic episode, the nurse told me that it's a common joke in the industry that if you want to find out if someone's bipolar, give them an SSRI.&amp;#x200B;I didn't have any real adverse reactions with alcohol and Zoloft, but I only really have two or so drinks when I do drink. However it should be noted that the use of alcohol with psychotropic medications is counteractive to the positive effects of medication. The way it was explained to me is that if you drink while you're taking antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, etc. then you might as well not take the meds, because the alcohol will negate any positive effects the meds will try to produce. I don't know how true that is or how well I've echoed that, but it's what I got out of it.  Mind that I'm not a medical professional. I've done my homework but everything I say really comes from personal experience and the knowledge I've gained from others. Take it with a grain of salt and trust your psychiatrist; he probably knows more about drug interactions with disorders than I do. [info] Bipolar 1 with Psychotic Features [info] 1546927104

dnr-u [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 ten years ago. I recently procured some bud after hand surgery. My supply of morphine and codeine had run out and the pain was pretty intense. Five minutes after smoking a tiny bowl I fell into a state of suicidal despair which lasted about four hours. Full blown existential terror. I woke the next morning feeling relaxed and refreshed. I slept until noon and even dozed off in the afternoon in my armchair which is something I have never done before. I could contently read a book without losing patience or my mind wandering. I know that the cannabis for sale on the street is far too strong for casual users and can cause problems for sensitive users but the residual effects for me anyway seem to be a lot more therapeutic that the atypical antipsychotics that UK doctors prescribe.

EmilyKaldwins [info] Sorry, I'm not quite sure what TTC means?My main priority was to ease my symptoms and thus hoping to have the cause and effect of helping the weight come off easier because everything's connected. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder but through research and understanding more, there is a very, very VERY good chance that my bipolar symptoms are actually caused by my PCOS (mainly the highs and lows and the extreme mood swings).I tried doing my own Inositol first but was too anxious/frustrated about trying to get the dose right on my own. I hated taking metformin and how it made me feel and that's how I ended up looking for alternatives.I guess Right off the bat my cycle started to regulate. Before I'd be skipping periods (honestly no complaints there) or go on for a full seven-eight days. On Ovasitol, my period would be about three-four days with spotting through a couple days after. I also had issues with thick uterine lining and this went away too. In order to make my ovasitol last (because it's pricey) I was only doing 1 packet a day and had those effects.In addition, I noticed my mood swings weren't as bad. They would center primarily in the week before my period, not through the entire month like they used to. I had more good days than bad.Blood sugar wise, well, I wasn't monitoring my diet very closely but I noticed that my spikes and drops weren't as bad either.I do have some obnoxious facial hair on either side of my chin that I try to pluck and didn't notice too much of a difference HOWEVER I was not specifically targeting that issue. Inositol supplements are not a All Over Curative. This focused mainly on my ovarian health.Once I ran out of supplement (and honestly like I was still really bad at taking it. I would forget some days) My period became a nightmare. In November it started normally and it was heavy, there was a ton of clotting, and it lasted for 20 days. The same thing happened in December.Inositol didn't make me sick, give me diarrhea, headaches, make me sleepy, make my stomach hurt like metformin. I tried metformin. I tried so hard and slowly tried to build myself up to it but I could never do anything with the side effects I experianced and I really wanted to get off pills.In addition to Ovasitol 2x, I'm taking 500mg of magnesium, 6000IUs of D-3, a women's multi-vitamin, fish oil, B-complex and now I'm starting Saw Palmetto which targets will target the excessive 5-alpha reductase. What that does is it's converting my overproduction of testosterone into DHT. Don't want that. So this should hopefully target the hirsutism and basically hair issues. Making sure you're getting your B-vitmains should help balance the fact that Biotin is in everything for women. I also plan on starting collagen peptides in Feb.I hope this helps???

Korinney [info] - Coop advisors can be useless, coop offerings can be shit, coop isn't guaranteed to be paid (or even paid hourly) so you can end up in debt for that time as well.- Very small sense of real community. The campus is scattered and because of coop cycles, you really have to work to make friendships and relationships last.- Because on-campus housing is so expensive and near-campus housing is insane, commuting becomes a reality for many students very quickly. I moved off campus after my second year and immediately felt like I was going to a different school. Hell, even when I was living in Davenport B and didn't have a meal plan I felt like I was in a different school. (Can be solved by not moving off of central campus and keeping a meal plan.)- Shuffle shuffle shuffle. I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder through UHCS and went on medical leave for two months. Came back part-time and struggled endlessly (in therapy and on medication from an outside psychiatrist regularly). Two YEARS later I've been told that I was supposed to have been given an advisor at the Disability Resource Center to help me with school. YEARS, PEOPLE. No one told me it was something I should use/could use.- School is really run as a company/brand. I don't feel like the administration wants me to learn, I feel like they treat me like an incoming check. I don't feel valued as a student, encouraged to learn, because my classes (STILL! AS A SENIOR!) are all medium-sized to large and so I can't get to know my professor easily. Even if I make the effort to go to office hours, they still have tons of students.- University relies heavily on adjunct professors which it doesn't value or treat well.

DisturbedLee [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar as a kid and more recently, last six years or so, bipolar with psychosis. So I mostly have psychosis episodes while in a bipolar episode but sometimes out side of them as well.  I'd been on different meds for various mental issues since a was a young child. I know they work and can be very helpful. I personally don't like to take medicine anymore though for various reasons. I like to learn about the issues and how they work and how people deal with them, and that helps me understand it better and be in more control of it. One thing I really need to work on is that sleep routine. It's a mess, but I have a hard time going to sleep sometimes and other times I have a hard time waking up. Meditation used to help really well. I'd meditate for 10-15 minutes before bed then listen to a sleep story and be out in minutes. It doesn't work so well anymore. Eating better is one thing everyone tells me I need to do. And I would if I could, but I just can't afford it. If I eat, I eat as cheap as possible most of the time. I eat one meal at the end of the day, or if food is low I'll eat once every couple of days. So that is a pretty big problem, but I've done this for so long it's just become normal for me and I forget it's a problem. I'm at the point I don't desire food until it's in front of me. I'll work on my sleeping habits, try to get back in control of that. I'll probably get back into a meditation routine as well to help. The eating situation will have to stay as it is for now.

Giddy_pig [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar (not so sure about the validity of that now but anyway) when i was about 20 but leading up to that, life was a bit rough. Around 18 years old i developed quite aggressive plaque psoriasis. I was on and off several SSRIs during this time. Stress was a factor too.I feel like the mental duress and it's affects on the immune system were likely factors that also required SSRIs treatment. In other words there might be a correlation but the link is the stress.This is all just spit balling though, I'm definitely qualified to make such statements. [info] None [info] 1518258400

When things out of my control happen and change my life I take that as a “fuck it do what you want” card. I’m currently on week two of a mixed episode and I’ve successfully pushed all healthy people out of my life because it doesn’t feel right. I don’t deserve understanding or love.

Since I’ve been free of trying to be a good person to a human who fell I love with me I’ve gladly been over spending on alcohol and having sex with men who I don’t have a connection with.

Heartnotes [info] Ha, my salary is "indie" and I got into the industry thanks to [Matt Lansing](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/196682) and this guy: http://www.weebls-stuff.com/contactus/peabo/ who is the (*in?*)famous **Z0nesama** http://zone-archive.com/ who is pretty much a fixture of the Internet at this point in time.This is our first attempt to really make it professionally in the "biz" and all the attention that means...Palcomix has probably had it the roughest out of all of us, IMHO, and that's just from commissioned fanart and IP lawsuits. (NSFW: http://rule34.paheal.net/post/list/bbmbbf/1) Still, one can't pick one's clients! Well, one can but not when starving... suddenly, pickiness goes right out the window. Me and [the Big H](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hasbro-Inc/101867679854347) have gone round and round a few times, where we stop, nobody knows. The lawsuits are a real drag because I can't actually afford health insurance. I'm on disability and applied for the FAFSA, etc...I kind of had the deck stacked against me from the start, I'm diagnosed with bipolar, mild cerebral palsy, scoliosis, maybe even schizoaffective disorder. It's incredibly hard to just... go on living in the face of such injustice that exists in the world today and I really struggle for reasons to go on fighting. What that means for my day to day life is that I take a whole host of medications and that hospitals and medical staff have **really** let me down in the past and fucked me over.That's kind of been my whole life story... [falling down.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGImSvcgzb8)Popularity is **truly** a double-edged sword. The rampant homophobia, as someone who is bisexual and heavily considering transitioning genders, has been the roughest thing to deal with it.

skeletonsmama [info] When does Hypomania become Mania? Can anyone help me ID if the line has been crossed? So, have been experiencing what I put down as a hypomanic episode for nearing a month. I am diagnosed with bipolar  II and within memory can only really identify hypo episodes - but my memory prior to 2019 is pretty fucked and I went through a lot of SSRIs and stuff prior to diagnosis.I have also - seperately because of bipolar II and the psychiatrists reasoning - been diagnosed with pyschosis that exists independent from my mood and recently started on anti-psychotics. The reason I'm asking this is the Hypomania hadn't really slowed. I chewed through 4 2mg diazapam - usually 2 of those knock me out but within an hour these had stopped having any effect. I'm going from idea to idea to idea, I want to spend a lot of money I don't have (and already have done), I'm loosing all impulse control and having a hard, if not impossible time physically leaving the house by myself. I'm going to talk to a doctor about all this, I have an appointment Thursday, just any resources online are super unclear as where the line is between mania and Hypomania and if someone's experienced both and could help me distinguish? And I ask because this is worse than I have experienced before. So I am unsure if it's just Hypomania like I haven't experience before or could be mania and thus indicative of other things. YeahThanks [info] None [info] 1581986010
Sarahkubar [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 15 (by a regular GP, who I later found out didn't have the experience or education to even diagnose or prescribe anything for those types of issues) and put on some heavy medication. I took myself off it as I couldn't function at school and it was damn near impossible to wake up of a morning. When I was around 16 and a half I did some googling in photography class one morning and stumbled across Borderline Personality Disorder. The symptoms were so identical with mine and resonated so much within me that I printed the info out and held onto it. Few months later I went and saw a psychiatrist for the first time for an official diagnosis. Low and behold, she diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. I'm much better now, on adequate medication, and can handle myself and my thoughts much easier. Google *can* help.  [info] None [info] 1494264994

Just not trapped in a delusional state anymore.I still identify as pagan. Just not sure what flavour anymore. [info] None [info] 1455964552
Jizzanthapuss [info] New here. Bipolar but not a major alcoholic. I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder which really makes the majority of my life make sense. Liquor has always been a factor in my mood swings, and for that reason I quit drinking about 2 months ago. But now I'm really craving a beer. Now I have a friend who's an alcoholic, and he CANNOT have a single beer and call it a night... But that is something I have always had no problems doing. I rarely would binge drink and even when I did, it only pushed me into a manic episode half of the time (Which is the big concern here) Now the problem is that even a single beer has the potential to push me into a manic episode. Even thought the effects of the alcohol have hardly taken place, it might be enough to make me hypo manic. This is what scares me and what made me quit drinking in the first place. But to be honest, it would be worth it to me to have a beer with a nice dinner and go home and sleep, even if I risked the mania. Does anybody know what I'm talking about? Thanks for reading.

Jake_The_Scrub_Lord [info] I recently got diagnosed with bipolar 2 after having a hypomanic episode a couple weeks ago. Don’t know if it’s real or not. So, recently (2 weeks ago) I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 after having a hypomanic episode where I pretty much stayed up for 4 days straight. So cut to now. I think I’m having another episode but I don’t have anyone to ask except you guys. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything beyond eat, watch videos on my phone, and lay in bed. But I have been less able to sleep for the past two days. Although I can’t sleep, I don’t have the motivation for anything beyond laying in my bed. I don’t feel depressed, I feel lazy beyond hell, but I can’t sleep even though I’ve been trying for days. I have been unable to nap (which I usually do) and my sleep has been lessening over the past few days. Last night I slept like 4 hours, and the night before 6 with no naps during the day. I’ve been trying to sleep but it’s impossible. Idk if I’m just having bad insomnia or if another hypomanic episode is coming and I need to watch out or tell my psychiatrist.

brilliantlycrazy86 [info] Sometimes I feel like I don't fit in! I'm sure the title is something that most bipolar people feel but I don't feel like I fit in anywhere sometimes.  A little back story I was adopted when I was little and later found out that my biological father had some real issues (message me if you want to know).  I knew my biological mother was nuts (yes I said it!) but I didn't know with what, also I lived with her for 6 years before I was adopted.  Later in life I found out she was bipolar or manic-depressive at that time.  Anyway from about 14 on I was always a moody or emotional kid, but my family was super religious so I was told to pray about it, and I was told by doctors it was just puberty.  I also knew how to hide my symptoms growing up so it wasn't until college I was diagnosed.  My freshman year of college I was diagnosed with bipolar and I had to go to the student health center (parents being religious) and never had a steady doctor.  I did somethings on my mania I am lucky I'm still here but I was never hospitalized.  I was able to manage graduating college, getting 2 career level jobs, I am buying a house, and trying to have a baby.  I am a successful bipolar which is great but sometimes I don't feel like I fit into the "bipolar" world because I have never been hospitalized and on the same sense I don't feel like I fit into the "normal" world because of my illness.  It sucks sometimes because when I try to talk to other bipolar people I have been told I don't understand because I don't have it that bad. BUT I do have it that bad I have just spend many many years learning how to hide (not healthy) and push through it.  HOLY MOLY: Thank you everyone for all the support I needed to hear it.  Sometimes it is so hard because I want to be open about being bipolar but I don't want the stigma.  LOVE YOU GUYS AND GALS!Does anyone else feel this way or am I just being "crazy" [info] None [info] 1334893220
sammywol [info] Questioning my diagnosis (long post) Please bear with me, I'm new to reddit.So, I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since I was 8 or 9 (I'm now 22), I was rediagnosed when I was 12. I've never talked about my disorder. My mother, who also has bipolar, always taught me to keep it a secret and never really talk about it in public, only to a therapist.About a year ago, a friend of mine who has PTSD and Depression "came out" to me about her PTSD and Depression, this gave me the courage and power to "come out" about my bipolar. It also encouraged me to start researching the disorder.As I've researched bipolar, I feel as though I meet some of the symptoms, and others I don't. I don't seem to have defined manic and depressive episodes, so I've chalked it up to mixed states. However, I seem to be manic a lot more than depressive.All of this research has caused me to start questioning my disorder. I will sometimes find things that fit, and it will be a reassurance that I am not wrong, and other times I will find things that don't fit, and I will feel like I don't have bipolar.It actually scares me to think that I might not have bipolar. It's taken me 10 years to get to this point, what if I don't have bipolar, and I have something else?I'm trying to find a way to get a physiological evaluation done, I'm a college student and the cost is too much for me.Any thoughts would be great! Thanks all! [info] None [info] 1448949452
angelface10 [info] Wtf am I supposed to name something like this So I don’t usually post on these things because I’m scared...but i see a lot of people posting and sharing things so I’m going to give this a try.I feel like such an annoyance and burden to everybody around me. I’m so annoying and emotional. I realize that my mood changes super quickly. I’m happy one min and then the next I’m so angry and I’m saying really mean things to people that I regret a couple hours later and i can’t help or control what I’m doing. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and I feel like I will never be able to hold down a stable relationship of any kind because I am not stable and I don’t know if I will ever be.  Regardless of the medication I take or how many counselors I talk to. I feel like I’m going to be stuck in this circle for the rest of my life of not controlling myself. I’m either really high on life and happy or I’m sad and depressed or angry. It’s so strange...I can feel and detect when I’m on a high...but I also have the voice in the back of my head telling me It won’t last. I  don’t know how long I can keep fighting for guys... After years of trying to cope with this..I can tell you right off the bat that it fucks you up in ways you don’t even realize. I’m exhausted and I’m tired. I would give up anything to go through one day without feeling like I’m on a roller coaster every second of the day. I want to be free. I want to be normal but for some reason I can’t get a grasp on reality and it’s slowly killing me, just like it killed my dad. [info] None [info] 1537343927
Kellebelle0127 [info] "You're not helping yourself" Sorry if this is against the rules -- new poster. I found out I had borderline when I moved out to go to college last September. I was away from my boyfriend and my family and was basically all alone all the time. I ended up dropping out after 3 weeks because I got so depressed it was unbearable. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a few months before that, and my psychiatrist at the time told me I wasn't ready to move out, I ignored her. She was right. Now every night I have to have my boyfriend sit with me until I fall asleep every night, my best friend got married and moved away so I'm a mess constantly (shes pregnant now and sleeping a lot so we dont talk a lot which makes me feel rejected) and whenever people leave the house or are too busy to be with me I cry. I dont mean to be emotionally manipulative. I'm afraid of how attached I am to people. I never used to be like this, I think moving out brought it out. Now I do online school and sleep most of the day and never leave the house. My family, therapist and pdoc tell me I'm doing it to myself. I don't know what to do to help myself.  This is so new to me.  I've been depressed before, but never like this. [info] None [info] 1519007622

Kindheartedspirit [info] I lived with my mom for 18 years of my life and during the last 6-7 years of my stay with her, it was awful. *I* diagnosed my bipolar disorder at 16 years old. When I was 17, my mom tried to get me to do Confirmation(a Catholic thing for those who don't know) and I told her I didn't want to because I didn't believe in God. Of course this led to fights with her. I even went to question my Confirmation teacher during my first year with him because f*** it's not worth my time and there's logically unsound ideas in Catholicism that I kept pointing out. When he finally was fed up with me, I stopped attending only to have to go *back* because my mom kept giving my stepdad crap about it so he asked me to do it for my mom who he later said she is sick in the head (said this in Vietnamese so it's the best translation). I thought it was unfair that I had to do this for her because she stopped being a good mom to me after she had my sisters *who happen to be my stepdad's kids with her*. But my diagnosis of her came out to be pretty accurate because lo and behold, here I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 (which I never thought would be the case until I kept spending lots of money on things I wanted and racking up credit card debts) and the only person I could have reasonably get it from is her. So what you said is *entirely not fair*. There's no reason for you to have to sacrifice your freedom when there's a car *right there* not being used. You're not taking her freedom away because if she wanted to go out, walking suffices. [info] None [info] 1569346301

fellhound007 [info] I have nightmares when I'm awake and I feel no one takes me seriously. Im 23 years old. Around 2009-2010 I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. That alone was hard enough. But I had a fairly abusive childhood and things started getting worse family wise, I dont even know where to start. 2011 my dad attacked me. And my family brushed it under the rug. Every day I see the scar. Everyday I think of it. Ive always struggled, but I guess Im too good at hiding it because friends and family just brush me off. 2018 I was finally diagnosed with PTSD, but that was after seeing my husband attempt suicide twice,a severe car accident, and being in such a bad place, on top of the trauma already there. I snapped last month. I couldnt do it anymore. I quit my job. I dont sleep. I have nightmares. Im constantly angry and yelling and I dont know how to stop. Im just this aggressive mess and its like nightmares while Im awake. Vivid flashes in my head and I just stop and the world goes silent. I am in therapy, but my thoughts are so jumbled that its like word vomit and i cant focus. And i constantlt downplay and laugh like im ok and im not and i dont know how to stop. I dont know how to tell my friends. My husband although also has PTSD has it for different reasons (army vet) and doesn't understand. Im so frustrated and lost. I cant get out of my head.

trout2243 [info] I have a couple of questions for all you bipolar people out there  Now, I don't know anybody else that has bipolar so I've never asked these questions:So, I was diagnosed with bipolar a year ago. I was hospitalized 3 times within the course of 5 months. They had me on all kinds of meds that didn't work, but eventually got me on the right ones. Anyway, my question is: While I was either off my meds or on the wrong ones I sometimes felt like I was trapped in my own body. Do other people with bipolar feel the same way sometimes??Second question:I can't usually feel when I get into a mood or whatever, but while I'm in a mood I often talk to myself in my head and try to talk myself out of doing stupid shit. Like today, I told my girlfriend to tell me things that would make me jealous. I kept telling myself that it was a bad idea but some other part of me was like "do it because you really want to get mad right now." Do any of you guys do that? [info] Bipolar 1 [info] 1413211704

danullment [info] Intro to my MIL who tried to bribe DH to leave me Another user posted a story about her MIL trying to bribe her FDH to leave her. Seeing her story made me finally feel ready (after lurking on this sub for over a year) to share my story. I will share the story of the bribe soon, but I wanted to start by giving you some background. She is mostly BEC, though she has veered into Just No territory, obviously, with the whole bribe thing. Some background info: I am polyamorous. I have my legal DH1 of 11 years and my unofficial DH2 who I’ve known for 8 years, almost 4 of them spent in a relationship. The three of us live together and are very happy and have a pretty great family dynamic. The guys aren’t involved romantically but are absolutely best friends. My family knows we are poly and don’t care but DH1’s family disowned him when he told them about us and it devastated him. We have not told DH2’s family we are poly for this reason. The story we gave them was that DH1 and I are no longer together romantically but that we are still living together because he has a disability (true) and DH2 and I love him and want to take care of him forever (also true.) Most of DH2’s family has been pretty okay with that explanation and treat DH1 as an unofficial member of the family. Besides the random interrogations from MIL2 about when DH1 and I would “finally” get divorced, the poly situation hasn’t really been an issue. (That I’m aware of…it’s very possible that the family suspects we are actually poly but that hasn’t really affected anything.) The BEC things MIL2 has done include: -Telling me (like 4 months into my relationship with her son) that she knew I had “emotional issues” from the day she first met me. This was said during a family vacation where she took me aside for like an hour long “heart to heart” where she interrogated me about why I still live with DH, my family history, and my mental health (I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD from being sexually assaulted). She acted like she was really kind and caring during that conversation but that comment (and the fact that she knew nothing about me besides what I looked like at that point) really pissed me off. I’m 98% sure that judgment was based off of my many tattoos and piercings and the fact that I’m goth/metal af. I’ve been medicated for over a decade and manage my mental health quite well. -Insists on pointing out that I’m “white too” whenever I mention my Native heritage. I’m equal parts Native and white but I was raised by my grandmother who is Native and have always identified as Native. I feel like she constantly has to mention that I’m also white to make her feel better about the fact that I’m with her son. Because literally all of this woman’s friends and family are white, anti-immigrant, pro-Trump. I’m pretty much the only “liberal” and POC at any family gathering. -Is totally unaccepting of different people and religions. She cries because DH2 is an atheist and is going to hell. She cried and became very upset when he mentioned casually (I was not present at the time) I was very close friends with a Muslim. She literally thinks all Muslims are evil people. -Gossiping and spreading false stories about me to the family based on hearsay from other family members and refusing to acknowledge when she is wrong or apologize for making me look bad. -Acting like she absolutely loves and adores me while actively trying to turn DH2 against me. I was able to ignore/write off most of the BEC stuff because she can be very kind and charming is very good at hiding her true feelings. That’s why it took me so long to realize she hated me and wanted me gone. Next time, the story of how she tried to break us up and DH2 had to learn to shine his spine. [info] None [info] 1541789771

zero-01 [info] I have some questions. So I have been diagnosed with bipolar for a few months now. That was my first time going to a doctor for "mental help" because I was taught that mental health is some fancy excuse for the rich/upper class and it's just your perception that needs to change. Nevertheless I always kindnof knew something was wrong with me and I am still so conflicted about everything. I am 80% sure I may have schizophrenia. A few rare times I've had visual hallucinations. I have voices in my head which I interpret as like 3-4 me just arguing with each other, if that makes sense? I loved my first old therapist. She listened to me and at the very least gave a shit about me. But my new counselor is just so, horrible. He actually made my life worse. He sometimes fall asleep during our sessions and then jokes about it and brushes it aside. I specifically told him not to tell my parents anything other than that I have bipolar and he actually spilled every major fucking details that we discussed. I am very non-confrontal guy and don't know how to get out of that clinic. And during this whole time, my symptoms have worsen and I am not sure if it's just early sign of schizophrenia or just my bipolar. Can anyone help me understanding these symptoms? Also what's the best way to get myself out of that clinic? Sorry for the long post. It's just I don't know what else to do. [info] None [info] 1514864340
BoojiBoy [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and her behavior definitely reminds me of some of my more unhinged moments before I started taking medication.  When that kind of thing used to happen to me, it would feel literally impossible to understand my thoughts and emotions.. much less control them.  When you add a couple of high pressure situations into the mix like running a kitchen by yourself and doing it in front of cameras for a prime-time television audience, it's inevitable that it all snowballs into a meltdown.  It's happened to me quite a few times, unfortunately.  That said, there's a definite layer of "total bitch" in her attitude that seems to be independent of the other thing.Maybe with all of the negative attention, she'll realize that she needs to get help and she may come out of the experience a better person.  I hope so, anyway.  I don't like seeing people suffer in that way.  It hits way too close to home.As far as the husband is concerned, I have no clue what his problem is.  He just kind of seems like a plain old dick. [info] None [info] 1368609069

sandsnatchqueen [info] 2 opinions are better than one imo if you have decent insurance or have the money. There's always the chance of other issues that may be more serious than adhd and one may find something else. Then you can decide from there. From my personal experience I was diagnosed with bipolar and adhd (lamictal+seroquel +adderall for treatment)  and only my second psych diagnosed me correctly. The first one put me on meds that exasperated my bipolar manic episodes (ssri's + adderall aren't a great combo for most) . So I'm all for second opinions.  [info] None [info] 1513306731
PugsAndPuns [info] Short answer: I don’t.Long answer: I feel really awful about myself and decide to do something about it. I work really hard at it but then I get frustrated and discouraged and stop all progress until my next bout of extreme self-hating. I make long and detailed “action plans,” outlining what I’ll eat, an exercise routine, goals, etc. and declare my dedication to “actually stick with it this time.” Given a little bit of time and it all falls apart again. Repeat this cycle indefinitely. I think it’s also worth noting that I am diagnosed with bipolar I with borderline personality disorder traits, so my mental instability is also a major contributor to this pattern.

mascara_party [info] My mother refuses to acknowledge my mental illness. I was diagnosed with bipolar more than 5 years ago, and finally came out and told my mother. Why, I have no idea. If I talk to her on the phone and seem a little down, she goes "Oh, I know you have a little bit of bipolar so I'll let you go and get some rest." She refers to my manic episode as "wow, you were really out of your mind and not in reality" instead of showing any sign of compassion. Anyway, just wanted to share and see if anyone had similar painful experiences. I have found this community really helpful in terms of understanding how troubled my mother is. She is very mentally unstable herself, but obviously refuses therapy or medication. [info] None [info] 1515871162

ladyb07 [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When i get in my depressive phase (which I'm in now) I cut myself off from the world. I sleep all day. I often just sit in my room in complete silence for hours. Never answer the phone. I feel nothing for anybody. Especially when people tell me they miss me I always have to lie and say i do too. You have forgotten the sense of excitement. And I perosnally get a physical feeling. My brain litterally feels different in the front. Heavier maybe?? I feel a heaviness above my eyes. And that's when I definitely know I'm back in my depressed cycle and not just sad.  [info] None [info] 1359528144

ziasun [info] Father is a serial killer This is just my story, and I have no idea where to put this, so I'm releasing it to the world in this fashion. As a kid, I never knew why I was adopted. I wasn't even adopted through an agency, but rather through a gynecologist who knew my adoptive father (worked in the same hospital). I never thought I would find my family, as the doctor who delivered me eventually passed away, and I was given up at 2 minutes old, leaving me with virtually no paper trail to follow. I grew up with a loving mother and a struggling father. As a teenager I fell deep into drug abuse and addiction. I honestly blamed it on the repeated abuse from my adoptive father (also an addict). I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I took my medication and attended meetings and sobered up. This year through 23andMe, I found my biological family. Growing up an only child, I now have 11 siblings/half siblings. My mom had 5 of us (the rest on dad's side), and she started having kids when she was 14. Three of her kids were taken by CPS, and the last two of us were adopted. I just met my mom. It was amazing to find her - the similarities were incredible and we immediately felt like best friends. However, she informed me that the reason for my adoption was that my biological father was a serial killer. I looked up my father's name to find various charges for meth trafficking and counterfeit money as well. He's dying in prison. He was a successful business owner, but was stuck with a long line of mental illness that had been passed down. I often question what is nature and what is nurture. Once again, I don't know what to do with this information, but it's out there now. If you're out there looking for your biological family, prepare yourself, just in case.

ran_out_of [info] Me too ! They're insane. Done my head in. Can't be dealing with the frustration anymore. Online will be better.Part of is as I am diagnosed with bipolar ( just think is a mood symptom of low testosterone for years though) doctors treat you differently I've noticed if I mention it or not.Also part of it is I am English living and working in Germany and I don't speak german. So they resent talking in English probably assume I don't have a job so see me as foreign mentally ill scum and probably assume I am on benefits and using their welfare system. So they see me as dirt. I probably pay just as much taxes as they do though. I don't want the battle anymore the stress is not worth it so online is the best thing for me. Especially as I keep moving countries and may be moving to Switzerland at end of the year so if I keep everything online I won't need to go through this again in a new country.Never get a mental illness put on your medical records it really does change the way you are treated. It gives them permission to discount everything you say. [info] None [info] 1555684986
LastStark [info] My family have been making me miserable for years and now I finally admitted to myself that I hate them I feel like a bad person. This is a lot of text so I apologise, but I'd be massively grateful for any opinions on this. It's the first time I've typed it all out like this.My mum never abused me or anything, and she always kept food in my mouth and a roof over my head, and generally did her best, most of the time. My real dad was a real piece of shit, used to kill all of our pets and beat my mother in front of me. Eventually she stormed out and left and we actually had to leave town because he was threatening to kidnap me and attempt to leave the country. I was four to five years old while all this was going on and apparently I barely ever spoke despite having a pretty good command of English at the time. I always just read and stayed quiet. When I did talk, it was apparently me begging her to get us and my tiny baby sister away from him. We move around. A lot. Never long enough for me to get used to socializing with other kids. I pretty much just gave up on it.Fast forward a few years and she's met a fairly decent guy in comparison. Nowhere near as fucked up as my real dad. But he comes from a family that's still stuck in the fifties. As soon as him and my mum got serious he started beating me when he 'looked after' me and my sister if we misbehaved. Bear in mind we were mostly good kids considering the environment we came from. He took a belt to me a fair few times and used to belt the back of our knees and smack our heads together. He was the kind of guy who'd scream in our faces and smack us to the ground if we talked back. To put it in context, this went on from me being seven to sixteen and he was a six foot bouncer. I remember being furious because my mother was a strictly NO physical punishment kind of person and here was this fucking guy just strolling into our lives and beating the shit out of us for not putting our dishes away properly. I went to her so many times, told her he was hitting us, showed her the bruises and belt marks, but she never believed me. She got married to this guy and I was expected to call him my dad. I got sick of it eventually when I hit sixteen and put on some muscle. He backed me into a corner and started throwing trash at me from out of the bin and I just fucking lunged at him. It took my mother threatening to call the police on him to get him off of me, but I gave him one hell of a bloody nose.Despite seeing him beat the shit out of me she still thought I was lying about all the other stuff, and when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year later, she told me I was 'lying' about that too, that I was just a moody, selfish teenager. Things got a little better around the house. My stepdad threw his weight around considerably less as we got older and actually became pretty chilled out. He ended up breaking down and straight up bawling at me about how badly he felt and how he wishes he could have been better. This was around the time my mum was pregnant with his child, my half-brother. So far he's been an incredible dad to him, and I can't help but feel a little bitter when I see how good he is with him. But, naturally, just as the arrival of my little brother starts pulling our family closer, my mum runs off to have an affair with a married policeman and tears the house apart. I had moved in with my first girlfriend while this was all happening but she kicked my stepdad to the curb after ten years of marriage and told him she wouldn't ever want to be with him again. Now whenever I come back to the town where they live my mum and dad beg to see me and get offended when I don't want to see them. They don't want to hear it when I talk about how much the past has fucked me up. My mum attempts to 'heal' my bipolar and alcoholism with positive energy and New Age stuff. Still insists I'm "Not bipolar, your chakras aren't aligned" and stuff like that. The thing is though, despite my family falling apart after never really being all that great and my girlfriend breaking up with me and kicking me out about six months after my parents split up, I'm blessed with the family I've made for myself. The friends who have fed me and given me sofas and floors to sleep on when I've had nowhere to go. The people who kept me off the streets. I am shocked when I count my blessings and *lose count*. My little brother adores me and I feel closer to him than any of my other blood relatives. I completely dread him turning out anything like me. But I feel shitty for not liking my family, and the fact that I don't want to spend time with them or want them particularly involved in my life now makes me feel like an ungrateful little brat. Yeah, things got pretty bad at times, but we were always fed. We always had clothes and shelter and I feel like I owe them for it. Am I wrong to want them out of my life?

Krazygrunt249 [info] I'm 25 now, but since I was about 13 I knew something felt off but I was able to go about my life. Joined the military at 17, and about halfway through my brain just took a nosedive and I just started failing everywhere. My leaders pushed me to try to get help and I did a few times while in, but stigma got me and I didn't seek the help I needed while I was in. I got out after 6 years without too many hiccups, but December of 2016 I was at my lowest. My girlfriend at the time was always working. I was struggling at my job because of what was happening mentally and was just feeling beyond alone. A bit after new years, I was driving behind a car and it got t-boned hard. I carry a few first aid kits in my car for times like this because I have the training and you just never know. I grab a kit and run for the car that got t-boned. The car was flipped but from the outside it didn't look too bad. The driver was far from ok. Nothing I could do. The other driver is out and already calling 911. I get home eventually very shooken up and I ask my gf to come over and help. She doesn't reply. Next morning she comes over and long story short she leaves me. I lost it. After a few days of self destruction, I knew where I was headed if I didn't get help. I ask my employer for leave and immediately drive myself to the ER because i didn't trust myself alone. After 2 days of waiting I was in a inpatient facility, and was there for 2 weeks. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I finally told myself fuck the stigma and started being very open about my mental health and about therapy. People I've known for years sent me messages about how they have gotten help because of how easy i made it seem. And although some days are very hard to be open, I am so glad I got help. Sorry for the rant.  [info] None [info] 1507258224
ricedreamer [info] I'm 23F and I've had to move back home with my parents after I was committed into the psych ward this past march (I posted in r/AMA about it for people who were curious as to what it was like) and I feel like I'm a million steps back. Before I lived alone, went to university in town and had a pretty good social life. I was spiraling and didnt even notice until my parents brought me in. I was diagnosed with bipolar mania type two and PTSD. I was manic for a couple months, then the hospital sorted me out. But now I feel like I'm back at square one... I know I am much healthier now, and I'm healing and planning to continue school either in January or next fall... But I can't shake the feeling that everything would have been better if I didn't go to the hospital. Which I know is untrue, I was a danger to myself and I know I wouldn't have either been dead or in jail. I'm just upset, teenage me would have not pictured me here back at home, broke, and sorting out my mental health. I wish so much that I was normal. A lot of my friends ditched when I was hospitalized, I do have a few close ones I'm grateful for. It just hurts to realize that I had friends that only cared about drugs and partying, and not myself. I was raped this past December by my friends boyfriend, I left that whole friend group since they told me I lied about it happening - regardless of going to the hospital, having the rape kit done, and reporting it to police. Since that moment my life has turned upside down and it's been super hard to orientate myself back up.

Falcom-Ace [info] I've had about 5 or 6 psychologists and psychiatrists. It was the third one who told me about the diagnosis, so I'm not sure which of the first two actually did the diagnosis and what specifically led them to that conclusion. My third one and I talked about it and went through a more formal diagnostic process with my being involved, wherein he told me that I was very obviously a "covert" schizoid.I'd originally been in therapy for a really bad depressive episode, then later I was diagnosed with bipolar NOS.

aurortonks [info] Oh yeah, of course. I used to regularly smash dishes in the kitchen when I got mad, before I was diagnosed with bipolar. Now, I get urges to smash stuff which ends up me usually punching myself in the leg or slapping myself in the face (these instances are very rare nowadays). I've come close to smashing things like my pc, laptop, phone, kindle, etc as well but haven't done so yet. I try to back off the ledge when the urges hit because I really like my things and damaging them would be heartbreaking once the anger or frustration subside. To do this, I use thought-changing techniques my therapist taught me such as reframing my thoughts into positives, writing down why I'm upset, and holding ice cubes until they get too cold over and over again. I also talk with my spouse when I'm feeling that upset and he helps talk through the thoughts and feelings so that I can calm down gradually while still having my emotions and thoughts validated.

EndemicPsychosis [info] Quick rant Hey its u/EndemicPsychosis. Ive posted a little bit before about my frustrating journey trying to get diagnosed. Basically I have psychosis but I don't know whats causing it. I suppose the most likely is either bipolar or schizophrenia. I was diagnosed with bipolar but it was by my primary care doctor on the first day we met with no sort of testing or anything so Im not sure its a trustworthy diagnosis. I asked him for a referral to a psychiatrist but he said he doesnt think I need one. So now Im on my own trying to get good help. I counselor I know through my church suggested I get a psychiatric evaluation done to diagnose me but I cant find a provider who can do the kind of evaluation I need who also takes my insurance. Ive called like seven different people and places now and none of them have worked out. I have a lead on another person now so wish me luck. Anyway its just really hard to find good help around here. Thanks for being such an awesome community. Rant over [info] None [info] 1524781603

cultofvader [info] Crime is what made me want to learn more about the brain and how it works physically and socially, but I was diagnosed with bipolar I and II within the last year and it's been a terrible struggle to get the medical help that I need, so I started doing a bunch of research on my own time about it and it interests me to the point I think I could do it as a career. I would love to focus on research and development of the knowledge around mental health but I know that the process of doing that is very jaded and messed up, so I probably won't be able to do that, I've always wanted to help people and in doing that I've found things that make people happy (like theatre for some). Things have been a very long and hard journey for me as far as mental health goes and in my opinion mental health is more important than physical in a lot of cases and I want people to know that someone actually understands what they're going through and wants to help them. I'm caught in the middle of doing two things I love which I guess isn't the worst struggle to have but oh well.  [info] None [info] 1510857953
crazyausachick [info] One small move I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1 and I have ptsd. Earlier this year the ptsd was really bad but I've managed to gain some control over it. I moved to a new city for a new job and I hate both of them, and it's been about 9 months. I feel really trapped and bored. But I don't trust myself to make any decisions or big moves or even do anything to alleviate my boredom. I can't tell if my boredom is mania induced as I feel twinges of impulsivity and so I'm afraid to do anything about it. In July I had a severe depressive episode and finally ended up stabilized back on lithium but I've also played with my lithium as the side effects were problematic. My doctor knows this and he and I are working on a solution with meds. However I feel really isolated and really agitated and bored. I feel like I'm wasting time, I keep thinking about quitting my job and moving somewhere else. I'm homesick for my other city that I was already desperate to leave to come here.... my solution is always to move. I don't have any friends here. I feel hopeless and like something might just crack inside of me and I just need to leave...but again I go back to feeling like I can't trust my decision making. I also have this feeling that nothing is familiar to me. I think this is a ptsd thing. Over the past 3 years I've lived in 3 countries and 4 or 5 major cities. And all of the sudden nothing is feeling familiar to me here in this place I've been for 9 months. And I'm finding that scary. I am scared that if I allow myself to even make one small move that could lead to manic behavior that's all it would take for me to just crumble and completely lose the plot.

AccioMotherfucker [info] I get paid in two weeks on the 28th. I'm thinking of buying a cheap shotgun and ending it. I'm a drug addict. I use cocaine, opiates, alcohol, benzos, and heroin occasionally. I've been diagnosed with bipolar for a few years and I guess I do the drugs to self-medicate.Well I went to the psychiatrist and went though 60 pills in one way (30x 1mg clonazepam and 30x Temazepam) and I'm tired of this roller coaster. I can't stand it anymore. My wife and I have been married for almost 5 years and last night in the car we were talking about my abuse issues. I told her I've tried to get help so many times and it never works. I'm an addict and that's it. I asked if she would be okay without me, and she said "I would make do without you, I could raise the kids myself, move back with my parents, etc."So I told her that she has until the end of the month to make a decision. Does she want me in her life or not? I told her to have fun explaining to the kids that their father won't be around anymore. This is all I ever wanted out of life. A wife and kids who love me. I want to see my little boys grow up (4yo and 6mo) and they absolutely adore me.I've always had suicidal tendencies and I'm tired of being a drug addict with a mental disorder. My bipolar will not go away as I get older, I'll be there forever, and right now it feels like my marriage won't.I have a problem, though. I don't want to hurt anyone. I know they'll be hurt but in her words "I'll get over it."I've been thinking about this for a while now. Do I need to write a will or something like that? It should be painless if I use buckshot. I can walk into any gun store and walk out with a shotgun + ammo within two or three hours.2017 was supposed to be good to me. I got a good job, moving to  a new place, etc,. People WILL miss me. People WILL hurt when they realize that I will never be around anymore to make them laugh and smile.I won't get to see my baby smile anymore, or read beditime stories to my oldest. Never again will I kiss my wife's lips or hold her when she cries.She put the straw on the camel's back It's happening. Of course I can't tell a psych. because they will lock me up for 3 days and that'll do nothing.10 days. [info] None [info] 1479547269
MelsWhitePubes [info] After my dad died, I got put on a high dose of antidepressants that fucked with my head majorly, for two reasons that I didn't understand for years later.  First, I find out through genetic testing that certain SSRIs are 7 times as effective on me than the average person...I was on the maximum recommended dose of Effexor.  Then, some time after that, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and was told that ANY dose of SSRI could cause my otherwise mild manic episodes to be much worse...I didn't know either of these things when I experienced the following...I had found my old livejournal page from the really 2000s, and reading it I saw lots of things I had no memory of.  This scared me and I did some research, and found that my antidepressants could cause memory loss.  One of the most disturbing lost memories was an auto collision I had in a Taco Bell drive through, because I described it in great detail...I was rear-ended, pushed into the brand new car in front of me, and all the cars had to pull into the parking lot and wait for the police to come work out what happened, spent almost two hours there making sure I would not be found at fault.  I had specific times recorded, and had 0 memory of any of it.  Over time, fragments of the memory came back to me - filling out a description of the accident under the yellow parking lot lights, being administered a breathalyzer, calling my insurance company and giving my phone to the cop because I didn't have my proof of insurance in the car... It was still fragmentary and like a dream, though.Years after that, after my mother died, an old ex girlfriend got in touch with me for the first time in years.  I asked her why she cut off all contact with me back in the day, and she asked "Did you break into my apartment?"  "Of course not, why did you think it was me?" "You had been texting me all day to give you back the laptop you gave me, so that night I took it to work with me, when I got home my apartment was broken into but nothing was taken, I assumed it was you because you were acting crazy after your dad died."  I told her it wasn't me and said she really should have asked me at the time.  Then, for no apparent reason, I asked if there was a footprint on the door, as that would show whether it was me (I have unusually large feet).  She didn't remember a footprint, and I was so obviously surprised and offended by the accusation that she apologized for thinking it was me.Afterwards, I kept thinking about that time, and the memory came back to me... Going to her apartment at night... Taking one of my mother's shoes and using it to put a muddy footprint on her door, then pushing it in with my shoulder... Looking for the laptop, then leaving without it.And, some time after that, I realized that the livejournal entry about the accident in the Taco Bell drive through was a fabrication to give me an alibi for where I was at the time I broke in, in case her neighbors reported something.  All the memories related to the accident were false, and created years after the fact when I completely forgot why I made up that story. [info] None [info] 1500915250
kicsikucsi [info] Dear dad, I know that I wasn't always the most ideal daughter, and maybe I didn't make you proud enough. At 21 years old, looking back, I remember thinking my life would be a lot different. I remember turning 13 and thinking that, however arbitrary the difference between 12 and 13 was, my "teens" would be absolutely great, and that by now, I would have lots of friends, money, a career I loved, or I'd be in college.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD and GAD with severe agoraphobia right before you passed away three months ago. All of it has been very hard on me. My biggest fear is that you died thinking I was a disappointment somehow, or that I did not make you proud enough. I guess I have some updates for you.&amp;#x200B;I remember you wondering why I didn't ever go out or do anything outside of the house. You'd encourage me to get out whenever I could. To live life to the fullest like you did.It's nothing *big*, I just wanted to let you know that for the first time in my life, I walked outside all by myself for five days in a row and got my own food and interacted with people. All on my own. I wanted to tell you about that.You died during the transitional period of seeing me grow as a woman, and I have a lot I wish I could share with you. I still take my medications and go to therapy, which you seemed to be happy with. You said you noticed a big change in me and that I seemed to be doing better.I've been thinking about going back to school next year. I've been looking for jobs after being unemployed for six or seven months. I know you like my current boyfriend a lot; you expressed being finally happy and relieved to know that I found someone that actually treats me well.So I wanted to say that things are going pretty well between us, and in a month and a half it'll be one year of us being together. I spent two weeks at his apartment and just got home yesterday. He was the one that encouraged me to go out and do things by myself for once, but you were the one that inspired me. More recently, I've heavily considered moving in with him within the next year, but I'm not so sure yet. When I told you that I thought about this before, you were very supportive of it and happy for me, but mom is very lonely without you. No matter how much she reassures me that it's okay if I choose to "*go on my own way*", I feel very guilty at the thought of leaving her alone. I miss you lots, and at times, painfully so. I wish you'd give me more advice. I'm not sure what to do, or where to begin sometimes. I still don't always like myself, but I feel confident knowing that you are my dad. I hope everything is great wherever you are, and that this message finds you well. &amp;#x200B;Love, your daughter&amp;#x200B;P.S. The Packers won over the Bears again. I remembered you told me to never bet against them during their rivalry matches, and I guess that you were right. [info] None [info] 1568533619

lexior [info] I lived in Finland for a very long time and grew up there intermittently. From my experience:The social pressure that if you don't drink (enough) you are viewed as weak, especially amongst "the boys" (mostly in the youth culture I've noticed this)The fact that kela Will not provide me with English forms because I have a Finnish passport and speak the language (I speak it decently, but I don't think anyone speaks kela)As a child, the schools very tolerant behaviour towards bullying. I was locked into a bathroom for half of the day by a classmate and no action was taken. I was also on multiple occasions told by teachers that it was my fault for being strange or out of the ordinary. I hear these types of stories a lot from Finnish friends. The lack of information provided on the social structures aimed to help youth unemployment is abysmal. Yes, you have places like osaamo in Helsinki, but there are very very few ways to get informed about things you can do as a twenty something struggling to navigate life.The absolute fucking mess that is the mental health treatment. It took me two months to get into crisis counselling through my doctor, after which it took another two months to start any kind of treatment. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I had prior diagnoses from the NL clearly stating I had complex PTSD. I was put on medication without proper explanation as to why. Then admitted into aurora for day therapy for two months. After which I was deemed cured and handed a prescription for quetiapine and peragablin and sent on my merry way. From what I've heard, this is not at all uncommon and Finland still suffers from a backwards thinking when it comes to mental health. The bureaucracy absolutely does not help and the devastating rate of successful suicide attempts is testament that this should be talked about.The Finnish Postal service could suck my dick if I had one as well.Don't get me wrong, I love Finland, the beauty and the people, but there are issues that I think especially outsiders ignore because Finland really is viewed as this utopia where socialism meets capitalism in this beautiful marriage of alcoholic coffee drinking Adonis bodied sauna goers.

aliceINchainz [info] I actually submitted this to /r/blunderyears: [photos of me in high school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blunderyears/comments/1ccr1a/band_tshirts_and_an_after_picture/)I was ugly and fat. Not very attractive at all. I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I was struggling with the beginning of bulimia. I would get in trouble a lot, but it wasn't anything serious just sometimes detention. My grades were okay, I would get As and Bs in Art, Science, and Cs and Ds in other classes. I was confused about my sexuality, too. I dated a couple of girls and guys. I was very awkward, had very few friends, and I doubt anyone liked me. I wish I could tell you I'm different than I was before, but not much has changed. I lost like 30 pounds, and I'm much more confident, but I'm still extremely shy and awkward.

huntybunchesofoats [info] I've Been Saved for a Year! Here's my Testimony. I grew up in a Lutheran household and was baptized as a baby and confirmed, but something was always missing, maybe I wasn't mature enough, maybe God had other plans, all I know is that I was not saved. As a reached my sophomore year of high school I became severely depressed, I began to cut and had no hope for life. I ended up in an outpatient mental hospital where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Wile at the hospital I began to hate God for putting this on me me. Once I reached my junior year of high school I began to question my sexuality, after some months of seeking ended up coming out as gay, the whole time disregarding God. It was half way through junior year of high school that I came out to my best friend, he was Christian and immediately became concerned. After months of arguments and a few full out fights, he convinced me to To the night at his house and we read the Bible, this sparked an interest in me that I had never had before l. After weeks of talking and convincing I agreed to go to church with him, I went to the youth service on Wednesday night. Long story short I felt outcasted and hated and I left in a rage. My friend apologized and next week I decided to try again. Most of that Wednesday night was a blur and honestly I don even remember the sermon, but that was the night I accepted Christ and received the Holy Spirt. The next day at school was honestly horrible, I began to see sin every where and the worst part was I saw it in myself, and it horrified me. That same day I sat in my history class and I heard  the word "pray" this shocked me but I bowed my head and began to pray during class, it was in that prayer I heard the words "you are not gay" and from that point on I no longer believed I was gay despite my "all in" mentality (I was actually planing to go to and upcoming pride parade). I got plugged in at a the church that my friend brought me to and I was baptized for the repentance of my sins. Well it's a year later, and I can't say it has been easy. It honestly was a giant struggle trying to find a balance between relying full on grace or fully on legalism. I can gladly say now after a year I have learned to fight sin, but when I fail know that I am forgiven. Me and the guy who brought me church are the best of friends and love sharing our experiences with each other. Oh and the gay thing, well I would be lying if I said I didn't have temptation, but temptation is not a sin, even Jesus was tempted, it's what you do with it. I  hope this helps or inspires some of you. God is the light of my life and I can now share that with two world, I pray that God is with you all, and that you all have a blessed day wherever you are.

IamAtticus19 [info] I used to be a teacher and now I make more money to do less work. I hate it. Two years ago I quit teaching to work on my mental health. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder which seems to be a good fit. My medication is doing wonders and I am so ready to go back to teaching. But I am worried. Last year I applied at some places and I got 0 interviews. This year my old job called me and begged me to come back to work at their school in my old position. (apparently my replacement is not cutting the mustard.) This offer gives me mixed feelings.   My current job pays me more than my teaching job but I absolutely hate it here. I am a receptionist. I answer a phone when I used to shape children. My coworkers are all 60+, I am about to turn 30. I cant relate to anyone here. I feel so meaningless here.

l-appel_du_vide- [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 in high school, but before they would give me the diagnosis, they ran some blood work to check out my thyroid, because apparently thyroid issues can manifest with symptoms strikingly similar to bipolar disorder.I had a number of extremely crazy, extremely horrible years before and after then until I finally found the pharmaceutical cocktail that works for me, but the root cause being neurochemical fuckery made sense to me. The fact that somebody's thyroid can do that same shit to them seemed so wild and awful.As somebody who's been down that road as well, even if for different reasons, you have my sincere empathy. I hope getting to the bottom of it helped you find a cocktail that worked for you, too. [info] None [info] 1517776165
PrairieWulf [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type II rapid cycling) six years ago although it has ruined me for my entire life. My loved ones made little to no effort to learn about it or help me. My friends all disappeared. When I was put on income assistance and couldn't afford my place anymore I had to move to another city because my cousin was the only person that could help me out, but that situation was way worse (at least six people at any time living in a three bedroom party house). That was year three, things got so much worse, and it doesn't account for the nightmare my life was for the 22 years leading up to the diagnosisI am never going to be able to get out of this myself. I have one friend in the city I live in now and he does his best to keep my spirits up but he's never going to help me change my lot in life and I can't do it alone. My only hope is that one day some kind person will take me in and help me get my legs under me before I kill myself. The only reason I haven't done it yet is to spare my family the pain, but I can't keep going on like this. [info] None [info] 1408541666
rachelway82 [info] Apparent I do have bpd I've been seeing my therapist for about 7 months. I was diagnosed with bipolar last summer. Yesterday I was talking to my therapist about how I used to be afraid I had borderline personality disorder. She said "you do". It really caught me off guard. I am trying to word this in a way that doesn't offend anyone, but I've only ever read bad things about bpd. I've read that some therapists won't even treat patients with it. When I was a kid my Mom always told me I was being manipulative or just trying to get attention whenever I got upset. Now it looks like maybe she was right. I spent most of yesterday lurking on this sub, and really did identify with a lot of what I read. But with all I've read online about people with bpd, its hard not to feel shame. It does seem to be very stigmatized. Did anyone else have a hard time accepting this diagnosis? I apologize if this post comes off as judgemental, it really isn't my intent. I just thought maybe talking to someone else with bpd might make me feel less alone. If this post is inappropriate please delete it. [info] None [info] 1493388580
krackle_wins [info] Question about bipolar 2 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a few years ago. After going though the regular routine of med cocktails I’ve settled on 200mg of lamictal, 10 mg of lexapro (down from 20, which I was on 20 for over 2 years), vraylar, quick-dissolve klonopin.I just had an absolute manic attack in which I decided to clean my entire apartment at 2:00am when I have a physical and blood work at 8am. I’ve been extremely stressed and overworked at work (network/telecom engineer), been having issues with my direct supervisor, while being friends with the director of operations (we even game together). What can be causing my first really bad manic episode in over 3 years and finally settling on a decent med mixture? I just saw my psychiatrist less than a week ago and I felt fine. Right now I’m freaking out over minor messy stuff, my apartment is immaculate but for some reason I can’t stand it and swear it’s a disaster. Please explain to me why this is suddenly happening again, I’m worried about another in-patient stay. I had more to explain but my mind is racing too fast to remember everything and get it down in this post.Edit: I’ve also been spending money like crazy lately. I’ve been working on rebuilding my credit and started a retirement fund (I’m only 33), but somehow my checking account is overdrawn which I also haven’t let happen in years.

CleanExpression [info] I’m not looking for posthumous fame or anything. I am writing for the story’s sake. It helps me feel better when I’m feeling low and it calms me down during manic episodes. Genre is realistic or literary fiction.I only care if somebody somewhere reads it and understands what I went through. I have one other published book, which I wrote after I was diagnosed with bipolar. I wrote it in an attempt to communicate how I feel through a short story about someone whose life is managed by an unpredictable and unpleasant force beyond her control, in the hopes that someone would resonate with my writing and find solace in it. Maybe it would even help them out of a rut. That’s what art is for in my opinion. The book I’m currently working on is more of a coming of age story. It’s very (and I mean REALLY) loosely based on a pretty traumatic event I went through in my mid teens (although there isn’t really a self-insert in it) that changed how I look at the world. my expectations are for its reception are low, but I hope somebody somewhere will find it entertaining or helpful or even say it has artistic merit. I don’t really care as long as I get the story down how I wanna tell it and there’s nothing left to say about it. I know that if I can do that it’ll speak volumes to people about what I live with everyday. It’s not just my experiences I wanna convey, its the reality of bipolar disorder. I’ve thought a lot about this, and there’s this quote from Virginia Woolf’s _To The Lighthouse_ that I think relates to this a lot. I debated even putting it in the back of certain editions of my first book:&gt; Now all the candles were lit up, and the faces on both sides of the table were brought nearer by the candle light, and composed, as they had not been in the twilight, into a party round a table, for the nightwas now shut off by panes of glass, which, far from giving any accurate view of the outside world, rippled it so strangely that here, inside the room, seemed to be order and dry land; there, outside, a reflection in which things waved and vanished, waterily.I want my writing to be like those candles.

Awkward_Dachsund [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 14, although it never quite felt "right" - I fit some criteria but not a majority of it, which led me to keep learning and looking other possible diagnoses. Well, one hospitalization later at 19, I started seei ng a different clinician and she diagnosed me with BPD, sayi ng I don't *quite* fit the criteria for bipolar.

rg1213 [info] Great and accurate observation of what it must be like to be crazy. I'm a pretty sane person, but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (pretty well treated now with meds) and let me tell you, when I'm not doing good, whether manic or depressed, stuff that's not real absolutely seems 100% real; there is no doubt in my mind that something irrational is true. Later I look back and am amazed that I felt that way. I believe that there is a lot of stigma right now associated with being mentally ill, with taking medication, seeking help, etc., and I hope over time people realize more and more that mental illness is a physical disease of the brain and treat it accordingly.

parisfrance137 [info] Was this my first "manic" episode? Hi everyone! I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder last summer and started taking Lamictal not long after being diagnosed. I did have to have my dosage upped a bit as the dosage I was on before just wasn't cutting it. I've noticed over the last couple weeks that I've begun to pick up on certain things that maybe I never noticed before. Sometimes I notice I'll get in these moods where I'll suddenly feel "giddy" or "excited" and feel like I have so much hope or drive. In these moments, I'll even feel so happy that I'll talk A LOT and may come across as hyper. Other times, like today, I'll feel irritated at everyone and depressed. I feel like I just want to cry. My husband asked me one day if when I get jittery if maybe I could have ADD, as he gets that way when his ADD goes off. I said no, that I believe I may be experiencing a manic episode and never realized it.&amp;#x200B;Has anyone else experienced symptoms like this before? [info] None [info] 1556040631
rlm1997 [info] What should I do with my life? I'm 20yrs old, but I feel like I'm 50. Reflecting on my life I remember getting the same look from all of my teachers and peers growing up, ever since I was a young child. Often times it was a wide eyed look, a look of shock, as if I were a crazy or something, and when people talked to me they wouldn't make direct eye contact with me. People still do those things, but I realize now that people do this because of the things that I say and because of the way I act. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15, recently my doctor said that it's moderate, but because I'm very intelligent I've never been hospitalized or anything because of it. This is something that perplexes me, because I always got b's and c's in middle and high school, so I never thought of myself as being really smart, but I'm in college now so apparently I am. I just feel like shit knowing that I'm so smart but have done so much stupid shit and acted like an idiot my whole life.It makes sense though, my family was and still is absolutely terrible. Growing up my parents yelled at each other at the top of their lungs almost every single day and it didn't matter to them when or where it was, in the middle of the night, in the morning, in public, at the grocery store, restaurant, it never failed that an argument would erupt for everyone around us to hear. Neither of them once said, "not in front of our son" or "let's not do this in public". They felt no shame, no embarrassment whatsoever, they couldn't have cared less. I remember getting home from school one day and seeing my mother crying saying, "Your dad just hit me in the private parts call the cops!" and my dad screaming at me "No don't call the fucking cops!!!". Things like that happened many times, and over the span of my entire adolescence. My mom finally broke up with my dad when I was eleven, but just a month later she got with a guy who likes to drink a lot and you know how that goes, and she's still with him. I never got a break. My two older siblings had a different father, and because of the way my dad acted they treated me like garbage and always stuck to themselves. And of course, because of my social akwardness, I got picked on at school by everyone, even the teachers.I'm 270lbs, I have adhd, bipolar disorder, no friends, no girlfriend, but I'm not depressed. I don't have any trouble getting up in the morning, I don't feel like I have no future, I feel optimistic. It's only because now I know that I'm intelligent that I feel obligated to move forward and accomplish great things.My mother and her boyfriend still argue and yell with each other almost every day  and her boyfriend still gets drunk and breaks things and yells in the middle of the night every other week. My grandmother is practically deaf and refuses to wear hearing aids, so whenever try to communicate with her you have to yell. Because she can't hear she sometimes interprets what we say as insults when they're not, and because of that her and my mother often get into very loud arguments almost every single day.I feel like nothing has changed in my life since I was a kid, it's both infuriating and depressing at the same time. Knowing just how much my family screwed me over and for how long they've been doing it pisses me off so bad. I try not to think about this but I just can't help it.I just came here to vent, but if anyone has any suggestions for me, please feel free to comment. [info] None [info] 1527721136

yuriopl [info] What do? Hello all,At my first psychiatrist appointment on March 6, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given a 7-day sample of 1.5 mg Vraylar.However, the psychiatrist was quite off-putting and basically threatened to put me in the hospital if my mom wasn’t there to monitor me 24/7, which is a problem because she is separating from my dad and lives on her own on the weekends. Basically, my mom is taking me to go to another psychiatrist, but the appointment she scheduled with the new one is not until the end of April (the 22nd). Because I’m “in-between” psychiatrists, I didn’t take the medication because the wait time is so long and the sample was for seven days. I honestly don’t think I can wait that long, last week was a good week, I felt really elevated and spent it basically dancing around my room,I even made plans to start writing a book.But this all began to deteriorate around Saturday, when I couldn’t even brush my teeth without crying for 15 minutes straight. Now I’m at school and can’t concentrate at all, I’m shaking and crying and am super behind on assignments, which is a problem since I’m in all IB or AP classes. I have 2 presentations, a research paper, a test etc all this week and I can barely function let alone do all these things. Since I’m still in between doctors, I don’t know how to go about getting an IEP or 504 plan since currently I don’t have a psychiatrist.I’m also experiencing visual and aural hallucinations, e.g seeing insects that aren’t there and hearing voices that aren’t there. Is there any way to speed up the wait time or cope with these symptoms until my next appointment? Or should I just go to the hospital? Thanks [info] Bipolar 1 [info] 1552919896
mackemerald [info] [Spoilers] "I've felt worse" and how that applies to real life So, I know a lot of people liked Lapis' line, "I've felt worse," and I wanted to talk on that just a little. Of course, it's funny and of course a lot of us feel it was a big mood. But I wanted to say that, this is one way I've essentially survived life. So, to be frank, my baby sibling died when I was a kid. Then as a teenager, I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I've been through other shit, too, but the point is - I've felt worse. And you've probably felt worse.Not only is that powerful for those of us who know it but if you have any kind of pain and trauma in your life, I'm here to tell you this line will get you through. It doesn't diminish your current pain but it reminds you of your own strength. You've felt worse so you know you can stand up to a fucking (metaphorical) diamond. I love that she said that. Lapis is strong. I'm strong. You're strong. So, I just wanted to point that out so that next time you feel absolutely terrible or you go through something awful, you'll remember. Let yourself feel your feelings but remember that you'll survive. You've got this. Inspiring post commenced. [info] peri is best gem [info] 1530928746

PhoZCalvin [info] Bipolar and unable to control my jealous habits. First time posting here... My name is Calvin and I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1 just recently, and have been misdiagnosed with things such as paranoid personality disorder, schizophrenia and other things in the past. During my first lasting relationship in the 8th grade, I started noticing a bit of a jealousy issue when my girlfriend and I were on the phone with my friend (who I knew my girlfriend found attractive) and while I was going to hang up she still wanted to talk to him... Which made me very nervous and suspicious. That relationship didn't go well due to those habits growing into more and more ridiculous things. Shirt is too low, she's trying to attract other guys. She hugs another guy, she wants him. She didn't exactly help me understand those issues.. However I never really accepted any help either. I was stuck in my beliefs. Many relationships were the same, one of them lasting 2 years with another bipolar girl and it was horribly toxic. The green eyes grew fierce. I hated the fact that my significant other would even find other people attractive. Even if they told me they didn't... The strangest things would bug me. I could never date someone who wasn't a virgin... It /killed/ me to hear that they have had sex before because I would constantly compare myself to them, no matter what she would say. I'm not even a virgin... I know it's horribly hypocritical to react that way. Even things like my girlfriend smoking cigarettes bothered me, because I saw it as a "bad girl thing" and that scared the shit out of me. I would never date a dirty girl. Her liking other guys photos on Facebook... Even if it was before we knew each other. "do you still find them attractive?" I'd ask. It's awful and I hate myself for even being like that. These things drive me absolute insane.. I've recently started medication, currently on 75 MG of lamictal and 40 MG of vyvanse. The girl I'm with now is wonderful... She's very supportive of me and loves me even with these issues. With her I've been the most stable... Relatively stable, that is. I still get very jealous. She's always told me she's not a dirty girl. I've been doing well at controlling my jealously (not stalking her Facebook mostly) but today didn't go so well.. I hadn't slept last night and felt like shit today. I told her about me refraining from stalking her Facebook, but she said "go ahead and look, I haven't done anything wrong, like usual" but the thing is, she doesn't have to do anything wrong for me to get jealous. I end up relapsing and browsing through.. Getting jealous, eventually leading me to going through her past statuses from years ago.. It ended up causing me to just look for as much as I can because it wasn't even hurting as much anymore. I came across a status that said "the amount of celebrities I would let have my body without second thought is insane" and immediately I panicked. Crying, shaking uncontrollably, doing everything I can to shove the thought out but again and again I'd hear it scream at me. I ended up burning my chest with a screwdriver, something I hadn't done in a while. I told her to come over to help me.. I explained I wasn't upset with her but I just needed help, but she said she didn't want to and that she no longer had any sympathy for me. It crushed me... She eventually did and not much was resolved.. I feel as if I have to push it away. Every time it crosses my mind, immediately I start flailing and shaking in a neurotic manner. I don't know how to deal with it... I have gotten better at understanding things that cause jealousy and brushing them off, but this is just too painful for me to even approach... I need to figure out what to do. I always have felt like my mind is such a scary place with so much forbidden ground. I'm afraid to even think in fear of thoughts I've repressed coming back.. The buzzing I hear as I shove it away is intense. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to prevent this from upsetting me and just realize that everything's okay... [info] None [info] 1397865251
yellowslashred [info] I can't say I've ever had to deal with anything even remotely close to this situation, in any of my relationships. I do know that that losing someone you love to circumstances beyond either of your control is awful though, and I'm sorry that this is something you have to go through.I will say this: I got out of a relationship that tore my heart apart in the end. I was pretty much dropped without a word, when I had put so much into being there for her. It was miserable. In addition to dealing the revelation that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I also had this failed relationship looming overhead. I emotionally shut down. I didn't talk to really anyone about it. I didn't... feel for a while. Things seemed kind of bleak.I spent no time trying to talk to or court other girls. I spent a lot of time with my friends, and had this sort of resentment about relationships, half due to the fact my heart was broken, half due to the fact at least half of my friends were in decent relationships. When I finally did give love a shot again, it was scary. The first girl I tried dating ended up catching on quick that I was becoming attached to her. We decided against dating because we were too good of friends, and she was a little emotionally unavailable. The next girl kind of pushed and pulled me away constantly, and I never knew where I stood with her. Eventually, it came to a head and I gave up on her.About three weeks later, I started seeing my current girlfriend, who I have been dating for four years now and plan on spending the rest of my life with.Love is confusing. Love is painful. Love is the most beautiful feeling in the world. Talk to this girl you love. Don't wait until the last minute to try and find closure or understanding. If things don't work out, it'll be okay. Things will be rough for a while, but you'll come out of it as a stronger and more knowledgeable person. Don't give up on love. Here's a [song for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEYWK5HQPf4). It might catch you in the feels, but it might help. [info] the devil and god are fidget spinning inside me [info] 1497860670
rightasrain0919 [info] Help Dating with Mental Illness I’ve been single for a few months. I’m considering getting back into the dating pool, but honestly it scares the hell out of me. While I was with my ex-boyfriend I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder II,  PTSD, and ADHD. It’s taken about two years to get everything under control with meds, therapy, and lifestyle changes. My personality is TOTALLY different now than what it was “before” and I have to maintain some routines in order to keep my mental health in check. I know that I’ll have to have “the talk” about my condition with any potential longer than short-term partner. I’m left with the feeling that, even though I want to share my life with a partner, that my life as it is and will be may be too much of a burden. I’m also afraid of the stigma surrounding less well-known mental illnesses like bipolar disorder. Many people think it’s the same thing as schizophrenia.Should I even try to start dating? Where should I start? What’s the appropriate time to have “the talk”? Please help me, kind internet strangers. [info] None [info] 1560022604
zkushlvn [info] I have this problem and it is by far my worst enemy.  Until I was diagnosed with bipolar I just thought I was a sex addict.  I mean come on, sex with random people, whether meeting them at a bar or online frequently.  I could not tell you the number of sexual partners I have had and I don't want to know.  Even medicated it is still something I struggle with and given my preferred sexual style (Dom/sub) it is even harder since it seems like a double ended sword for me of conquest and satisfaction through sex alone.  I always hated myself later on but could not and still cannot stop.  I have been somewhat successful lately but still I crave it.  While medicated I am able to keep to porn and just reading/fantasizing but it is still a thorn in the side I am unable to keep in check.  For resisting, if I can, I have a support person I can call.  My wife is amazing and I am able to talk to her about it.  It is weird to tell your wife you are craving sex and want to fuck each woman you see etc etc but being able to talk about it and know that she will relieve my issue later that day is such a weight off the shoulders.  I wish I could be more helpful for ideas but others have said what else works.  Channeling your energy to something else which takes time.  Mostly is writing my ideas down if I have nothing else.  It clears the mind, even if it is an hour session or just sexual babble that doesn't make sense but hey it kept me from cheating on my wife or fucking some random person.

RaptorGoRawr [info] My first semester in college I was you. I slept all the time, had no friends, and was failing EVERY class. I would leave my room, go get food to go from the cafeteria and come back to my room. I wanted zero interaction. I had no motivation to do anything, even showering was a chore. I told my parents.... the parents that had slaved away for years to give me everything they could, the ones who put themselves in debt for my private school tuition. You know what they did? They were confused and hurt at first but they helped me get help. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and insomnia. I went back the next semester, medicated, in therapy, and determined.   I discussed it with my RA who became an ear and an accountability partner.  She made sure I stayed med compliant, got to my appointments and connected me with some really great girls in my dorm who became great friends. Your RA is there to help you, let them!No matter what you chose to do about school, having your parents in your corner makes all the difference.  [info] None [info] 1368184048
lovingtype [info] Got diagnosed as bipolar but idk if I am My friend and I were talking and I mentioned how I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the past by a psychiatrist but didn’t believe that I have it since I have did so it’s kind of hard to know if some behaviors was bc we’re bipolar or it was an atler. I’m not rlly sure what a manic episode is or what its like to have it but I made a comment that in the past my previous host felt emotions very strongly where one time she dropped a cooking while crossing the street and got genuinely upset to where she screamed and wanted to cry and he said that sounds like we’re bipolar. When I hear about mania I see a lot of it is people talking about how they feel great in the moment but I cant rlly remember tht happening ourselves. Ive had times where I’ve became restless and started acting out doing a lot of risky things I shouldnt have and lashed out and felt super out of it and not myself but never had those moments I felt elated or rlly super happy so idk if those would rlly b a manic episode. I also remember there was a time where our prev host felt super on edge and like everyone was watching her or was out to get her. She was pretty out of touch and stopped going to school and even though rationally it didnt make any sense at all and people tried to explain that to her she’d just get upset because she knew they were right but she fully believed in it the same and didnt know how to stop. Eventually she came out of it a few months later but idk of thats an episode or trauma. Theres also times where I’ll rlly get into smthing like games to where I’ll focus on it soley and forget abt everything like eating and sleeping and my friend told me an episode can b like that but I think thats bc I'm autistic and I’m just super focused on the thing. So idk if I really am bipolar or not bc my therapist and I have never rlly talked abt it, maybe she did with the previous host but Ive been focused on a lot of other things in life but I think I wanna bring it up to her.

phoenixgriffin [info] They can move you to a different team when you go to uni. My experience was pretty good. I got referred to all kinds of people like individual therapy, art therapy (I had to pay for that), family therapy, and a dietician when my meds made me out on lots of weight.  Note I wasn’t seeing all these people all at the same time. I saw my early intervention team for three years and then they downgrade me to a different type of team after. They’re thinking about discharging me to the GP but I’m having none of that.

calculust_ [info] How does schizophrenia feel on light medication? I was diagnosed with bipolar II about a year ago. At that point, I didn’t know I was having psychotic symptoms like hearing voices because they never talked to me. I never told my doctor this because it went away when I started medication. Now, I think I was starting to develop schizophrenia and going on antipsychotics for the bipolar II stopped me from developing it further. However, I still have slight auditory hallucinations like I feel like I can hear electro magnetic waves or sometimes I hear music that isn’t playing. I am extremely paranoid and last night I stayed up until 4 in the morning because I was convinced there was a shadow man in my kitchen waiting for me to fall asleep so he could kill me with a dagger and telling anyone this was happening would make him do it while I was awake. I never actually saw him though. I also have depersonalization all the time like it never goes away. I’m told that my ideas are often told in ways that don’t make sense to the people around me and I have the feeling this isn’t the real world and it is actually a hell created just for me because I did something awful in a past life. When I see coincidences, I see them as glitches in the plan set out for my torture. I don’t think about this often unless I am in a very low mood which happens 2-3 days per week. I also have deja vu moments almost every day. There were other things going on before I was on medication too but I feel like this post is already too long. I was wondering if people who were on lighter doses of medication felt similar to how I’m feeling and if not, how do you feel? I’m going to see my therapist on Monday and I don’t want to ask him if I’m schizophrenic if I’m clearly not to people who know more about it than I do. Tl:dr I might have been misdiagnosed as bipolar so I’m on antipsychotics already. How does schizophrenia feel on lower doses of medication? [info] None [info] 1512567202

DrAnalBeads [info] Restart/new beginnings So this is gonna be a happy post. I derailed my life in my teens and did a  bunch of drugs instead of studying like a good boy, because i felt like the only person who cared about me (my mother), didn't care if I succeeded... there were many other reasons too, but i really don't want to go too deep here. Anyway I just passed my last exam for my year 12 equivalence with honours, which is something I never thought I'd live long enough to do (I'm 21), let alone be strong enough to do. I've been practicing mindfulness and I've been engaged in DBT for a while now and I can't express the difference it has made for me. Up until recently I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2, which felt like a life sentence. I feel like I've been given a second chance at success... and in a way i feel like I gave it to myself. Now I know my success is my responsibility! And I truly believe that with hard work I can achieve what I want to, and become the person I've always wanted to be. Thank you subreddit BPD... you helped me see i was not alone.

heathermlavoie [info] Don't lose hope. I was diagnosed with bipolar and brought up BPD with my psychiatrist, he said while I may have some symptoms of BPD, he didn't think I had it. So he's continuing to treat the bipolar with different medications (none have really worked so far) while I try to practice mindfulness and all that DBT kind of stuff on my own. I really recommend reading books on BPD and reading other people's experiences. It helps me feel less alone. In terms of relationships, they're going to be hard and painful, and trust will never come easy. I'm very sorry you're going through a breakup, letting go is always very hard for me. But you know you can be better, you said it yourself. Try to be mindful of what did and didn't work in the relationship so that you can grow from it.  [info] emotional rollercoaster [info] 1549299860

I've not really been taking my meds but wow I felt alive I even started questioning my diagnosis. I was outgoing, felt I looked good, friendly, talkative, responsible, creative etc I was the person I've always wanted to be the person that I used to strive to become through my alcoholism, except this time round I didn't have to drink to become that person... But it turns out it was just hypomania. I've been feeling quite shitty lately numb, having no will to live but also being to lazy to die lol. What can I do to get out of this depressive episode?

eilletane [info] Really like this question. You've started a very interesting conversation. Especially at this time when most of the working adults were raised by traditional and conservation parents.   &amp;nbsp;  For myself, I don't intend to have kids. And I do think this is due to my upbringing.   &amp;nbsp;  Quick life story:   Divorced parents, father was emotionally and physically abusive to my sister, my mom and me. Lived with my mother for most of my life. She's very calculative and paranoid. Being the younger and "surprise" child, I always had to work to get attention from my mom. Sis was book smart, I was street smart. But we all know that doesn't matter in Singapore.  &amp;nbsp;  Mother adopted some emotional and physical abuse parenting from dad. I was rebellious because I wanted attention and I was bad at school. Mom and I had a really abusive relationship till i was 17 when I was diagnosed with bipolar after a psychotic episode. After that, things calmed down a bit and we understood each other much more.  I moved out, with much reluctance from my mother. (Again another violent argument) and after things died down, everything soared real high up. We became friends.   &amp;nbsp;  On the other side is my elder sister. Brought up by the same parent, she was a very obedient and smart child. However, she never got to the rebellious stage, till she was an adult. And as of currently, her r/s with mom is quite terrible.   &amp;nbsp;  I'm grateful for all that has happened. It made me a better person. All that ugliness and violence bonded my mother and I in a way I never thought existed. However, I would never want that to ever happen between myself and my children.  [info] None [info] 1522668991
ErebosGR [info] Araragi mentioned that he went through a depressive period in middle school or earlier in high school IIRC. And he seems hypomanic in most of his encounters with the other female characters (talkativeness, distractibility, restlessness, disinhibition, euphoria, hypersexuality etc.).Senjougahara could have suffered from PTSD because of her sexual assault that subsequently could have triggered her eating disorder, but I didn't see any symptoms of PTSD in the present. What did you see that makes you say that?I'm not saying that all the characters fill all the criteria to be diagnosed properly, it's entertainment after all, but the parallels with almost every character are too many to ignore.Disclaimer: I'm not a psychologist, but I've been diagnosed with bipolar type II and I found Araragi's messiah complex very relatable instantly.

DrRobotniksMachine [info] When I was diagnosed with bpd I didn't think much of it because I didn't really know much about it. When I was diagnosed with bipolar I was devestated because that's what my abuser had. Through both of these diagnoses they tried to discuss a trauma diagnosis as well which I was not ready for. Then a few years later bipolar was scrapped and replaced with cptsd, which I feel satisfied with. I think people seek a diagnosis to validate their experiences but I think sometimes it can be detrimental. It's easy to read a pattern of behaviour on the Internet and adopt it as your own if you are impressionable. For example I self harmed a lot more after my bpd diagnosis because I realised it was an accepted action for people with bpd. [info] None [info] 1557356885
yege90 [info] Absolutely not. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and autism. I can't hold a job very long. I had to move back in with my mother which is very embarrassing for me. The worst part was that when I was in college I was also in the army reserves and loved it. I had my own place, a good amount of money. The bipolar disorder got the best of me and even though everything was going well I attempted suicide. After that the Army just cut me off. I told them about it and the response was "I don't care." A few weeks later I got a letter saying I was discharged. It crushed me. I never really recovered. I'm in and out of psych wards and on a bunch of different meds that are constantly being changed. I'm in VR but I lock up at every interview they get me. I'm in a lot of debt from my hospital bills, my collage loans and the army wanted my bonus back.I'm trying to see if I can get disability.

NoahPM [info] How well does a 3.65 transfer out of a CC? This is a hypothetical goal gpa, not what I have.  Seems feasible for me though and I'd shoot for even higher.  My highschool SAT was 1860 (not sure if that matters), and I plan to take as many of the 200-400 classes as possible.

warmgreenhatgirl [info] Mom, I have bipolar disorder and my delusions are hurting my marriage. Mom, I was just diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder and I've been trying my best to work though myself and realize what is a symptom and what is the "real" me. I'm waiting in medication because my doctor said I need genetic testing and I don't have the money for that right now, but I'm very willing and open to medicine.. I don't want to live like this.So, here's what I needed to talk to you about momma. Im having all sorts of delusions that relate to my husband and they HURT so bad, but I was hoping that if I wrote them down it would get better- that works for a little while, maybe two hours? Do you think that it would be okay for me to share what I wrote down with my husband so that I might have a chance of feeling better, because he would show me how wrong I am? My other worry is that it would just hurt his feelings to know what my mind has dreamed up concerning him. (I'm having paranoid delusions about him and a co-worker of his) and he would pull farther away from me than he did before we realized my illness and started to talk about stuff more.My illness isn't an excuse but a cause of these thoughts, and I've already wounded my husband emotionally and I feel terrible for it, but I'm trying my best to work though and get better- as much as I can while I wait on my medication anyway.

_AquaFractalyne_ [info] LSD has been studied in highly controlled clinical settings with professional psychiatric researchers. Doing LSD at your house is completely different (I'm speaking from experience). Psychedelics are not going to help you cure yourself, and it took me years to realize that self-medicating was only making things worse for me. 7 years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I never saw that coming!

HeathenMama541 [info] I can't comment on the bread so I'm going to reply to you directly. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar and medicated, my cycles were so drastic that it affected every aspect of my life. My job, my parenting, my relationship. I went on a very emotionally violent downward spiral over the summer and finally brought it all up to my psychiatrist who put me on 20 mg of celexa (citalopram) a day, and my life has been significantly better ever since. I'm calmer, more rational and level headed, and the paranoia has completely been eliminated from my psyche. I strongly suggest taking the steps towards medication. Mental health is just as important as physical health.

mbok_jamu [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and OCD in 2007, but the first time I went to psychiatrist was in 2005. I often faint at school and there were times when I was so angry, I slapped my friends for a very simple problem. My teacher sent a letter to my dad, asked him to take me to the doctor. So he took me to the doctor and the doctor said there must be something wrong with my heart, he says I've got lemah jantung and that's what makes me often faint. But when we went to a cardiologist, he says I'm fine and recommend me to visit a psychiatrist instead. My dad was confused, but we went to the psychiatrist anyway. I don't know what the doctor said at that time, I went with my dad, so the doctor told the diagnosis to my dad. They didn't tell me anything about it, but I remember my dad looks angry. On our way home, he told me he couldn't believe he just took his daughter to the psychiatrist and he says I'm an attention whore, I made up all these things just to get attention. It breaks my heart. I feel offended. I know there must be something wrong with me.My parents are conservative. For them, there is no such thing as mental disorder, if someone should be treated by a psychiatrist, then that person is crazy. Nggak ada yang namanya dateng ke psikiater cuma buat konsultasi doang, nggak ada yang namanya stress, depresi, atau apalah, kalo udah gila ya gila aja. They believe they raised me well, while in fact, they don't. My dad is an authoritarian, when he talks, no one can talk. Nggak ada yang namanya berpendapat, karena buat dia itu namanya membangkang. So that's why I always hide what I'm feeling inside. I was so quiet. There are so many things I wanna tell my parents that they're wrong, but I have no courage to say that. When I entered the university, I started to collect some money to go to the psychiatrist. Finally, I knew what's wrong with me. The doctor said I  have bipolar disorder and OCD. That's why I can't control my mood and anger, I also speak in repetitive form, I often repeat what I've said and done. I feel relieved. I have a disorder and it's not normal, but at least now I know how to deal with it.What you should do right now is find a person that you can trust, a person who will listen to anything you're saying, because I never had that person, I chose to keep it all in my head, until it explodes. Don't wait until you're explode. Find a help. [info] Neng, papa kamu tukang komputer ya? Muka Neng perlu diedit. [info] 1400823522
letitfckingsnow [info] Misdiagnosis with other mental illnesses? Has anyone been diagnosed with other mental illnesses and had to deal with the question of comorbidity, or whether it’s all due to PMDD? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 3 years ago. I’m obviously not asking for diagnostic advice because it would take forever to type out (and you’re not doctors), but essentially I’m looking back and my symptoms started right after I went on birth control — and though I didn’t track them exactly, I know a lot of my “episodes” would occur about a month apart. When I’ve been off that birth control, I still have PMDD symptoms, but it was like the pill exacerbated it. I’ve also been diagnosed with PMDD but never by someone who thought to discriminate between them, if that makes sense. I know now that I don’t react well to hormones (at least the wrong ones), but I’m doubting that I even have bipolar, as the meds and therapy really never helped me. I definitely experienced some bipolar-like symptoms but I don’t know if I have it independently of PMDD, if that makes sense. Has anyone dealt with something similar? What were your experiences?

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder going on almost a year now and slowly I noticed that I have these phases where I’m an asshole to people for a while, then really closed off, then really nice, then just super happy about life.

I've been getting my life together, and once I'm in a stable place, I plan to ditch them too.I've also had a friend tell me I might need ADD meds, but I've been putting off seeing my doctor so I don't have to explain why I went cold turkey on the citalopram without consulting him (yeah... whoops).Thanks for the offer, though!

Halloysite [info] Are you sure he is actually bipolar? Many people see "bipolar" and think it means "I have an angry side and a good side" and see their self-diagnosis as a reason to not do anything about being an asshole, or even play up the cruel asshole factor and whip out the "bipolar" excuse when people call them on it as if it clears them from any responsibility.

ginamoe167 [info] People like this never used to  other me, until I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. A lot of the time when I tell somebody about my bipolar disorder they say something along the lines of "I think i have that too, my moods are so up and down."No. Just fucking no. That's called being a human.Bipolar disorder does not mean you're moody, it doesn't mean that some times you're sad, and some times you're happy.I some times don't know what is real and what's not. I can go from so happy I try to kill myself to so depressed that I want to die more than anything in the world. I will intentionally cut people out of my life, for ridiculous reasons like they got a cat even though im allergic to cats.  I will tell my husband I want a divorce when honestly I just dont really want to spend time with him in the moment. I will see how much money we have for bills say yeah im going to pay them, and then just not pay them, instead go on shopping sprees, all the while knowing I wasn't supposed to spend that money but not giving a shit about the consequences. I have ended relationships because I got frustrated over something that had literally nothing to do with the other person. I will just not show up for work. I have gone through more jobs than I care to admit. I will go days without sleeping, and then weeks doing nothing but staying in bed. I struggle daily, even with medication, not knowing what thoughts are mine, and what thoughts are my mental disorder's. No, you don't have bipolar disorder because you have human emotions.

midnight9383 [info] I’m strong in that I don’t get angry. When I do, I use it to my advantage. TW: sexual abuse This is half rant, half proud of myself.I’ve had a rough life, in some ways. In other ways, not so much. I guess I’ve been through a lot, but I consider myself lucky and strong more than anything.Growing up was tough with autism. I had no friends. I couldn’t make friends. People thought I was weird or aloof. I felt like a freak, as someone who is self aware despite the autism. I still have numerous sensory issues—but I work in social jobs and am paying my way through college.My father was somewhat abusive. Definitely a narcissist. Emotionally you were never good enough. Physical abuse happened too on occasion. He cheated on my mother for 15 years  and gave her herpes. He dragged me up the stairs by my hair or beat me until my ass was blue as a kid. No matter what you did, you were always a failure.At age 11 an older guy started sexually abusing me. Happened til I was 13. When he committed suicide when I was 14, I felt nothing.At age 15 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I would disrupt class when hypomanic. As a female at age 15 of course I had a high sex drive but it would be to the point I had female “blue balls” for days on end. Other times I was so depressed I’d self harm and threaten suicide. The autism didn’t help. If I got upset or had a meltdown I’d bang my head against the wall or scratch up my face. I still have scars.When I was 19 I was raped. The trauma caused me to drop out of college. I didn’t tell a soul for three months. When I did, my parents basically told me i fucked up by dropping out. I’d have to pay my way through school now.At age 20 I had my first psychotic break. Since then I’ve been hospitalized once and in outpatient a few times.And yet... I’m still here. I’m not angry about my lot in life. Some people justify it by saying “others have it worse” and that is absolutely true. It could *always* be worse. That brings me no comfort however. I think, it could always get better.I never allowed myself to be angry for getting raped. I was sad, and numb. Until I realized, fuck, MY LIFE SUCKS AND IT ISNT FAIR. And I was pissed off for a few weeks. I mean, bloody pissed. This was three years after I was raped. Years after my dad was abusive. Years after I became “less socially awkward”. But I was ANGRY.Sometimes people use anger as an excuse. I’m angry—so I’ll drink myself to death, or hate others, or be an asshole. I used anger as spite. I will persevere. I will do well despite my trials. I will be level headed.Despite the times I scratched my face as a kid. Despite the times I was abused. Despite everything. I won’t dwell on it anymore.This is me letting go. [info] None [info] 1547055694
mostlygray [info] I don't recall.  I want to say .1mg but I could be way out of line. It was a minimal dose once a day ostensibly for bipolar (poor diagnosis).  I just don't get along with psychotropics.  Regular cold medicine makes me trip balls and gives me panic attacks.  When you're mis-diagnosed, the meds make everything worse.  Don't even get my started on Klonopin.  That one made me go damn near insane.I was diagnosed with bipolar because I was in a good mood at the time of the interview but complained of stress.

LadySerenity [info] In my freshman year of college, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and panic disorder. I immediately began the arduous process of trying different medications before finding the right one. Unfortunately, unless your side effects are really severe, you have to wait at least 3 months before you know for sure if the medication is a good fit. During the spring semester, I tried a new antidepressant. The stuff made me a fucking zombie. When I walked to class, it felt like my feet were cinderblocks and I had trouble starting awake in my classes. I was also constantly nauseous. Towards the end of the semester, my pre-Calc professor called me out in front of the entire class for how arrogant I was to skip the homework and try to take the exams anyway. He used me as an example of what not to do. I had a talk with him privately and mentioned that the Dean of Students was aware of my situation. He was mortified and publicly apologized the next day in class. I ultimately passed the class with a C, but damn did I want to drop his class.I took the next semester off and got myself sorted out. Once stable, I took Calculus and got an A. Even so, I still cringe when I remember that day in class. [info] None [info] 1559130682
joshman108 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar I but that diagnosis doesn't fit in the sense that my manic episodes are quite short, never more than minutes of extreme-ness (though a less extreme episode lasts much longer). Of course I wouldn't automatically discredit being bipolar for two reasons. The first of which is that it's nice to have an explanation for why you feel the way that you do. The second is that if you ARE bipolar then there is a real chance that having that understand would help mitigate some potentially dangerous choices you may otherwise make because you wouldn't be aware that anything unusual was happening in your body (which basically happens to every bipolar person until they gain a sense of awareness).

Drugs_are_awesome [info] Ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 ive been convinced sex hormones play a sizable role. Estradiol, testosterone, dht, shbg all of them have effects in the brain. High levels of DHT are known to increase glutamate which is what most BP drugs try to inhibit (ie lamictal). And estradiol is known to be neuroprotective which is why fewer women get degenerative brain diseases. Unfortunately no doctors test hormones in bipolar but I can say that going on TRT and having my hormones balanced has eliminated a lot of the symptoms. Are sex hormones the end all be all of bipolar? No. But I believe having them balanced can help a lot.  [info] None [info] 1548425631

brinkofhumor [info] Don't know if my Girlfriend cheated on me, need your opinion.  Okay, so this summer my gf was working as an intern in MA, while I was in ohio. One night she went out drinking (which im fine with) and sent me a text saying "Im so sorry, I fucked up, Im so sorry". She told me afterwords that it was just because seh got a little more drunk than she meant to. Fast Foward to a few weeks ago, wehere she told me that some guy tried to kiss her at same party. I was pretty upset, because she waited so long, but I told her you did the right thing for telling me. I foudn the guy on facebook, and sent him a "Your an asshole" message, and he sent one saying "Dude she kissed me back"So, I go kinda stir crazy. I know her facebook pw, and i know its wrong but I log in to see if there was anything said. I find her conversation with a friend, saying how she kissed him when she was drunk. I confront her with this, and she said she only told her that to make the story more dramatic, because the almost kiss kinda shook her off...I think thats bullshit, and that something happened, shes mad at me for not trusting her, and im mad at her for being deceptive.Edit-7:45 Got this on facebook, then we talked on the phone ...This summer, while we were on the outs with each other, Josh did show interest in me, but I refused him. While we eventually did hang out with each other, it didn’t turn into anything. What I told Jill was true. However, this is very different from what your other girlfriends did. I still love you, and don’t want to be with Josh, but I can’t be with you right now. Hanging out with him showed me that I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to be together. I just want to be independent. Your emotional ups and downs are, I believe, causing you to mistreat me. I don’t want to be with anyone else, but we can’t be together right now.

bostonstapler [info] I (25M) think I struggle with codependency I need some advice Hey all so I'll try to explain this as best as I can. I was diagnosed with bipolarism when I was 18. I didn't have a "bad" childhood, but I did have emotionally unavailable parents and I think because of the combination of things I have developed codependency in relationships. Looking back at all my past relationships I have started to notice a trend. I either completely ignore my partner or am not emotional with them at all and have struggles connecting with them despite their best efforts and how much they would do for me. Or on the flip side, I try to take care of them entirely, and just do everything in my power to make sure they're okay. I like to spend as much time as humanly possible with them and I get upset if they cant follow through with some of the stuff they had said. It's like I became instantly attached and I become super stressed out because I'm afraid they'll leave or that I'm not good enough.&amp;#x200B;Which brings us to now, I started dating a beautiful woman and have noticed that i've started these patterns. She's currently in rehab in recovery trying to get better for alcoholism which I am immensely proud of her for. But she has a son and soon she will be busy taking care of him and working. So I am worried that I might go full self destructive and become the absolute worst thing for her.&amp;#x200B;Is there any advice any of you can give me to help break my codependency cycle, and be the man that she deserves without breaking myself emotionally or mentally?

psilonox [info] Im not manic or depressed. What gives? A little back story: I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around the age of 20 and im 32 now. I have been prescribed tons of different types of medication and the only thing I thought worked was a combination of xanax and adderall (my comment history is mostly super cringe worthy manic rants.)I quit my extremely high dose of xanax about a year ago (it was hell and almost killed me.) I haven't been medication compliant for years but I decided to just stop taking all medication other than my medical marijuana. What's weird to me is I don't feel depressed and I have no symptoms of mania. I was diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenic type. I have no symptoms of schitzophrenia either.

EchoInTheRoom [info] Actually, I am 32. I worked a good job for 5 years and saved 0 dollars. I should also note I suffer from bipolar disorder. Spending money is one of those things that gives me immediate gratification. If I made $1800 I spent $2000. I wound up burying myself in a couple thousand dollars worth of debt. I have been back working and have saved a couple thousand dollars. But I've been working very, very hard on cleaning up my debt. It is a big life lesson. Now I can swipe my card without fear of it being declined. Creditors have all stopped harassing me for money. Learning how to save money and be financially responsible is one of the harder things I have ever done. Lately when I want to spend money I do something productive like putting gas in my tank or go get a $2 coffee. Money has always been a mystery as well, I never learned how to save, then once I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder things went REALLY downhill. I wish I could say I was 18, but no, I am not. A buddy of mine told me a couple weeks ago to look into NYAB. I didn't, then he again recommended it to me. Now I look forward to getting my paycheck and budgeting everything. I check NYAB daily and if I plan on going out to buy something I check my spending money envelope.

molly_bl00m [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II a little over a decade ago (I’m 27 now) and have been smoking dope for the past 3-4 years (with a whole year clean thrown in there from 2016 til this May). While the substances change, I’ve always had some sort of addiction since 15 (when I tried my first drug, which was meth yay). While I obviously still struggle a bit, and two fucked life events beyond my control are what finally pushed me toward heroin, I do feel like I am in a much better place now than I ever have been - partly due to the way medication has helped me since I found my angel of a doctor, but dope has also positively affected me in two ways I didn’t expect:At first, as you’ve mentioned, it killed the pain and made me feel OKAY, for once in my life. And feeling okay gave me the strength to quit my cycle of shitty jobs and finally go back to community college. I’m now about to finish my first semester at one of the best universities in the world studying something I have loved literally for as long as I can remember. But second, and most surprisingly to me, the negative aspects of use (from having to worry about avoiding withdrawal to hating being at the mercy of dealers to feeling shitty about being the junkie in the lives of everyone I love, etc etc) have shown me that not only do I actually love myself, but I love myself and my dreams even more than I love drugs. I can’t say I’ll never go back, but when I go home this weekend for winter break I am going to kick and come back to school in January a clean machine. Without dope, I wouldn’t have had that chemical confidence to start accomplishing my goals, and without dope I wouldn’t have experienced the depths of desperation and degradation that it’s put me through which have helped me realize that I deserve my full agency back - and that I want it more than I want that next ping pong ball of black.I know this probably sounds stupid and idealistic and whatever else, but I really don’t regret my dope use cuz I’m finally learning who I am and who I want to be.

Long story short, the 2 girls and I went to the mall today and had a great time. I want to remember this day forever, but I am paranoid that it will lose its luster and shine over time.Basically, how do you get rid of the fear of losing your memories?

ShinyNewAndroid [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar last month.  It's super irritating to hear people call any sort of change in mood being bipolar.  In fact, any time someone uses any mental illness as a descriptor for something obviously not that illness is really annoying.  Like, no, you're not OCD because you like to tidy up.

loudchar [info] No urge to buy since upping my meds So I slumped a little in January, got on a holy Grail search (dark lippie), but pushed it into planner supplies hard. Stickers and markers are even dumber IMHO. I had cut back my bipolar meds because something is making me sleepy, but the doc says that's not it, so I re-upped them and I have seriously had no urge to buy! Still scrolling but it's getting easier. I have been diagnosed with bipolar for about 3 years now and I'm a therapist, still coming to terms with that. I know how the bipolar mind works, once I feel good I'm like these can go! Nope. I need my meds. Hope this helps someone. I would rather take Lamictal 250 than ruin my finances over lipstick and washi tape [info] None [info] 1581356852
aboyhasn0name [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar, GAD and panic disorder. Lamictal + Xanax has been a winning combination for me lately. Just be careful with the Xanax, it can be a slippery slope. It makes me feel so "normal" and that can be addicting. So I try not to take it every day.Klonopin or Valium are slower acting benzos that stay in your system longer than Xanax. So the peaks and come down are gentler. Ativan would knock me on my ass, although I may have just had too high of a dose.May I ask why you rejected the idea of Xanax immediately?

ketothrowaway95 [info] Holy shit! When I was eating SAD, I couldn’t stay awake through an entire day, I couldn’t get my body out of bed in the morning. I was diagnosed with bipolar II as an adolescent and during my last semester I reached a point where my depressive spells would last much longer than they did before my weight gain. It was a vicious cycle of being addicted to sugar and carbs and using them to cope with feeling like shit. My first week of keto I woke up on my own before my alarm clock almost every day and I had so much energy it was hard to fall asleep. I’m more frequently manic than I am depressive now (4.5 months keto adapted with IF), and it’s so much better to have than energy and be able to channel it into school/art/exercise rather that not having the energy to do anything at all and coping with carbs/sugar. I wish I started keto last winter, I wouldn’t be retaking 2 classes if I had! I’ve heard of keto helping people with epilepsy as well. It’s so mind blowing how much better my life is now that I’m not making myself sick every day via the SAD Americans are indoctrinated with, and it pisses me off that there’s so much misinformation being spread about a WOE that’s helped me SO MUCH. After experiencing that change, I won’t eat any other way.  [info] None [info] 1534293298
BrokenDolly_TN [info] New Bipolar Diagnosis Yesterday I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by my physician and therapist on top of the list of other mental health issues I have. So far I have told my significant other, my close co-worker, and one stranger. It's been a normal 24hrs, I don't think I've come to terms with having bipolar yet it makes so much sense and explains why I am the way I am. The reality is that I won't fix this overnight. The reality is I have to take more medication. [info] None [info] 1503700399
Emilyram [info] I think my mom is a Nmom Recently I was diagnosed with bipolar and adhd. I told her my diagnosis and her reply was that it was her fault. I did tell her it probably runs in the family. She gets defensive and sticks to it's her fault no matter how I try reassure her she isn't directly at fault. a few weeks after that, we went out to get something to eat and something brings up mental health. So I try to explain to her what bipolar is with a video because maybe I didn't explain it right before. We listen to the 19 minute video in spanish so that she really understand it. Says she now understand and to stop attacking her with it. She feels bad as it is, she says. So I drop it and move on. A few days pass and she is watching her favorite show and bipolar is the subject. Turns out she completely ignored that 19 minute video we listened to a while ago.Other things I have looked for in my past to come to this conclusion. She ALWAYS has to be right. If she isn't she comes up with something that proves she is right. Nothing I say or do is right. I say something it's wrong but when someone else says the same exact thing it's correct. After the 19 minute video I showed her. She started talking about this one client who would always tell her all her issues. She always does this to everyone else. Wanted or not she tells you her all her problems with us. She is constantly talking bad about me when she thinks I can't hear her. It has caused problems for me with the rest of my family/relatives. I came out to her as trans 3 years ago and she started crying saying it was somehow her fault. I didn't have a room till I was 18 years old because she would always say yes to my older siblings. I have so many health issues that could have easily been treated and diagnosed but wasn't because we didn't have insurance. I have to be reminded every time family gets together that I wasn't planned. My dad was drunk and she didn't say no. So I was bored because of that. She tells me I'm lazy and to get a job yet relies on me to take care of her and drive her to appointments and her job on the weekends. She get mad when I have doctors appointments or other obligations.That is all I want to type. It's a longer list than this. I plan on going no contact with all of my family once I get back on my feet. I want to confirm this so I can start the healing process and not feel guilty about what I'm about to do.

mementomori4 [info] Isn't borderline personality disorder a different set of symptoms and behaviors altogether? As a teenager I was diagnosed with bipolar II and they considered the borderline diagnosis based on my insane self-injury and a couple other things. Now, I'm 28. I haven't had a depressive dip in years and I'm not sure if it's because I'm medicated or because I don't have bipolar after all. (I definitely don't have bpd.) It's actually really odd to realize that this diagnosis that I've had for 12 years, that is part of my identity, might not be accurate. It's good, but still very, very weird.

easyiris [info] I can almost empathise, especially with the Facebook thing.I haven't seen my biological father since I was three (also an alcoholic and bipolar but I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was in my late teens so I obviously don't judge). He wrote to me out of the blue when I was eighteen. We started emailing because I was too busy then to write back by post. Anyway, we've spoken on and off now for six years. I still haven't met him because I just don't feel ready to.One day, I had a friend request on Facebook from someone with no picture, no information, generic name. Accepted as I thought perhaps their profile was just very private. Seconds later, I get a message - it's my biological father, under a fake name. Promptly deleted him.I felt like it was a complete invasion of my privacy. He pretty much duped me, really. I kind of get how you might be feeling, there. Having your Mum add you to Facebook, which is probably a large part of your life - all your friends are on there, photos of you, statuses on what you've been up to and where you've been... I just think it's very invasive.Now, your Mum hasn't been in your life for a long time. She's missed out on a lot of key moments and she probably doesn't want to miss any more. She probably is very sorry and she probably did have her reasons. That's all great but it's not important right now.What's important right now is you. You are priority - she knows that. You're like a magical, super rare commodity that she needs a little piece of. YOU decide how much you give her an YOU decide when and how. Letters, emails, phone call, whatever.What's important is whether or not you feel comfortable with your estranged mother contacting you via Facebook. If I were you, I would (this is what I did with my father) make my profile incredibly private - nothing is visible to anyone, unless they are a friend all ready. I'd then give your Mother your email address and ask her to contact you via that from now on. You should make a new email address, don't give your normal email out.  I say this because my father also found my Twitter and started bringing up things I was talking about in a very creepy way. It made me feel incredibly uneasy. Also, sometimes, I would have had a shit day, would need to check my email for something and an email from him would be in my inbox. Sometimes I wouldn't want to read it straight away, you know? Sometimes, it would bring up more bad feeling and fuck up my day a bit more.Anyway. This is your life. It's up to you whether you're happy to email her, accept her on Facebook (I strongly advise you don't) or write each other letters. If you want to meet up with her, do so when you feel completely ready to. Don't let her guilt you into it. As I said, I've been talking to my father on and off for six years but I'm just not comfortable enough to meet him yet. And he nags all the time. It's pretty unbearable. Just keep the ball in your court and remember that there is no right or wrong way to go about things. Also, don't get your hopes up too much. I always imagined my biological father would be this amazing person (he went to the royal academy of music and RADA, was in the royal Shakespeare company) but he just wasn't. Unfortunately, he was an addict and he destroyed his life, throwing all of that away. I mean, the guy would have had everything. When we started speaking, he ended up being a manipulative, invasive, whiny man, via email and letters etc. It was pity story after pity story.There's a lot I could go into, emotionally, but it's not worth pounding out in one comment that will probably get buried. However, if you do read this, and you want some more personal advice, just ask. I understand how confused you probably are right now but I hope you realise that the ball is in your court. Don't allow yourself to be manipulated. Talk to her on your terms, if that's what you want to do, when you're ready, via a medium that you're most comfortable with.Sorry for the long post. I wish you lots of luck.Just wanted to add, after seeing a couple of comments - do not feel bad or sorry for your Mum because of the shit she did when she was unwell. As I said, I suffer from bipolar disorder and have done some crazy, completely horrible things. However, just because I can sometimes be unwell, doesn't mean it's an excuse for my behaviour. Sure, shit is hard but you forgive her and speak to her because YOU want to and not because she's bipolar and "didn't mean it". Doesn't matter what she did or didn't do - or what she may or may not do in the future - nor do the reasons for her behaviour matter. The damage has still been done. You do not forgive her because you feel sorry for her, you forgive her because you can genuinely make peace with her. Do it for you, not for her.I hope that makes sense. [info] None [info] 1348794179
macproafro [info] Farwell Bipolar Hey guys. This subreddit has more or less been a great place for me to seek advice and vent whenever I've been depressed or feeling down.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder three years ago and honestly my life has gotten worse and worse. For some reason the medication literally never helped. I always stayed the same depressed attention seeking loser and all the methods that I had been using to treat my bipolar disorder weren't working.  Anyway last Friday I had a severe panic attack.  My stomach, shoulders, back and head were absolutely killing me.  I felt like I was dying and if I wasn't going to die I definitely knew that I was going to kill myself. I didn't think that I was having a manic or depressive phase. I just immediately went to the hospital. After spending three days languishing in a room I was sent to a psych ward. And that's where the kicker came in.  I've been misdiagnosed. (I would just like to say my entire life would be different if I had been diagnosed properly so I am absolutely furious about this.) Instead of bipolar disorder I actually have borderline personality disorder.  I'm sure many of you are familiar with this mental illness. But basically the symptoms for Bipolar Disorder and BPD are almost always confused.  The kicker is that you actually get BPD when you've suffered significant childhood trauma and due to lack of love or affection as a child.  So basically my entire brain is fucked to hell because my parents didn't love me enough and consistent physically and emotionally abused me.  I have no idea how to feel about this. I don't know what to do. I'm just sad and angry and bummed and just really annoyed about the entire situation.  The fact that this could have all been prevented if my parents weren't shitty at parenting just bums me the fuck out.  On the good side this actually explains a lot of the problems and issues I've been grappling with.  On the bad side I still have a mental illness and I have to deal with it. So anyway I don't think I'll be posting in this subreddit anymore since I'm not actually bipolar. I'll probably find some kind of BPD community on another subreddit or something. Anyway thanks for all your love and support. Peace out. [info] None [info] 1517507919
shitjoesays [info] My ex committed suicide in front of me in September 2007. I didn't see your previous post (wasn't horribly active on reddit at the time), but I'd like to share my experience with you if you don't mind. Sorry in advance for the wall of text.I was a mess after. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around the same time, so I was put on medication. It made me numb. My mom said she didn't see her daughter anymore, I was a shell of my former self. I stopped going to church and stopped answering phone calls and text messages from my friends and family. I dropped out of school and pretty much fell off the face of the planet for a few months. I felt that his suicide was my fault (didn't help that he and a few of our mutual friends felt the same way). We'd been together for 2 1/2 years and had broken up only a few months before he committed suicide. I thought I was going to marry him, we'd started planning and everything. And he took that from me in the blink of an eye. He even told me when he called me to come over thay night that he wanted to talk about getting back together. I was (obviously) foolish enough to believe him, mostly because I was still in love with him. He used my feelings for him against me, much like he had for most of our relationship. He was never wrong, and I was never right. My feelings were regularly dismissed or even made fun of for the last year of our relationship. Our "friends" regularly told me I needed to back off and give him space. In hindsight I understand, but at the time I was just confused and upset. No, I wasn't perfect in our relationship (far from it actually), but he made me feel even more crazy than I actually was, and that wasn't okay. I tell you all this so you can understand what happened in the months after his suicide.I started using again in the days after his suicide to escape the reality of what I was feeling. It was much easier to just forget I even had emotions rather than actually deal with them. I checked myself into rehab (again) before I had to have my parents or roommates do it for me.I couldn't go to his funeral. His mom asked me to come but I just couldn't trust myself in that situation. Not to mention the fact that I had actually seen him die, had held him as the life left his body. It took three rather large police officers to pull me away from him. I kept telling myself that he was going to wake up, that the bullet hadn't actually gone in and he was just unconscious from the shock. I blacked out when I saw the coroner, and the next thing I remember is waking up in my old dealer's house three days later. I don't know how they even let me go, but apparently they did. For a solid year after I believed what he told me. It was my fault he committed suicide. It didn't matter that he was sleeping with not only both of my best friends, but his boyfriend as well. In the days after his suicide they found he was HIV positive. He came from an extremely religious family, and if they had found out they would have disowned him. To this day I don't know if his parents even know. I was lucky that he had told me he was saving himself for marriage so I wasn't exposed, but both of our friends and his boyfriend tested positive a few months after. I couldn't care less about our friends, they got everything they had coming to them. But his boyfriend was innocent.  He had no idea any of us even existed. And his life was dramatically altered because of my ex's selfishness.After that year, I suddenly got really angry. I would lash out at anyone I felt had disrespected me, and I did a complete 180 on how I felt about his suicide. I went from blaming myself to hating my ex. I truly believed that he could have changed his circumstances,  and therefore he was incredibly selfish for doing what he did. It wasn't until I met my now husband in May 2009 that I really started to heal, to forgive my ex. He was sick, and for whatever reason he couldn't reach out for the help he needed. And I didn't see the warning signs, no one did. He had just gotten a promotion at work and moved into a much nicer apartment in a better neighborhood. He hid it very well, and I was too wrapped up in my own head to even realize there was a problem. If you've made it this far, thank you. If not, I'll put a TL; DR at the end. I told you all this because I want you to realize you're not alone. And if you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to pm me.TL; DR my ex committed suicide right in front of me. In the days after his suicide I found out he was sleeping with three different people, two of them my former best friends. [info] None [info] 1430836482

acavaticus [info] Today was a good day, until... Until it wasn't. And there was no reason for it to stop being a good day - nothing happened to make it bad. It's like my brain got to a point where it simply wouldn't allow me to enjoy anything anymore. I had all the supplies and ideas I needed to be productive and useful, but I couldn't touch them.I'm diagnosed with bipolar II and am currently taking Ativan and Abilify, both of which are taken in the morning. I'd suggest that it's a situation with my meds, but it feels like I've always been like this - nights have always been the worst.Can anyone help me? I feel pathetic typing this right now, but this is the only place I feel comfortable letting myself initiate sharing this kind of stuff... [info] None [info] 1579580639
Celany [info] Yeeeeeeeeears of therapy. Seriously. First talk therapy, then CBT combined with talk therapy. Then more talk therapy. Most recently, talk therapy and doing The DBT Skills Workbook (found on amazon), because I figured hey, why the hell not?I am both hopeful and wary about the medical issue part. On one hand, hopeful because (like I keep saying) this is just *so* out of character for her, and a big part of my stress was trying to figure out why on earth my aunt would behave that way. OTOH, wary to pin things on mental health that aren't on mental health. And really, I'll probably never know 100% if it's mental health. And also, keeping full awareness that even if it is mental health, she doens't get a free pass. One of the hardest (but most helpful) things that I was told when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder was that I should never assume or even consider that having bipolar meant that special allowances should be made for my mood problems. I was told that I could always *ask* for extra help, but that I was not owed a smidgen of forgiveness or understanding, if I hurt someone. And that it was my responsibility, first and foremost, to work on keeping myself under control. For me, hearing that was the first step in holding not just myself, but everybody around me accountable for their own shit. So if my aunt sincerely apologizes, then fine, we can move on for this weekend. Though I will expect to talk to her or my mom at some point about how her moods seem to be going poorly now, and that she needs to look into that. If she can't do that, then...that sucks, but I'm not going to get myself hurt because someone else won't take care of their problems.All that said, it is heart-breaking. I know other people with family members who kept their mental illness in check for many years, but eventually, it got bad. It's scary to think I could lose another loved one due to mental illness going out of control. Scarier still to think that someday, I could be the person lost to mental illness. On that note, I think one of my errands on the way home is going to be to pick up some comforting chocolate. Today could use a little comfort.  [info] None [info] 1512173449
Itneedsmore_zazz [info] Stereotypes As a nurse I coordinate a lot of patient care. Today I received a phone call from a patient who requested a letter specifically stating but he doesn't have a serious mental illness like being bipolar or schizophrenic. My heart sank when I heard that. I have a full-time job, a house, a car, an associate's degree, and an awesome fulfilling social life. One of my best friends is also schizophrenic, she is also responsible with her diagnosis. She has a high-profile job, two Bachelor degrees and a master's degree. It is for this reason, why I'm always so hesitant to tell people that I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1. We are so often misconstrued in the media as well as having these negative stereotypes propagated Within our own local communities. I am proud that we've come so far, but it still hurts when I hear things like this. I have to remember that this isn't something that people can see, that most people understand, that most people don't experience in their lifetime until they come in contact with somebody at the very worst. I apologize for this being very long post, but I hope that at least a few of you can take solace in my experience and know that we are strong tribe. Everyday that we wake up and decide to face the world proves that we are strong. It's like having 50 lb weight always tight around your neck but we still keep going. [info] None [info] 1556165014
Interestedatheist [info] My PMS used to last two weeks, the week before my period and the week of my period. I was diagnosed with bipolar because it was so bad and I used to cycle between highs and lows so much, but I didn't make the connection to my period until I switched to a contraception that meant I didn't have periods. My moods have been completely stable ever since. Both high and low levels of sex hormones can cause emotional instability, just because hormone levels spike before your period, that doesn't mean that your lower hormone levels during your period wont affect your mood too.

beccaabrooke [info] Bipolar and birth control I am a 25 year old female and I doubt my weight is very important to this lol but I’m tiny. Anyways when I was younger I was diagnosed with bipolar and after trying different medications I got landed on lithium. So I’ll be honest I forget to take it sometimes and that’s my bad. The problem is I started on birth control pills for the first time and my doctor briefly asked about the lithium but didn’t say anything really about it. They put me on birth control and since then I have been bad. It’s been years since I felt out of control sadness or anger with debilitating panic attacks. I hate it and I’m miserable. My question is does birth control affect bipolar in anyway? It’s hard to tell if it’s from the pill or just a badness episode coming at a suspicious time. I don’t want to get off birth control because it stops my cramps completely but if it’s cramps or everyday of emotional hell I’ll take cramps lol. [info] This user has not yet been verified.

Kaniela420 [info] I've never been officially diagnosed with 1 or 2, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar 3 times by different Dr's and therapists. I can tell you though that I most definitely am more inclined to believe I am bipolar 1, as I experience auditory hallucinations at times, and some pretty ghastly psychosis experiences. But, I've never been hospitalized for it, and apparently a lot of folks read that in a description and believe that to be a pre-requisite for a diagnosis of bipolar 1.I think I'm just better at suppressing my actual thoughts and feelings when I know I have an audience that has the authority to lock me up against my wishes. Probably my misspent youth doing illegal shit and evading cops.  My depressive phases, quite the contrary to what most people describe with 1 and 2, are actually relatively short. I'd say on average maybe 1 to 2 weeks, although I have had a depressive episode last upwards of a year once or twice. My Mania, on the other hand, is frequent and has a mighty large reserve tank when the gas runs low. My longest manic episode I would say lasted more than a year. As I don't have much of a frame of reference for the depressive side, (besides loss of interest in hobbies/things I've enjoyed, staying in bed and staying in my sweats and not bathing for a week at a time, isolating myself from everyone I know and becoming quiet and distant), I'll give you a rundown of what mania/hypomania looks like, for me.It starts out; everything is fucking AWESOME! I have so much energy and I feel so good, I really need to get this house clean! Oh wow I finished the house in no time! You know what, I should really clean out my closet and get rid of a bunch of shit I don't wear.... You know what? I'm having such a great day, and it's so beautiful out, I should have a Corona! Wow this beer tastes good, I think I'll have 1 or 2 more. Hmm.... I have a pretty nice buzz going, but I really feel like having a shot. I'm gonna go for a drive to the next town over that has the only liquor store in the valley open on Sundays and bump some gangsta rap. Man it sucks being in such a celebratory mood and not having anyone to hang out with, I'm gonna start blowing up Facebook with funny commentary and trying to hit up all my long lost friends on chat! Oh my God I have such a great idea on how to effectively make our partnership with our global convergys reps more cohesive! And while I'm at it, I'm going to put a training together on how to use our engineering coverage maps, I guess that means I'll have to learn how to ACTUALLY be what I always claim to be on my resumes, "proficient" in PowerPoint! Fuck it, I'll figure it out, I'll just wing it! Oh shit only 2 hours before my husband gets home and he doesn't like it when I drink, I wonder if I have time to pop in to the bar around the corner and have a couple crown and cokes and make it back here before he gets home... I just want to socialize a little bit! Next morning, after blacking out and getting maaaaybe 3 hours of sleep. "Oh damn. I think I might still be a little drunk. How did I even make it to bed last night? Why is my husband sleeping on the couch? No time to deal with that dfamay, gotta get ready to go get dis bread!" *Spends a COPIOUS amount of time fixing hair and makeup and getting those wings JUST RIGHT. Takes forever picking out a necklace and boots to accessorize perfectly* "well shit. I'm 10 minutes late as usual. Where are my damn keys!?" *Gets to work, spends entire morning meeting interrupting everyone and trying to make sure I command the most attention and have a funny comment or anecdote for every single topic that is mentioned.* *Starts on PowerPoint for that great idea I had last night. "Oh you need me to help you work your follow-ups? Sure! Bring em on! Gosh our servicing partners have a lot of questions, but I absolutely can NOT leave any of them unanswered. But the more I answer them the more they private message me and only come to me with their questions... Oh well, this should help get me some recognition so I have some visibility for that promotion I always say I don't want..." Before long I am over extended and HIGHLY annoyed and snappy and bitchy with ANYONE that tries to transfer me a call, as if it's their fault I'm busy...Aaaah home after a long day, time to pick a fight with my husband and be annoyed by my son's existence. I need some alone time. I'm gonna go see if there's any leftover fun drugs I can crush and snort. God my life is so MUNDANE and eventless. You know what would make me feel better? Some retail therapy. I'm gonna buy a bunch of clothes online and then because I can't wait I'm gonna go to a local store and buy a cute new outfit! None of my clothes fit me anymore because I've already dropped a fuckton of weight because I'm manic, plus I just cleaned out my closet today, I've earned it! This goes on, and on, and ON, for days or weeks, my fuse gets shorter and shorter and I fucking RAGE and go mad hoss at the slightest inconvenience. Then, thanks to good ol lack of sleep and photo editing projects, I start hearing shit. "What is that sound? Why does it sound like 2 morning radio DJ's talking? I don't have the radio on... Why is it so muffled like I can't ever make out what they're actually saying??" Then, the visual fuckery comes into play. -ESPECIALLY- if I am home alone, which I fucking HATE being home alone as I am convinced that the bad man has been laying in wait, waiting for the opportunity for me to be alone so he can rape/murder me. Throw that in with the eye fuckery and the muffled voices of 2 dudes in another room... We've got ourselves a party! I once carried a 9mm throughout the house all night and all morning long, convinced that there were people in the house that were going to get me. I saw someone's glasses reflecting in the moonlight watching me from the park across the street... I even called the cops and made them patrol my house. Twice. My house is fucking tiny. With paper thin walls. I can't believe they didn't haul my ass off. The best one was my most recent psychosis though, where I became convinced that my hairline was receding and that it was caused by scalp ringworm I must have gotten from my son or our dog. I walked around the house, spraying the walls with bleach water, I thought the cobwebs were mold or some sort of fungus that wanted to collect my hair. The spiders in the shower were watching me in eager wait to collect my hair, I saw them eating it, or making a web with it, I wasn't sure which. The flies were working with them, it was a covert op where they would dive bomb me, snatch my hair and give it to the spiders, who would then in turn give it to the mold monsters. I wore a beanie inside at all times, to try to protect my hair. It went on for several days, and didn't stop until my husband came and collected me out of the front yard, where I was sitting, picking ringworm pebbles out of a beanie I had just pulled out of the dryer, refusing to go inside because I didn't want to lose any more of my hair... He had to walk me around and make me point out the things I was seeing, so that he could explain them away for me. THAT. was a real muthafucka of a psychosis. Worst one yet, though thus far I've only had about 4 major events since I was diagnosed. As I get older, my symptoms get worse, even with medication. My rage gets more severe, my fuse shorter, the flight of rapid fire ideas, becoming early overwhelmed, crippling fear of calling places for bills, Dr's appts, basically any grown up obligation. And the presence of those auditory hallucinations definitely grows more prevalent. And so, yeah.... That about sums it up... Sound anything like your thing? Lol [info] None [info] 1573310303
h4baine [info] You're not alone. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 18 and have been through some scary periods where meds didn't seem to be the right fit and it felt like it would never get better. It always does though. Sometimes it takes time to find the right meds for you but it does get better. You know when you need help and you're getting it. That's a huge step many people don't take.You said you were going to urgent care and I hope you have a good experience but know that not all family doctors have the best grip on psychiatry. If one of them says something stupid, it's not because of you. I've heard some ignorant ass comments from general practitioners, don't let their ignorance derail you if that happens.It gets better but it's okay to have days when things aren't okay. It's normal and it's important to know when you're in that so you can reach out for help. [info] None [info] 1509395761
peaceey [info] I don't know about your specific diagnosis, but I can share my experience. I took `shrooms before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and got really paranoid.

Including my last relationship which ended 3 years ago.Up until a year ago, I never really had an answers, and just thought I was “an emotional person”But then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it felt awful.Now, after my diagnosis I often wonder what’s what.

celolex [info] I don't like saying this on my main account (because, as you've admitted, there's a lot of stigma) but I was diagnosed with bipolar two weeks ago. The stigma is one of the most difficult things to grapple with. I'm afraid to tell friends because I'm worried they'll cut me out of their lives if they know.  It's important to remember that bipolar manifests in many different ways, and your experience with one person is not indicative of everyone with the condition. Additionally, while she obviously caused you significant emotional distress, this girl in no way "totally ruined" your life – certainly not to the degree that she's ruining her own.

iamthe_girl [info] Good for you, for kicking the drugs! Street drugs (sans marijuana), when paired with bipolar just makes your symptoms worse. Self-medicating is EXTREMELY normal, however. All you want is to escape the madness inside your brain, I get that. The flip side to that, is to develop a routine like you have! I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago, and was recently diagnosed with schizoaffected disorder: bipolar type. For years, I self-medicated with meth, coke, acid, etc. Once I got on the right meds as a young adult, my drug habits changed. And now that I am older, I try to have routines too. If I don't stick to my routines, I feel "off" and depressed. I find myself feeling like a loser, and incapable of daily activities. In short, I absolutely think you are on the right track in having a routine. The routine keeps your mind healthy and functioning. Keep up the great work!  [info] None [info] 1510496472
balletboot [info] Were you immediately diagnosed with it? Or were you given another diagnosis first? How old were you?Has DBT actually helped? Any other therapies, medications?What stigma have you faced?Long story short, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 16 and told that I may have BPD but that they didn't want to diagnose me with it until I was older because of the stigma. I'm 18 now and terrified to go to a therapist because I know the symptoms I have are characteristic of BPD far more than bipolar, and I'm scared that it won't help and then I'll have that on record.

littlehoneypossum [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar at the beginning of the year and I definitely recommend seeing a doctor about it! Even if you don't get on medication or anything like that, it's nice to know what is actually going on up there and with a diagnosis you can be given access to a registered nurse who can help you with therapy and medication (if you choose to take it). After a few months of mania and no sleep I remember taking seroquel for the first time and being like "ohhh... being tired feels... nice". I'm not on it anymore but I still think the diagnosis and the nurse are both helpful in my everyday life. PM if you wanna discuss more! [info] None [info] 1572566883

My commander moved me to a work center outside of the SCIF until it was clear that I was stable and my meds were working, but they didn't revoke my clearance. Even if they had, there isn't anything in the Air Force more important than not being suicidal. He's nether the first nor will he be the last to be severely affected by events downrange.

admiral_snugglebutt [info] What's it like to have ADHD and Bipolar? I know for sure that I have ADHD, I've had that diagnosis confirmed every time I get it in my head to start seeing a professional about it again. It affects my life regularly. Buuuut I also think I might be having a hypomanic episode.  I've been full of energy the last few days, wide awake well into the night.  Today I was so full of energy it felt like my chest would explode.  My pain from my connective tissue disorder, which had been at like a 5, abruptly went to 0 despite me doing nothing to treat it.  Also I had a 3 hour long internet binge I literally could not tear myself away from, and I spent a bunch of money on shit I don't need. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was in college, but I thought it was a mistake.  I didn't feel like I have the mood swings she described. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if maybe I should try to treat my bipolar and if that would help the ADHD.  My executive function skills have been absolute GARBAGE the last few days. Would love it if bipolar meds helped that. TL;DR - I think I'm having a hypomanic episode and I don't know why, and it's scary and weird. But also I feel physically amazing so that's nice. Trying to figure out how it intersects with ADHD. [info] None [info] 1575794885
moosiemae [info] For a while I used to think that I was only as sick as I wanted to be - when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, the one thing my therapist kept coming back to was the fact that I seemed to blame it on myself. Whenever I felt a particular extreme on one end of the spectrum or the other, a little part of me would look back on that incident and kinda scold myself for "acting crazy". I genuinely believed that all of it was in some way rooted in how I wanted to behave.Thankfully, I have learned these past few years to get over the prejudice I had against my own illness. When I start acting manic, or when things are really bad on the depressive end of the spectrum and I can barely function, I know that's not me. It's my illness.  [info] None [info] 1501217191
obscureengineer [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar, I would obsess over projects and ignore my responsibilities while manic. When I was 16, I was working on a large anamatronic that was meant to be designed, built and coded by many people, by myself. I let other aspects of my life fail because I thought it was the only thing that mattered. My downfall was my lack of coding experience and stubbornness, and the anamatronic never came through before competition.

Anxietyfuckedmeup [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and began Ability which did nothing for me. Then I went on to take seroquel which improved my stability with the trade off of making me quite tired and lethargic because I needed quite a high dose. I have since been put on trileptal as well as a low dose of seroquel. Long story short, seroquel high dose made me a zombie but made me not go back to the hospital. Lower dose is great for me.

axon-axoff [info] I agree that OP may want to see a therapist/psychiatrist. I have always done the same thing, alternating between avoidance and hyper-productivity. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in my late teens but mood-stabilizing meds didn’t improve my quality of life on their own. More recently I was diagnosed with ADHD and a combo of low-dose mood stabilizers and ADHD medication (in addition to DBT once a week with a therapist I like) work for me. “Hyperfocus” is actually a characteristic of some varieties of ADHD. There’s so much overlap in definitions of mental conditions, the only thing that really matters is finding medication and therapy (I really believe in both) that work for you, not the label.

kelseyroundtherosie [info] First post on r/loseit 28 pounds down! I’m actually a little anxious to post, but I’ve been lurking since I started my weight loss journey and promised myself I’d post at 25 lbs down but talked myself out of it, but I know I needed to post or I never would’ve worked up the nerve so here it goes.Female/23/5’7.5Start date: November 1stStart weight: 248Current Weight: 220Goal weight: 165&gt;A little about me and my weight; growing up I was in the upper normal weight range, muscular but with hips and bust. I did sports but always had an extra little bit of fat you know? Normal.  I reached full height early along with the majority of the rest of my body devolvement. Then at 13 I was diagnosed with bipolar and shit kinda hit the fan. Meds were a huge weight disturbance. My smallest I was age 13-14, I was still swimming competitively at the time and I was 145 pretty much all muscle do to initial nausea with med intake and adderall-like medication I was put on at the time. My largest I was 16-17 inactive and mostly house bound at 280+. Every new med change brought a weight change. Gains or losses of 20 pounds were not uncommon. Some as dramatic as 30-40 in less than 4 months. I have been on more than 30 different med combinations. I own 3 sets of clothes: pants range from 14-16, 18-20 and 20-24. I had no control over my weight and for a long time no desire or motivation to workout. It wasn’t until the last year or so I got my illness under enough control to begin considering doing something about it, but the med changes still caused wild swings, mostly because I was going through withdrawals.This October I was down to my last lithium reduction and I told myself I needed to get healthy if I wanted to continue without meds. I was going out dancing and took a picture, weighed myself and said once I’d finish I’d start.November 1st was the first day I didn’t take any pills and the first day I set goals and started my journey. I have lost majority of my muscle mass, I want to climb stairs, dance, and run without getting winded. I want a healthy BMI, I’ve got living stuff to do now man and everything is easier with a normal weight. I want to be able to manage my moods, food and exercise are my pills now.I have minimum workouts 4x a week I do for an hour. Along with walks and dancing with headphones I’m slowly but surely rebuilding muscle mass.As for diet I don’t really count calories, it was mostly just educating myself. How many fruits and vegetables I was really supposed to eat a day and how much protein I actually needed. I keep grains to a minimum and only eat sugars when I really want a treat. Alcohol is now something I consider a desert. 3 servings of my veggies are almost always raw a day.All of this is going well but I’m honestly in uncharted territory. I’ve never really tried losing weight before and not sure what to expect as more weight comes off.  Will I have trouble dropping weight as I lose more this way?Sorry for the long post, but thanks for reading. [info]   [info] 1513994404
blackbird_girl [info] Oh god, thank you. I'm so glad I found your post on r/happy. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well and was dealing with mental health issues since I was 13. I was the perpetual honor student, achiever of the family, until I wasn't able to go to school or focus on my studies anymore because of my mind and other students' bullying. One of my teachers was especially harsh, saying to the whole class that if we're to go on with what we're doing (absences, low grades), then we better not go to college as we'll only be a burden to our parents. Everyone knows that she was talking about me. She repeatedly humiliated me in class in subtle ways. It was crushing, being golden girl to garbage.Fast forward and I've dropped out of college twice, never finishing a semester. Most of my classmates already graduated from college, which is the ultimate goal where I'm from. I almost started believing that my teacher's right. Now, I'm about to start my second year in college (FINALLY, YAY!) studying something I love and slightly back to achiever status, but with a lot of struggles. Mental health treatment is expensive so I've been on and off of it, and I usually feel like I'll never get out of the cycle. So high up then crashing to the pits of hell. But seeing other people with bipolar disorder overcome and live life fully (Carrie Fisher, for example, RIP) really made me hope that I can, too. I root for them so much. And when those who know about me ask about famous people with bipolar, I usually say Demi Lovato, as people my age know her.Demi said that "it IS possible." It's been a tough few days with school stress and other life issues that the news about her really shook me. I found myself asking Demi (in my mind) to please tell me that it IS still possible. Even when bipolar turns me into someone I wouldn't want to be.You, mister, just told me that it IS possible. You don't know how much I needed this. I thank you so much for that.Love and light to you, bipolar brother!  [info] None [info] 1532707531
thetrees_savedme [info] Thanks for the advice. I told my therapist about it once, after that I stopped seeing her. It made me immensely uncomfortable to have even mentioned it and being a woman talking to another woman about it really disturbed me. Idk :/  I've told myself that maybe when my aunt dies I will be able to tell my family, I wouldn't even know how to begin that kind of a conversation.

AmyB848484 [info] I've been in your situation. I also take meds for bipolar that I can't stop because I'd be a danger to myself if I do. I had a similar situation where the guy disappeared and I wasn't working, and I didn't want to become a burden to my family. I was afraid I'd regret it for the rest of my life. I was raised to believe it was murder. When I had the procedure done, all I felt was a sense of relief. A few years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and if I had a child, there's no way I'd be mentally or financially stable enough to take care of it. The guy who was the father, I thought he'd disappeared because he wanted nothing to do with the baby, but he had gotten arrested and locked up in another state and had tried to contact me. He was upset about the abortion, but he just ended up going to prison and lost all the money he had fighting the case. So if I'd had that baby, I would have been on my own financially and dealing with the prison system 1000 miles away. I have no regrets. I dodged a major bullet. I'm unable to work due to my condition, and I would have been trying to raise a child when my symptoms started, and probably would have ended up losing custody due to my mental illness. It would have been cruel to bring a child into such a situation. I would definitely do it again (if I had it to do over again, I never would have been with that loser in the first place, but if I couldn't take that back, I'd definitely have the procedure again)   I wish you the best in whatever you do. Don't feel any guilt about doing what you have to do. As a fellow bipolar sufferer, raising a baby is a stress that you just shouldn't bring on yourself unless you 100% want to do it with all your heart. I also don't want children because mental illness runs in my family and I don't want to bring anyone into the world who might have my bipolar genes, because I don't wish this on anyone.

EleanorRigby96 [info] Wondering if I should tell my dad Hi, everyone. So, I was diagnosed with bipolar I about 2 months ago. I'm seeing a therapist, and working on getting in to see a psychiatrist to start meds.What I'm wondering is if I should tell my dad. We have a mostly ok, but difficult relationship. My brother has borderline personality disorder, and while my dad always told me that my mother was bipolar, several years ago I overheard him telling a few of his friends that she was actually schizophrenic (he'd definitely lie to me about her diagnosis, but would tell his friends the truth). My mother was horrible to him when they were married (she pulled knives on him, purposely crashed her car into our car port, cheated on him a lot, etc.). Because of her illness/behavior, he had to deal with having her committed and her being in and out of rehab (she was an alcoholic and drug addict as well) a few times. With my brother having his condition, he's  been a lot to handle over the years as well. I guess I'm worried that my dad won't react well to hearing that yet another person in the family has a mental illness, especially since my brother attempted suicide less than a year ago. Should I tell my dad? If so, should it wait for a while until things with my brother settle down a bit? How does one decide whether or not they should tell certain people about this stuff?

Ramen8ion [info] Tired of seeking help and meeting dead ends I’m really angry basically. I feel so lost and stuck in the system, just to make it clear, I live in the UK. I was diagnosed with bipolar for almost 10 years now (first mood disorder NOS cuz I was a minor, then bipolar at 18). I’ve been hospitalised many times as are most people with bipolar and my last admission was jan 2016 after almost 6 months of being hypomanic and unaware, it turned into a horrible mixed episode where I was wandering the streets confused and unaware. That’s when I had insurance through my uni scholarship and went into a private psychiatrist hospital. I don’t have insurance anymore, I started reducing my meds because they affected my health so badly and my mood started going all over the place, spent the past months at home never leaving and feeling extremely suicidal, I have planned detailed plans so many times. I have barely any support from anyone and feel lonely in this struggle.I finally got the courage to speak to the NHS GP so I could access help and see what I could do about this. I had an appointment with a mental health nurse after waiting months and explained what’s been going on. The nurse kept trying to downplay everything ‘so just a little depressed? You haven’t actually killed your self?’In the end i just get a letter in the post saying he spoke to a psychiatrist and this was his recommendation:1) stay off meds and ‘apply therapeutic methods you learnt in the past’2) if u feel worse take a low dose of anti depressants.What the actual fuck. ANTI DEPRESSANTS triggered my first manic episode. You are not meant to take them alone. I’m completely unmedicated and have been of high risk for so long. Without any access to healthcare as a person with a serious diagnosis, and this is  the only medical advice I’m receiving.It makes me feel what’s the point. Like I keep hitting brick walls. As if it’s not bad enough to deal with this condition sometimes. It’s like they want you dead to get rid of you sometimes. The anger in me is not even normal right now, I’m just so so angry and I have every right to be. What do I even do. [info] None [info] 1559700511
mickcube [info] i know it's not news that kanye doesn't know how to talk but pitchfork printed this transcript and it's incredible how similar it is to how trump speaks&gt; At one point, West discussed why he wears a MAGA hat:&gt; &gt; This hat, it gives me power in a way. My dad and my mom separated, so I didn’t have a lot of male energy in my home. And, also, I’m married to a family that, you know, not a lot of male energy going on. It’s beautiful, though! I love Hillary. I love everyone. But the campaign “I’m With Her” just didn’t make me feel—as a guy that didn’t get to see my dad all the time, a guy that could play catch with his son—it was something about when I put this hat on it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman.&gt; &gt; Later, he discussed the 13th Amendment, which segued into West talking about bipolar disorder:&gt; &gt; I did say “abolish” with the hat because, why would you keep something around that’s a trapdoor? If you’re building a floor, the Constitution is the base of our industry—of our country, of our company—would you build a trapdoor that if you mess up and you accidentally something happens and you fall and end up next to the Unabomber, you gotta remove all that trapdoor out of the relationship.&gt; &gt; The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment—and I think the way the universe works, it’s perfect. We don’t have 13th floors, do we? The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn’t look like the people they were amending. Also, at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read. Or African-Americans to read. And so that meant that if you actually read the amendment, you’d get locked up and turned to a slave! Again. So, what I think is we don’t need sentences, we need pardons.&gt; &gt; I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. He looked at my brain. It’s equal on three parts. I’m gonna go ahead and drop some bombs for you: 98th percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings when it was counting numbers backwards, so I’m gonna work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent. Tesla. Freud. So, he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar. I had sleep deprivation, which can cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name. So all this power that I got—and I’m taking my son to the Sox game and all that—I wouldn’t be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage. [info]  [info] 1539283597

D4DDYL0NGLEGGS [info] Why isn’t weed legal? I was diagnosed with bipolar II in 2010 while on a stent in rehab for trying to kill myself by taking a 90 day prescription of Ativan. Thank god for my mother that’s all I will say about that. While in rehab they had me taking Depakote, Seroquel, Wellbutrin, Trazadone, and a host of other things. I hated it. I felt like a zombie. So when they released me I took my treatment into my own hands and started smoking pot. Flash forward 9 years and I have been a medicinal smoker, everyday,  as needed. It has helped me out tremendously! I have kept a stable job, have a car that is now paid off,  kept a roof over my head, and am engaged to be married. All of which would have been impossible if I wasn’t self medicating and staying away from the hard shit (pre-rehab I would do whatever you set in front of me). I recently applied for a job as an outdoor instructor at a summer camp working with under privileged kids. A drug test is mandatory and as such I have quit smoking. I feel like I want to blow my brains out. I’m not sleeping or eating, my fiancé is ready to murder me because of my mood swings, seriously I’m absolutely miserable. I’m ready to give up on this opportunity which I don’t need to do because this is the foot I want into the outdoor industry. The easy solution would be go see a doctor get back on the pills and deal with being a zombie. Unfortunately being unemployed that is not an option for me. It’s just too damn expensive. What can I do to alleviate this pain? What have you guys done? I’m tired of laying in bed all day like a lump on a log feeling sorry for myself. I’m tired of making my fiancé miserable, she is a saint and doesn’t deserve it. Please help, cause my alternative can’t even be considered an option. [info] None [info] 1557765586
jacfearsome [info] I've found it is important to judge and analyze the person you plan to tell.  Practice telling them other secrets and see if others find out.  If the can't keep your confidence with small things, you certainly can't trust them with big things.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 4 years ago and have since then learned how to tell people.  I have slowly created a circle of friends that allow me to reveal my "crazy" (not the best word) self and not scare them away or get hurt by them.  From what I've seen people generally have a couple responses.1. They acknowledge it and are polite/nice to your face but then badmouth you to others.2. They acknowledge it and are polite/nice but then judge you or look down on you.3. They understand that they don't understand and listen with an open mind, and are gracious.

bathroomspaceman [info] Tracy reminds me so much of myself it's crazy. I was diagnosed with bipolar II three years ago and before I learned how to handle it better, I was always doing shit like this. Cutting off friends for no reason other than the fact that it felt appropriate. Deleting social media accounts, recreating them, deleting them again. I even had my number changed so nobody could contact me. I frequently dropped hobbies and picked them back up weeks or months later. Not to mention using substances to cope and having very real suicidal thoughts. All I can say is that I feel for Tracy. People who are downplaying this like "ThIs iS jUsT hOw He iS" really don't realize what they're doing by disregarding his clear mental illness. I hope he gets help soon. Bipolar really fucking sucks, and in my experience, making posts like this really is a cry for help.  [info] None [info] 1549500636
__sortof [info] Am I disabled? Hi /r/BipolarReddit, long time no see. I've been pretty well, so I haven't been coming around much.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 10 years ago. I wasn't all that compliant with my treatment until about 5 years ago, when I overcame my marijuana addiction and started getting my life under control. I was rediagnosed bipolar I from bipolar II, I revamped all my meds, started in on weekly group therapy then graduated to weekly individual therapy. I'd been working at Starbucks the whole time, but last September I started back in school, and things have been great. I haven't had a major episode in over a year. Sometimes I still get very sad and a little suicidal, and there's some intrusive thoughts here and there with some paranoia/psychotic delusions, but I have a 4.0 GPA!The thing is though, to pay for my weekly therapy and my medication, I need to maintain 20 hours a week at Starbucks to  be health benefits eligible. I've been juggling school with work since September, and clearly I am capable of doing that. But I'm starting to plan for September, and as part of my program I have to do a placement of 10 hours a week while still maintaining a full time course load, and reddit, I just don't know that this is a good idea. Since September I've been tired all the time, and I have no doubt the psychosis-lite comes on when I am stressed from having 3 papers due in the course of a week while still having to work 20 hours a week while having to go to class while having to go to therapy while having to maintain a social life while having to get exercise while having to cook right so I don't get ill etc etc etc. It seems to me a recipe for relapse. And TBH I'm secretly convinced that I've just been in an extended hypomanic state since September.I have a couple of friends who've been telling me for years that I should just apply for disability. I am in Ontario, Canada, where I can apply for a bursary for students with permanent disabilities which can pay for services including therapy. Then I could ease off on my hours at Starbucks and still maintain my treatment.But honestly, I don't feel "disabled." I'm working 20 hours a week and maintaining a 4.0 GPA on a full course load. This, it seems to me, is more than fully able people do. I don't think anyone would consider me disabled either, despite my long track record of being in treatment.I was just hoping to hear some discussion around the word "disabled," its relationship to bipolar disorder, what it means to be given that title by governing agencies, how you feel about the word, the relationship between disability and capability, and whatever else you have to say about the topic!Also, I just wanted to say while I'm here that this community gave me so much support when I really needed it, and I am glad it's still an awesome community full of amazing people.

UmbraNyx [info] I think I might have some form of epilepsy. Starting when I was 19, I would occasionally have episodes where time would slow down, everything felt unreal, and I could barely move or speak. Like, I couldn't physically make myself do it, even if I wanted to. I would also get vivid images and sounds in my head, sort of like a daydream, but far more intense and out of my control.I got a sleep-deprived EEG that turned up nothing. Later I spoke with a psychiatrist who thought they might be dissociative episodes. I was in a very dark period in my life, so it's not out of the question.A few years later I was diagnosed with bipolar II, and the medication I was prescribed for it is also used to treat epilepsy. I haven't had an episode since. It could be that my improved mental state meant that I stopped dissociating, but I'll probably never know for sure. [info] None [info] 1566066054
caramel_kiss [info] Um okay, do you have a medical degree? Because the professionals I've spoken to with medical degrees have said psychosis is a symptom of bipolar. I'm bipolar, I am diagnosed with bipolar with psychotic features which is a real disorder. Psychosis is not a bad thing, so why are you so strongly rejecting the notion that bipolar people are psychotic? A lot of us are, it's just another medical symptom. It's like seizures, and epileptic people are also barred from many jobs because there's too much stimulus. [info] None [info] 1571114609

NoCreativeInput [info] Hey, I have bpd and borderline. I was diagnosed with bipolar, 6 years ago, when I was 22. Bipolar used to run my life. I was constantly on am emotional roller coaster, going from happy to depressed and constantly having suicidal ideation.Now the focus in my life is how to treat my bpd symptoms as I have really bad fears of abandonment and I have started cutting. I am also on lamictal, I used to be on saphris. My life has drastically changed since I have been on meds that were prescribed for my bipolar.

SweetJade [info] Diagnosed with BDP and Bipolar Just a little background... When I was 23 I was diagnosed with bipolar. The diagnosis never completely fit and I felt that there was something missing. When I was 26 I ended up in a short stay mental facility for 11 days and the bipolar diagnosis was lifted and I was told that I had BPD. Borderline Personality Disorder fit better for me as a whole than bipolar did but I wasn't getting any better going through group therapy. I moved provinces and sought out help for my BPD which for me seemed to be aggravated with the stress of moving. I am currently in a 10 week group program here and today I spent my first decent amount of time with the shrink. As of today he believes that both BPD and bipolar are correct. On Monday he will meet with me to discuss medications. He has mentioned lithium. I was on Olanzapine the first time and it didn't go so well (massive weight gain and no energy)I was wondering if there was anyone here who may have an experience with BPD and bipolar or if anyone has had more success with Lithium than Olanzapine?

vno3333 [info] Tips on dealing with the mood swings? Sooo, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 earlier this year. I’ve been on medication which DEFINITELY helps, but I still get monthly mood swings around that time of the month, and this month they’ve been worse than they have been in a while. I’m afraid that I feel myself slipping back to my old self, picking fights about every little thing. My mania tends to manifest as agitation and fights, which sucks cause I’m either normal, depressed, or angry lol no euphoric uppity mania. Anyway, does anyone have tips for how to stop their mood swings from taking over when you feel them coming on? I really don’t want to fight with the people in my life and I know it’s my responsibility, but at the moment I’m feeling a little out of control with things. [info] None [info] 1575041726
capn_krunk [info] Not sure what you were diagnosed with. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago. I tried the therapy and medication for a good year, and it didn't help much. The medicine made me lose all feeling. I'd rather feel good for a while and then bad for a while than nothing at all. I remember thinking, *Is this what it means to be normal?*Bouts of anger are part of my condition. All I can say is that I feel for you, and I love you.

hell_kat [info] Oh, my mom has borderline personality disorder (refuses meds/thinks shrinks do more harm than good), agoraphobia, food issues (former bulimic) and more!  She was a treat to grow up with.  My dad was better but enabled her and had different issues. Some gems:- "We thought your brother was going to be the screw up."  This was when I chose to be a stay at home mom.  The other women in the family were stay at home moms but not by choice.  I went to university and stayed home.  That pissed her off.  My brother had learning issues.- "If you ever try that fucking shit again, I'm going to have you locked in a mental institute."  At 13 I attempted suicide.  Apparently it was too much to worry about your kid when you have a lot going on.- Less of a specific comment and more of an incident.  My mother took me around to multiple diet clinics getting quotes for programs.  I was weighed, examined, etc.  Apparently I was getting 'fat'.  We didn't have money to join any of them and later than night she bought us pie.  The reason is resonates with me is that years later I saw a pic of me at that age.  I was perfect.  Truly.  I was taller than my mom, had bigger boobs and built very athletically.  Because I was 'bigger' than her, I was fat.  And that was the beginning of her obsession with my weight and issues.- 'Stop being so fucking high and mighty.  He is disabled and you need to fucking deal with it and stop being such a bitch.  You never liked him since the accident."  My disabled (with head trauma too) uncle started making sexual remarks to me and began asking me to sit on his lap.  I told the folks he freaked me out.  So many more but those are some of the best.  Thankfully I was diagnosed with bipolar and got to have YEARS of awesome therapy.  Also married an amazing guy and cut the crazies out 10 years ago.  To all my fellow redditors with shitty parents, life can get better.  And if nothing else, these are great tutors on how not to live your life!   [info] None [info] 1380291081
antennas_to_heaven [info] Hi friend! I used ket both recreationally and medically (spiritually?) when I was diagnosed with bipolar and overcoming an emotionally abusive relationship (it also later helped me come to realizations regarding gender identity).It’s impossible for me to prescribe a purely medical route seeing as I love ket as a drug but I guess I would say the nights I spent listening to ambient in bed after shooting 80mg IM were some of the most constructive.In general I think ket helps you sort through thoughts and feelings without being attached to them in the moment. At a show, I snorted 300mg (I have a moderately stupid tolerance, don’t do that) and fell into a deep hole in the corner thinking about my ex and just letting the thought “I don’t feel bad for her and I don’t need to” sit in my head. I picture the brain like a knotted ball of yarn; ketamine expands the spaces and pauses time so you can slowly un-knot that ball. If I had any specific recommendation it would be to meditate on things that have hurt you or made you feel worthless while decenty ketty but not in the hole.Also in order to IM you *have* to get it out of a sterile vial. Some people use micron filters but at that point I’d rather IV. Don’t want any bullshit stuck in your muscle tissue. Side note, if you want to avoid needles plugging 150-250mg in your ass feels VERY similar, it just wastes a lot of k but it lasts several hours.Source: am no longer suicidal :) [info] None [info] 1548782582

NotDeeReynolds [info] Am I classed as a vulnerable adult? And would a healthcare provider be legally obligated to report a rape if I sought help/a check up, if so? I'm really hoping to receive some advice here that I'm struggling to find online. Please no judgemental comments, I'm in a really bad place now and I know I made some poor choices. I didn't plan for any of this to happen though. I was diagnosed with bipolar over a decade ago. It's been a struggle over the years but I had generally been doing well. Until last year, when I ended up being hospitalised after a draining long manic period. Earlier this year, I found myself in the same position again, though this time I was much a lot erratic apparently and the 'episode' was much shorter. I was reported missing and classed as a vulnerable adult. What I'm wanting to know is if I would still be classed as a vulnerable adult, and if so, would a doctor or nurse be legally obligated to report a violent sexual attack that happened to me if I went to get checked out? I don't feel that I should be classed as a vulnerable adult, I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions right now. I'm concerned though that Sundays events would go against me looking as though I am capable of looking after myself. I don't want to go into it but for a little context I was put through an almost 2 hour violent and degrading attack on Sunday night. The company I work for has recently agreed to a deal with a big client. It was big enough news for them to organise an event/party and for three of the bosses from the US site to fly over. Over the past couple of years I've gotten to know the US team. One of the bosses and I really hit it off the last time he was here in the UK. It went to further as he is married. This time I very stupidly put my morals aside and agreed to go back to an apartment he was staying in in the city centre. Once we got there I had started to think and have second thoughts. I told him it wasn't a good idea, then it all happened very suddenly from there. He said I knew exactly what I was doing and that I shouldn't have gone there if I wasn't expecting sex. I feel sick even thinking that he's right because I would be mortified hearing anybody else agree to that. I made the choice to go with him though. I called in sick yesterday and today. I thought I was having a heart attack at the thought of going in yesterday. I've pretty much stayed in bed. My ribs and abdomen are sore and my back really hurts. I've got bruises across my body, including my cheek and jaw area where I can remember him grabbing my face and pushing me down. But I'm really hurting and uncomfortable down there.. I think I might need to be checked over but I don't now whether I would need to go to my doctor, or a walk-in. I don't know whether they would be legally obligated to break confidentiality if I am classed as a vulnerable adult, which I don't think I am technically legally classed as that. Surely I would know? I don't want to report this right now. I don't feel like I can go through people not believing me over him. He said he will ruin me if I told anybody it was anything but us having fun. I think I scratched him when I tried to get him off me. Can he use that against me? He claimed right after that we just had rough sex and made me repeat what he said. I have no back up to what happened. There were people staying in at least one of the apartments above or below I could hear loud music. I don't know if they would have heard anything. I don't want to have to talk about what happened. I just want it to end. I don't to know what do about work tomorrow. I haven't seen anybody or spoken to anybody, apart from leaving a message with work to say I wouldn't be in. I work with my SIL and she's been messaging asking if I'm okay. Can anything be reported on my behalf if I get checked out? [info] None [info] 1565124919
Elisebruni [info] You sound like you are dealing with real issues that are probably separate from ADHD. I don't think the average inferiority complex fully explains the feelings of worthlessness and self-hatred you are having. Please get some help, and don't listen to people who tell you to stop being dramatic/ suck it up/ get over it. I used to hate myself for having ADHD, but then I was diagnosed with bipolar and realized the feelings I was having were due to that (but I misattributed them to ADHD).When I was diagnosed bipolar, my father gave me some really good advice- "You have to play the cards you're dealt in life." It really doesn't matter what we were born with, because someone else always has it worse, and you can either obsess over your shortcomings or focus on living a good life. --&gt; I don't write that as a means of saying "suck it up," but because it was personally inspirational for me to hear.Good luck, and I hope you get to a better place.

calypsocasino [info] And I’ll gloss over this part for sake of time (and would like to devote more time to it), but from roughly August 2014 to August 2016, I nosedived like a Japanese kamikaze pilot trying to honor his famiree.I’ll fill it in later, but I had gained 67 lbs, was addicted to clonazepam that was prescribed immediately after my sibling’s suicide to numb the existential terror that became my life, I couldn’t hold a part time minimum wage job, I used substances around the clock, I never exercised, I blamed everyone, I manipulated everyone, I victimized myself, I became suicidal, I moved home with my parents at age 26 (600 miles from a social life and my girlfriend), I was diagnosed with bipolar and clinical OCD (“severe;” one step below hospitalization), I had no prospect for the future, and I wrote myself off as “well, it was a good run.” Last week I was dumped by girlfriend of 4 years - and I can’t blame her. She was the candle that got me through the midnight hurricane that was my life for 3 years, all while sacrificing her last year of college - throwing away time despite being in her 20’s,  gorgeous, and an intelligent young woman. And for that, I am forever indebted. I stopped all substances when I moved home - not that I had a choice, my parents weren’t exactly going to let me rip a bong and vape all day if I couldn’t hold a job. They didn’t mind, however, if I had a couple beers on a friday night - as long as I was exercising and dieting all week, working hard at my therapy sessions (and nightly journals I had to write), and putting effort into taking care of myself and my image. And when I mean a couple beers, I mean 2, MAYBE 3. In college I knew when I could and couldn’t party, because the pre med grind was insane. Let’s visit that. Alcohol is terrible for me. In college, after two weeks of hitting the gym, the books, and everything else hard as fuck, I’d relax and go out for a night. And I’d go out HARD. My friends loved the nights I had off - “Is this is a Tommy night?! It is!” They were stuff of legend. And other stuff I can’t talk about because of statutes of limitations, but we’ll forget about that and look through rose colored welding masks. When I’d drink, the first feeling I would get is “everything is going to be ok,” not “Time to enjoy a weekend with my friends, life is beautiful.”  Which never raised a flag to me at the time - I had always got that feeling. And it wasn’t a feeling reassuring me that I was going to get into medical school - just that life in general would be okay. But even then, that wasn’t in a good way, like a drink on a plane just to calm someone down. It was buffering internal problems. And then holy fuck, the hangovers. Physically it wasn’t all that horrific - sure I’d have a headache and jet black diarrhea. My shits would be role play: me acting as BP, and my toilet the Gulf of Mexico. My asshole connected to the Gulf by a solid column of greasy black biohazard filth that had the consistency of refried beans mixed with motor oil, and killed any aquatic life in the sewage system, their demise brought on by an onslaught of organic diesel death, which I can only imagine visually mushroomed and swirled like death's cloak through the water, like watching printer ink dropped in an aquarium tank full of water so crystal clear that Water Boy would have an aneurysm.

bioviolin [info] Hoping for Happiness The past year has been really difficult for me. I moved twice, started university, and basically created a new life for myself. I was under immense stress and my mental health declined until I was diagnosed with bipolar in May. I've spent the last few months doing damage control for all of the things I screwed up before I got my diagnosis and started getting treatment. Because of all of that, I became even more depressed and my outlook on life became intensely pessimistic. I could only see a future of damage control for all of my mistakes and neglected to see all of the good things that came out of this difficult year. I moved to a new place and became a student at my dream university. I survived the year with okay grades and a summer research position. During this difficult time, my friends and family supported me more than they ever have before. I started treatment and have an amazing doctor and therapist. I'm starting to see improvements since I started taking medication. I've spent the past few months doing damage control, but I'm much better equipped now with coping skills and life skills to support myself in the future. I have so much hope now. Sending all the good vibes to this incredible community.

birdcafe [info] I’m so ashamed of the things I did while hypomanic TW: Sexual harassment, brief mention of assaultMy first hypomanic episode happened when I was 16 (I’m 22 now) It was 5 months after my mom died by suicide. Obviously that was very traumatic and definitely influenced my spiral downward.Here’s what happened: I was on a high school choir retreat. I did some very inappropriate things to other girls. I have no idea why. I thought it was playful and funny at the time. I slapped a girl on her butt and another girl I kissed during truth or dare when she didn’t want it. I was up all night playing candy crush and that pissed people off too.I got kicked out of choir 3 weeks later. And I spiraled into horrible, horrible depressed, worst I’ve ever experienced. Almost tried to overdose on Tylenol until I read online it is a horrible way to die. So I told my dad and he took me to a psych ward. I went to the ward again 3 months later (still depressed).My dad had to go through so much bc of this. He had to watch his daughter be suspended from school and kicked out of the choir she loved because she literally sexually harassedpeople. I don’t know how he wasn’t disgusted with me.At the second hospitalization, I was diagnosed with bipolar II. Suddenly my actions made sense. But it didn’t make the shame go away.In the current climate of #MeToo, there is no tolerance for sexual harassment. I support that. I have been a victim of assault twice in college. Which only makes me feel more horrible that I victimized these girls, one of whom disclosed she was sexually abused as a child. I made them feel so uncomfortable and unsafe.I can only discuss this in the context of being bipolar. No one else understands. How you can do these things when manic/hypomanic that you would never do when stable. How you cannot possibly defend yourself. I still feel like a monster because of it sometimes. It damaged my self-image and it has taken years to try and repair it.Anyway, I hope someone can relate. :-/ At least I didn’t spend $6k on video games &amp; paying for characters/weapons like my friend’s brother during a manic ep.

boxer21 [info] I have boxed for 20 years, competed for 7.  I competed at the National Golden Gloves in 2004 losing in the second round to Shawn Porter’s older brother.  I always struggled with competition.  The pressure I put on myself would lead me into a dark downward spiral.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple of years ago.  I still box nearly everyday (I’m 36).  I’m a good fighter and it’s heartbreaking to feel like my talent is going to waste, but mental illness fucks you very hard.  I’ve learned to just box for fun but I still take it very seriously.  I think I’m actually a better fighter simply because I don’t have that pressure on me and feel I can be more creative with my style.  I fly out to LA three to four times a year to workout at the Wildcard.  I spar frequently with top caliber fighters and I get my fill.  I love boxing.  It now helps me manage my mental health issues rather than intensifying them.  It’s crazy because when I’m manic and on a high I can go 10 good rounds. When I’m in a depressive state I barely have the energy to go 2.  Bipolar Disorder doesn’t just make you feel like shit mentally, it manifests itself physically as well. [info] None [info] 1525214153

3and202 [info] Extreme irritability and anger after concussion I had a workplace accident where a forklift crashed into a metal cage and the thick bar on the side (approx the thickness of a crowbar handle) crashed into the side of my head at 20mph, at first I felt very tired with a splitting headache and now I'm just experiencing severe moodswings made even worse since I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder 2 months ago, can anyone advise how long these mood swings normally last for? Things that wouldn't normally bother me even when having a depressive episode are causing me extreme anger to the point of feeling suicidal or like crying mixed in with feelings of euphoria for a few minutes and it's becoming very unbearable.

twandar [info] I was diagnosed with ADHD years ago and blamed my impulsivity on that. I also drank heavily in my mid 20's and blamed a lot of my bad behavior on that. But even for a drunk my behaviors were extreme and when I sobered up I sought excitement more through risky sex. I didn't think anything of it in this day and age of Tinder. My behaviors just never seemed out of the ordinary to me because they were my norm. Just recently, I've been diagnosed with bipolar rapid cycling and it has been hard to believe at first. It's helped me a lot to track my moods, consult my journals, and ask others for their observations. By tracking my moods I can see that they change every few days and sometimes even within a day, just like a switch was flipped. My memory and perception is so fucked up that I honestly just think I'm always angry and depressed. But tracking my moods proves differently. Reading back through years and years of journals as an observer of my behavior was mind blowing. I didn't think I was ever happy, but there were lots of manic entries where I thought I was destined to be a super hero with my special powers. Or that I understood the world and everyone better than others. There were also these weird delusional relationships with men I was crushing on. I don't remember any of that because those moods have passed. Asking others their observations about my "craziest behaviors" got interesting results as well. My brother reports a seemingly normal brunch on mother's day. He thought I was totally out of control and ruining everything. I thought it was a normal outing. My drunk friend who still drinks like we did in college reports a few very disturbing nights in college. I was extreme even amongst our group of friends who all prided ourselves on drinking more than others. I think that's why I clung to them. My insane behavior was more often seen as amusing rather than disturbing to a room full of binge drinkers. I agree with others above that if 3 different doctors suggest it, it's most likely pretty obvious. I don't think there's anything to gain by denying the diagnosis. My life only got harder, not easier. I waited way too long to believe I really needed help, until I was at my breaking point and desperate. So, I think a diagnosis is powerful. Knowledge can help you better understand and manage the disorder. I've learned so much about myself in this last month. I regret not slowing down to figure this shit out 20 years ago. Live and learn I suppose. Good luck on your journey of discovery. [info] None [info] 1505441509
bbbastardchild [info] The thing is, I was diagnosed with bipolar like last year? Recently  got medication for it and that was the best thing, I had the worst manic episodes. And as far as MDD that was diagnosed awhile ago before Bipolar, so I don't know really. I haven't had the best luck with prescribers ether. And exactly! Since BPD isn't official it's a lot harder. I was seeing the only specialist here that would take us. There was two groups and both were just adults so I couldn't go in and that's that for BPD, unfortunately. I get my coping and support from here, if I knew what our insurance was called I'd tell you. I really have no idea but I do really appreciate you trying to help and even just listening.

aidrocsid [info] Well, for one, I developed a lot of irrational fears and would completely freak out when forced to confront them. Much of the time it felt more like I was watching myself act than actually participating in my life, which was frustrating. My memory, which, for events (though not information) had already been pretty bad, became far worse. I started having difficulty in school (which I'd always excelled at) and having emotional problems. I was frequently in what I now recognize as a mixed state, though whether that was caused by ritalin or just an early symptom of my bipolar (I), I couldn't tell you. I sometimes, because of the timing, suspect that ritalin may have initiated my bipolar to begin with or (though less so now) that the ADHD was just misdiagnosed bipolar. Once I stopped taking ritalin my emotional problems became more acute but it actually felt like *I* was the one experiencing them. Within a couple of years of stopping ritalin I was diagnosed with bipolar I with symptoms of psychosis in mania, they also said I might have borderline personality disorder but I didn't meet as many of the criteria as they like for diagnosis. I went through a number of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics, none of which did anything other than make my life more difficult by putting me to sleep. Eventually I'd discover that I could mitigate my symptoms with marijuana and meditation.Recently, actually, I quit smoking tobacco and have seen an increase in bipolar symptoms, though the coping methods I've developed make it easier to function than it was when they were previously at these levels. Mind you, I also haven't really been meditating actively. [info] None [info] 1283865691
two__sheds [info] I started taking responsibility for my actions and how they affect other people.I have a long history of shitty behaviour.  When I was in my early 20s, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and BPD, among other things.  I fell into a trap that I see many people with mental illnesses or personality disorders fall into.  All of a sudden there was a reason for everything!  If I hurt those around me, it wasn't my fault, it was my illness. What I really needed was for everyone to understand why I was acting the way I was. If they were upset with me it was their fault for not researching my illnesses and understanding my behaviour.Unsurprisingly, that didn't work out so well. My family stopped taking to me, I lost most of my friends and my then-fiancé started threatening to leave me if I didn't at least try to sort my shit out.  At some point, something clicked: my brain might be broken, and that's not my fault, but I don't get a pass on shitty behaviour because of it.  It wasn't up to everyone else to put up with my bullshit, it was up to me to minimize how much my disorders affected everyone around me.  That was the big turning point for my life.Tips for doing it yourself: recognize that explanations are not excuses. When something goes wrong, take steps to try to keep it from happening again.  You might not be perfect, but with practice you can keep the slip ups to a minimum.  People are much more willing to forgive you if they see real effort being put forth. [info] None [info] 1524537132
Twenty8k [info] [REQ] $800 to keep from going homeless. Full situation inside. Will repay minimum $225 every 2 weeks to repay you $900 in total. So, I lost my job due to medical reasons and have been scraping by on unemployment. I was diagnosed with bipolar and insomnia last year, and had a very hard time adjusting to medications, while the side effects of blood pressure drops were taking place too. My unemployment runs out next week, but fortunately I landed a really nice job, but I won't be able to start until March 25th. The $800 will go strictly to my mortgage, which is running behind. I have some to put into it already, but I'll be at risk of losing the house if I don't catch up entirely... My wife is still currently looking for a job after she was laid off for downsizing recently, but since I'll be bringing in $18/hr full time with possible overtime (which I'll be aggressively going for anyway when i can) so repayment will be no issue whatsoever. I have until March 29th to get the payment in to avoid losing the house... I have already contacted section 8 and all other local assistance groups (salvation army and related as well) but none are accepting new applications till around may or June, and section 8 wants me to have already started a job first before they'll even accept an application, but by then it'll be needless. I can start repayments around the first or 2nd week of April at the absolute latest. I am in Reading, PA area. Thanks. PayPal ok. [info] None [info] 1426564113
HoppyGirl94 [info] A short positive story I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 for a little less than a year. I just started taking lithium along with abilify which I was already on. The difference is ridiculous. I haven’t felt this good in years. I just signed up to go back to college and will be starting with a class this summer!

Overclockinggirl [info] I am so sorry you’re going through this and it probably breaks your heart that you cannot physically get to her because of your disability. My mother was disabled and I know it would’ve broken her heart if she couldn’t get to me to help me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 2 years ago and it is a tough battle but I am doing ok now. I will say that hospitalizations were 100% necessary about 4-5 times in my life. I tried committing suicide twice and failed, obviously. Then voluntarily committed myself after that because I realized I couldn’t go on living that way. Unfortunately, even after being hospitalized twice during that severe, 2 year long depressive episode, it didn’t get me to a euthymic mental state. Now that I am on the correct medication (mood stabilizer and LOW dose of an SSRI), I feel better than ever. I can say first hand that alcohol does not mix with bipolar disorder. I am struggling with that reality now but I’m working on it. I would say your best bet would be to call 911 or perhaps, if she is more stable today, the non-emergency number for the location she lives. I’m sure you can google it and find their number. Explain the situation and see if they can help. You could also try contacting NAMI (National Alliance of Mental Illness). Also, don’t beat yourself up and try to take care of yourself. It can be very draining trying to help someone with mental illness. I have lost many wonderful friends and even immediate family members because they weren’t able to balance their own lives and try to support me and help me. Deep down, I am a very happy, loving, calm, friendly person. However, when I am either manic or depressed, I’m a totally different person. It can scare people away and make them feel uncomfortable. If you have any other questions, feel free to direct message me. I hope this helped. [info] None [info] 1574551417
jamesick [info] It's extremely easy to get diagnosed with adhd and bipolar by a doctor just from telling them your symptoms which means absolutely nothing. Not to say you don't have these, you may do, but more often than not a doctor just telling you do doesn't mean you do. Everyone and their dog these days seems to have bipolar which is a mental condition and can't just be diagnosed from you telling a doctor your symptoms. Just like most other illnesses it takes more than just saying what you feel to be properly diagnosed with it. Have you had any serious tests like brain scans or anything that could actually give a doctor a reason to diagnose you with these?I don't mean to be rude, it's just everyone thinks they have bipolar or adhd because they told their doctor they feel happy sometimes and sad sometimes and their doctor mentioned bipolar. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and it was absolute bullshit and I know I don't have it. More often than not its just normal the way you're feeling and you shouldn't feel like you have something you don't. If you think you have adhd and/or bipolar you will eventually let that rule your life. Try not accepting it and continue your life as if you were never diagnosed with it, if you still feel you do have it look further into it than just a GP's "you seem to have bipolar".

Tortitudes [info] NMom Flipping Out Over Me Requesting Medical Records I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder at the age of 17. I was admitted into a mental health hospital at the time, was prescribed a mood stabilizing medication specifically for my condition, spent about a week adjusting to it (it made me really sleepy), got some therapy, and went home. I took this medication for about a year, under her care, under her insurance, with her picking it up and giving it to me to take.Now about 12 years later, she keeps making comments about "oh this person is f*king nuts and bipolar" so I finally told her to cut it out, asking why do you have to keep saying stuff like that in front of me? So upon reminding her of my diagnosis, both her and my brother (who honestly usually sides with me on her antics, which makes it hurt so much) told me that a) nobody told my mother that I had bipolar disorder and b) I must be lying because I don't seem bipolar. Also the medication I was taking could be used as a sleep aid or schizophrenia as well. So I guess I was placed in a mental hospital for a week to get used to a sleeping pill? Sure, sure.Okay, so I guess when your teenage daughter would stay up all night for a couple nights in a row organizing your fabric by type and color and cleaning our house, that's not being manic. When you would yell at your daughter for talking too fast, that's not being manic. When you would scream at your daughter for being in bed for three days and can't bring herself to even shower properly, that's not being depressed.And being that she's gaslighting me and telling me my diagnosis and memories aren't real, I'm paranoid and starting to think I'm freaking crazy and started to try and get these medical records so I can be sure I'm not "making stuff up again." She calls me yesterday and got angry with me because I sounded distracted. I was reading the steps I had to take on the network website and told her what I was doing. She immediately got weird with me and hung up the phone. I just figured it was because we weren't talking about her per usual. I didn't even tell her I was getting them so I could prove her wrong. I just phrased it as, "I'm almost 30, I should probably have my medical history at some point."Now she's calling me today and asking me if I really want to make sure I want to get those records in case my husband reads them.  She's using some things in my past against me to try and talk me out of getting them. I can't imagine there's something in there that I'm not supposed to see, or something that would be weird against her, so I'm not sure why she's trying to scare me out of getting them. And anything in the past that might show up on my records, my husband already knows. So nice try, lady.I don't plan on shoving these in her face. It will be of no use to do so. I just want them because I should honestly probably have them, and to reassure me I'm not making stuff up in my head. If I wanted to shove them in her face, I'd be sure to include the emergency room visit I had after miscarrying since she thinks I made that up too.I'm just confused on her angle and why she doesn't want me to have my own medical records.

TheRoyalGodfrey [info] yeah the way kanye talks about mental health isn't really accurate or healthy. Like I remember in his interview with Charlamagne, Charlamagne asked him if he sees a therapist and he said "the world is my therapist."And the ye cover is perpetuating the misleading stereotype around bipolar disorder that you just constantly switch between manic and depressive but usually cycles last for 3-6 months. Ultra-rapid (cycles lasting days) and ultradian (cycles within a day) are very very rare.It's also unclear whether Kanye actually has bipolar disorder. At the White House, he said "I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and NFL. He looked at my brain. I wasn't actually bipolar, I had sleep deprivation" but now he's back to saying he has it. Which (I don't wan to armchair diagnose but) he probably does. [Mariah Carey has bipolar disorder](https://people.com/music/mariah-carey-bipolar-disorder-diagnosis-exclusive/) and she's talked about how he wanted to believe it was just sleep deprivation for a while.It feels like Kanye is trying to use his mental illness to guilty people while not even treating it properly and spreading harmful misconceptions about BPD. A lot of the stuff he's been saying about not listening to other people and being "free" sounds like feeding into a manic episode. Like the song "Freee" and saying "bipolar is my superpower" sound like embracing the mania which seems ill advised.Also that Gucci/Quavo song doesn't destigmatize BPD at all [info] None [info] 1544908543

MoonbeamThunderbutt [info] I never considered that my diagnosis could be wrong either, but when I finally read the BPD criteria (more than a decade after my bipolar diagnosis), I was flabbergasted. BPD makes so much more sense for me in retrospect. The criteria fit so much better, but most of all: BPD is a result of trauma. It's a manifestation of CPTSD.Bipolar is treated more like a genetic illness, like schizophrenia. It's treatable but incurable and "just happens" to some people, like a random chance force of nature. At this point, I'm angry that I was ever diagnosed with it, because I was actively being abused and neglected when I got that diagnosis. Did my fucking therapist not see that? I was doing the best I possibly could in a completely intolerable, psyche-breaking situation. The fault was with the people putting me in that situation, not me for trying to survive it. And yet, I was diagnosed with bipolar, which is really just a way of saying "Your brain is defective and you shouldn't trust yourself. The abuse is your fault, because you're too difficult to handle. You drive people to treat you badly and who can blame them."*Fuck. That. Shit.*Some people might consider BPD to be a "worse" diagnosis, but for me it gave me back my dignity and allowed me to trust myself again. I didn't cause any of this. I'm not defective. I've just been doing the best I can with very limited resources. [info] INFJ . F . 29 . 5w4 [info] 1465510625

zevondhen [info] Has Anyone Else Ever Experienced This? (Please excuse the length and disorganized nature of this post--it's a bit difficult for me to articulate myself at the moment) I was diagnosed with bipolar type II when I was 18 (although I was 15 when I first displayed symptoms) and I have brief hypomanic episodes followed by long stretches of depressed episodes, but I also experience another aspect that I've never heard anyone ever talk about. I've never been able to really describe it, but I suppose it's sort of like the feeling you get smelling your favorite perfume or tasting the best food or being a kid on Christmas morning but about *everything*. All sensory information. All the time. It's this overwhelming euphoric sense that quickly peaks within a day or two and then takes a sharp dive into being overwhelming (think a wire with far too much current running through it) and this sensation can linger for *years*. It might not sound all that bad, but it's mostly because I lack the ability to fully describe it. I've experienced suicidal episodes, panic attacks, intense grief after losing a sister to suicide, and PTSD flashbacks and this... ordeal is up there with the worst mental states I've ever been in.One vivid example I can think of is when I visited a house where the living room was entirely mustard yellow--the tablecloth was yellow, the drapery was yellow, the carpet was yellow, even the bricks in the fireplace were yellow. I felt extremely uncomfortable and it was like having to smell the mustiest, most cloying old lady perfume through a dirty dish rag (I didn't literally *smell* this, but it's the closest I can get to explaining how it felt). It also seems to be triggered by the transition from winter to spring and summer to fall and I suppose it might have something to do with a subconscious reaction to sensory input. It's so sensitive that one day in late February to early March I will walk outside, stop, and think "yep, spring is coming." Now I know a sense of mania/hypomania can include feelings of euphoria, but I haven't seen anyone describe anything quite like this. I'm sure with seven billion people on the planet I can't possibly be the only person with this issue but I've never read any literature, seen any media, or read any posts about anything similar. I have had psychiatrists say that they don't know what's going on in my brain or what to do about it. I don't even have the *language* to fully capture it and I feel terribly alone in a state that can be absolutely debilitating.I just want to know if this sounds familiar to *anyone* out there because if I could find just one person who understands, it would help.

We have lived in this house for 3 years with her and I reached the end of my rope a long time ago but I finally just got m wife on board last night. Firstly let me say that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder this year and it is EXTREMELY hard for me to keep my bipolar rage in check with MIL when I spend 6 to 8 hours cleaning up the house and she wrecks it 2 days later.  The kitchen is the real room of anger for me.  MIL has 2 dogs, that NEVER go outside and shit and piss in a room directly off the kitchen.  One of the dogs is 10 the other one is 3.  They never go for walks they aren't housebroken and the icing on the cake for me is that I have a super strong sense of smell so all I can smell when I'm downstairs is dog urine and feces.  So imagine trying to prepare your dinner after spending 8 hours cleaning only to constantly smell piss and that has been my life for the last 3 years. I snapped this morning when I spent 4 hours getting the kitchen to a decently clean level by putting all her stuff in the basement that she doesn't use.  She got up and said I wish I was dead because we put her fryer in a cabinet and put the cord in a drawer.I need help.  I can't live like this anymore.  I am the only person in the house who gives a shit what it looks like ever and it's fucking driving me insane literally.  I committed myself to a mental hospital this year because I couldn't stand my life anymore and found out that I'm bipolar.She never does dishes.

26pages [info] Horrible side affects with lamictol So I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in the beginning of 2017, and pretty quickly started lamictol (I had been on sertraline multiple times before that and it only made things worse). When I first started lamictol, I felt so good, it’s like I knew how it felt to be normal for the first time in my life. Somehow living was actually easy which it had never been before. After a few months my doctor wanted to up the dosage which I was hesitant to do because I felt pretty great but I shrugged off my doubt because doctor knows best right? Well it’s like like things changed for me overnight. I was suddenly experiencing such severe paranoia - which I have never had in my life - to the point where I thought people were out to kill me. I was crying all the time even in front of coworkers which was incredibly embarrassing. I couldn’t think straight or interact normally, it was hard for me to string enough words together to create a coherent thought. All of a sudden I was beyond suicidal. I had a plan, one that I put a lot of thought and effort into. The scariest part was that after feeling depressed/suicidal since I was 12, I had never reached such a serious decision before. Anyway I finally got help and spent a week in the psych ward where they put me back on sertraline. I read so many people absolutely loving lamictol and it being such a game changer that I want to give it another shot. Almost two years ago I don’t feel like I knew very much about bipolar and I don’t feel like any of my healthcare providers really took the time to explain things to me or really get into the depth of things in order to know what I need. My question is: through all the people that love lamictol, is there anyone out there specifically with bipolar 2 that had such extreme reactions to it like me? What works in its place? Also, do you guys think that maybe I just had it increased too fast? I’d really really appreciate any and all feedback. I feel very confused and very mentally and emotionally tired having to continuously figure this all out on my own without any improvement for years now. [info] None [info] 1542689536

i_have_a_semicolon [info] That's an interesting take on BPD, I must say I don't think "changing identities" is the only criterion. Bpd, like most metal disorder, is categorized by many different symptoms and in order to be diagnosed you must show a minimum of 5 or something like that. So even if you are not trying on different identities like clothes, you can still have BPD.Another thing is that although only ~1% of the pop are diagnosed, its possible the actual figure is somewhere around ~7%I have been researching this lately, because I was diagnosed with bipolar II many years ago, taking medication, and it's mostly "in remission", but despite this I still have emotional reactions that are not proportional to the stimuli. Someone on RP suggested I may have BPD, and after some reading I found bipolar and BPD can be comorbid. This new information has shown me there's still more i can do to "fix" myself - and thus I will be working harder on getting this under control. It's great that people like you are educating others - often times, even psychiatrist won't mention this. I hadn't heard about BPD until RP mentioned it - and after I did my own research I may bring my new self diagnosis back to my therapist/psych, and see if I could start doing CBT [info] None [info] 1480781260
plato234 [info] How did you deal with your diagnosis? I see a lot of posts on here along the lines of..."I was diagnosed with bipolar (insert anywhere from yesterday, to more vague "recently") after suffering because of it for a long time. "It's mind blowing to me because a lot of the posts, people accept their diagnosis right away. It took a couple of years before I accepted my diagnosis and thought I had a mental illness. I lost a lot because of that, but I now have a much deeper understanding of my own mind thanks to it. Any others here that fought their diagnosis for a long time and refused treatment? Or, if you were recently diagnosed and accepted it, what makes you accept it so readily? Do you realize you have a chronic illness that has claimed many lives and left destruction in its wake? And if you're young and thinking about the military, forget about it. Something I myself regret. I don't know, I can't stress enough how much of a shock it was to accept I have bipolar.

72690 [info] Personally I've taken Prozac, Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan, Abilify, Seroquel, Risperdol, Lamictal, Trileptal, Thorazine, Trazodone, Gabapentin, and Celexa in my life, at different times/combinations, since 2001. I was diagnosed with bipolar II, OCD, panic disorder, and PTSD. Also borderline personality disorder. I am off of my medication now. I also exercise 3-5x week with cardio, I spend time in nature throughout the week, I supplement and take vitamins, and take 1 teaspoon of Kratom 1-2x a day (8:30 am and 5:30 pm)I find that I am able to go without Klonopin, although I will take a .5mg if I truly need it. This is down from taking it daily or every other day. My prescription medications never worked for me, ever. I would go on and off of them all the time, but everyone around me believed in the pills so much I felt like I owed it to them. Thorazine helped me a lot, but it made me exhausted and has some serious potential side effects. I feel great. I am still figuring out which days are going to be my off days, but overall this is the most relief I've ever had in my entire life. I'm 26 years old. [info] None [info] 1500477679
davos_mith [info] life comes at you fast So I am currently a 3rd-year college student and will be in college for another 2 because of failed classes. So I am at the point in my life where I am not sure which road I want to take. A part of me wants to drop out, get a alright job and travel because college doesn’t make me happy and never has. A 9-5 sounds awful and I don’t really have many interests except music and would like to be creative, but i’ve never tapped into that side of myself. But on the other hand I feel as though I should finish my degree since I’m almost done but on the other hand, I am poor. I already owe the government about 15k for student loans and that number just increase exponentially before I graduate. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I just feel like i’m in a bad place in life. Hindering my chances of living care free with a good job and free lifestyle. I grew up in poverty and I never want to go back to that, you know? Not being to provide the bet for myself or the people I love. I would feel like the biggest ducking failure. I wish I had this epiphany as a senior in high school. Do any of you guys have advice? Maybe on ways to find a passion?

Bio_is_life [info] Maintaining Relationships Question Hey there,I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 around two years ago and have been on meds since then. Although I've made pretty significant progress since then, I still do have rare episodes and I'm working on that with my psychiatrist and therapist.However, no matter what I do, I still have a hard time holding onto any long term, significant relationships with people.  I have great friendships (I guess...?) but I never tell those people about my disorder or talk about my feelings with them (bad, I know).  But anyone who I am open with and try and talk to always ends up leaving. For example, I'm usually a very laid back person who loves talking but when I go into a swing I just shut off and isolate myself. I feel empty and alone and just hate myself and everything about the world and I want someone to care about me but then when people do try to help I end up lashing out at them because they don't really understand (stupid, I know). Then when I come out of it I open up more and apologize and I feel really bad about it because I was genuinely mean to them but it just happens over and over and I think I end up hurting  them so much that they just get tired of dealing with it.  Most of my family doesn't talk to me anymore, my girlfriend of five years left me, and I only have one friend left who knows about my disorder but I never talk to him about it. Is it because I'm just a bad person, even without considering bipolar, or is there something else I can do? I don't know if any of you all have experienced something similar and if you want more details or anything I can add more but I just wanted to know if you all had any suggestions. I'm tired of feeling empty and alone and I'd like to feel safe sharing my feelings with someone without them leaving. Sorry if this is dumb or doesn't make sense or is the wrong place to put this...Edit: thank you all so much for taking the time to respond to me, it really means a lot &lt;3 [info] None [info] 1482971971
krastins [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar II -- and now I'm doubting everything [info] BPD + BP2// DoNM, NC for 1yr [info] 1408320846
youRheaDiSoNfirE [info] My (32F) husband (34M), who has a severely enmeshed relationship with his mother (50F), is pretending we broke up and doesn't care how it is affecting our relationship I am going to try to make this as detailed as possible, because I am so desperate for advice. My husband (34M) and I (32F), when we first began dating 2 years ago, both came clean with each other about the fact that he is a recovering opiate addict who takes methadone daily and that I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type 1, for full disclosure) as well as PTSD and an eating disorder (EDNOS, for full disclosure, but pretty much anorexia). We both accepted that about one another, and we fell madly in love. At the time, I was living in a town 90 min away and he lived in my hometown, but we saw each other as much as possible. After about 3 months of dating, and about a month after he asked me to marry him, I made a pretty sudden decision to move back to my hometown and live with him. He was living with his mother (50F) and sister (23F) for financial reasons, as his previous wife had absolutely destroyed his life. He helped, of course, but she was truly an awful human being who stole his identity for drug money, amongst other things. She had a son, who my husband had essentially helped raise, and he wanted badly to make it work for the little boy. It didn't, and he eventually moved back in with his mother to rebuild. I should mention here that he grew up without a father, because his mother was 15 when she had him and made the unilateral decision to leave the father off the birth certificate. She used her son as a source of emotional support throughout his entire life, and when he reached his teen years and then especially adulthood, she also began to lean on him as a surrogate spouse. My husband informed me when we started dating that he was extremely close to his mother and any woman who took issue with that probably wasn't the right woman for him. I naively ignored all the signs of severe enmeshment and just took it as a sign that he treats women well. Before I moved in, his mother had been so kind to me. She had a Bernie sticker on her bumper, shared my love of Prince, and clearly loves her son. I really thought "she's so awesome, she really would make a great mother in law". I wanted so badly to be with him and get rid of the distance, and his mother welcomed me into the fold with seemingly open arms. I had only been in the house once prior, and I guess probably must have had some Rose colored goggles on, because when I moved in I realized that the house was filthy. His mother, his sister, and her 4-year-old son seem to be happy with living in total filth, and they also horde animals and neglect them severely. 3 dogs kept in back "rooms" no bigger than closets, rarely taken outside and often going unfed. 5 cats, indoor and outdoor, whose food is poured onto the kitchen counter and onto the floor in piles. His sister, when doing dishes, would just throw entire pots and utensils away rather than washing them, including things I had bought to cook with. Then there was the constant screaming at each other - including at the child. He was genuinely being neglected and screamed at every single morning, had never been to a pediatrician appointment or had a single vaccine, was regularly given baby bottles full of soda, and was pumped full of so much sugar (cupcakes, candy, ice cream, you name it) nightly (well, if you consider 1am night time) that he was literally showing signs of malnutrition. He had also never been to the dentist, which I was told but didn't need to be, because anybody could see that his little teeth were black and decayed around the gums. Obviously, any sane person would be pretty uncomfortable living in those conditions. I don't know how sane I am, but I certainly was. However, I knew it was temporary. We were both working, so we would be out shortly. That's what I thought, anyway. I figured out pretty quickly that my husband's mother has a lot of issues, including money management, and that his sister, despite being 23 years old and having a child, would likely never get a job. She doesn't even have a drivers license. Claims to be an agoraphobe to excuse her behavior but loves to go out to eat and go tanning. Anyway. The dysfunction was THICK. Pretty much weekly, his mother was asking for money, on top of what we were paying her for rent. We could literally never get our footing or save enough to leave, because of pumping so much of our resources into his mom and sister, including often picking up cigarettes for his sister and never getting reimbursed.Compounded with this money situation, which his mother was clearly ashamed of, is the fact that I was witnessing all of this awful behavior and the neglect and emotional abuse going on, which she was also clearly ashamed of. I kept in our room pretty much always, because I was very uncomfortable with how dirty the house was, and seeing the neglected animals just became too much. My husband's mother and sister began to think of me as snobby, and his mother's behavior simultaneously started to get WEIRD. She would text him literally anytime we left the house to ask where we were going, and throw shade if we were doing something fun together or going to dinner. Anything, really. I began to notice that our things were being rifled through, daily it seemed, including very private things like our sex toys. His mother would take and use whatever she wanted of mine, sometimes putting it back but usually just leaving it lying out for me to grab and put back. Any semblence of boundaries that may have existed before were completely gone. She began to pick fights with my husband, and the closer our wedding date got, the more unhinged she became, culminating in her point blank asking him not to marry me, and even going as far as insinuating to other family members that they should not support our marriage.When that didn't work, shit really hit the fan. When my husband told her that he was going to need the several hundred dollars she had borrowed so we could pay for our wedding, she began screaming at him and telling him how ungrateful he is. I heard it all and marched out of the bedroom to defend him, but stopped myself in my tracks because I knew he wouldn't want me to. That's when I saw his sister, sitting on the floor, with her iPad. She had the most awful, bone chilling smile on her face as she listened to her family rip each other to shreds. I was seriously shocked by her face, and then I was angry. So I looked her in the eye and said "get a fucking job, _____." And I walked out the front door. All hell broke loose at this point. His mother charged after me and got in my face. We argued, said horrible things to each other. And this is the part that I still can't comprehend - why they would do it and why she would tell on herself. But regardless, she triumphantly informed us that she and his sister had read through ALL of our messages to each other. Which means a ton of sexting and just stuff that any normal mother would never even WANT to see, let alone gleefully brag she had read. So, we left. We moved in with his aunt, where life was much better. His mother and sister did not attend our wedding. And since then, she refers to me as his girlfriend. She continues to demand an emotionally incestuous relationship with my husband, and if he dares to not communicate several times a day with her, she jumps right into accusing him of being a bad son and a terrible stepfather to his FORMER stepson. I am not allowed at family functions, and have been forced to sit outside a restaurant in the car while my husband celebrated with his family.We are still loaning her money anytime she asks. 2 years later and his sister still has no job. A family member finally stepped in and demanded they stop neglecting the little boy's health and development, so thankfully he is now fully caught up on vaccines, has been to the dentist, and is in kindergarten. The house is still filthy, the animals still aren't properly cared for (2 of the dogs died under her watch in the last year,  and I finally called animal control today for the dog they are still neglecting), and like I said nothing has changed about his mom's weird interest in his life. We live in a lovely home I found for us, and life should be better - but so many things haven't changed.My mental health has always taken a backseat during our relationship. My husband's methadone is always a top priority, and over the course of our time together and after being on methadone for YEARS, he is down to 24mg, compared to the 68 he was on when we met. I make his Dr appointments for him, made him go to the dentist which he was deathly afraid of and never would have done had I not made him, probably saving him from a severe infection that could have killed him. His home is furnished, decorated, clean and comfortable, which he says is the first time he's had that since his grandmother when he was a kid. I encouraged him to push forward toward a better job, which he got. But I am often given the backseat. When money is tight, my husband insinuates that because I'm anorexic it's easier for me to go without eating, so food for him is always a priority but not necessarily for me. I asked over and over and over during the course of this year if he could get me some help because I feel suicidal sometimes and because I have no medication. When I moved here, I left my doctors behind. Anytime I said anything, he would say yes I'll get you help but he never followed through. Not once. He goes to his mother when we have issues and tells her everything about me, and also sometimes lies about me to make himself look better. He has used cocaine repeatedly over the last year and lied to me about it. The only time I get the truth is when I discover it on my own.A month ago, I went to New York (13 hours from my home) for a very important family meeting. I used our card for more than I expected, and was unable to communicate quick enough for him, so he started calling my family and talking trash about me. I told him I was leaving him, that it was just too much. So he involved his family and told them insanely huge lies about me. His mother used it as an opportunity to tell him to come stay with her. She absolutely loves when we have issues. When I returned a couple days later, we talked and came to a resolution and stayed together. But I discovered that to save face, he was still telling intricate lies to his family about me. All of this, in addition to the month leading up to it, in which my mental health was absolutely wrecked, put me in a state of rapid cycling. Manic one minute, suicidal the next. Over and over and over. I was miserable, my marriage was essentially Swiss cheese, and my husband was never going to cut the apron strings. I was angry and I was sad and most of all, I was confused. My behavior was erratic, my moods were switching between angry and devastated by the minute. So many things triggered me all at once, and none of them were going away. My husband informed me that I was out of control and needed to check into a psychiatric hospital. I resented him so much, partly because I knew he was right, but mostly because he had ignored my pleas for help for SO LONG that now I needed to go to the psych ward instead of just being able to get better with meds and therapy. I agreed, but my resentment coupled with my rapid cycling turned me into a monster. I said awful, hurtful things. I threw his phone down and broke it, and then......... I did the same thing to his Xbox. There is no excuse for that behavior. My illness explains why I did it, but it doesn't make it okay or acceptable. I am a grown adult and I take full responsibility for doing those things, despite being incredibly ashamed of them. My diagnosis helps provide a road map, or an instruction manual for me if you will, but it never excuses what I do. I am responsible for my behavior, not my illness.After breaking the Xbox, he left. I began to write a suicide note. Midway through this chore, he showed up with one of his aunts, who explained that I would be checking in NOW instead of the next day like we had planned. I got my things together and they drove me to the facility. My husband didn't even come inside with me, which still hurts when I think about it. They just dropped me off and left. I checked myself in and spent the next 3 days getting my meds adjusted, going to group therapy, and getting better. My doctor released me and my husband picked me up. While I was there, the same aunt who drove me pried into my treatment there. Illegally, I might add. She severely violated my rights. She is an RN who used to work there and still has friends who are there. I still am coming to terms with that violation and have to talk myself down from contacting someone and attempting to get her nursing license revoked. I'll get over it eventually, but right now it's still fresh and just a reminder that my in laws fundamentally don't understand the concept of boundaries, and have no intention on ever observing them even if they did understand the concept. In addition to that, his entire family (but especially his mother) let him know that unless he breaks up with me, they are essentially disowning him. So, like a very good son/nephew, he is doing as they demand. Except he isn't. We are still together - he received back a very different wife than the wife he dropped off. I have made a huge effort to change in a tiny amount of time, because he doesn't deserve a rapid cycling nutjob who breaks things. I should point out that that was not a regular thing - I've never done anything like that before that day. But he is lying to his family because he is afraid to not have them to ask for help when he needs to, and also because the enmeshment is so strong. Also, while I was hospitalized, he spent the only money we had on cocaine and had a 3 day binge. I was unable to reach him by phone almost the entire time I was there because he used the money for cocaine instead of the cell phone bill. He began lying to me immediately about it, and has used since I have been back too. He lies about so much now that I literally never know when he is being truthful. I've never done cocaine, my father is a cocaine addict and has been for 35 years, so it scares the ever living fuck out of me, and it scares me so bad to see my own husband struggle with the compulsion to use it.I don't know what to do. I'm afraid we are toxic, but I see what our relationship does for him. I know what will happen if we do break up - he will spiral down into that place of addiction, he will eventually move back in with his mother, and his life will return to what it was before he met me. I love him so much - there is so much wonderful in him. He is kind and thoughtful and loving. But he has this other side, this selfish "every man for himself" part. And his enmeshed relationship with his mother is now stronger than ever. She's clearly thrilled, and it makes me feel sometimes like there is "another woman" in our marriage, and then I feel ridiculous for thinking that. But I can't help it. I also can't help seeing that our relationship as it is now is keeping me from getting healthy. I left the hospital with resolve, with a new outlook on life, with a will to not just live but to live WELL. And I can feel all of that progress crumbling. He won't be honest with me, or his family. I can't even celebrate our wedding anniversary because I'm supposed to be keeping us a secret. He even has ME helping to hide myself from his family. He's gone so far now that they think I'm gone and so are my things. It's such an intricate web of deceit and it breaks my heart, because it's all in the name of convincing a large group of people that I'm an awful human being and that he's "finally rid of her".I. Dont. Know. What. To. Do.Someone please help me. Tell me it's useless, or tell me how I can get him to work on being healthy with me. We argued last night because he wanted to get cocaine, and he loaned his mother money again today. How do I fix this? I'm desperate to fix it, because I love him and I know that he loves me. I just don't know how. Tl;Dr - I'm worried that my husband and I can't function in a healthy way together, and that his family's refusal to observe boundaries, plus his emotionally incestuous relationship with his mother, will likely to be the final few nails in the coffin.

a_bi_polarbear [info] Does this religion contribute towards mental health problems? (Also hello) Hello, I have been a lurker for about 6 months now (on a different account that I no longer use) so I decided it was about time that I said hello.I am from Western Australia and I'm 26years old. I was raised in the "truth", baptized at 13, started fading at 15-16, then was DF'ed at 19. Since then my life has been up and down (mostly down.) My question for my fellow ex-jws is, do you think that the emotional abuse we suffer from shunning has a part in developing metal health issues? I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 a couple of years ago, with very strong depressive phases, resulting in being hospitalized several times, including spending time in a mental ward (it is a horrid place to end up.) It is still an on-going struggle, but reading about others experiences here and just knowing I'm not alone in a lot of my feelings toward jws has helped immensely. So I also wanted to say thanks. :) [info] None [info] 1395954229
xviriditasx [info] Antipsychotics can help a lot, but if your psychosis is caused by a mood episode, as it is with a lot of people with bipolar disorder, treating the mood episode will alleviate symptoms of psychosis. This can include medications like mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and some various meds prescribed off label. I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder before later being diagnosed as schizoaffective bipolar type. I struggled to find a therapist who understood psychosis well and could actually help me. I had to learn how to be my own therapist, teaching myself how to do reality checks and manage psychotic symptoms. I’ve set some hard rules for myself - for example, any time I hear a disembodied voice, I remind myself that it is my own thoughts that I am perceiving inaccurately. Under no circumstances will a disembodied voice actually talk to me. It’s all me.  [info] None [info] 1521565547
Em42 [info] I have absence seizures (I know nothing like those of you with really serious, disruptive forms of epilepsy) and bipolar disorder.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 20 years ago, I'm 33, I've probably taken around 100 different medications in countless combinations, so I know meds suck, they don't work as advertised, the side effects are hell, drug regiments are complex and difficult to follow, I'm taking 7 different drugs right now at 4 different times a day.  One drug I've been on for a few years is Lamictal and it actually makes me less depressed (and with Topamax no more absence seizures yay), I don't know if it would have that effect if I weren't also bipolar, but it might.  It does dumb me down some (not as much as Topamax, honestly they should have just named that one Stupamax) but that effect has dissipated over time and isn't as bad now (plus I'm lucky I won the genetic lottery and have the IQ points to spare which helps some but I still fucking hate it).  Maybe they could try changing things up or adding something with some mood stabilizing properties to the therapy you're already on.  It's worth taking to your doctor about.Since I'm also bipolar I've had many suicidal thoughts over the years so I can really relate to how you must be feeling.  They come in a few forms, the "I just don't want to go on living" kind, which are the least serious but still very upsetting, the "I want to kill myself" kind (but have no plan), which is a little worse and really hard to cope with, and the "I'm going to kill myself and I know how and I know when" that last one, if you're having that, go to an ER and tell them you want to die and you have a plan.  You're a danger to yourself and you need help.  The first two fall under what's known as "suicidal ideation" the last one does not, it's the serious kind, when you start planning you really need help.  I hope you feel better soon, life isn't all shit, even when it seems like it is.  There are a lot of good things out there even if they aren't what you originally set out to do, I was pre-med before I became too sick to finish my schooling, being a doctor was all I ever wanted to do.  In some ways it became a trap and I've never been able to move on because that was the only plan I had.  I worked a lot of bullshit jobs since then.  I had a baby, unfortunately not with a nice guy (he beat me), but my son (11 now) while he has some issues (high functioning autism, ADHD) is really smart and kind and funny, I probably wouldn't have made it all these years without him.  I'm trying to get disability since I haven't been able to work since 2013, I figure if I do then I'll take a painting class or a bonsai class at the local botanical garden or something, get myself out of the house a couple days a week.  There are positive experiences that you're are still capable of having even if they aren't the super driven ideals you had in mind for your life.  You can still contribute to things in a positive way, there's always a need for people to do charity work and that's something you could do a bit of to keep busy while you job hunt.  I've done some work at shelters for victims of domestic violence (it was a good fit since I was a victim at one point in my life) and I found it to be really rewarding, I never left there feeling bad about myself, I always left feeling like I had done something meaningful, something good, it always made me feel better knowing I had made even a small difference in someone's life.What you're feeling now, it's not forever.  Things will look up again, maybe not how you expect, but they will, I promise.  I know it's cliche, but it's true, suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Every single person that has ever jumped off the golden gate bridge and lived says pretty much the same thing, to paraphrase "about half way down I realized all my problems were fixable except that I was falling to my death."  You will make it through this, you've gotten this far, I can tell from what you wrote that you're a strong person, forget about throwing in the towel and just focus on the little things that make life just a little better.  It's just like I tell my son everyday **"what are we going to do?"**  **"We're going to try to make today just a little bit better than yesterday"** you're not looking for a miracle, it's about **Progress Not Perfection**.

It still sets me back hundreds of dollars a month to buy my fucking antipsychotics. I'm used to the apologetic and stunned looks from the pharmacist when I go to pay.I also had an awful experience at the psych ward at Jubilee.

starflashfairy [info] I have been hospitalized three times. The first time I was fourteen. I was cutting myself because I was super depressed. They put me on Prozac, which was a terrible mistake...The second time I was trying to kill myself after a very traumatic event. I was on Topamax for headaches and I had just gotten a new refill. I was on an extremely high dose twice a day, so there were 60 pills in the bottle at 200 mg each. I swallowed the whole bottle and went to lie down and sleep myself to death. My dad found the bottle empty on the counter and came up and called an ambulance. I wound up in the ICU. They couldn't pump my stomach without killing me, so they put me on a saline drip and then took me to the psych ward. There I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. They started regulating my meds, though I went through a few very manic years.The third time, I was only considering suicide, but my new therapist at the time decided to 302 me for safety due to my history. I went to the hospital and was given a second diagnosis, borderline personality disorder, which when paired with bipolar disorder is extremely difficult to manage. They've finally got me slightly stabilized on the correct meds now though, because of this diagnosis.Each time I went, I stayed for a week, and each time the experiences were not fun, but overall it's helped in ways I never expected. But I want to avoid ever going back.   [info] None [info] 1487484013

loliclown [info] Absolutely. In psychiatry, these are called "crying spells". I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder when I was 21 years old, and one of my bewildering symptoms were crying spells. It made so much sense when my psychiatrist told me about them. Just about anyone can experience them, especially during times of stress, feeling overwhelmed, or even exhaustion, especially mental and emotional exhaustion. They just happen more often for bipolar people like me, or depressed or anxious people. You're completely normal, and crying is actually good for your body and mental health. If you need to cry, let yourself cry. You'll feel a bit better afterwards. [info] None [info] 1528286268

SW: 180 CW: 185 GW: 120 Height: 5'2" Age: 23From November 2015 to this January, I went from 180lbs to 150lbs using CICO, ketosis, and cardio. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on Risperidone, which can cause rapid weight gain, in late February. I gained 35lbs since about late March. I've been eating 1000-1200 calories a day and I go to the gym for cardio three times a week. I don't eat exercise calories back. I weigh all of my ingredients and carefully portion what I eat. I cut out alcohol (except for special occassions) and drink nothing but coffee, tea, and water. I rarely eat carbs. Unfortunately this medication is making me pack on the pounds quite quickly. It's exhausting. I can't get in another medication until next month, but even then my doctor said that I will most likely gain weight on other medications as well.I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this?

effeduphealer [info] More and more I question if I'm really bipolar, on Wednesday, I plan to discuss this with my pdoc... I'm not sure when/where I was diagnosed with bipolar originally. I was first taken to the ER and checked into a psych ward in 2005.  At that time, they said that I was must likely OCD, although, I'm not sure where this came from.My first post hospital pdoc said that he believe that I suffered from borderline personality disorder, and I agreed 100% with this diagnosis.  Since then, I've seen so many pdocs both inpatient and out.  In 2007, I was told I had been diagnosed bipolar, but no one seemed to know by which doctor.I have my fair share of ups and downs, but I don't think I have ever had anything that would be considered mania.  Definitely impulsive at times, but that falls into the BPD.  The more I think about it, and read about it, and think about it, the more I think I'm not actually bipolar.The problem is that I don't get along with my pdoc that well, and I'm not sure that I can bring this up with my pdoc without becoming confrontational.

It's like, no. No you don't. And I don't have bipolar.So I don't like telling people I have bipolar. And saying "I was diagnosed with bipolar" is a little better, but still not really the whole picture. Ideally you know the person well enough you can sit down and have a full conversation about it.

One of the figures I had heard tossed around is that 90% of marriages end in divorce where a partner is bipolar. It’s not true. Though it led me to research the issue and while no solid statistics can be made about it, the tendency to assortatively mate with others who have mental health issues can exacerbate the challenges of those interpersonal relationships. For that reason, I’ve decided that I will not get involved with any long term relationship with someone who has a mental illness.

edmdusty [info] This sounds like me. I was a binge drinker like this.  I was using booze as a coping mechanism to quash negative emotional states. Used a.a. to quit drinking. Some people say that addiction has to be actual physical dependency. Others say it's wanting to quit and can't. I think binge drinkers are not physically dependent but emotionally dependent. If it's causing trouble in your life then it's probably time to think about quitting. A couple years after I quit, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. Now that I'm managing that and using healthy coping skill I don't need a.a. to stay sober. It would be worth checking out a meeting with an open mind. Also go see a shrink.

divermom74 [info] This is my Face Book coming-out post from March 10.“Here goes, humor me and hang in till the end…A few months ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The decision to share has been tough, scary. Blythewood is a small town with a BIG baseball park. But a couple years ago, I posted about how desperately our country needs to take mental illness seriously. So here I am shaking, heart pounding, fighting tears, so afraid of the stigma yet driven by that stigma. People post on FB all the time about their diagnoses to ask for prayers, raise awareness, vent, tell their stories (or those of family members), celebrate. Cancer, Alzheimer’s, autoimmune disorders, lupus, MS, epilepsy, diabetes, major surgeries, treatments, successes, resignation, acceptance. Now it’s my turn. Toward the end of the summer, I began to suspect that something wasn’t right, so Davis and I talked with my doctor. Fast forward through many appts, a complete psych eval, and BAM I have bipolar 1 disorder. It's pretty scary to learn that you have an illness that’s life-altering, life-long, life-threatening. One that by society’s standards means you’re crazy. I became super dependent on Davis. I didn’t trust myself. I found myself clinging to him to make me feel safe. My doctor started treatment with meds, making gradual additions and dosage tweaks since then. There’ve been numerous ups and downs and I’ve ruined many things that should have been great fun with friends. But now we know why. I’m in a good place with my meds. I feel like me again. I have the best hubby and friends ever. They’ve seen me at my worst and have never judged me. Instead they protected me, loved me when I was unlovable. I know it’ll rear its ugly head again, but we’ll handle it. I don’t want pity, I don’t want anyone on eggshells around me, afraid they’re going to “set me off.” What I want is awareness and understanding as opposed to fear and labels. So I’ll take this diagnosis as part of me, I’ll educate anyone who’ll listen or read my posts, I’ll be myself because I have a purpose and I remember that now. I’ll take this bipolar thing and run with it.” [info] None [info] 1522440878

beanieweenie [info] Hey OP, you are not alone. I have been in a committed relationship for about 16 years. The first 6 years were long distance, and I cheated on my partner with 3 people during that time (a coworker, a guy who I knew was using me for sex but who I was obsessed with, and also my sister's boyfriend). I 'fessed up to my partner and he was able to forgive me. We ended up moving in together 10 years ago, and during the first two years of living with my partner I found the opportunity to cheat on him yet again with one of my old hookups. My partner is a lovely person, we are totally emotionally and sexually compatible. Basically there was no reason for me to cheat except that I craved the rush and validation of someone (anyone, lol) desiring me. Up until recently, I just thought I was a shitty person. Two months ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and found out about hypersexuality and it suddenly made me realize that my infidelity was not because I'm a terrible human being, but because I am ~~I'll~~ ill and sometimes unable to resist the urges and feelings that this disorder lays on me. I still do think that I am somewhat responsible for the choices I made back then, but now I realize all I was up against with dealing with this illness that I didn't know I had. I think maybe if I would have known about my bipolar maybe I would have made different choices. [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1563908237

ENGALND [info] I want to decrease my dose of quetiapine (seroquel). Semi success story. I'm diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and Asperger's and have been taking quetiapine for roughly 8 years, maybe ten. I am unsure of my bipolar diagnosis and a previous psychiatrist suggested it may be BPD but she left shortly after (she was a good one). Anyway that's for a different thread one day. I started off on 600mg the reduced to 450 and noticed an immediate change in my eating habits, or lack of. I was no longer waking up at X-am and eating all the chocolate or sweet snacks I could find! My weight dropped from 17 and a bit stone to 14 in nine months, though I did have a decent hour+ walk most days and at a pace to make me sweat. After several weeks I then decreased again to 300mg which I have been on for around 4 months. Now I was due an appointment with my psychiatrist and psychologist that was cancelled due to covid, and one of the things I was going to discuss was decreasing the dose further with the intention of coming off them **at some point in the future.** I have 300mg tablets and a set of accurate milligramme scales - if I were to weigh a 300mg tablet, crush it and take the equivalent of 200mg (I know most of the pill is binder) is this safe to do? I'm assuming that the spread of quetiapine in these pills are equal throughout. I'd go down from 300 to 150 but the drop before from 450 to 300 was horrible in terms of side effects. I have a dozen 10mg diazepam in case of restless nights or irritability during the day.What are people's experiences with decreasing the dose and by how much did you do it? Thanks!Small edit: I have noticed no increase in irritability, no decrease in mood or suicidal thoughts apart from the first 10 to 14 days after lowering the dose. After that I'm fine, if anything I feel better on a lower dose. More motivation, I can keep to a regular sleeping pattern (still face some difficulty) and I'm preparing meals from scratch with fresh veg instead of microwave meals. I have also been microdosing mushrooms since the beginning of January which have had a profound effect on my mental well-being. [info] None [info] 1586012664

Anyone who thinks that you are is ignorant. All people are difficult to deal with sometimes, and you shouldn’t have to feel this way purely because you have a diagnosis. People need to learn how to interact with each other better. Thought I do not know your personal struggle, I often get brushed off when showing any emotion because I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and get the occasional “you’re pretty high functioning for someone who’s bipolar”.

gaychapstick [info] A lot on my mind... Hi! This is my (21F) first time posting here.I do not have schizophrenia but I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 w/ psychosis. I’ve experienced psychosis since I was 14, and I managed for a very long time on medication. However, I came off my anti-psychotic meds (Geodon) over a year ago because the med starting causing very nasty side effects. I switched to an anti-convulsant (Lamictal) to just manage my bipolar symptoms thinking it would be fine since I had not experienced psychosis since I was 16. I was fine for a while, but started experiencing psychosis again in March of this year. I had a very bad delusional episode in April and was nearly sent to the hospital by my therapist. Since then I really haven’t been managing well. I’ve been having pretty consistent but brief episodes of psychosis since then. I have a reoccurring delusion of being trapped in an alternate reality. Sometimes in these brief episodes I believe everyone around me is conspiring to keep me trapped there. I also become convinced that every time I close my eyes, someone or something is in the room with me, watching me, but vanishes once I open my eyes. (As you can imagine this makes it very hard to sleep, or be in my house by myself) I also have minor hallucinations; brighter colors, shadows in my peripheral vision, and the particularly scary one of a person screaming into my ear: usually only one or two words, but incredibly loud like a gunshot. I’ve also been lucid dreaming a lot lately. Probably just due to the fact I’m constantly asking myself if I’m dreaming, or if what I’m experiencing is real. When I realize I’m dreaming I usually inform the others in my dream that I’m aware I’m sleeping, and that’s when it becomes terrifying. I’ll say something along the lines of, “No, this isn’t real. I’m dreaming!”. Everyone in the dream will then stare at me, go dead silent and blank faced, like you see in movies, before becoming aware with me and saying things along the lines of, “Well, congratulations! You’ve figured it out. You’re still trapped here though. How exactly do you plan of waking yourself up?”  All of that on the table; I’m worried I’m going to have a full psychotic break if I don’t get help soon. I also fear my only option for “help” is medication, and I really don’t favor that. I’ve probably been on a hundred different medications since I was 14 and I’m so sick of it, being a walking trial and error experiment.  I’m also really scared to post this now. I’ve been constantly invalidated by my family my entire life, to the point where I feel like maybe I don’t have this diagnosis after all? Am I just making all of this up? I know my psychosis doesn’t match the typical psychosis symptoms. I also know my friends and boyfriend in particular really struggle to support me. I don’t blame them, because I don’t even know how to deal with this. I guess I’m just hoping to find comfort in this community... A place for me to finally vent to people who will maybe understand what I’m going through right now. I’m sorry in advance if I’m accidentally breaking any community rules. Also, thank you in advance to anyone who even bothered to read this whole post.

I was diagnosed with bipolar before I left school (turned out that it wasn't a correct diagnosis and that it was drugs causing the mania etc) but from my own experiences of mania and deep valleys a lot of things can go wrong where you might trigger something else due to lack of sleep/food etc or thought patterns and suspicions can lead to some delusions etc. &amp;#x200B;Trust your doctor, if he/she says it's temporary then just follow the right path and you should be in the clear. Best of luck [info] None [info] 1534965276
riker89 [info] Incorrect, there are other reasons for failure. For example, I flunked out because I was near-suicidally depressed, self harming, and many days literally did not get out of bed except to eat or pee. A year or so later, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. So it wasn't that I didn't do my best, my best just wasn't enough at the time. Now that I've successfully been in treatment for a few years, I'm looking forward to going back next fall.  [info] None [info] 1443699159
JenW37 [info] Maybe I'm a rare case but I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about a year and a half ago and was only prescribed abilify.  From what I've been told it's not even a mood stabilizer but I don't seem to have fluctuating moods really so maybe that is why. [info] None [info] 1488203288
Clarice_Ferguson [info] Bipolar is a major struggle- people just assume your depressive episodes are just sadness because they mistake (hypo)manic episode for being happy again. When I was diagnosed with bipolar ll very few people believed it because it didn't fit the stereotype. I think that's why it's so hard for people to get help and it takes reaching the near end to go "maybe this isn't normal." [info] None [info] 1500235136
momscakeday [info] Hey, I read it. That is indeed a really stressful chain of events that would set anybody off who might have depressive or bipolar tendencies. So don't be too hard on yourself if you can help it.I was diagnosed with bipolar II eh maybe 5 years ago now, though I was a bit suspicious before that, and I've had serious depressive issues since puberty (which was a long time ago now, sigh). The couple ideas I would offer based on my own experience are:* Absolutely, totally, 1000%, getting sleep regulated is Step 0 of any management of bipolar. For nearly everyone with bipolar, it is critical in order to stay stable. Most of us tend to have lifelong sleep weirdness of one kind or another - me for example, I'm an extreme night owl if left completely to my own devices. And I prefer the night. But it turns out it's f#$%ing terrible for me to be nocturnal. I am absolutely thoroughly convinced that getting my sleep under control (with a regimen of daytime light exposure and evening microdose melatonin) was fundamental to my recovery, and I worked to learn my limits as far as variance, etc, so I can keep it regulated now. Because the surest way to a "mood excursion" is messed up sleep.* It would be good to find a good therapist and hopefully also a support group or something like that as well (e.g. DBSA, NAMI, or even something like a Stitch N Bitch, a faith group, sports/exercise group, etc). Meds alone really don't cut it for a lot of bipolar people, and often bipolar can be complex enough that it takes a while to find the right meds even so. It can really help to have a good therapist. My rule of thumb (can you tell I've been thru this grind MANY times yet?) is that if you don't click well by the end of the 3rd session, find somebody else. Which I know is a HUGE pain and a challenge. But it's really worth it to have a therapist you actually relate well with, vs one that's merely okay.* Finally, if at all possible, and despite it probably seeming like the last thing you want to do, it might also be good to directly ask your parents to increase their involvement on "the little things" in terms of you living at home. This may well not be appropriate for you, but I've found that living with people who are naturally chatty and will say things - without nagging! but just making a note of it - like "oh I haven't seen you at breakfast for a couple days, are you sleeping okay?" or making sure you're aware of when meals are happening and that they'd like you around, without judgement if you do need a day or two off.... this is SUPER helpful to keeping me engaged in the household, which in turn regulates my mood and keeps me moving forward better. This can feel awkward at first but to me it's so helpful. I feel like it's sort of like a cobbled together version of IPSRT, which is a therapy for bipolar (which I haven't yet tried) that focuses on keeping us stable by keeping us integrated with other people. Isolation is very very damaging for many of us, and that absolutely includes me, even though I have reclusive tendencies and often really do need to withdraw! It can be a fuzzy line. As long as you're aware and are trying to find yours, that's what matters :)Good luck, I really hope things start looking a bit better for you soon, and just a side note I'm sorry to hear about the girl. That would have crushed me as well. I find personally that I tend to come on real strong once somebody gets "in" enough that I'm willing to open up to them, and I've scared more than one good person off this way. Kinda comes with the territory sometimes. But there really, really, really are more fish in the sea, eventually one will swim your way, and hopefully it will be one who is a little more adept at handling sensitive people. Hoping for the best for you! [info] None [info] 1559256522
skittery [info] My son is almost 5 months and I still have PPD. Before pregnancy I was diagnosed with bipolar, so I was already screwed going into this. Once the baby came, I was always frustrated, like you are, when he would cry. To this day it still frustrates me when he starts crying/screaming, but I take a minute to collect myself and go to my son and care for him. I'm on medication and it still isn't perfect.Talk to a doctor. Get help. It sounds like the old anti-depressant you were on was the wrong one for your body. There is one out there for you that won't make you feel worse and drug you into a stupor. I'm on a handful of pills and I can still function throughout the day without feeling like I am in a stupor. Talk to someone. Anyone. Write things down on paper. Talk aloud to no one and get it out. Cry. Go outside and kick something. Do whatever to get the feelings out. Leaving everything pent up is not good. [info] monkey man born 6/1/12 [info] 1351546576
gold_miner_94 [info] I understand the cornered feeling. Listen, I'm a sufferer of bipolar disorder and childfree. I've struggled with just getting out and meeting people. I've struggled with keeping relationships together during manic episodes. I can promise you from someone who has been to very dark places that there is hope, and there are more women out there who don't spring this crap. This subreddit is full of them!&amp;nbsp;That one in a million feeling is in reality brain chemistry and hormones. I met the one in a million girl once. Didn't want kids, smart, chemical engineering student. The day she found out I was diagnosed with bipolar she left me on the spot. I was miserable and swore off dating for months. When I finally got back into dating all I could think about was her. You know what ended that? Seeing other people who weren't her. Didn't matter that the relationships didn't pan out, I just began to see that she wasn't a unicorn or a 1 in a million girl. She was a person with her own flaws and problems, like me. I finally met a girl who is understanding of the fact I will forever live with bipolar and that I choose to remain CF, which she is also. She's not a 1 in a million find. She's a person with flaws and problems, but I want to be with her regardless of them. You will find other people who share the childfree lifestyle, it might just take a while. I go years between relationships that pan out, and even some of those don't last long. Just keep your head up and go about this in a manner that lets you go on and be happy, because I promise a child will not make you happy in the slightest. [info] 21/M [info] 1458278987

apricotasd28 [info] &gt; He is coherent. "I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. He looked at my brain. It’s equal on three parts. I’m gonna go ahead and drop some bombs for you: 98th percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings when it was counting numbers backwards, so I’m gonna work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent. Tesla. Freud. So, he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar. I had sleep deprivation, which can cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name. So all this power that I got—and I’m taking my son to the Sox game and all that—I wouldn’t be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage."Very stable. Very much stable genius. Indeed stable.

fabioelfabuloso [info] I always knew that religion could cause some major mental disorders due to the oppression and dogma. However, it wasn't until recently that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depersonalization, and dissociation. I can have an entire day with a mental lapse of what transpired. I've emailed my therapist in panic and tears, only to not having remembered writing any of the words I used. These lapses are terrifying, and it's absolutely a way for your brain to protect itself, albeit awful. You're not alone, and it took me years to realize that these disorders could have very well been opened due to trauma of living as a regular pioneer in a strict household, to then losing faith and family. it's an incredible trauma. I highly recommend finding a good therapist, and discovering these truths for yourself. Discover why your brain does what it does, what causes it. Learning these truths has saved my life multiple times. Don't forget, each mental slip up is a learning opportunity towards mental success. [info] None [info] 1546981795
TheHonourableCurls [info] Around my freshmen year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my way of coping was being a condescending demeaning prick to everyone. My grandfather and father were the exact same so I guess that's why I adapted that behavior as appropriate. But throughout high school no one pointed it out to me, I had friends so it didn't really bother me. It wasn't until I moved out and was one my own traveling and working that people actually told me I was an asshole. They explained why and how and for a while my outlook was "Well I've made it this far, why should I change for others?" Then it got the point where I was in a relationship with my now prepossessing girlfriend that I realized it was a problem and I had to change for her. It got to the point where I would act that way towards her and I could see she felt like a piece of shit when I spoke like that towards her. It's like seeing your mother cry. No matter what, even if it's your fault, it's the most deplorable feeling ever. So I changed, I talked to my girlfriend about it, decided I should get some help to figure things out and see what needed to be done. That was about 2 years ago and we've been together for almost 3 years now and we're happier then we ever were. I've been receiving the help I needed. Now whenever I see someone I knew in school I simply apologize for how I used to be, not that it really matters or that they remember but if it were me I'd appreciate someone doing that.

zebrapig [info] I also have bipolar.    Never be afraid to ask if you can step off the floor. I have had some pretty intense episodes and all it takes is one customer to set me off. If you think your SS or SM might not allow that, I would talk to your SM in advance as a precaution. You could probably even get a doctors note if you needed to.  I can channel my manic episodes into being a badass at work, but my coworkers all joke that I'm always in a bad mood or that I hate everything because I've been more depressed lately. If you can fake it enough to handle the customers, I wouldn't give a single shit about what anyone else says. If "coaching" is anything like it is at my store, I would honestly not worry too much about it. I'm to the point now where I am confident that I can recognize what is needed from me to serve the customer and still let them have a speedy and friendly transaction and if it means me breaking away from deployment for a second, so be it. If this "coaching" is personal or just nagging, without any sbu standard to back it up, bring it up with your SM because that shit is annoying and just a result of people being power hungry.    Also, if you're not already, meds and support groups are extremely helpful and a great outlet when dealing with stress like this. If you ever need to chat, please don't be afraid to send me a message on here. I was diagnosed with bipolar close to 5 years ago, I have been at sbux for a year and a half now and I will agree that it is super challenging sometimes. Good luck out there! :) [info] None [info] 1397263338
NotTheSharpestCacti [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in December 2016. To clarify, bipolar disorder is not what you see in media where I would switch moods super quick or change from angry to crying to loving in five minutes. Not that that CAN'T happen, however rapid-cycling still doesn't look very much like the media presents it. I've been on and off medication since my diagnosis, trying to find the one that works. Currently off meds, so honestly life hasn't changed that much. I get depressed for periods of time, lay in bed, don't go to class, don't eat, have no motivation to exist. And then I get manic, and spend too much money, go out and drink a little too much, sleep 2-4 hours a night, start projects I'll never finish. Not that I'm trying to down play the severity of being diagnosed with bpd, however getting a diagnosis doesn't change who I am, it just gives me an explanation for my behavior. Edit: r/bipolar exists, in case anyone ever needs any resources or understand it a little better. [info] None [info] 1521427207
kirolm [info] I started when I was 13.I cut my arms and wore long sleeves all the time (I live in Texas, if that tells you anything about how much this stood out). It was an outlet to get some release from issues I was having that I couldn't even put into words. It not only was a cry for help I didn't quite understand, when my family found out my mother couldn't stop blaming herself, my sisters were scared and angry on the off chance I was doing it for attention (it sounds fucked up but is not uncommon and it is an understandable reaction due to the high emotions flying everywhere), and it fucked up a lot of relationships, both romantic and platonic.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15 after a 3-week "voluntary" psych ward stint (My mother called the ambulance. They told me they either took me in or foot me with the $1000ish dollar ambulance bill) and set on anti-depressants and therapy. I relapsed and went back into psych wards at ages 17 and 19 (Probably tied to my inability to provide for my newborn at the time due to all my issues). I stopped cutting around then and have been doing my best to keep up with child support, take care of myself, work and have a good life.I had two relapses at ages 23 after a really bad breakup and during a cruise last year when things came to a head resulting in my current divorce. How's that for TMI :DAnywho, I am stable and I know that cutting is a symptom, albeit one that is more easy to avoid and manage with good habits than others. Having things that get my mind off things (my guitar, writing, gaming) help put me in a better state of mind before making any big decisions.Hope that gives you a bit of insight? :D I am now 27.

BlakeBarnes00 [info] [Relationship] Girlfriend of a year and a half just left me.. So I've dated this girl for one and a half years, meet her last April and asked her out in three days. We never argue or anything until later on in the relationship as well we always did nice things together, I got her into PC gaming last year, and we started to play a lot of games together bringing the bond closer. We didn't only play games though, we did tons of other things such as go on dates, hang out a lot, and watch stuff together. Everything seemed just perfect...I was diagnosed with bipolar at 16 (yes before anybody says it's not possible, it sure is under certain cases like mine), this led to problems such as my mood couldn't be really helped much at all because when I'm down, I'm really down. She started to feel like she wasn't helpful. I kept having to reassure her that she was the best, and that this is something that she didn't have to help with. She then started understanding. (This was about 6 months into the relationship)Around 8 months into the relationship my family started struggling financially, we could barely afford to pay for food, so her family started to help take care of me. They offered me the room in their house that nobody used, they helped me with my problems, even my breaking down that would happen. I was just all around accepted. While this happened, I was struggling in school academically because I was placed in all honors and AP classes, which when you're constantly flowed with that work and having problems you have to deal with about yourself and family, it's rough...  To pile it all up on top of that, these guys started flirting with her. I never knew about it, she said she didn't want to worry me so she didn't tell me, which of course made it worse. So I started getting really worried and down all the time thinking about it. I was stupid and thought about my own discomforts sometimes and asked her to stop talking to some of them, I thought it was only fair because she did would do it to me. (Keep in mind I'm not sociable so I barely had friends myself)Jealousy really started bringing the relationship down around this time. Seemed to me when she got defensive about these guys that's what she wanted. She would always tell me she was jealous of a girl and my solution was to start pushing them away if she felt that way about them. Which helped her. This led to her having control over everything like that. (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, Steam.. Ect. Where constantly checked to make sure nothing was going on with me, completely limiting me) After I confronted her about this, she understood. We talked and agreed that we would both drop certain people for one another to fix it all. This made us happy for the next two months. My parents were getting new jobs.. In Florida. This tore my girlfriend and even family apart. I ended up attempting suicide, regret it now. There was a battle going on between my family and myself, some taking my side and others not. I wanted to stay and finish high school and go to college in SC, so my girlfriends family offered to take me in. Parents shut it down, so my grandpa then tried. They shut that down, they stopped letting me talk to him for a while. My parents didn't let me go to school for about a week so I couldn't attempt running away or anything or try getting help from the school. This sucked. We were then long distance. The first couple months started rough, but we did it really well. We called each other during school and slept on Skype at night. We watched Netflix together and just played games. We had a blast. I made plans with my new school.to graduate early and move back there next year in January, where I would also be considered an adult so I couldn't be held back from doing it. I didn't tell her about this plan until about a month ago. The papers and stuff are all ready and it's confirmed so now I'm kind of stuck with it. The last month (leading up to last night), I started to get told from her friends that they think there is another guy. I started realizing that she has grown more distance and started hanging up when I heard a guy/s talking to her at school. If I would confront her about said guy/s, she would start getting mad and ignore me for the rest of the day. Her friends would try helping but this only made it worse. She had made it where I was dependent on her, so she knew if she ignored me things would go wrong on my side. She knew I didn't have friends, because I got along better with girls than guys. She knew my parents wouldn't help. And her friends would start to get overwhelmed by me breaking down, they realized what she was doing to me, they realized how unfair it was. They confronted her about it and she blew up. My girlfriend and her girlfriend (we had a somewhat open relationship for her side anyways, she could see other girls) were talking last night. I was having a breakdown, her girlfriend was trying to help me but my girlfriend wouldn't help. She was just watching it. Her girlfriend then got tired of me breaking down and blocked me. They started ignoring me both leaving me alone breaking down. They went and talked all night as this happened... I got a messaged saying that we were done this morning. They are now together as probably even her and one of said guys. I don't know what to do... I'm sorry for the long read, but I needed to get it out somewhere..Re: Thank you all, I have started doing what you guys have suggested and it has helped so far today. [info] 16 [info] 1465053382

stopmillion [info] Hello ! When I was 17 I was so depressed and suicidal I knew I had to get help but I did not want to tell my parents myself. I gathered up the courage to go to a guidance counselor at my high school.... I'm not going to lie it was hard to do. I felt like I was choking. Keep in mind if you do this they're required by law to call ur parents... And if you say ur suicidal they might send you to the hospital... Be careful what you tell them. If you do this I would say "I'm extremely depressed can you please call my parents and tell them I need professional help". That's basically what I did. It was awkward af with my parents after for a while but to be frank I needed them to pay for the help I desperately needed. I was diagnosed with bipolar maybe 2 years later. Good luck... I would really recommend just gathering up the courage and telling someone. If you don't things could get worse. Good luck and I really do know how hard it is  [info] None [info] 1515639536
BarleyBreakfast [info] Effexor withdrawal, Lamotrigine titration, combatting the brain fog? Good Morning All,I was diagnosed with bipolar II a few days ago. Immediately was told to start weaning off of effexor and start titrating on to lamotrigine. I run a small business, and have eight people I directly manage and direct throughout the day, while handling any customer problems and purchasing, receivables etc. etc. I have to be on the ball at work. I'm currently transitioning into management, and I need to be sharp. I've always been sharp, or at least have come across as sharp anyway. I'm on day 2 in a row with no effexor, and don't have any brainzaps or anything (I was only on 75mg, down to 37.5 a week ago), however I'm finding myself exhausted and completely spaced out. I keep forgetting what I'm doing while I'm doing it. I can't be having this right now. I wouldn't care if it weren't for my job, but my job is really important to me and one of the very few things I haven't destroyed in the last 9 months. My boss doesn't even know about my last two stays in hospital. He left the company in my hands while he's on vacation.Does anyone have any good tips on battling this? I'm going to wean the effexor more slowly to start, but anything else? Apparently vitamins and all that. I've been taking vitamins and trying to get at least 8 hours of sleep right now and plenty of water. Is there medication that can help? My understanding is that during early bipolar treatment, stimulants are not a good idea as they can trigger hypomania or mania, so I'm trying to see if there are any other options.Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!

Torreau [info] All forms of hormonal birth control destroyed my drive and eventually over the course of about 7-8 years it just made me off-my-rocker crazy; we're talking white hot rage over stupid things, like that he didn't notice the floor needed to be swept or that he went out for a drink with friends after work.I know that this is somewhat common, however in my case it wound up being a sign of something more, and the fact that you mention mood issues sets off alarm bells for me. When I went off the hormones I felt better for quite a while but then my moods started to go nuts again and I realized that the birth control just amplified what I would have gone through anyway. For what it's worth, I was also super horny when not on it.I no longer take hormones because of what they did to my moods, and just over a year ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.I am not at all saying you're bipolar, just saying I'm seeing some similarities in your story.

SagiTsukiko [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teen despite not having manic episodes of any sort. I was abused and traumatized, and surprise, i acted like i was abused and traumatized. I learned how to control myself through dialectical behavioral therapy and processing what's happened to me on my own using the skills i learned there. I basically learned coping skills and social skills I was not previously taught because I wasn't socialized well as a child and did not have any healthy models for emotions. Explicit discussion of psychiatric diagnoses was banned in the group i attended.  As an aside, I really hate how literal children will be diagnosed with a "chemical imbalance" and get doped up with neuroleptics and lithium when they're actually being abused at home.

Let's get Into a little back story of mine that I am willing to share.3 years ago, I was a happy, carefree 13 year old who would spend his time playing  pokemon GO. But when I  went into grade 8, I became a victim of bullying ( I really can't remember why)  then I became depressed and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I would spend my time feeling sad for myself and constantly feel dead on the inside. Ms Sarah who didn't even teach me knew as she would take my class for chapel sessions but she  observed me during periods. She always noticed that I would sit away from the rest of my friends and either sleep or read a book.One such day, I think I was bullied again but this time I had a melt down during her period. She started to talk to me, counsel me and gave me space to reflect on how I felt as well as loads of advice.  Everyday since then for about a year she greeted me in the morning and ask me how I was doing every single day. ( she was one the most caring teachers I met). After that I moved on to a different class made loads of friends and I completely started to ignore her in the morning ( I was 15, I thought I was old enough to manage things on my own) and whenever she said hi or asked me a question I acted like she was non-existant to me. She still waved at me and was kind to me though I displayed such crude mannerisms. (After that I understood that I needed her as she guided me and cared about me) Fastfoward to last week I managed to talk to Ms sarah and apologise for my crude mannerisms as well as to thank her for being so patient and kind to me. ( I still do feel guilty that I wanted her out of my life as I thought that she was a nosy Parker)tl;dr I am thanking my caring teacher for guiding me through my ups and downs and being extremely patient when I was being very apathetic towards her care and concern to me. ( really made me feel so much better) First post from a relatively new redditor, thank you. [info] None [info] 1568202560
CaseyAPayne [info] I want to start with **culture shock is real**. Everyone reacts to it differently.Then I want to say **be kind to yourself**. I'm not suggesting this, and I will add thoughts on how to counter this shortly but... embrace the fact that maybe you won't be able to "get your shit together" while alone in a foreign country. If you don't get the PROTIPs you need from this thread, or you do and drop the ball on applying them. That's OK. Be kind to yourself.Alright... here's my PROist of PROTIPs.First, **get an accountability partner**. Someone that you're going to check in with EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. The check-in might be super simple. Maybe you just send a "y" letting them know you did "the thing" that day. If you send an "n" you need to explain to them why it was an "n". I think a good friend or family member works best, but maybe you have a digital friend that could work.Second, **write down exactly what you'll be checking in about**. I know you have dreams of doing 8-10 hours of work a day and attending all of your classes, but start with the smallest, IMPOSSIBLE TO FAIL, thing and build up from there. **Maybe all you'll be checking in about each day is doing one Pomodoro cycle**. If you do that, you're a winner. If you do more... AWESOME! But... don't worry about doing more. Worry about doing one.Third, **build on your daily success**. One Pomodoro might become eight. Perhaps along with it you also do 30 minutes of walking a day and meditate. Once you build up this daily muscle it gets easier to add more to it and you'll also become aware of what is, and is not, feasible to do.**BACKSTORY**I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 20 years ago. I've had to dig myself out of depressed states more than a few times. The last time I had to do it was the worse because I had grown accustomed to "waiting until I felt better" and then... slowly getting back into the swing of things. This time a year had gone by and I was still playing video games 10-14 hours a day (Destiny when it first came out), not showering, living at grandma's house, etc. and... just felt empty/hopeless. I'm actually one of those super upbeat dudes all about goals (when not like that) and... goals just weren't working. There were three times that year I wrote out goals I wanted to do and I totally failed at doing them. They were super weak too (brush my teeth, shower, make the bed, etc.)What finally got me out of that loop was choosing a single goal that I didn't think I could fail at (which I had  already earlier that year) and called my brother and said "I'm going to send you a text message every day before 10:30 pm letting you know if I made the bed or not." After I knew someone was "watching" me and I knew there was no reason to fail I immediately changed. There were a few times I squeezed in making the bed at 10:25 pm, but I never missed a day. It took about 50+ days for it to become automatic, but I built on to that (brushing teeth, showering, etc.) until it got up to exercising, writing, meditating, bed early, etc.Anyhow, I know you want/need to "GO BIG" right away. Even though that's the case, ramp up to it a bit. Start with one Pomodoro and if you win, or do more, ramp it up the next day. Check-in with your accountability partner and when you fail, explain why. The explanation isn't for shaming or anything. It's to learn and adjust for the next day.Kudos for trying to figure this out! The human brain is a complex organism and human life is unnecessarily complex... :P Good luck! [info] None [info] 1562241369
tv_peddler [info] questions about LOA So, about 10 days ago, I attempted to end my life with pills and beer, obviously I failed. I went in the next day and talked to my manager about a LOA, went to the ER, and was admitted an inpatient facility where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on many meds, after a 6 day stay. I dont feel like I am ready to go back to work, but I have no idea when the doctor put my return date as and I'm confused as to what to do next. [info] None [info] 1469078203
captaincannibal [info] I overdosed on Moxy and now THC triggers psychosis This probably won’t be a well-liked post here but I still feel that this is worth discussing. I promise you that nothing in this post is fabricated or even exaggerated in any way. This is exactly what happens.So I actually made a post about this a little while back. Since then, I finally figured out two important things - this happens only when weed is involved. Also.. that it's *psychosis*.- [Moxy - Trip Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/3mc96f/moxy_trip_report/)- [Trip Report - 6-APB / 4-AcO-DMT / 5-MeO-MiPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/5h8rwf/trip_report_6apb_4acodmt_5meomipt/) - From what I've been told I *did* smoke during this but apparently forgot? I'd also like to say that this combo was incredibly stupid and I take full responsibility for that. You can easily see the psychosis in there though. - [I overdosed on Moxy and potentially broke my brain](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/6vsuvn/i_overdosed_on_moxy_once_and_potentially_broke_my/)The first post kind of summarizes the first time I had this happen (and has a link to the trip report), but just a quick recap - a while back, I took some Moxy and had a great time. I decided to smoke some on top of a bowl eventually. Turns out my scale was fucked and I actually ended up smoking a shitload. I’m still not sure how much, but I know I had something like 250mg total in my bag and it was almost completely gone when I became lucid again. I should’ve recognized it sooner but my brain during psychosis sort of *refuses* to see the real pattern. My most recent experience was 3-MeO-PCP and weed and the entire time, I was absolutely certain that this was all caused by 3-MeO-PCP. Even though I only tried it less than a year ago. If I tried to think of something else that could cause it, I entered an intense thought loop where I could only see myself insufflating some of it and I could only hear the name repeated over and over in my head. This happens with any amount of THC - it happens with bud, wax, and even edibles. _______________________I’ll summarize what I experience when this happens:- Intense “seizures”. I begin to repeatedly clack my teeth together very hard. It’s like I’m shivering. My body will also seize up for a few seconds at a time where everything becomes stiff and I can’t move. - My brain literally starts to think in a way that is foreign to me. It’s incredibly difficult to describe. - An overwhelming feeling of dread and doom, like someone is standing behind me with a gun and I know I'm fucked.- I begin to recognize patterns that do not exist. Everything seems like a big puzzle and suddenly I’m seeing how the pieces fit together. - I become convinced that what is happening to me has never happened to another human being and that I need to be studied. I’m the key to understanding the universe. - I also become convinced that someone or something does not like that I’m finding the answers to all of life’s mysteries. This is because of [“thought blocking”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_blocking). If I have some realization that I think is important, my thoughts will start to be ripped from my mind. The way I interpret it is that something is doing it on purpose to keep me away from whatever that revelation was. - I get beyond confused. While everything makes sense to me, I can’t actually interpret anything surrounding me. It all seems foreign. The floor itself confuses the shit out of me. - I get insane vertigo - wherever I’m laying starts to spin rapidly and I feel like I’m going to puke. - If I’m lying down, the room tilts (visually). This combined with the vertigo makes me think I’m starting to fall. - Every fiber of my being experiences extremely uncomfortable euphoria. - Weird ass dissociative-type visuals. My vision becomes filled with gears and machine-like objects. At some point I’ll full-on have external hallucinations that change where I’m at, what’s around me, etc. I start to see that I’m outside, at a completely different time, seeing people that don’t exist and things that I’ve never seen. Except I believe I have seen them before. - Eventually I stop noticing my body. I feel completely disembodied, like I’m just a consciousness. - I become convinced that, because of how my brain is acting, there is some cosmic conspiracy concerning me. - My thoughts become very disorganized. I cannot stay on a subject for more than a few seconds before I jump to something else and lose the thought. - My speech makes zero sense. I’ll either change subjects mid-sentence and not realize if, or I’ll forget what I was saying. A good example is, “yeah so then I went to the car and and I went to the car and I went to uh.. and.. uh.. wait was I just talking? what's going on?"- I rapidly move through images in my head of areas I don’t recognize - except I do. My brain tells me that I’m having crazy deja vu and these are all places I recognize. I also start to believe that these are things other people are seeing that are being beamed to my brain..- Just in general I get crazy deja vu. I believe that what is happening to me is identical to the last time it happened - where I’m at, who I’m with, what I did that day. I think hard and begin to say “I should’ve recognized this. This day happened before. I remember it all”. That day never happened before. But my mind is placing importance on every event leading up to that moment. - I start to hear multiple voices but they’re all my own. It’s like I have multiple internal voices, all having different thoughts at the same time. - I honestly think that the only way out of it is to kill myself. It’s like someone else is putting that thought in to my brain. It isn’t my own thought. There’s a lot more to this but it’s almost indescribable. My idea of psychosis never was like this because this thought pattern makes NO sense to me once I’m sober. Again, it’s downright foreign. The main takeaways are that my thoughts become incredibly disorganized and very dark, and my brain starts to place importance on every single thing that it brings up - notice I say that *it* brings up. Not me. Because it feels like I have zero control over my own thoughts._________________________________To really freak you out, I’ll share some pieces of the notes I tried to take the last time this happened. To me, they made perfect sense and were easy to understand. Until I sobered up. Usually once I’m sober I get embarrassed and delete the notes. You’ll see that when I’m in psychosis, I actively believe that something is tricking me in to deleting them so that I don’t share them with anyone. So yeah, this is really embarrassing but here you go:“*avoid november 29th and do not work on the sunday after thanksgiving. this is the day that this happens every time. dont watch eric andre either you get in to that and then this happens i always come back to this day it is a time loop that will n stop ever i will always have this happen again**this is fucked. you had enough to know. so they forced you in to deleting**I remember every other time this happens I think “it will happen again. and again. always.” and each time i have my own memories but when i go there it gets comformed without breaking**god dammit i was so closei was so closedo not let it back in and he’s forced to go back to try and repair it. this is critical for this to work at all. you need to avoid this scenario like the plague. it is destroying you.**this is not losing time as in your memory doesn’t work, this ismissing time as in my brain loses its understanding of time and because i can’t process it and move forward through the day everything suddenly falls apart.**my thoughts are spilling out in to the UNIVERSAL CONCUOUSNESS. there are shadows moving around me they are coming they are coming theyarexo coming coming they coming oh no oh no o no”*Yep. There’s honestly more to it but it’s a lot of personal info and it gets even more embarrassing than that, believe it or not. As you can see, my brain really is placing importance on insignificant days and events that occurred recently - here, I was convinced that because this day was some sort of "time loop" that I kept coming back to, the events leading up to it (me working on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the actual date itself, and WATCHING THE FUCKING ERIC ANDRE SHOW) were all things that I need to recognize in the future to avoid getting pulled back in to the time loop. I fully believed that I had experienced all of that lead-up before (because of intense deja vu). I also get stuck in thought loops and continually lose track of what I was thinking about.__________________________________So someone is going to ask why I even smoke then - it’s weird. I actually feel drawn to it, even though what happens is absolutely horrifying and eventually I’m probably not going to come back from it.. I finally decided to just give up because I’m going to regret it soon. It really blows because I grew up just smoking a metric fuckton of weed.Now that I finally found that it’s psychosis, I can get out of it by taking seroquel - not because it stops it, but because it knocks me the fuck out for a while. If anyone’s wondering why I have seroquel, it’s because a few months after the Moxy overdose I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I don’t think the Moxy caused it, but it probably brought it out a lot more. I always had issues with my mood going up and down but after that it started to get a lot more noticeable and was causing some serious issues in my life. I'm no longer prescribed seroquel but I still have a shitload of it. There are some other interesting reports about this happening to others. [Here](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience:17mg_3-MeO-PCP_%26_Cannabis_oil_-_Terrifying_confusion) is a trip report that describes it all very well. And [here](https://news.vice.com/article/this-is-how-one-pot-smoker-learned-that-weed-plays-a-mysterious-role-in-psychosis) is an article about it happening to someone - my experience is basically identical to his in every way. I want to type a lot more but this post is huge and I’m on mobile and at work. If you guys find this interesting, google “cannabis psychosis” or something. You’ll find articles and studies on the subject. If anyone else has experience with this, please let me know. I’d love to hear more. **tl;dr** - REEFER MADNESS___________________________**EDIT** - Almost forgot an interesting tidbit. So far I've experienced three distinct "types" of psychosis. I've experienced each one multiple times.- **Fun psychosis** - It isn't actually that fun but I'm *extremely* manic during this. My thoughts are not dark unless I start to enter a thought loop. Still, my brain does not work the way it should. I don’t get paranoia but I do get pronoia at times, believing that the universe is trying to help me. Also worth noting that I am not spiritual and I am very opposed to organized religion. So I seem to believe in some sort of divine plan during this, though I don’t necessarily believe it to be the work of any sort of god. Usually I believe it’s the universe itself or some beings from another reality.- **Cosmic psychosis** - This one is the one I experience the most and the one that prompted me to finally write the original post. This ones involves me believing that I am the mouthpiece for the universe and that I've discovered all of it's secrets. I become extremely dissociated during this. There is a lot of paranoia and pronoia involved here. I also jump to the conclusion that what I'm discovering is dangerous and some entity is trying to keep me from figuring out what's happening. - **Suicidal psychosis** - This scares me the most. I've gone through it twice and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy (if I even had one). This almost feels like the opposite of "cosmic psychosis" - I am very aware of my body and that I am alive and that I am a human being. Unfortunately, my mind gets stuck in thought loops that are trying to convince me to commit suicide. They mainly do this by convincing me that life is just fuckin' stupid. I don't get depressed or focus on bad things that happen to me. Most recently I remember I couldn't stop thinking about how "lame" life was.. I pictured myself with my wife, sitting at home, playing a game, listening to music - it all seemed fucking stupid and pointless and uninteresting. I couldn't bring myself to feel any sort of joy. I was convinced that I had to off myself because there was no coming back from this realization. As soon as I became lucid again I was back to normal and it had zero impact on me. For some reason my vision gets FUCKED with this. I start to sink in to whatever I'm laying or sitting on and I get intense sliding visuals - the entire room just slips in to itself as if I'm looking at a bunch of tectonic plates doing their thing.

peacefulcate815 [info] I can relate to some of this, as I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder II almost a year ago. Keep on your meds, even when you don’t want to. Recreational weed helps me a lot, so as long as you’re not developing a mental dependency, you’re fine with that. I’m so sorry that all of that is happening, I can imagine how hard that must be.

Ellie_A_K [info] Diagnosis Hi, can anyone describe how they found out or were diagnosed with BPD? I have been diagnosed with bipolar but I definitely feel that BPD describes me so I don’t know if I’m wrong or if I’m misdiagnosed [info] None [info] 1569601017
INSERT_USERNAME___ [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, too. My rationale for being open about my condition is to show others who may have negative views of people living with mental illness or are afraid to seek help that one can live a relatively normal life with serious mental illness. I wouldn't tell a stranger unprompted, but if I was talking to an acquaintance and the conversation was related to my mental health or my perspective on treatment, I wouldn't have a problem letting them know.

redheadgurl1987 [info] Need help with confidence situation Here’s how my story started. At 18 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, at 19 I was put on disability for it. For 12 years I was incredibly sick. Now in my 30’s I’m coming out of it. I volunteer , I run a meetup and am going through a weight loss transformation. However the ‘ not having a job’ makes me feel less than other people. I’m an honest person who doesn’t like to lie so I end up telling the truth. Because of low confidence with this I’m doing poorly romantically. Being a currently obese woman doesn’t help much either. But my weight I can change. My fiscal situation I’ve accepted. What are anyone’s thoughts of my situation? [info] None [info] 1542938533
Menelly [info] And, once in a while it's both lifestyle choice *and* biology/medical condition type stuff.  ;)Once upon a time, I was 5'9 (OK, still am that) and 150 lbs or so (nowhere near that now...)  Then, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, went psychotic manic several times, and ended up on the med go round of a billion different psych meds, all of which tend to add pounds to the frame.  (Heard of Zyprexa?  The "joke" on that med is you'll gain 10 lbs filling the prescription.)  Now, I'm much larger than I used to be, and no, I don't eat as healthy as I should.  But that weight isn't shifting as long as I'm on a battery of psych meds, and I value sanity more than vanity.So yes, I may tuck into my Whopper (no mayo!) and apple fries (I'm not fond of the regular ones anyways) and someone is probably judging me cause I'm not tiny, and I don't care.  It's my life, and I'm more comfortable being me than I've been before.  :) [info] None [info] 1346727564
Q1e3t5r4w2 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 before BPD and I went through all the same things. None of the medications ever worked for me except benzos when I was having a really bad episode/panic attack. Sleeping pills never even put me to sleep just gave me headaches and made my mouth taste horrible. You could try buying him a DBT workbook and read it with him if you want to try to save money. Most therapists will just work through the DBT workbook with him. But there are other therapists who try different kinds of therapy specifically for past abuse and PTSD type disorders. I've had others try things like hypnotherapy and crystal healing... which never did anything lol. It might be more helpful for him to work through these things with a licensed therapist though because I know how hard it is to read a book while dealing with mental problems. I've been doing it on my own because I dont have health insurance and I've still been making a lot of progress. But sometimes it's easier to have a professional explain things to you. My last therapist just took pages of the DBT workbook and scanned them for me to take home though and I was paying her a lot of money so I guess I'm just jaded when it comes to therapy. Thank you for being there for him and trying to help him through this. Hes very lucky to have someone like you in his life who cares so much. :) [info] None [info] 1540637960
